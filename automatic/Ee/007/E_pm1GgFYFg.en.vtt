00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
this the only thing is I think I kind of

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.030 
this the only thing is I think I kind of
broke<00:02:04.810> some<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.110> plastic<00:02:05.530> off<00:02:05.710> some<00:02:05.950> of

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
broke some of the plastic off some of

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.650 
broke some of the plastic off some of
them<00:02:06.130> so<00:02:06.610> I<00:02:06.640> may<00:02:06.880> have<00:02:06.910> to<00:02:07.060> go<00:02:07.210> pick<00:02:07.330> up<00:02:07.450> more

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
them so I may have to go pick up more

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.930 
them so I may have to go pick up more
regardless<00:02:08.350> all<00:02:08.770> right<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.040> basically<00:02:09.160> three

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
regardless all right so basically three

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.520 
regardless all right so basically three
of<00:02:10.090> them<00:02:10.270> have<00:02:11.130> no<00:02:12.150> back<00:02:13.150> because<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.989> plastic

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
of them have no back because the plastic

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.229 
of them have no back because the plastic
actually<00:02:14.980> broke<00:02:15.280> off<00:02:15.520> as<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.850> can<00:02:15.970> see<00:02:16.120> like

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
to looks like I said in one of my

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.530 
to looks like I said in one of my
previous<00:02:25.780> videos<00:02:26.310> super<00:02:27.310> cheap<00:02:27.519> awesome<00:02:28.450> way

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
previous videos super cheap awesome way

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.509 
previous videos super cheap awesome way
to<00:02:28.600> do<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:28.959> the<00:02:29.530> only<00:02:29.739> one<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:29.890> messed<00:02:30.160> up<00:02:30.340> on

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
to do it the only one I messed up on

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.190 
to do it the only one I messed up on
that<00:02:30.700> fuel<00:02:30.940> paint<00:02:31.180> was<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.600> first<00:02:31.780> one<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.959> did

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
that fuel paint was the first one I did

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.560 
that fuel paint was the first one I did
so<00:02:32.500> I<00:02:32.709> got<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.459> hang<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:33.790> pretty<00:02:33.970> quick<00:02:34.330> and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
so I got the hang of it pretty quick and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.509 
so I got the hang of it pretty quick and
the<00:02:35.230> rest<00:02:35.470> five<00:02:35.739> out<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.950> six<00:02:36.130> came<00:02:36.370> out

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
the rest five out of six came out

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.000 
the rest five out of six came out
perfect<00:02:37.060> so<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.480> don't<00:02:38.140> know<00:02:38.200> if<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.620> don't

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
perfect so I don't know if you don't

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
perfect so I don't know if you don't
want<00:02:39.670> to<00:02:39.940> chance<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.420> don't<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.049> but

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
want to chance it don't do it but

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.720 
want to chance it don't do it but
they're<00:02:41.560> really<00:02:41.590> not<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.190> hard<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.459> do<00:02:42.610> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
they're really not that hard to do you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.880 
they're really not that hard to do you
just<00:02:42.910> got<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.090> pull<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.390> tab<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.019> slowly

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
just got to pull on that tab and slowly

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.800 
just got to pull on that tab and slowly
but<00:02:45.250> surely<00:02:45.280> it'll<00:02:45.730> pop<00:02:45.940> right<00:02:45.970> off<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.660> no

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
but surely it'll pop right off and no

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.720 
but surely it'll pop right off and no
paint<00:02:47.049> came<00:02:47.260> off<00:02:47.290> but<00:02:48.220> now<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.340> do<00:02:48.489> have<00:02:48.670> to

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
paint came off but now I do have to

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.490 
paint came off but now I do have to
spackle<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.239> paint<00:02:49.330> that<00:02:49.600> little<00:02:50.170> section<00:02:50.350> of

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
spackle and paint that little section of

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.009 
spackle and paint that little section of
the<00:02:50.590> wall<00:02:50.739> which<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:50.950> gonna<00:02:51.220> be<00:02:51.370> annoying<00:02:52.019> but

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
the wall which is gonna be annoying but

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.150 
the wall which is gonna be annoying but
yeah<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.170> you<00:02:53.200> don't<00:02:53.410> own<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.860> place<00:02:54.010> you're

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
yeah if you don't own the place you're

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.860 
yeah if you don't own the place you're
living<00:02:54.250> maybe<00:02:54.640> it's<00:02:54.940> not<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> best<00:02:55.360> idea<00:02:55.510> but

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
living maybe it's not the best idea but

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.140 
living maybe it's not the best idea but
trust<00:02:56.440> me<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:57.040> really<00:02:57.250> was<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.489> lot<00:02:57.730> easier<00:02:57.790> than

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
trust me it really was a lot easier than

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.360 
trust me it really was a lot easier than
than<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.989> seems<00:02:59.260> I<00:02:59.530> thought<00:02:59.950> was<00:03:00.040> gonna<00:03:00.160> be<00:03:00.310> an

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
than it seems I thought was gonna be an

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.940 
than it seems I thought was gonna be an
issue<00:03:00.489> but<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.970> was<00:03:01.060> fine<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.780> can<00:03:02.440> just<00:03:02.709> use

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
issue but it was fine so I can just use

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.680 
issue but it was fine so I can just use
a<00:03:02.980> brain<00:03:03.250> wave<00:03:03.400> stand<00:03:03.730> or<00:03:03.940> hook<00:03:04.150> it<00:03:04.269> on<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.480> eat

thing I need to do is definitely get a
longer<00:05:04.789> strip<00:05:05.789> because<00:05:06.599> that's<00:05:07.110> really<00:05:07.620> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
longer strip because that's really the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.650 
longer strip because that's really the
only<00:05:07.770> wire<00:05:08.190> that's<00:05:08.520> annoying<00:05:09.030> me<00:05:09.330> because

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
once I get a longer one I could actually

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.700 
once I get a longer one I could actually
manage<00:05:11.940> it<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.539> this<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.020> only<00:05:13.110> used<00:05:13.500> to

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
manage it and this is only used to

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.650 
manage it and this is only used to
connect<00:05:14.070> to<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.550> outlet<00:05:14.789> over<00:05:14.970> there<00:05:15.150> the

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
connect to the outlet over there the

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.570 
connect to the outlet over there the
power<00:05:15.900> strip<00:05:16.139> that<00:05:16.620> I<00:05:16.860> have<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.010> power<00:05:17.400> strip

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
power strip that I have a power strip

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.670 
power strip that I have a power strip
mounted<00:05:17.880> to<00:05:17.940> my<00:05:18.000> desk<00:05:18.300> over<00:05:18.599> here<00:05:18.840> so<00:05:19.380> it's

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
mounted to my desk over here so it's

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.250 
mounted to my desk over here so it's
really<00:05:19.919> like<00:05:20.280> it's<00:05:20.940> kind<00:05:21.270> of<00:05:21.360> unnecessary<00:05:21.660> but
