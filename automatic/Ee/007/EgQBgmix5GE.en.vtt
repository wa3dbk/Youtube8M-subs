invested on this and we went on this

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.440 
invested on this and we went on this
training<00:03:05.280> program<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:07.200> was<00:03:07.440> all<00:03:07.650> like

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
training program it was all like

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.470 
training program it was all like
flashcards<00:03:09.450> and<00:03:10.549> papers<00:03:11.549> printouts<00:03:12.150> and

flashcards and papers printouts and
every<00:03:12.900> 15<00:03:13.290> days<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.859> wife<00:03:14.040> had<00:03:14.280> to

every 15 days the wife had to
communicate<00:03:14.959> with<00:03:16.280> mrs.<00:03:17.280> Realty<00:03:17.700> Shankaran

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
communicate with mrs. Realty Shankaran

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.210 
communicate with mrs. Realty Shankaran
and<00:03:19.430> we<00:03:20.430> started<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.150> program<00:03:21.890> of<00:03:22.890> course

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
and we started the program of course

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.810 
and we started the program of course
when<00:03:23.640> we<00:03:23.850> started<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.420> without<00:03:25.200> any<00:03:25.560> I<00:03:25.980> started

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
when we started it without any I started

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.270 
when we started it without any I started
this<00:03:26.970> without<00:03:27.329> any<00:03:27.570> much<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.959> expectations<00:03:28.739> it

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
this without any much of expectations it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.970 
this without any much of expectations it
was<00:03:29.489> just<00:03:29.700> like<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.910> trial<00:03:30.269> basis<00:03:30.750> which<00:03:31.500> was<00:03:31.709> of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
was just like a trial basis which was of

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.860 
was just like a trial basis which was of
no<00:03:32.310> failures<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.239> knew<00:03:33.450> for<00:03:33.690> sure<00:03:33.720> and<00:03:35.660> acid<00:03:36.660> man

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
no failures I knew for sure and acid man

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.650 
no failures I knew for sure and acid man
slowly<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:38.130> course<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.549> had<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.760> carry<00:03:39.239> them<00:03:39.480> on

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
slowly of course I had to carry them on

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.199 
slowly of course I had to carry them on
board<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.140> ship<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:41.190> even<00:03:41.459> from<00:03:41.609> ship<00:03:41.910> we<00:03:42.030> used

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
board the ship so even from ship we used

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.150 
board the ship so even from ship we used
to<00:03:42.359> emailer<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.170> be<00:03:43.290> used<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.650> communicate

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
to emailer and be used to communicate

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.270 
to emailer and be used to communicate
with<00:03:44.190> her<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.549> we<00:03:44.880> used<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.120> see<00:03:45.390> her<00:03:45.480> progress

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
with her and we used to see her progress

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.860 
with her and we used to see her progress
after<00:03:47.280> about<00:03:47.459> six<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:48.000> seven<00:03:48.359> months<00:03:48.540> she

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
after about six to seven months she

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990 
after about six to seven months she
found<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.380> lot<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.650> changes<00:03:50.220> improvements<00:03:50.910> in

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
found a lot of changes improvements in

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.420 
found a lot of changes improvements in
her<00:03:51.150> she<00:03:51.870> started<00:03:52.260> picking<00:03:52.620> up<00:03:52.680> words<00:03:53.010> she

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
her she started picking up words she

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.250 
her she started picking up words she
started<00:03:53.819> picking<00:03:53.940> up<00:03:54.150> cards<00:03:54.660> he<00:03:54.870> started

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
started picking up cards he started

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.390 
started picking up cards he started
recognizing<00:03:55.560> all<00:03:56.069> flags<00:03:56.459> of<00:03:56.819> all<00:03:56.970> countries

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
recognizing all flags of all countries

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.250 
recognizing all flags of all countries
she<00:03:59.400> started<00:03:59.730> recognizing<00:04:00.060> proofs<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.900> was

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
she started recognizing proofs that was

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.400 
she started recognizing proofs that was
when<00:04:01.560> she<00:04:01.590> was<00:04:01.829> about<00:04:02.100> one

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
when she was about one

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.430 
when she was about one
two<00:04:02.770> years<00:04:03.040> old<00:04:03.360> so<00:04:04.360> that<00:04:05.230> made<00:04:05.560> us<00:04:05.770> much<00:04:06.040> more

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
two years old so that made us much more

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.760 
two years old so that made us much more
interesting<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:08.670> things<00:04:09.670> went<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.150> and

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
interesting and things went on and

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.259 
interesting and things went on and
slowly<00:04:11.770> today<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.610> find<00:04:13.360> them<00:04:13.600> to<00:04:14.170> be<00:04:14.200> quite

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
slowly today I find them to be quite

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.800 
slowly today I find them to be quite
quite<00:04:16.560> far<00:04:17.560> more<00:04:18.070> than<00:04:18.430> what<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:18.850> normal<00:04:19.299> child

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
quite far more than what a normal child

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.460 
quite far more than what a normal child
of<00:04:20.049> her<00:04:20.200> age<00:04:20.230> of<00:04:20.709> about<00:04:21.250> four<00:04:21.580> would<00:04:21.790> be<00:04:21.970> and

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
of her age of about four would be and

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.130 
of her age of about four would be and
same<00:04:23.470> was<00:04:23.740> the<00:04:23.770> report<00:04:24.340> from<00:04:24.900> little<00:04:25.900> gems

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
same was the report from little gems

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.530 
same was the report from little gems

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
be a product of little jumps I should

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.690 
be a product of little jumps I should
say<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:37.030> would<00:04:37.390> advise<00:04:37.780> all<00:04:38.260> parents<00:04:38.950> who

who have got the same impression as me

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.750 
who have got the same impression as me
of<00:04:42.700> their<00:04:43.510> child<00:04:43.870> should<00:04:44.140> become<00:04:44.320> a<00:04:44.500> great<00:04:45.370> one

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
of their child should become a great one

one of the best should surely join such
a<00:04:49.270> program<00:04:49.810> should<00:04:50.050> surely<00:04:50.230> join<00:04:50.860> such<00:04:51.220> a

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
a program should surely join such a

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.450 
a program should surely join such a
program<00:04:51.820> and<00:04:52.350> take<00:04:53.350> more<00:04:53.680> interest<00:04:53.890> towards

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
program and take more interest towards

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
such program which will have a great

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.900 
such program which will have a great
effect<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:01.270> think<00:05:02.020> my<00:05:02.560> wife<00:05:02.770> Mumma<00:05:03.280> also<00:05:03.730> will

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:03.910 
effect I think my wife Mumma also will

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.480 
effect I think my wife Mumma also will
have<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.090> same<00:05:05.610> answer

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
have the same answer

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880 
have the same answer
every<00:05:09.490> child<00:05:09.760> is<00:05:10.060> extraordinary<00:05:10.750> we<00:05:11.620> are<00:05:11.770> the
