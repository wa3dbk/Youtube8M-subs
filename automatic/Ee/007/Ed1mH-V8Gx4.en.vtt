pretty<00:02:04.030> hard<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.450> go<00:02:04.720> back<00:02:04.899> and<00:02:05.050> forth<00:02:05.289> but

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
pretty hard you go back and forth but

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.809 
pretty hard you go back and forth but
it's<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.190> lot<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.369> fun<00:02:06.640> going<00:02:07.330> around<00:02:08.819> just

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
it's a lot of fun going around just

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.750 
it's a lot of fun going around just
trying<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.149> train<00:02:10.390> but<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.440> mean<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.489> can

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
trying to train but I mean it can

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.280 
trying to train but I mean it can
somewhat<00:02:13.330> be<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> challenge<00:02:14.019> just<00:02:14.050> because

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
somewhat be a challenge just because

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.890 
somewhat be a challenge just because
sometimes<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:16.180> extreme<00:02:16.480> martial<00:02:16.690> art

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
sometimes and the extreme martial art

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.600 
sometimes and the extreme martial art
six<00:02:17.110> dances<00:02:17.530> are<00:02:17.680> a<00:02:17.709> little<00:02:17.860> more<00:02:18.040> exaggerated

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
six dances are a little more exaggerated

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.440 
six dances are a little more exaggerated
but<00:02:19.569> one<00:02:19.959> thing<00:02:20.230> that<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.950> think<00:02:21.340> benefit<00:02:22.090> even

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
but one thing that I think benefit even

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
but one thing that I think benefit even
the<00:02:22.630> traditional<00:02:23.140> is<00:02:23.350> if<00:02:23.650> those<00:02:23.950> type<00:02:24.310> of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
the traditional is if those type of

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.160 
the traditional is if those type of
cutters<00:02:24.670> are<00:02:24.790> really<00:02:24.970> explosive<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:26.110> you

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
cutters are really explosive so you

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.229 
cutters are really explosive so you
train<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.980> be<00:02:27.010> really<00:02:27.340> explosive<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.150> you

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
train to be really explosive so if you

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.319 
train to be really explosive so if you
can<00:02:28.360> take<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.540> explosiveness<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:31.239> know

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329 
can take that explosiveness of you know

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.880 
can take that explosiveness of you know
extreme<00:02:31.750> kata<00:02:32.019> and<00:02:32.440> then<00:02:32.620> put<00:02:32.860> that

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
extreme kata and then put that

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
extreme kata and then put that
explosiveness<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.180> traditional<00:02:34.780> contest

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
explosiveness in a traditional contest

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.470 
explosiveness in a traditional contest
