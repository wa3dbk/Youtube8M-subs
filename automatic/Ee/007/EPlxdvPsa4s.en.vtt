00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:26.330
 Today I'll show you one more 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.340
 other technology and that the photo 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.970
 transfer technique on textiles 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.100
 there are special foils there you can 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.010
 your motives all photos everything you want 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.110
 May imprint and that is one of them 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.790
 special foil for inkjet printers 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.260
 that would be very important so not with the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.330
 Laser printer on it but print the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.040
 only works with an inkjet printer 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.890
 i have been here for so retro now 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.300
 Motives decided if your motive 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.890
 printed on it because you just have to 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.750
 Cut out then I have one more here 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.770
 second motive the camera I found 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.600
 just too cute 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.480
 I'll be easy after that as well 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.820
 Iron on a piece of fabric and then 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.160
 sew the contours on the outside and that 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.210
 then just as Dekko kessen also for 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.130
 use sofa 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.399
 then I just have a whole here 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.200
 normal white pillow cases I have 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.600
 ever tried a bit before 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.970
 get space hills and then I take 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.990
 my printed motif and loves it 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.700
 with the motive down on the pillow 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.170
 cover where I just the motive later 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.679
 I would like to have it on now 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.000
 just with me on it 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.970
 then I would feel so over it I have that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.009
 iron now on cotton so 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.179
 set these three points 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.520
 that means there is something going on 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.069
 important when ironing the motive is 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.569
 that you are not directly on the one too 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.950
 ironing board iron so it must be one 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.630
 be solid backing 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.509
 I now have a wooden board here and 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.369
 Simple and cloth over it and 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.050
 then you really have to iron with pressure 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.880
 and about 90 seconds long so that 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.429
 the color of the printer with the fabric 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.590
 if he can do that, then good 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.640
 ironed then you have to do that well 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.140
 let cool down 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.780
 so it really does not wait until it stops 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.880
 hot or even warm that's it 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.520
 it really does not connect well 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.250
 early remove the protective film otherwise 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.379
 Kink the whole thing and remember 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.349
 if you work with writings or 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.790
 at all with photos that the whole 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.590
 mirrored that would have to 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.120
 also mirrored print 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.610
 so that the font is correct 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.540
 on it is we have our own motive 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.099
 I'll show you something cool 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.859
 the camera is still the I plan 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.469
 I also pressed on the fabric 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.629
 I just have the contours with me 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:45.180
 schneider 3d nachgemalt so simply the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.579
 keep the light up so that he is the one 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.530
 Contour of your motive See that I have 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.329
 I 've just repainted me 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.340
 fabric now doubled and become him 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:55.439
 easy to handle 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
 that now with the normal piece 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:00.409
 Stich I'll just here the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.409
 culture bypass 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.730
 just think about it at the end 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:19.930
 so he leaves the piece open 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:21.730
 I can now turn again 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.830
 my substance simply s.der ill 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.680
 along very close in my position 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:32.550
 along and at one of my turn 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.280
 opening that a bit more stuff 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:39.940
 if I had better do that later 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:45.400
 can then be a few millimeters on the edge 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.380
 just cut along and then 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:54.940
 you can just do your stuff through yours 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:56.620
 turn opening then turn 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.160
 I've pretty much turned around 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.900
 Always like this is a china chopsticks 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.800
 me always and then works like this 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.810
 whole corners and curves out that 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.490
 all then well issued here have the 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.250
 he has all the rough edges with 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.900
 if he does not fill water now 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.109
 So have ne fill words you might have 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.239
 her still such a cheap ikea pillow 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.280
 this little blue for 69 cents or 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.960
 what the costs then you can just like that 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.700
 just cut out and there debate out 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.700
 take the course is the cheapest 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:39.000
 and here I sometimes take my 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:42.170
 it's better to eat the chopsticks here as well 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.480
 in the corners and then through these two 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.780
 I delete one more turn now 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.880
 opening was actually on top of each other 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.190
 sees that again in the length of that 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:57.290
 the one above the other and then below 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.290
 simply my walls opening to 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.780
 if your motive is cool then then 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:25.160
 Can you do it carefully in a corner 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:28.280
 solve paper but very slowly 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.930
 Remove protective film 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.950
 It is still very important that the substance is present 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:39.350
 must be washed and best without 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.350
 Softener then keeps that best 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:56.040
 and that 's it you can do it 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:58.740
 real t shirt it all to pimp and 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:02.000
 the pictures of yours on each one 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.000
 textile printing thereon 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.669
 8th
