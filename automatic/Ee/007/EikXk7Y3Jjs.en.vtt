00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709

was hand

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.180

but<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.660> sort<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.990> gave<00:02:19.200> me<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.500> idea<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.920> start

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
but it sort of gave me the idea to start

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.580 
but it sort of gave me the idea to start
piecing<00:02:20.520> bits<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> pieces<00:02:21.390> together<00:02:21.590> so

time I've worked in painting on cakes in
this<00:06:20.860> medium<00:06:21.070> so<00:06:21.639> I'm<00:06:21.940> pretty<00:06:22.690> happy<00:06:22.810> with<00:06:23.110> the

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.200 
this medium so I'm pretty happy with the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
job however I probably should have

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.350

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
measured out my design first instead of

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.779 
measured out my design first instead of
just<00:06:28.479> free<00:06:28.780> handing<00:06:29.169> it<00:06:29.260> because<00:06:29.620> it's<00:06:30.610> not

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
just free handing it because it's not

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:34.589 
just free handing it because it's not
perfect<00:06:31.710> but<00:06:32.710> nonetheless<00:06:33.520> I'm<00:06:34.060> still<00:06:34.389> happy

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:34.599 
perfect but nonetheless I'm still happy

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:37.999 
perfect but nonetheless I'm still happy

00:06:59.820 --> 00:06:59.830 
to stick all the way around because it

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.070
