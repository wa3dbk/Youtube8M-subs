00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
essentially I believe that the entire

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.729 
essentially I believe that the entire
game<00:00:36.059> like<00:00:36.540> Scott<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:37.020> delicately<00:00:37.469> crafted

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that was at the game creator I think

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
that was at the game creator I think
that<00:00:41.670> he<00:00:41.760> delicately<00:00:42.030> crafted<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:43.200> game<00:00:43.469> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that he delicately crafted this game to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.709 
that he delicately crafted this game to
be<00:00:43.710> just<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.100> any<00:00:44.370> any<00:00:44.700> child's<00:00:45.270> nightmares

bed bugs which are the Freddy's the
Freddy<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.400> toys<00:01:23.700> I<00:01:23.850> guess<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.119> could

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
say there's all the monsters in the

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.590 
say there's all the monsters in the
darkness<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.640> was<00:01:26.729> saying<00:01:26.939> earlier<00:01:27.060> i<00:01:27.390> call

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
darkness as I was saying earlier i call

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.850 
darkness as I was saying earlier i call
these<00:01:27.780> there's<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.259> everyone's<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
these there's because everyone's like

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.080 
these there's because everyone's like
every<00:01:29.070> child's<00:01:29.100> always<00:01:29.579> scared<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> dark

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
every child's always scared of the dark

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.890 
every child's always scared of the dark
you<00:01:30.180> know<00:01:30.270> they're<00:01:30.420> always<00:01:30.509> holding<00:01:30.750> their

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you know they're always holding their

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660 
you know they're always holding their
flashlights<00:01:31.350> they're<00:01:32.009> scared<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.460> dark

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
flashlights they're scared of the dark

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
flashlights they're scared of the dark
so<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.909> think<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> Scott<00:01:33.600> actually<00:01:33.990> really

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so I think that Scott actually really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.310 
so I think that Scott actually really
delicately<00:01:34.619> crafted<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.850> game<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
delicately crafted this game to like to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.840 
delicately crafted this game to like to
sing<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> fire<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> be<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> metaphor<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.670> guess

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
sing the fire to be a metaphor I guess

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.760 
sing the fire to be a metaphor I guess
you<00:01:38.970> could<00:01:39.119> say<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.810> every<00:01:39.930> child<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.619> like

for<00:02:55.030> something<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.360> little<00:02:55.390> bit<00:02:55.660> deeper<00:02:56.019> than

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
for something a little bit deeper than

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.199 
for something a little bit deeper than
just<00:02:56.440> being<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.160> nightmare<00:02:57.819> game<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.180> really

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209

guys are excited about that let me know

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.009 
guys are excited about that let me know
you<00:03:39.519> guys<00:03:39.670> think<00:03:40.030> about<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.690> little<00:03:40.840> bit<00:03:40.989> of

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you guys think about this little bit of

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.090 
you guys think about this little bit of
a<00:03:41.079> theory<00:03:41.319> i'm<00:03:41.470> not<00:03:41.620> really<00:03:41.709> sure<00:03:41.829> if<00:03:41.950> you<00:03:42.010> can

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
a theory i'm not really sure if you can

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.650 
a theory i'm not really sure if you can
go<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.250> if<00:03:42.340> they're<00:03:42.549> both<00:03:42.670> this<00:03:42.880> these

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
go out if they're both this these

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.090 
go out if they're both this these
details<00:03:44.170> that<00:03:44.319> did<00:03:44.410> notice<00:03:44.680> about<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.950> game

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
details that did notice about the game

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.069 
details that did notice about the game
but<00:03:45.310> how<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.639> whole<00:03:45.760> game<00:03:46.060> maybe<00:03:46.660> just<00:03:46.930> a

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
but how this whole game maybe just a

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.750 
but how this whole game maybe just a
metaphor<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:47.650> every<00:03:48.100> single<00:03:48.370> child<00:03:48.519> it's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
metaphor for every single child it's

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.979 
metaphor for every single child it's
like<00:03:48.850> like<00:03:49.060> life<00:03:49.299> and<00:03:49.569> their<00:03:49.660> child's

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
like like life and their child's

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.690 
like like life and their child's
nightmares<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.680> child's<00:03:51.010> being<00:03:51.400> afraid

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700
