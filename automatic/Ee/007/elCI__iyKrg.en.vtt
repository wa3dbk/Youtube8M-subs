00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.830
 we took shortening the good area of 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.660
 salt lemon juice and cook it 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.230
 slowly grill until it is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.840
 well cooked for spiced apples 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 let's cut them into quarters and mix them 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.609
 with cinnamon with black cardamom curry 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.099
 let's click the area was cooked 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.640
 in laughter and then I made a 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.130
 little sugar chicken we're going to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.100
 cut them into quarters put a little bit of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:44.120
 dijon mustard orange juice and 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.120
 cook a beating more 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.080
 obvious infiernito and enrico the apples 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.690
 I do not want them to be too soft and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 so look how easy it is to get it out of 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:18.360
 the clamp and the meat 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.570
 vedette today as not 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.330
 they need to have the cover all the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.220
 time they go alternating so they give more 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:34.979
 or less armed in which he was a member 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:49.650
 most important song we will see 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:51.900
 how is a shoulder 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.830
 combination of known flavors between 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.320
 yes 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:02:00.770
 the apple 8 made one way 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 different 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.720
 the combination of flavors for a dinner 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.209
 usual 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.790
 I'm not very fond of bacon 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.130
 prefer to use another cut of meat 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.890
 they can not do perfectly with a 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.840
 empty they can do it with a cut 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.290
 we basically need a cut of 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:31.160
 meat that is a well that has good 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.160
 amount of fat and resist option 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.290
 lots of polite Luis 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:53.950
 and what better to accompany this meat 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.950
 and a rich ice cold beer 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.690
 I hope you enjoyed it as much as 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:04.690
 the process doing this program I see it 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.690
 plus 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.319
 The cans 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:35.730
 more what
