trucks<00:00:28.710> oil<00:00:29.130> rigs<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> thing

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
trucks oil rigs and that kind of thing

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.650 
trucks oil rigs and that kind of thing
it's<00:00:31.349> all<00:00:31.529> hydraulic<00:00:32.219> it's<00:00:32.850> got<00:00:33.059> an<00:00:33.180> integral

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
it's all hydraulic it's got an integral

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.990 
it's all hydraulic it's got an integral
brake<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.040> shaft<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.750> winch<00:00:37.290> are

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
brake and the shaft and the winch are

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.850 
brake and the shaft and the winch are
separate<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.480> run<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.620> other

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
separate so you can run one or the other

00:00:40.860 --> 00:02:26.670 
separate so you can run one or the other
and<00:00:41.480> this<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:42.899> started<00:00:43.230> with

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.949 

one<00:02:27.680> other<00:02:27.830> thing<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.280> did<00:02:28.550> was<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.209> cut<00:02:29.510> down<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
one other thing I did was I cut down the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.170 
one other thing I did was I cut down the
spool<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.590> held<00:02:30.860> the<00:02:30.980> cable<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.610> remove<00:02:31.880> the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
spool that held the cable and remove the

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.790 
spool that held the cable and remove the
cable<00:02:32.330> obviously<00:02:33.760> right<00:02:34.760> here<00:02:35.260> was<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.560> looked

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
cable obviously right here was it looked

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.520 
cable obviously right here was it looked
like<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.160> and<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.480> this<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.080> what<00:02:39.260> I'm<00:02:39.349> left

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
like this and so this is what I'm left

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.610 
like this and so this is what I'm left
with<00:02:39.739> now<00:02:40.040> is<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.910> little<00:02:41.150> 3-inch<00:02:41.900> section

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
with now is that little 3-inch section

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.080 
with now is that little 3-inch section
right<00:02:42.800> there<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.340> was<00:02:43.430> able<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.640> slim<00:02:43.940> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
right there so I was able to slim the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.270 
right there so I was able to slim the
whole<00:02:44.209> thing<00:02:44.480> down<00:02:44.690> and<00:02:45.020> then<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:45.770> I<00:02:45.800> did<00:02:45.920> was

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
whole thing down and then what I did was

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.030 
whole thing down and then what I did was
I<00:02:46.430> took<00:02:46.489> some<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.090> plate<00:02:47.420> off<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.530> back

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
I took some of the plate off of the back

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.509 
I took some of the plate off of the back
and<00:02:49.700> rear<00:02:50.090> of<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.780> bumper<00:02:51.200> were<00:02:51.380> 3/8<00:02:51.830> inch<00:02:52.130> by

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
and rear of the bumper were 3/8 inch by

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.390 
and rear of the bumper were 3/8 inch by
12<00:02:53.000> inch<00:02:53.330> wide<00:02:53.750> plate<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.620> that's<00:02:55.160> what<00:02:55.370> I

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
12 inch wide plate and that's what I

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.780 
12 inch wide plate and that's what I
made<00:02:55.700> these<00:02:56.330> brackets<00:02:56.750> out<00:02:57.140> of<00:02:57.349> I<00:02:57.620> used<00:02:58.610> some

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
made these brackets out of I used some

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.729 
made these brackets out of I used some
old<00:02:58.940> pipe<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.630> had<00:02:59.810> laying<00:03:00.050> around<00:03:00.230> for

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
old pipe that I had laying around for

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.820 
old pipe that I had laying around for
over<00:03:01.459> 20<00:03:01.850> years<00:03:01.880> and<00:03:02.630> I<00:03:03.019> finally<00:03:03.350> got<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.530> use

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
over 20 years and I finally got to use

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.390 
over 20 years and I finally got to use
it<00:03:04.040> this<00:03:04.459> is<00:03:04.730> some<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:05.830> think<00:03:06.830> it's<00:03:06.980> two<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.250> a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it this is some I think it's two and a

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.470 
it this is some I think it's two and a
half<00:03:07.580> inch<00:03:07.850> OD<00:03:08.330> inch<00:03:08.600> and<00:03:08.810> a<00:03:08.840> half<00:03:08.870> ID<00:03:09.380> pipe

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
half inch OD inch and a half ID pipe

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.809 
half inch OD inch and a half ID pipe
stuff<00:03:11.480> is<00:03:11.660> thick<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:15.310> mean<00:03:16.310> carrying<00:03:16.730> around

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
stuff is thick I mean carrying around

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.070 
stuff is thick I mean carrying around
this<00:03:17.030> piece<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.360> metal<00:03:17.600> for<00:03:17.720> I<00:03:17.750> don't<00:03:17.900> even

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
this piece of metal for I don't even

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.220 
this piece of metal for I don't even
know<00:03:18.319> how<00:03:18.470> long

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
know how long

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.420 
know how long
here's<00:03:21.230> what<00:03:21.440> all<00:03:21.530> I'm<00:03:21.709> kind<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.980> getting<00:03:22.130> left

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
here's what all I'm kind of getting left

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.150 
here's what all I'm kind of getting left
with<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.880> scrap<00:03:23.239> end<00:03:23.540> of<00:03:23.780> it<00:03:23.930> all<00:03:24.080> I'm<00:03:25.040> going

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
with the scrap end of it all I'm going

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.210 
with the scrap end of it all I'm going
to<00:03:25.250> probably<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.819> use<00:03:25.940> part<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:27.220> to

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
to probably have to use part of this to

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.420 
to probably have to use part of this to
make<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.519> shaft<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.600> adapt<00:03:30.590> to<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.950> bobcat

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
make a shaft to adapt to the bobcat

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.120 
make a shaft to adapt to the bobcat
system<00:03:32.000> which<00:03:32.390> most<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.350> those<00:03:33.470> auger<00:03:33.769> bits

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
system which most of those auger bits

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.650 
system which most of those auger bits
have<00:03:34.400> a<00:03:34.430> 2<00:03:34.820> and<00:03:36.010> 9/16<00:03:37.010> inch<00:03:37.370> shaft<00:03:38.120> is<00:03:38.480> what

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
have a 2 and 9/16 inch shaft is what

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.960 
have a 2 and 9/16 inch shaft is what
they're<00:03:38.840> ready<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:39.380> and<00:03:39.920> so<00:03:40.489> that's<00:03:40.670> what<00:03:40.850> I'm

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
they're ready for and so that's what I'm

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.210 
they're ready for and so that's what I'm
going<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.209> weld<00:03:41.600> one<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.930> those<00:03:42.220> probably

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
going to weld one of those probably

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.410 
going to weld one of those probably
actually<00:03:43.340> going<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.730> use<00:03:43.850> another<00:03:44.060> piece<00:03:44.359> of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
actually going to use another piece of

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.600

to the Bobcat and that is a quick catch

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.300 
to the Bobcat and that is a quick catch

features that I heard guys really liked

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.170 
features that I heard guys really liked
is<00:04:12.210> the<00:04:12.240> cradle<00:04:12.660> and<00:04:13.080> I<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.160> see<00:04:14.340> why<00:04:14.520> keeps

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
is the cradle and I can see why keeps

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.120 
is the cradle and I can see why keeps
the<00:04:15.360> thing<00:04:15.480> from<00:04:15.630> bouncing<00:04:16.140> around<00:04:16.200> a<00:04:16.530> lot<00:04:16.769> and

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
the thing from bouncing around a lot and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.479 
the thing from bouncing around a lot and
so<00:04:18.060> made<00:04:18.810> one<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.140> those<00:04:19.290> i'm<00:04:19.769> adam<00:04:20.040> made<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.370> a

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
so made one of those i'm adam made it a

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.500 
so made one of those i'm adam made it a
little<00:04:20.670> bit<00:04:20.880> too<00:04:21.060> tall<00:04:21.269> with<00:04:22.140> the<00:04:23.300> quick<00:04:24.300> catch

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
little bit too tall with the quick catch

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.110 
little bit too tall with the quick catch
fully<00:04:24.930> extended<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.800> hanging<00:04:26.610> up<00:04:26.730> its<00:04:26.970> high

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
fully extended and hanging up its high

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.140 
fully extended and hanging up its high
and<00:04:27.420> over<00:04:27.720> as<00:04:27.960> it'll<00:04:28.200> go<00:04:28.230> it<00:04:29.010> just<00:04:29.190> barely

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
and over as it'll go it just barely

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.710 
and over as it'll go it just barely
doesn't<00:04:30.990> touch<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:32.340> bottom<00:04:32.700> of<00:04:32.820> this<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.450> so

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
doesn't touch the bottom of this and so

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.420 
doesn't touch the bottom of this and so
i<00:04:33.990> think<00:04:34.140> it's<00:04:34.380> going<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.590> swing<00:04:34.890> pretty<00:04:35.040> free

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
i think it's going to swing pretty free

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.400 
i think it's going to swing pretty free
one<00:04:36.120> other<00:04:36.300> thing<00:04:36.540> i<00:04:36.660> did<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:36.870> i'm<00:04:37.200> really

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
one other thing i did is i'm really

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.440 
one other thing i did is i'm really
worried<00:04:37.710> about<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:38.070> thing<00:04:38.250> torquing<00:04:38.820> so<00:04:39.420> I

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
worried about the thing torquing so I

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.830 
worried about the thing torquing so I
added<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:40.020> plate<00:04:40.290> of<00:04:40.440> metal<00:04:40.620> back<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.840> so

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
added a plate of metal back there so

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.560 
added a plate of metal back there so
that<00:04:42.990> it'll<00:04:43.140> keep<00:04:44.100> it<00:04:44.310> from<00:04:44.490> possibly<00:04:45.000> bending

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
that it'll keep it from possibly bending

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.110 
that it'll keep it from possibly bending
this<00:04:46.110> thing's<00:04:46.320> going<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.620> produce<00:04:46.920> if<00:04:47.910> the

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
this thing's going to produce if the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.690 
this thing's going to produce if the
calculations<00:04:48.810> are<00:04:48.990> correct<00:04:49.110> close<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.010> 1,500

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
calculations are correct close to 1,500

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.720 
calculations are correct close to 1,500
pounds<00:04:50.880> per<00:04:51.300> foot<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:52.560> the<00:04:52.680> bit<00:04:52.920> so<00:04:53.550> that's

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
pounds per foot to the bit so that's

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.270 
pounds per foot to the bit so that's
going<00:04:53.880> to<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.060> pretty<00:04:54.300> significant<00:04:55.080> we've<00:04:56.040> got

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
going to be pretty significant we've got

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.310 
going to be pretty significant we've got
everything<00:04:56.640> pretty<00:04:56.970> much<00:04:57.150> tack<00:04:57.690> welded<00:04:58.169> up

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
everything pretty much tack welded up

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.610 
everything pretty much tack welded up
now<00:04:58.560> I'm<00:04:58.950> just<00:04:59.220> using<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.669> little<00:04:59.870> 1/10<00:05:00.870> MIG

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
now I'm just using the little 1/10 MIG

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.730 
now I'm just using the little 1/10 MIG
welder<00:05:02.160> that<00:05:02.370> I<00:05:02.940> have<00:05:03.230> tomorrow<00:05:04.230> I'll<00:05:04.380> fire<00:05:04.710> up

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
welder that I have tomorrow I'll fire up

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.720 
welder that I have tomorrow I'll fire up
the<00:05:04.950> buzz<00:05:05.430> box<00:05:05.790> with<00:05:06.180> some<00:05:06.500> 78<00:05:07.500> 18<00:05:08.100> rod<00:05:08.370> or

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
the buzz box with some 78 18 rod or

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.130 
the buzz box with some 78 18 rod or
whatever<00:05:09.300> I<00:05:09.360> have<00:05:09.660> that'll<00:05:10.169> do<00:05:10.950> it
