00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.990
 before gushing from the tap the water 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.059
 drinking is propelled by pumps in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.599
 pipelines rectilinear what is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.440
 completely contrary to its natural flow 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.059
 a century ago 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.010
 the Austrian naturalist victor 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.930
 schauberg hours felt that the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.330
 swirl was the basic premise of 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.359
 the vitality of the water the system turns 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.650
 600 rpm 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 we feel the energy when we 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.710
 touch the tank 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 if the latter was made of stainless steel 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.829
 in copper is that someone does not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.629
 touching would literally be floored 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.610
 vortex systems are used in 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.410
 hydrotherapy for ten years 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 medical observations have shown 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.739
 that water subjected to turbulence and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.660
 very effective at treating the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.030
 neck and waist contractures 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 scapular his electronic showers 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.410
 Made in Switzerland are equipped with 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.149
 several vortex systems massage 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.340
 due to the pressure of the water jets soothes 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.320
 rheumatic pains promotes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.650
 the cleaning body and prevents 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.170
 this bakery in dÃ¼sseldorf 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.250
 has been using the vortex machine since 1978 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.250
 from schauberg hours 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.880
 this reaction favors bacteria 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.280
 positive for mold and inhibits 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:25.690
 negative the corner is silica 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:29.890
 natural crystallized shame this quartz this 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:34.020
 is of the highest exceptional quality 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.460
 zealous more he carries information 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.770
 that I am here also quartz 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.560
 crystalline ie crystal of 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.780
 rock in becoming closer to the water 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.970
 by its characteristics not born to when 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.680
 the rock crystal would be a rush 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.280
 ideal for transmitting information 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.280
 at the water 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.619
 beautiful space when I bypass the rock 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.719
 on both sides the two flows 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.549
 fall behind that gives birth to a 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.470
 additional effect that recharges the water 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.150
 thoroughly it improves on the plane 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.890
 energetic in this ottmar stream 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.989
 gruber built a few years ago 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.400
 a stone staircase which baptized him 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:25.430
 pendulum ramp today on the banks 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.530
 the vegetation is lush the grass of the 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.209
 meadows down the stairs is a meter 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.209
 higher than that of upstream loans
