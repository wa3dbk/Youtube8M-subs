 successful without abb from like to wrongly 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.570
 as abbot weapon understands the abb indeed 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.290
 easy to learn but hard to get 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.450

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.399
 you my blackbetty and me just 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.869
 explain a few basics hwp in the 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:31.140
 next follow the guide then it goes 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.730
 to move dab positioning aiming 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.680
 training on a very special 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 training map and other tips and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:42.120
 tricks to the different cs maps so 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.769
 Get started and go from 4750 dollars 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.420
 can you buy a abb 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.920
 but especially as a beginner you should 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.989
 always make sure that too 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.670
 the rest of the team at least some 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.019
 weapon someone already bought one but 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.000
 and you have best yet 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.629
 retrofit grenades and maybe one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.399
 Buy good gun as soon as you can 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.079
 First thing a hand today have everyone 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.559
 opponent in a direct hit immediately 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 around 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.550
 except he has 100 p and only meet 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.080
 The footheads are also through 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.640
 walls deadly an accurate shoot 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.960
 while running you can with the wp 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.550
 completely forgotten 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.940
 the same is true for the way 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.740
 Ballern while jumping in close combat since 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.540
 The lunch was usually underlaid 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.149
 therefore best changes for a short time 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.070
 Distances on the pistol makes sense 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:26.970
 It is also after every shot with the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 Bible in front 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.930
 secondary weapon in the hand like that 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.190
 you will not become a defenseless target 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.880
 while the adp is not back yet 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.590
 ready 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.480
 if you do that fast enough 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 shortened to the waiting time until 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.940
 next shot and can this again 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.560
 Brand new focused 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.940
 for playing with the wp you should 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.780
 also the mouse speed for the 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.060
 adjust zoom 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 with zoom sensitivity rage around you can 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.570
 you adjust how fast yours 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.150
 speed during the boom is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.500
 a value of 1 means 100 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.600
 percent of your normal build 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.250
 speed well then I'm still driving 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 times together pay attention to your mails 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.600
 Atp buy direct hits except in the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.910
 kill foot immediately please shoot only if 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.040
 her completely silent stands between the 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.570
 shots please pull the pistol and 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.880
 last fits your zoom sensitivity 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.860
 bitter in the game style in the next 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.590
 it is then what you do when 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.780
 offensive or defensive adp plays in 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.100
 Positioning aiming and positioning 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.030
 should pay attention in the movement 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.410
 In the meantime you can of course 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.270
 also like other videos of me 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.459
 they all built such a way 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.890
 are a bit linked there are , for example, csu 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.630
 stream highlights quite funny and great 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.610
 and super g and then there are still 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.320
 of course entertainment videos already
