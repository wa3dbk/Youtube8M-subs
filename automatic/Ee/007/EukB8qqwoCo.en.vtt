the<00:00:07.950> original<00:00:08.309> G<00:00:08.490> flex<00:00:08.730> but<00:00:09.210> it's<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.660> little

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
the original G flex but it's a little

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.080 
the original G flex but it's a little
bit<00:00:10.080> smaller<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> original<00:00:10.980> G<00:00:11.130> flex<00:00:11.400> was<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> 6

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
bit smaller the original G flex was a 6

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
inch plastic OLED display the G flex 2

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.090 
inch plastic OLED display the G flex 2
is<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> 5.5<00:00:15.929> inch<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> they've<00:00:16.650> bumped<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
is a 5.5 inch and they've bumped the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.550 
is a 5.5 inch and they've bumped the
resolution<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.880> full<00:00:18.119> HD<00:00:18.630> so<00:00:19.080> that's<00:00:19.260> great<00:00:19.350> to

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
resolution to full HD so that's great to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.470 
resolution to full HD so that's great to
see<00:00:19.710> too<00:00:19.949> now<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> same<00:00:20.939> plastic<00:00:21.210> OLED

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
see too now it's the same plastic OLED

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.380 
see too now it's the same plastic OLED
403<00:00:22.230> pixels<00:00:22.650> per<00:00:22.830> inch<00:00:23.039> but<00:00:23.640> obviously<00:00:23.880> has<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
403 pixels per inch but obviously has a

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.390 
403 pixels per inch but obviously has a
smaller<00:00:24.840> footprint<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.500> actual<00:00:26.070> footprint

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
smaller footprint the actual footprint

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.939 
smaller footprint the actual footprint
of<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.609> phone<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:26.970> not<00:00:27.150> much<00:00:27.330> bigger<00:00:27.779> than<00:00:27.949> the

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
of the phone is not much bigger than the

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.849 
of the phone is not much bigger than the
g3<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.330> we've<00:00:30.449> got<00:00:30.480> two<00:00:30.750> colors<00:00:31.109> here<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.590> have

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
g3 see we've got two colors here we have

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.310 
g3 see we've got two colors here we have
the<00:00:32.189> platinum<00:00:32.790> silver<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> flamenco<00:00:33.930> red

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the platinum silver and flamenco red

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
the platinum silver and flamenco red
which<00:00:34.530> looks<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.370> fantastic<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> back

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
which looks really fantastic on the back

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.569 
which looks really fantastic on the back
we<00:00:36.780> have<00:00:36.809> an<00:00:37.260> advanced<00:00:37.860> second-generation

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
we have an advanced second-generation

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.330 
we have an advanced second-generation
self-healing<00:00:39.450> coating<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.190> will

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
self-healing coating so this will

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.130 
self-healing coating so this will
actually<00:00:41.489> self-repair<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.270> 10<00:00:42.510> seconds<00:00:42.960> as

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
actually self-repair in 10 seconds as

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.049 
actually self-repair in 10 seconds as
opposed<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> original<00:00:44.280> G<00:00:44.610> flex<00:00:44.879> which

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
opposed to the original G flex which

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
opposed to the original G flex which
took<00:00:45.270> up<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> 10<00:00:45.780> minutes<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.260> sometimes<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
took up to 10 minutes and sometimes a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.920 
took up to 10 minutes and sometimes a
little<00:00:47.039> longer<00:00:47.280> than<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> front<00:00:48.780> we

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
little longer than that on the front we

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.709 
little longer than that on the front we
have<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> new<00:00:49.739> proprietary<00:00:50.460> LG<00:00:50.940> G<00:00:51.390> regard

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
have a new proprietary LG G regard

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.439 
have a new proprietary LG G regard
coating<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.289> top<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.680> Gorilla<00:00:53.640> Glass<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.180> it's

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
coating on top of Gorilla Glass so it's

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.029 
coating on top of Gorilla Glass so it's
actually<00:00:54.570> twenty<00:00:54.960> percent<00:00:55.230> stronger<00:00:55.770> than

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's the same sensor as the g3 but with

it's the same sensor as the g3 but with
improved<00:01:13.619> software<00:01:14.310> got<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.210> same<00:01:15.390> Ricky<00:01:15.869> set

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110

stuff<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.770> is<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.850> be

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
stuff this thing is actually going to be

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.929 
stuff this thing is actually going to be
I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:40.079> LG's<00:01:40.530> new<00:01:40.560> flagship<00:01:41.159> perhaps<00:01:41.759> even

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
I think LG's new flagship perhaps even

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.780 
I think LG's new flagship perhaps even
better<00:01:42.390> specs<00:01:43.049> wise<00:01:43.229> than<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.829> g4<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.579> may<00:01:44.759> be

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
better specs wise than the g4 and may be

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
better specs wise than the g4 and may be
priced<00:01:45.270> around<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.720> same<00:01:45.960> maybe<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.320> little

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
priced around the same maybe a little

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.109 
priced around the same maybe a little
bit<00:01:46.710> more<00:01:46.860> they<00:01:47.070> can't<00:01:47.310> give<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> specifics<00:01:47.970> yet
