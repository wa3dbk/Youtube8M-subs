00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 Efe brand good brushes yes 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.790
 you want to know more about these brushes 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.769
 we were to see the video 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.580
 let's start with facial brushes 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.520
 in this case only 3 of these come 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.920
 because this really comes to us is a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.869
 basic for any girl who wants 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.080
 start to put on makeup I recommend it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.020
 to use these skewers is good 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.040
 as you can see 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.040
 here it comes 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.550
 Here you can see that in each brush what 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.350
 What I like is that the 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.710
 little name I do not know if you can see in this 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.710
 part 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.690
 you see what each one serves this bronze 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:56.810
 and blues really is to contour me 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.500
 was usually used a lot to apply 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.650
 the rouge as you see is beveled 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.300
 it's pretty soft the only thing I know that 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.950
 There are many hairs, there are many 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.560
 hairs and if the lava is for the first time 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.899
 the red dye that he has here 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.140
 it's pretty good that it leaves the water 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.820
 red but not the truth is that it is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 quite web then we continue with the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.470
 powder brush costs total facebook 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:30.780
 let's take this voucher is a brush 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.229
 very soft with a lot of beige hair 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.729
 and really the truth that is very pretty 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.990
 this color so it really looks like but 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.920
 really redhead are very soft it 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.920
 wash very easily 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.640
 It already has a pretty good size for me 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.400
 They are too big, it's not pretty 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.650
 well the last facial is this fundation 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.340
 brush and that's what it's called 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.340
 but you have 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.140
 and this is the truth that I use 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.320
 very much for to apply the baby 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:11.090
 cream and facial masks is very 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:13.340
 soft is very easy to wash vale has 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.569
 As you can see, it's soft, it's not very 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 rigid as there are others that are 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.970
 Pretty stiff does not loose any hair 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.980
 and it's very easy for me to apply 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.760
 the step of makeup now we are going to 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.599
 move to the range of good eyes we're going to 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.599
 start with this 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.780
 this really is called blending there 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.030
 bruce you can 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.330
 you can see it 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.670
 and to blur is going great are 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.770
 very soft as you see this does not have the 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.330
 dye that has the other this already has a 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.510
 normal color 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.180
 and they are very easy to apply this serves 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:58.770
 to outline what is the basin of the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.710
 eye then there is this one called the 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.420
 ice to those blues that is for really 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.560
 how do you put the name that is for xavi da 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.020
 the shadow that to be able to use 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.760
 put it all the mobile eyelid paint it and 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.130
 others and I the truth is that with all 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.610
 these are skewers I paint a lot 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.360
 all right 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:21.940
 then we move on to this one that is like a 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.100
 kind of rigid foam rubber that 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.380
 you are to blur the eyeliner 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.310
 and also to blur everything better 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.170
 that are the eyeliners that I 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.710
 I normally used these 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:40.770
 two this is called 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.770
 with clear brush or for corrector 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.400
 and this is called eyeliner bruce which is 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 to put the eyeliner what happens is 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.170
 that I see a little thick for the 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.450
 eyeliner because I thought that this was 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.849
 more finite but good 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.010
 I have not tried it yet but 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.629
 this one I've tried it for the proofreader 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.550
 to put on a concealer of circles under your eyes 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.959
 you have to cover a granite or something in 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.599
 so give with your finger then 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.209
 you already hit it with this and so 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.620
 you drag as much makeup as when 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.280
 you make up with your fingers what you get 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:17.569
 is always more here than in the face 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.569
 then we passed 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:24.570
 from find a bruce this is like elvis 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.220
 ice cream for the face but for the eyes 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.220
 it's so fine finite 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.689
 quite about this still does not 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.669
 has been very useful because really 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:39.849
 I use these two more than this because 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:44.090
 although it's beveled it looks a bit thick 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:48.080
 it does not happen the same as with this one for 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:53.440
 to put the shadow after we passed 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.440
 to the normal this is the lips 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.650
 fine brooks clip 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.240
 as you can see, it 's finite, quite soft and 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.419
 flexible 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.270
 and then, well, these two last ones 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:13.650
 this is to comb the eyebrows and 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:17.190
 eyelashes also serve and this is called 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.190
 and the am brown one that is for 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.000
 Eyelashes and eyebrows 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.150
 and then this one had two in one that 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.340
 call brown with bruce that would be for the 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.480
 tabs to separate them to comb and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.250
 this one also for the lashes and the 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.280
 good eyebrows girls I hope you have 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.830
