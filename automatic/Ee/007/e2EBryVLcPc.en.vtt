and my suggestion is you should try
being<00:02:12.660> create

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.199 
of but when that fails you need to have
a<00:02:15.540> back-up<00:02:15.870> plan<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.920> best<00:02:17.250> suggestion<00:02:17.700> is

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
a back-up plan and my best suggestion is

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.900 
a back-up plan and my best suggestion is

and upload that what could go wrong and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.160 
and upload that what could go wrong and
you're<00:02:24.239> going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.390> get<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.599> lot<00:02:24.660> of<00:02:24.810> views
