reward is an at-home experience that
will<00:00:22.670> further<00:00:23.090> illustrate<00:00:23.570> surface<00:00:24.410> tension

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
will further illustrate surface tension

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.390 
will further illustrate surface tension
here's<00:00:25.520> what<00:00:25.760> you<00:00:25.910> need<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:28.000> bowl<00:00:29.000> of<00:00:29.150> water

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
toasted pastry treat now you're ready to

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.799 
toasted pastry treat now you're ready to
begin<00:00:43.420> have<00:00:44.420> a<00:00:44.449> bowl<00:00:44.749> of<00:00:44.780> water<00:00:45.730> then<00:00:46.809> take

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
begin have a bowl of water then take

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:50.739 
begin have a bowl of water then take
your<00:00:48.350> pepper<00:00:48.649> and<00:00:48.979> grind<00:00:49.729> it<00:00:49.909> or<00:00:50.089> sprinkle<00:00:50.690> it

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
your pepper and grind it or sprinkle it

00:00:50.749 --> 00:01:00.340 
your pepper and grind it or sprinkle it
onto<00:00:51.019> the<00:00:51.319> surface<00:00:58.179> pepper<00:00:59.179> is<00:00:59.569> less<00:01:00.109> dense

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
onto the surface pepper is less dense

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.369 
onto the surface pepper is less dense
than<00:01:00.679> water<00:01:00.969> therefore<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.659> can<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:03.049> that<00:01:03.079> it

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
than water therefore you can see that it

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.700 
than water therefore you can see that it
floats<00:01:03.710> on<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.010> surface<00:01:04.309> of<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.820> water

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
floats on the surface of the water

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.460 
floats on the surface of the water
now<00:01:06.710> take<00:01:07.490> your<00:01:07.640> bed<00:01:07.850> paper<00:01:08.120> clip<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:08.630> apply

now take your bed paper clip and apply

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.230 
now take your bed paper clip and apply
soap<00:01:09.830> to<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.310> end<00:01:10.430> of<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.670> follow<00:01:11.510> ad<00:01:16.060> take<00:01:17.060> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
soap to the end of it follow ad take the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.900 
soap to the end of it follow ad take the
soap<00:01:17.710> touch<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.890> to<00:01:19.010> the<00:01:19.160> center<00:01:19.490> of<00:01:19.700> the

surface<00:01:20.330> of<00:01:20.480> the<00:01:20.570> water<00:01:21.110> oh<00:01:25.540> my<00:01:26.540> gosh<00:01:26.810> look<00:01:27.170> at

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
surface of the water oh my gosh look at

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.950 
surface of the water oh my gosh look at
that<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:28.280> pepper<00:01:28.550> move<00:01:29.150> to<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.420> outer<00:01:29.600> edges

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
that the pepper move to the outer edges

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.680 
that the pepper move to the outer edges
of<00:01:30.230> the<00:01:30.350> bowl<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:31.580> introduction<00:01:32.240> of<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.450> soap

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.730 

now<00:01:44.330> I<00:01:44.360> bet<00:01:44.780> you're<00:01:44.990> wondering<00:01:45.020> what<00:01:45.560> that

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
now I bet you're wondering what that

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.900 
now I bet you're wondering what that
toasted<00:01:46.160> pastry<00:01:46.700> treatments<00:01:47.180> for<00:01:47.800> glad<00:01:48.910> you
