00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.930
 today we talk about aquaplaning phenomenon 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.570
 aquaplaning consists of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.059
 floating of tires on one 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.780
 layer of water that may have accumulated later 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.780
 a heavy rain 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.450
 the aquaplaning involves the total 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.420
 detachment of tires from the bottom 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.830
 road and the consequent loss of 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.830
 vehicle control itself 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:12.550
 it is favored by excessive speed 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:15.400
 tires worn or deflated like 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.070
 we perceive from the problem we might have 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.369
 a sudden lightening of the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.369
 steering and an increase in the number of revolutions 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.299
 how we should behave surely 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.200
 no sudden maneuver to avoid steering 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.409
 avoid braking keep the steering wheel well 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.899
 balance in your hands, if necessary press 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.979
 the clutch pedal and wait for 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.979
 get out of the critical situation
