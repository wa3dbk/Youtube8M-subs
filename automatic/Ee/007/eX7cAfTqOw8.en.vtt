00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.340
 I will now go to the boy I loved to go to 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.500
 him but after what happened to me 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.019
 I hate to go to the circus and even more to the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.700
 clowns he is running in my city 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.710
 my little brother and I had 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.740
 heard that a new circus would have 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.930
 to get to the city today and that the three 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.060
 first functions were free but for 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.930
 no one was going to go after the 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.060
 first function 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.740
 my parents did not want us 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.150
 we were since it was a show in the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.820
 which children were the only ones 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.979
 they could enter that seemed suspicious to us 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.229
 to the whole city but there was something 

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:38.809
 hypnotic in that circus that attracted 

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:41.149
 all children the night of the first 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.909
 function my sister and I escaped from 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.059
 house to go to the circus that has been my 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:49.290
 biggest mistake in my whole life which 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.960
 it cost my life in my little sister 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.150
 the tube started like any other all 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640
 we were so excited about that 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.260
 appeared a miniature car of is that 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 use the clowns and that's when 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.550
 things became terrifying the 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 background music started to distort 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 the lights turned off suddenly I heard 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.050
 several cries and suddenly they went on 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.820
 the lights in a scarlet hue I 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.760
 I realized that my sister was no longer 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.220
 side of the car three clowns came down 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.270
 with devilish smiles the three laughed 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.000
 in unison 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.460
 I still remember that laugh a hoarse laugh 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.890
 and hollow as if it were a lion 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.020
 drowning the clowns ran towards 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.630
 the first row and they took how many children 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 they could put them in the stroller and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.390
 repeat in the process over and over again the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.910
 spectators tried to flee but it was 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.520
 impossible there were more clowns guarding 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.920
 the departures there were more and more 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.600
 clowns in the crowd I could see my 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.840
 sister crying in the corner of the circus 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.430
 I went for her I took her and I turned around and 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.430
 I noticed that there was no one left 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.320
 correct towards the exit and my sister 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.320
 Advise the ear 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.550
 when I saw her 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.910
 that face do not stay face 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.950
 It was not the same anymore, it was not my 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.290
 sister had the quality of the eyes 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.690
 you empty the blood gushing from her 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.720
 Segmented dress and smiling 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.850
 ear to ear and a white make-up 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 she started to laugh like the 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.450
 clowns that came around me 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.760
 I thought this is my end I will die but not 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.830
 it was like that a clown took me by the back 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.990
 at the same time that another tangle goes the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.600
 abdomen they turned around and they removed me 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:39.210
 eyes left me thrown in a puddle 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.670
 of blood while I laughed did not stop 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.130
 laugh out of the circus dragons of that 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.310
 Devilish place I told police what 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.340
 happened in that place nobody believed me the 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.310
 circus was not there anymore I've gone crazy I'm 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.110
 a schizophrenic according to my doctors 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.690
 but I'm still listening to those laughs 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.480
 they go from my head and what else I 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.750
 it pains the conscience is that the circus 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.110
 they can go to your city to visit you already 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.160
 has warned that I still know who 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.090
 you will escape from its clutches 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.090
 So only 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.270
 difficult to treat
