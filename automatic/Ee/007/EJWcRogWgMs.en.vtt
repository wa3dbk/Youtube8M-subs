00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.050
 If I get it wrong 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:09.160
 he is an athlete 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.160
 and I have tits 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.279
 or two a gameplay with line 86 trying 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.350
 know about some gameplays 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.240
 handles with alcohol different weapons and 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.580
 other but good this is not a gameplay 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.250
 with the king he had the project as they want 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.390
 be what you want to call it this is from 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.010
 the previous prestige that had a 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.960
 gameplay so saved that I was left 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.449
 pretty good even though I 'm dying a 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.020
 couple of times I was pretty good 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:49.020
 liked with that of 86 that the truth 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 is that to be a light rail weapon 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
 it's not so bad tour either here 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.300
 trying to shoot an airplane without betty 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.760
 today good what I wanted to talk about in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.040
 this gameplay was from my podcasts and 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.079
 many of you know that I have a podcast 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.150
 called podcast command with console and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.520
 walker and david asensio 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.140
 and today just on Tuesday we are going to start 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.400
 here at the end on Tuesdays we are going to start 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.950
 to record at around 10 o'clock at night 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.550
 because normally at the beginning I 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.130
 we recorded 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.780
 at normal time and we record from 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.610
 once in a while without more we did not 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.340
 live video but since we're with 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.350
 gay law - well we have started to be more 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.190
 strict with the area and so on and we're going to 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.290
 start doing Tuesday at 10 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.440
 the night because at that time is when I saw 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.480
 I arrived from work 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.160
 the better it came a little late but always 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.320
 I'll be there the work came and nothing 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.080
 more to get the job when I put 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.940
 record with them comes out just like they are 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.090
 many will know her for having been in 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.390
 a video with me in the in the first 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:59.380
 chapter of knowing bilges 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.670
 interview for optics of s &amp; p and the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.000
 rise more or less 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 It does quite a lot if a lot of people saw it 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.899
 got enough reproductions at 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.670
 better 9 thousand reproductions and carlos 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.459
 it caused quite a furore in the world of 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.130
 gaming then david has seen very little 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.280
 has made a width one command channel 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.440
 podcast but the truth that still does not 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.569
 you know many that I invite you to 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 all to get into the lifetime stand 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.480
 this afternoon or tonight and that of the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.010
 10 in the games version or if you want 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.950
 metro but also in the team speak for 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.680
 listen to it with the followers too 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.989
 you can enter surely we will enter 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.120
 some subscriber or something some follower 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.100
 the podcast you want to get him 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 we will get to see four little things can 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.610
 say hey look what do you think about this 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.340
 topic we will talk to the best of several 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.739
 things there will be other leagues because command 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.930
 podcast is a spot is humor but 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.370
 also with a good one is rather of 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.410
 videogames but with a touch of humor 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.350
 more retro readings and more 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.860
 Sara already has a section by herself 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.630
 to troll and well I do not know we make a 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 little of all news analysis 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.170
 releases 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.239
 I really like the dynamics that 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.700
 we have and I hope that you like it 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.329
 we will also do it live as I have already 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.030
 said and I'll also leave the link of the 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.280
 I live so you can hear it in the air 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.109
 clearly and if not if you do not reach 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.390
 time if this video you see later 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.769
 it does not matter, nothing happens perfectly 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.140
 you can see in another moment listen to 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.720
 our moment'll pardon the 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.329
 ivoox or we can in itunes and surely 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.719
 well surely I probably can 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.239
 upload a video of the podcast to what 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:43.370
 I will upload the audio to YouTube to this channel 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.019
 to see if you want to see it if you want 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.319
 but what is promised and not what 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.319
 upload 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.800
 in what will be a plus or minus one hour 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.750
 something like that is the podcast that depends on 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.270
 if we have many sections stuck if 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.930
 no, it depends 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.060
 and that basically is that tonight 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.470
 we have the podcast and also also 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.140
 also tell you that I'm just 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.850
 agree that I have a video uploaded in the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.230
 account would be put inside the profile me 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.989
 really liked it is a channel that is called 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.820
 course and jota course I am but I 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.010
 agreement as it was pronounced but 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.440
 It was very very very funny, very funny 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.600
 unfair an egg was pretty funny 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.550
 I had quite a few funny clips of 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.850
 several games and I hope you like it 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.460
 because someone hand me the box by going to 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.040
 put at the end of the video about 10 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.840
 seconds of the video for you to see 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.430

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.010
