as<00:00:00.060> if<00:00:00.210> it<00:00:00.329> all<00:00:00.420> actually<00:00:00.599> yeah<00:00:01.860> Murat<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.810> a

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
as if it all actually yeah Murat is a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.440 
as if it all actually yeah Murat is a
person<00:00:04.799> who<00:00:04.950> uses<00:00:05.279> emotion<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.000> his<00:00:06.120> advantage

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
person who uses emotion to his advantage

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.400 
person who uses emotion to his advantage
I<00:00:06.810> think<00:00:07.020> he<00:00:07.529> uses<00:00:08.660> every<00:00:09.660> possible<00:00:12.410> incident

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
I think he uses every possible incident

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.160 
I think he uses every possible incident
thing<00:00:13.830> event<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:15.030> try<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.420> pump<00:00:15.690> himself<00:00:15.870> up

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
thing event to try and pump himself up

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.960 
thing event to try and pump himself up
to<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.770> well<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.160> cricket<00:00:17.460> field<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
to do well on the cricket field and I

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.750 
to do well on the cricket field and I
think<00:00:18.210> that's<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.320> he<00:00:19.350> really<00:00:19.920> capitalizes

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
think that's how he really capitalizes

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.429 
think that's how he really capitalizes
on<00:00:20.930> his<00:00:21.930> ability<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.930> well<00:00:24.930> as<00:00:25.050> commentators

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
on his ability and well as commentators

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.630 
on his ability and well as commentators

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
right but I also think that he's I don't
know<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.790> finest<00:00:33.420> batsmen<00:00:33.870> I

have seen in my years and for someone
that<00:00:39.450> young<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.020> able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.800> continue

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that young to be able to do and continue

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.310 
that young to be able to do and continue
to<00:00:41.579> do<00:00:41.760> what<00:00:41.910> he<00:00:42.000> does<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.420> think<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.140> it's

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that he was going to do something very

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.740 
that he was going to do something very
special<00:01:14.130> as<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> batsman<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:15.270> when<00:01:15.450> he<00:01:15.540> came<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
special as a batsman how when he came to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.820 
special as a batsman how when he came to
to<00:01:16.229> record<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.930> was<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
to record and that was that was the the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.370 
to record and that was that was the the
gist<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> conversation<00:01:20.869> and<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.049> think<00:01:22.080> he

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
gist of the conversation and I think he

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950 
gist of the conversation and I think he
will<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:22.830> go<00:01:23.009> on<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.450> probably<00:01:24.450> break

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
will he will go on to do probably break

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.359 
will he will go on to do probably break
a<00:01:24.990> lot<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> records<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.770> we<00:01:26.009> probably

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
a lot of records that we probably

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.149 
a lot of records that we probably
thought<00:01:26.670> was<00:01:26.880> impossible<00:01:27.590> up<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
thought was impossible up to now and

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460 
thought was impossible up to now and
this<00:01:29.729> guy's<00:01:29.909> got<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> ability<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> he

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
this guy's got the ability to do that he

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.749
