at the core of everything we do that's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this development testing we can think

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.310 
this development testing we can think
about<00:01:22.830> many<00:01:23.340> ideas<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:24.270> at<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.479> office<00:01:24.600> but

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
about many ideas like at the office but

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
about many ideas like at the office but
once<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.799> actually<00:01:25.920> get<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> test

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
once you actually get in here and test

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.749 
once you actually get in here and test
things<00:01:28.049> out<00:01:28.250> that's<00:01:29.250> when<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.460> actually

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
things out that's when you actually

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.429 
things out that's when you actually
determine<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.299> good<00:01:30.570> something<00:01:31.079> works

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
determine how good something works

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.740 
determine how good something works
that's<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> beautiful<00:01:32.759> thing<00:01:33.030> about<00:01:33.060> testing

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that's the beautiful thing about testing

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.539 
that's the beautiful thing about testing
that's<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> real<00:01:34.380> world<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.070> know<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.310> can

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
that's the real world you know you can

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.730 
that's the real world you know you can
design<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> analyze<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.079> day<00:01:37.290> long<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
design you can analyze all day long but

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.700 
design you can analyze all day long but
when<00:01:37.950> until<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.579> take<00:01:38.869> your<00:01:39.869> design<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
when until you take your design out and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
when until you take your design out and
really<00:01:40.979> test<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.729> real<00:01:41.939> environment<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
really test it in a real environment you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.149 
really test it in a real environment you
don't<00:01:43.079> really<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.560> how<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.070> to
