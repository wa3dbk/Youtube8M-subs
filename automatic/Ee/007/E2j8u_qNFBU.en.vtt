I've<00:00:07.100> made<00:00:07.280> some<00:00:07.520> Christmas<00:00:07.970> bunting<00:00:08.390> and

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
I've made some Christmas bunting and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.980 
I've made some Christmas bunting and
I've<00:00:09.200> made<00:00:09.380> it<00:00:09.500> really<00:00:09.770> really<00:00:10.719> quickly<00:00:11.719> and

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
I've made it really really quickly and

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.850 
I've made it really really quickly and
simply<00:00:12.350> I've<00:00:13.190> used<00:00:13.549> a<00:00:14.389> few<00:00:15.110> templates<00:00:15.619> there

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
simply I've used a few templates there

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.580 
simply I've used a few templates there
I've<00:00:16.010> got<00:00:16.039> a<00:00:16.780> stocking<00:00:17.780> up<00:00:17.900> on<00:00:18.050> the<00:00:18.170> left<00:00:18.350> there

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
I've got a stocking up on the left there

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.620 
I've got a stocking up on the left there
then<00:00:18.800> some<00:00:19.070> Holly<00:00:19.280> then<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.670> star<00:00:20.029> then<00:00:20.360> a<00:00:20.390> bell

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
then some Holly then a star then a bell

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.380 
then some Holly then a star then a bell
then<00:00:21.440> a<00:00:21.470> Christmas<00:00:21.920> tree<00:00:22.160> and<00:00:22.400> all<00:00:23.150> of<00:00:23.300> the

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
then a Christmas tree and all of the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.599 
then a Christmas tree and all of the
templates<00:00:23.839> are<00:00:24.109> available<00:00:24.140> on<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.890> on<00:00:25.490> the

templates are available on the on the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:30.249 
templates are available on the on the
website<00:00:26.029> now<00:00:26.919> I've<00:00:27.919> made<00:00:28.609> at<00:00:29.060> the<00:00:29.330> moment<00:00:29.720> five

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:30.259 
website now I've made at the moment five

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.740 
website now I've made at the moment five
and<00:00:30.679> I've<00:00:31.249> threaded<00:00:31.789> them<00:00:32.029> together<00:00:32.240> with

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
and I've threaded them together with

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.360 
and I've threaded them together with
some<00:00:33.590> ribbon<00:00:34.340> a<00:00:34.730> quarter<00:00:35.180> inch<00:00:35.329> ribbon<00:00:35.720> and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
some ribbon a quarter inch ribbon and

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.310 
some ribbon a quarter inch ribbon and
it's<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:37.910> simple<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.420> make<00:00:38.450> and<00:00:38.810> so<00:00:38.960> quick

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
it's so so simple to make and so quick

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.700 
it's so so simple to make and so quick
I've<00:00:39.920> cut<00:00:40.250> a<00:00:40.280> strip<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.120> a<00:00:41.420> light<00:00:42.260> colored

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
I've cut a strip of a light colored

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.680 
I've cut a strip of a light colored
background<00:00:43.129> fabric<00:00:43.370> which<00:00:43.879> is<00:00:43.910> eight<00:00:44.390> inches

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
background fabric which is eight inches

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.849 
background fabric which is eight inches
wide<00:00:45.550> but<00:00:46.550> by<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.820> width<00:00:47.390> of<00:00:47.539> the<00:00:47.719> fabric<00:00:47.989> now

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
wide but by the width of the fabric now

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.670 
wide but by the width of the fabric now
I'm<00:00:49.160> marking<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.059> out<00:00:50.239> at<00:00:50.480> 60<00:00:50.930> degree<00:00:51.230> angles

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
I'm marking it out at 60 degree angles

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.849 
I'm marking it out at 60 degree angles
to<00:00:51.920> make<00:00:51.949> triangles<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.379> if<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:54.500> see<00:00:54.649> along

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
to make triangles and if you see along

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.250 
to make triangles and if you see along
here<00:00:54.920> I've<00:00:55.370> got<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.730> 60<00:00:56.300> degree<00:00:56.420> line<00:00:56.870> there

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
here I've got the 60 degree line there

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.110 
here I've got the 60 degree line there
which<00:00:57.859> is<00:00:58.010> running<00:00:58.219> along<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.640> bottom<00:00:58.820> of<00:00:59.059> the

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
which is running along the bottom of the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.990 
which is running along the bottom of the
fabric<00:00:59.600> so<00:01:00.199> now<00:01:00.379> I<00:01:00.410> can<00:01:00.800> mark<00:01:01.010> up<00:01:01.280> that<00:01:01.399> line

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
fabric so now I can mark up that line

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.439 
fabric so now I can mark up that line
there<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.769> then<00:01:03.769> I'll<00:01:04.550> be<00:01:04.760> able<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:04.970> cut<00:01:05.180> along

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
there and then I'll be able to cut along

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.100 
there and then I'll be able to cut along
that<00:01:05.510> line<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.980> get<00:01:07.190> the<00:01:07.750> line<00:01:08.750> in<00:01:08.780> the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
that line and to get the line in the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.280 
that line and to get the line in the
other<00:01:09.260> direction<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:10.360> move<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.660> ruler<00:01:11.870> like

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
other direction I move the ruler like

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.310 
other direction I move the ruler like
that<00:01:12.790> until<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:13.820> get<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.300> other<00:01:14.450> 60<00:01:15.020> degree

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
that until I get the other 60 degree

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.670 
that until I get the other 60 degree
line<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.560> that's<00:01:15.950> 60<00:01:16.460> there<00:01:17.290> line<00:01:18.290> that<00:01:18.650> up

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
line and that's 60 there line that up

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.030 
line and that's 60 there line that up
with<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.190> bottom<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:20.590> fabric<00:01:21.590> like<00:01:21.800> that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
with the bottom of the fabric like that

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.090 
with the bottom of the fabric like that
and<00:01:22.310> that<00:01:22.760> gives<00:01:23.000> me<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.620> line<00:01:24.620> in<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.980> other

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
and that gives me the line in the other

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.610 
and that gives me the line in the other
direction<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.910> now<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.480> can<00:01:26.840> go<00:01:26.990> ahead<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.410> cut

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
direction so now I can go ahead and cut

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.040 
direction so now I can go ahead and cut
all<00:01:27.860> these<00:01:27.980> triangles<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.910> they<00:01:29.540> will<00:01:29.780> form

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.050 
all these triangles and they will form

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.890 
all these triangles and they will form
the<00:01:30.200> basis<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.680> my<00:01:30.860> bunting<00:01:31.480> now<00:01:32.480> I've<00:01:32.660> cut

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
the basis of my bunting now I've cut

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.960 
the basis of my bunting now I've cut
along<00:01:33.080> those<00:01:33.320> marked<00:01:33.740> lines<00:01:33.980> and<00:01:34.430> this<00:01:34.730> will

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
along those marked lines and this will

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.330 
along those marked lines and this will
give<00:01:35.150> me<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:35.630> pair<00:01:36.320> of<00:01:36.440> triangles<00:01:36.940> for<00:01:37.940> each<00:01:38.060> cut

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
give me a pair of triangles for each cut

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.130 
give me a pair of triangles for each cut
in<00:01:40.340> order<00:01:40.550> to<00:01:40.700> stop<00:01:40.970> preying<00:01:41.300> on<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.690> bunting

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
in order to stop preying on the bunting

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.830 
in order to stop preying on the bunting
I've<00:01:42.410> tried<00:01:43.250> two<00:01:43.520> different<00:01:43.970> methods<00:01:44.390> on<00:01:44.600> this

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
I've tried two different methods on this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.920 
I've tried two different methods on this
side<00:01:45.140> I've<00:01:45.470> zigzag<00:01:46.100> around<00:01:46.370> the<00:01:46.760> edges<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.270> on

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
side I've zigzag around the edges and on

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.440 
side I've zigzag around the edges and on
this<00:01:48.110> side<00:01:48.290> I<00:01:48.320> turned<00:01:48.710> under<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.430> small<00:01:49.880> hem<00:01:50.180> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
this side I turned under a small hem and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.720 
this side I turned under a small hem and
just<00:01:50.750> straight<00:01:51.050> stitched<00:01:51.410> along<00:01:51.650> there<00:01:52.010> I

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:52.730 
just straight stitched along there I

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.750 
just straight stitched along there I
think<00:01:53.360> on<00:01:53.540> balance<00:01:53.690> I'd<00:01:54.140> prefer<00:01:54.350> this<00:01:54.740> one<00:01:55.040> but

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
think on balance I'd prefer this one but

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.050 
think on balance I'd prefer this one but
either<00:01:56.750> one<00:01:57.050> will<00:01:57.290> be<00:01:57.440> okay<00:01:58.400> depending<00:01:58.610> on<00:01:58.940> the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
either one will be okay depending on the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.870 
either one will be okay depending on the
kind<00:01:59.270> of<00:01:59.330> look<00:01:59.540> that<00:01:59.690> you<00:01:59.750> want

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
kind of look that you want

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.760 
kind of look that you want
I've<00:02:01.880> used<00:02:02.180> up<00:02:02.420> scraps<00:02:02.810> both<00:02:03.110> of<00:02:03.350> Christmas

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
I've used up scraps both of Christmas

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.630 
I've used up scraps both of Christmas
fabric<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.430> of<00:02:05.440> interfacing<00:02:06.440> so<00:02:06.980> I've<00:02:07.340> cut

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
fabric and of interfacing so I've cut

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.180 
fabric and of interfacing so I've cut
out<00:02:07.670> in<00:02:08.119> paper<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.959> template<00:02:09.800> so<00:02:10.069> that

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
out in paper all the template so that

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.010 
out in paper all the template so that
I've<00:02:10.280> got<00:02:10.310> a<00:02:10.459> Christmas<00:02:10.670> tree<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.360> bell<00:02:11.660> a

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
I've got a Christmas tree a bell a

stocking two holly leaves and a star

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.200 
stocking two holly leaves and a star
I've<00:02:16.390> pinned<00:02:16.690> them<00:02:16.900> onto<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:18.070> big<00:02:18.700> enough<00:02:18.910> scrap

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
I've pinned them onto a big enough scrap

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.170 
I've pinned them onto a big enough scrap
of<00:02:19.390> fabric<00:02:19.570> with<00:02:20.280> lining<00:02:21.280> on<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.670> back<00:02:21.700> there

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
of fabric with lining on the back there

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
of fabric with lining on the back there
which<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:22.600> going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.900> iron<00:02:23.080> on<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.700> you'll

which I'm going to iron on to it you'll

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.150 
which I'm going to iron on to it you'll
notice<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.300> over<00:02:25.600> here<00:02:25.780> on<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:26.080> bell<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.560> just

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
notice that over here on the bell I just

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.530 
notice that over here on the bell I just
happened<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.520> have<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.790> couple<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.360> holly

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
happened to have a couple of holly

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.840 
happened to have a couple of holly
berries<00:02:28.930> at<00:02:29.110> the<00:02:29.230> top<00:02:29.470> there<00:02:29.740> so<00:02:30.310> I<00:02:30.340> may<00:02:30.640> well

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
berries at the top there so I may well

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.460 
berries at the top there so I may well
use<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.150> I'll<00:02:31.690> come<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.110> top<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.410> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
use that I'll come to the top of the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.080 
use that I'll come to the top of the
bell<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:32.650> then<00:02:32.920> I'll<00:02:33.040> cut<00:02:33.280> around<00:02:33.460> there<00:02:33.940> as

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
bell and then I'll cut around there as

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.690 
bell and then I'll cut around there as
well<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.480> take<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.870> those<00:02:35.020> berries<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:36.550> then

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
well to take in those berries and then

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.000 
well to take in those berries and then
come<00:02:36.910> back<00:02:36.940> down<00:02:37.090> again<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.200> now<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.830> to

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
come back down again so now I'm going to

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.400 
come back down again so now I'm going to
press<00:02:39.820> these<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.720> interfacing<00:02:41.290> is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
press these so that the interfacing is

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.380 
press these so that the interfacing is
stuck<00:02:41.680> onto<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.070> fabric<00:02:42.460> and<00:02:42.610> then<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.240> will

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
stuck onto the fabric and then I will

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.590 
stuck onto the fabric and then I will
cut<00:02:43.600> round<00:02:43.840> all<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.080> shapes<00:02:45.270> before<00:02:46.270> you

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
cut round all the shapes before you

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.040 
cut round all the shapes before you
throw<00:02:46.810> these<00:02:47.080> shapes<00:02:47.410> onto<00:02:47.740> these<00:02:47.980> bunting

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
throw these shapes onto these bunting

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.750 
throw these shapes onto these bunting
triangles<00:02:50.050> you<00:02:50.500> need<00:02:50.680> to<00:02:50.800> turn<00:02:50.980> under<00:02:51.220> hem<00:02:51.580> on

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
triangles you need to turn under hem on

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.970 
triangles you need to turn under hem on
the<00:02:51.910> top<00:02:52.180> it's<00:02:52.810> about<00:02:52.990> half<00:02:53.290> an<00:02:53.440> inch<00:02:53.560> there

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980

go into the tube if necessary you can

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.840 
go into the tube if necessary you can
either<00:03:16.680> turn<00:03:17.680> them<00:03:17.890> slightly<00:03:18.190> to<00:03:18.490> make<00:03:18.520> sure

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
either turn them slightly to make sure

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.690 
either turn them slightly to make sure
they<00:03:19.060> fit<00:03:19.330> or<00:03:19.720> trim<00:03:20.140> them<00:03:20.350> if<00:03:20.500> needs<00:03:20.800> be<00:03:20.980> just

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.610 
right hand side and then you can swivel
the<00:04:12.100> shape<00:04:13.100> around<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.110> start<00:04:15.110> again<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.500> go

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
the shape around and start again to go

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.520 
the shape around and start again to go
down<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.640> next<00:04:17.000> side<00:04:17.180> of<00:04:17.360> that<00:04:17.540> spike<00:04:18.230> of<00:04:18.410> the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
down the next side of that spike of the

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:27.340 
down the next side of that spike of the
star<00:04:24.340> now<00:04:25.340> I've<00:04:25.640> ended<00:04:25.910> up<00:04:26.060> here<00:04:26.300> at<00:04:26.480> the<00:04:26.660> it's

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
star now I've ended up here at the it's

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.380 
star now I've ended up here at the it's
what<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.770> call<00:04:27.980> an<00:04:28.160> internal<00:04:28.670> core<00:04:28.880> it's<00:04:29.180> where

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
what I call an internal core it's where

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
what I call an internal core it's where
the<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:31.360> spike<00:04:32.360> comes<00:04:32.630> down<00:04:32.840> before<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.290> goes

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
the the spike comes down before it goes

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.380 
the the spike comes down before it goes
out<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:33.800> another<00:04:33.950> spike<00:04:34.310> and<00:04:34.640> I've<00:04:35.000> got<00:04:35.180> the

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
out to another spike and I've got the

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.000 
out to another spike and I've got the
needle<00:04:35.930> at<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.080> moment<00:04:36.380> on<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.590> right<00:04:36.740> hand

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
needle at the moment on the right hand

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.160 
needle at the moment on the right hand
side<00:04:37.100> but<00:04:37.880> for<00:04:38.060> these<00:04:38.180> corners<00:04:38.630> I<00:04:38.750> want<00:04:38.960> it<00:04:39.050> on

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
side but for these corners I want it on

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.380 
side but for these corners I want it on
the<00:04:39.290> left<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:40.040> I'm<00:04:40.130> going<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.340> lift<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.640> up<00:04:40.820> and

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
the left so I'm going to lift it up and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.510 
the left so I'm going to lift it up and
bring<00:04:41.540> it<00:04:41.570> down<00:04:41.660> again<00:04:42.050> on<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.230> left<00:04:42.560> then<00:04:43.280> I

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
bring it down again on the left then I

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.300 
bring it down again on the left then I
can<00:04:43.850> turn<00:04:44.120> this<00:04:44.450> and<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:45.260> can<00:04:45.650> go<00:04:45.800> up<00:04:45.950> the<00:04:46.100> next

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
can turn this and I can go up the next

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.260 
can turn this and I can go up the next
spike

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.490 

and<00:04:53.270> basically<00:04:53.690> that's<00:04:53.900> how<00:04:54.080> I've<00:04:54.290> gotten

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
and basically that's how I've gotten

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.440 
and basically that's how I've gotten
Roger<00:04:54.710> all<00:04:55.040> of<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.340> shapes<00:04:55.580> just<00:04:56.150> putting

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
Roger all of the shapes just putting

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.480 
Roger all of the shapes just putting
them<00:04:56.570> on<00:04:56.660> like<00:04:56.870> that<00:04:57.080> I'm<00:04:57.980> going<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.310> use<00:04:58.370> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
them on like that I'm going to use a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.790 
them on like that I'm going to use a
thin<00:04:58.850> ribbon<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.570> string<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.350> bunching

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
thin ribbon to string the bunching

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.830 
thin ribbon to string the bunching
together<00:05:00.950> so<00:05:01.820> what<00:05:02.240> I've<00:05:02.389> done<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.570> I've

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
together so what I've done is I've

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.090 
together so what I've done is I've
threaded<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:04.040> end<00:05:04.280> onto<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:05.330> small<00:05:06.100> quilting

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
threaded the end onto a small quilting

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.300 
threaded the end onto a small quilting
pin<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:08.030> now<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:08.450> can<00:05:08.900> just<00:05:09.139> feed<00:05:09.770> that<00:05:10.040> in

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
pin and now I can just feed that in

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.570 
pin and now I can just feed that in
through<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.930> tube<00:05:12.200> there<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.860> then<00:05:13.460> I'll

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
through the the tube there and then I'll

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.310 
through the the tube there and then I'll
pull<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:14.060> push<00:05:14.330> out<00:05:14.540> and<00:05:14.690> pull<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.900> right<00:05:15.139> the

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
pull a push out and pull it right the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440 
pull a push out and pull it right the
way<00:05:15.350> across<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:16.040> as<00:05:16.460> I'll<00:05:16.610> end<00:05:16.820> up<00:05:16.970> with<00:05:17.210> the

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
way across so as I'll end up with the

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.320 
way across so as I'll end up with the
each<00:05:18.110> bunting<00:05:18.620> triangle<00:05:19.100> actually<00:05:19.520> hanging

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
each bunting triangle actually hanging

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.230 
each bunting triangle actually hanging
from<00:05:20.570> the<00:05:20.840> ribbon
