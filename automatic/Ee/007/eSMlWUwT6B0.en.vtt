this<00:00:25.849> color<00:00:26.849> or<00:00:27.210> bleach<00:00:27.570> I'm<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.960> really<00:00:28.109> sure

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380

what<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.130> think<00:00:30.000> it<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.590> blue

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
what it is I think it is like a blue

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.630 
what it is I think it is like a blue
color<00:00:32.279> bleach<00:00:32.669> mix<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.899> it<00:00:34.290> doesn't<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:35.100> that

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
color bleach mix but it doesn't say that

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.790 
color bleach mix but it doesn't say that
it<00:00:35.940> reaches<00:00:36.570> your<00:00:36.719> hair<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.140> just<00:00:37.350> says<00:00:37.559> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it reaches your hair it just says that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.049 
it reaches your hair it just says that
it<00:00:39.590> lightens<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.579> not<00:00:41.730> really<00:00:41.940> sure

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
it lightens it so I'm not really sure

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.819 
it lightens it so I'm not really sure
how<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.510> gonna<00:00:42.629> work<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.379> just<00:00:43.620> want<00:00:43.800> to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.970 
go a little bit lighter and you can see
it<00:00:47.219> doesn't<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.270> make<00:00:48.539> up<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.780> difference<00:00:49.289> it's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980
