00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello my name is julia sluggish in 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.960
 St. Petersburg School of Television I 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.519
 I teach oratory courses 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.769
 very often novice speakers 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.780
 face the problem of gestures and 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.220
 body position even exist quite 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.470
 specific wording 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.930
 I don't know where to put my hands, of course 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.359
 There are some canons and rules 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.880
 that will help you shape your 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.340
 stage oratorical behavior 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.000
 behavior but the first thing you should 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.710
 to find out 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 in any case do not take 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.059
 gestures as a separate element 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.520
 your speech gesticulation is 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.469
 expressive means and she helps 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.870
 you carry rubbish to attach some 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.760
 emotional state but as soon as you 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.660
 You begin to think only about your body and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.640
 arms and legs and posture maybe we 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.530
 immediately forget about the main thing you forget 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.190
 appreciate your performance and this 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 is unacceptable 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.980
 remember your daily conversations with 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.809
 parents with friends, with family you do 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 don't worry about your gestures you 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.119
 speak and your gestures your whole body 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.470
 just help you communicate the same 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.409
 the most should happen during 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 performances so while you think about 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 that you tell your body to you 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.369
 helps you look great 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.759
 naturally and organically but as soon as you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.650
 start thinking about how you speak 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.570
 your body can hardly be free 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.049
 you'll get hung up on hands 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.020
 legs and other small things but not 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.640
 less there are some taboos 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.500
 there are some body positions 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.070
 which really should be avoided 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.850
 so the first taboo is the so-called posture 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.440
 prisoner that she imagines hands 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.810
 behind the back 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.180
 so you do the whole show 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 Of course this is unacceptable because 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 the viewer has the feeling that you are something 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.140
 hiding there is the first thing 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 the main thing which is for some reason very often we 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
 see on stage probably this school is with us 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 there is this habit of folding your arms 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.920
 Danish second taboo 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.840
 it's late napoleon well we all heard 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.940
 about closed poses so here 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.190
 no comment if you close 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.730
 yourself from the viewer then he probably too 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.950
 soon closes from you 3 forget it 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.350
 age is very funny name pose 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.750
 football player your hands are just below 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.210
 belts and you, too, are closing on the viewer 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.190
 as you already understood it is unacceptable 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.810
 try to always show respect to 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.390
 the viewer is not only his speech but also 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.610
 with their movements with their plastic and so 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.650
 these are the three main postures that follow 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.720
 avoid your speeches but of course 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.940
 there are some recommendations 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.770
 as to how 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.020
 be on stage like 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.540
 gesturing what poses to use 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.680
 about these rules I will gladly give you 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.680
 I'll tell you in my classes
