00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
of the way of what they're going to go

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.710 
of the way of what they're going to go
through<00:03:40.310> just<00:03:40.819> not<00:03:40.940> on<00:03:40.970> the<00:03:41.150> field<00:03:41.450> but<00:03:41.569> off

through just not on the field but off

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.809 
through just not on the field but off
the<00:03:41.750> field<00:03:41.870> so<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.290> think<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:43.129> senator<00:03:43.370> will

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
the field so I think the senator will

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.369

come<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.090> because<00:03:44.390> I've<00:03:44.540> lived<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:45.049> but<00:03:45.349> i

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
think the conviction will come from the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.409 
think the conviction will come from the
fact<00:03:47.180> that<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.629> mean<00:03:47.840> I<00:03:47.989> am<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.799> am<00:03:49.209> what<00:03:50.209> they
