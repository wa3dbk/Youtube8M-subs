00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
light there was when you use video light

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
light there was when you use video light
or<00:00:46.020> any<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.469> type<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.800> continuous<00:00:47.579> light<00:00:48.170> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.340 
or any other type of continuous light it
gives<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.559> very<00:00:49.770> harsh<00:00:50.100> look<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.480> that's

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
gives a very harsh look and so that's

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.160 
gives a very harsh look and so that's
what<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.739> looks<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.100> here<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.960> is

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
it looks like this has been the standard

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.070 
it looks like this has been the standard
for<00:01:00.390> years<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.649> videographers<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.300> so

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
for years for videographers and so

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
for years for videographers and so
you'll<00:01:04.530> notice<00:01:04.619> here<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.159> even<00:01:05.700> when<00:01:05.850> i<00:01:05.880> move

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
you'll notice here is even when i move

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.149 
you'll notice here is even when i move
it<00:01:06.330> around<00:01:06.450> I'm<00:01:06.990> getting<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.130> harsh<00:01:10.159> light

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
it around I'm getting a very harsh light
quality<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.450> simply<00:01:12.869> because<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
quality and that's simply because of the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.679 
quality and that's simply because of the
way<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> light<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.970> designed<00:01:15.450> it's

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
way that the light is designed it's

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.350 
way that the light is designed it's
basically<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.470> flat<00:01:16.799> panel<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:17.970> reason

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
basically a flat panel now the reason

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.840 
basically a flat panel now the reason
why<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.689> were<00:01:18.960> very<00:01:19.640> important<00:01:20.640> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
why these were very important and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.289 
why these were very important and
popular<00:01:21.619> was<00:01:22.619> because<00:01:22.650> they<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.759> what's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
popular was because they have what's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
popular was because they have what's
called<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.570> continuous<00:01:25.170> light<00:01:25.409> spectrum<00:01:25.920> where

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
called a continuous light spectrum where

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.039 
called a continuous light spectrum where
there's<00:01:26.400> no<00:01:26.700> drop-off<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.479> any<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> light

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
there's no drop-off in any of the light

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
there's no drop-off in any of the light
colors<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.189> when<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> match<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.119> nice

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
colors so when you go to match a nice

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.510 
colors so when you go to match a nice
flesh<00:01:30.630> tone<00:01:30.869> later<00:01:31.079> you'll<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.380> able<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.920> let's

that's<00:02:36.830> nice<00:02:36.980> about<00:02:37.040> continuous<00:02:37.850> light<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.390> can

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
that's nice about continuous light I can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.830 
that's nice about continuous light I can
create<00:02:39.170> a<00:02:39.230> ratio<00:02:39.650> here<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.220> can<00:02:40.400> go<00:02:40.550> above<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:41.300> can

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
create a ratio here I can go above I can

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.950 
create a ratio here I can go above I can
go<00:02:42.230> below<00:02:42.680> I<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.730> flatter<00:02:44.030> closer<00:02:44.600> toward

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
go below I can go flatter closer toward

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.310 
go below I can go flatter closer toward
the<00:02:45.110> lens<00:02:45.320> if<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.620> wanted<00:02:45.920> to<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:48.020> can<00:02:48.170> just

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
the lens if I wanted to and I can just

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.140 
the lens if I wanted to and I can just
kind<00:02:48.440> of<00:02:48.530> experiment<00:02:49.100> with<00:02:49.190> that<00:02:49.340> with<00:02:49.850> flash

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
kind of experiment with that with flash

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.490 
kind of experiment with that with flash

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
you would have to wind up just

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.890 
you would have to wind up just
experimenting<00:02:52.100> over<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.490> over<00:02:52.760> pretty<00:02:53.600> let
