00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
isolated the issue so what's the issue

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.150 
isolated the issue so what's the issue
say<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.550> issue<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.149> depot<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.710> issue<00:01:01.890> is

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
say the issue is not depot the issue is

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.009 
say the issue is not depot the issue is
the<00:01:02.309> resveratrol<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.120> transverse<00:01:03.570> virtual

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the resveratrol the transverse virtual

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.010 
the resveratrol the transverse virtual
and<00:01:04.199> recycle<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.129> they<00:01:05.580> put<00:01:05.850> fifty<00:01:06.330> percent<00:01:06.720> i

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and recycle and they put fifty percent i

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.260 
and recycle and they put fifty percent i
I've<00:01:07.770> been<00:01:08.130> taken<00:01:08.580> for<00:01:08.850> many<00:01:09.030> years

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I've been taken for many years

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.330 
I've been taken for many years
ninety-eight<00:01:09.960> percent<00:01:10.170> transverse<00:01:10.860> virtual

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
ninety-eight percent transverse virtual

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.000 
ninety-eight percent transverse virtual
and<00:01:11.610> then<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.570> come<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.960> find<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.350> company<00:01:13.890> is<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and then I come to find out company is a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
and then I come to find out company is a
good<00:01:14.159> fifty<00:01:14.549> percent<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.060> 60<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> know

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
good fifty percent of 60 and you know

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.810 
good fifty percent of 60 and you know
there's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.140> whole<00:01:16.380> spectrum<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.070> I<00:01:17.280> did<00:01:17.670> my

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
there's a whole spectrum so I did my

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
there's a whole spectrum so I did my
research<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.450> find<00:01:18.630> out<00:01:18.840> they<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.680> cut

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
research to find out they do that to cut

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.760 
research to find out they do that to cut
the<00:01:20.009> cost<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> downside<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the cost now the downside to that is

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.539 
the cost now the downside to that is
that<00:01:23.670> now<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.600> filler<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.680> imodium<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.520> I

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that now the filler is imodium what I

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.310 
that now the filler is imodium what I
did<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> search<00:01:27.299> for<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.900> makes<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
did a search for that that makes you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.170 
did a search for that that makes you
tend<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.650> want<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> restroom<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
tend to want to go to the restroom so

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.010 
tend to want to go to the restroom so
every<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.020> use<00:01:31.380> recycle<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.540> end<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.659> having

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
every time I use recycle I end up having

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.640 
every time I use recycle I end up having
to<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> restroom<00:01:36.200> with<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.470> him

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to go to the restroom with the with him

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
to go to the restroom with the with him
like<00:01:37.979> after<00:01:38.159> i<00:01:38.340> work<00:01:38.610> out<00:01:38.790> an<00:01:38.939> example<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
like after i work out an example so

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.109 
like after i work out an example so
today<00:01:39.750> i<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:39.990> got<00:01:40.140> done<00:01:40.170> work<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.680> out<00:01:40.799> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
today i just got done work it out and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.480 
today i just got done work it out and
already<00:01:42.119> three<00:01:42.869> times<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> positive

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
already three times but on a positive

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.429 
already three times but on a positive
note<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.479> very<00:01:45.600> minor<00:01:45.990> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.290> can

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
note so that's very minor if you can

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.550 
note so that's very minor if you can
handle<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:47.180> great<00:01:48.180> but<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:48.960> positive<00:01:49.140> note

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
handle that great but on a positive note

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
handle that great but on a positive note
i'm<00:01:50.070> getting<00:01:50.399> great<00:01:50.729> pumps<00:01:51.119> from<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
i'm getting great pumps from the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.870 
i'm getting great pumps from the
nitrates<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> depot<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:53.340> with

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
nitrates from the depot and then with

nitrates from the depot and then with
the<00:01:53.970> recycle<00:01:54.540> I'm<00:01:54.600> hoping<00:01:54.960> my<00:01:55.470> hormonal

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
the recycle I'm hoping my hormonal

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.209 
the recycle I'm hoping my hormonal
production<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> very<00:01:57.659> regulated<00:01:58.439> based<00:01:59.009> on

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
production is a very regulated based on

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.100 
production is a very regulated based on
this<00:01:59.399> so<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.640> doesn't<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.149> drop<00:02:00.899> by

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this so it doesn't a drop by

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
this so it doesn't a drop by

because it has a rowboat inhibitor in
