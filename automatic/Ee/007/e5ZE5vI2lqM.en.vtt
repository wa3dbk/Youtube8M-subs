00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
of Robin in the movie possibly or you

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.510 
of Robin in the movie possibly or you
know<00:01:27.810> maybe<00:01:27.990> it's<00:01:28.170> just<00:01:28.229> an<00:01:28.409> easter<00:01:28.740> egg<00:01:28.770> for

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
know maybe it's just an easter egg for

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.219 
know maybe it's just an easter egg for
the<00:01:29.820> standalone<00:01:30.119> Batman<00:01:30.600> movie<00:01:30.840> very<00:01:31.079> well

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the standalone Batman movie very well

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109 
the standalone Batman movie very well
could<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.790> thought<00:01:33.000> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
could be that as well but I thought that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.580 
could be that as well but I thought that
was<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.420> cool<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.560> know

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
was pretty cool that they you know

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.289 
was pretty cool that they you know
obviously<00:01:35.040> when<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.310> put<00:01:35.610> stuff<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.090> this

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
obviously when they put stuff like this

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
obviously when they put stuff like this
in<00:01:36.509> there<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.960> an<00:01:37.170> easter<00:01:37.439> egg<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.799> know
