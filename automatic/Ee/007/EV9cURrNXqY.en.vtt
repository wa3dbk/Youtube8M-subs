 of adata% and it will open you all 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.579
 small for as much whenever you 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.319
 install a program 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.569
 well, the documents that have been installed 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.920
 Well they are in there and there 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.049
 one that is for minecraft so there one 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 wants to install the modes so for you 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.380
 can you see it will look like that and 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 there are several things so we're going 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.660
 start by installing fashion the smell that 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.769
 is the most important 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.819
 you opened up then you see 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:31.170
 minecraft snow drifts you are going to open it 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:32.160
 like that so weaver has you going to have 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.110
 it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.670
 this little window with lots of 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.370
 documents so as you can see there 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.510
 has a lot and if you say li t1 and 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.670
 Well, it can make your spit 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.590
 minecraft and it's very important to not 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.299
 equality the only one you have the right 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.049
 militate Semeta in which blocks 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:53.069
 certain modes so volubility the 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:55.650
 bursts so it's now back 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:03:00.000
 another mode the smell you select 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.829
 all that is inside and he 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.840
 just drag it into your 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.180
 minecraft divers and click on ok 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.030
 and so that's where we installed the first 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 something called maul the smell 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:15.810
 now let's go to heroes brahim so 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.160
 a double click and you will see all 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.780
 these documents there is a way 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.579
 automatic to install it but I'm going 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.780
 not show you because sometimes 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.120
 does not work as it is 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.510
 with mine so you double click 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.239
 on into minecraft points var and all this 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.370
 that you see inside there you 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.829
 and will select the same as 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.849
 the smell put it in your skin 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.200
 minecraft and that's it of course it's not 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:44.450
 ended because otherwise it would be too much 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:48.599
 easy are you going so you go 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.560
 now open let's go back to our 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.159
 kraft problem 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:55.049
 so here and you'll take the into 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.850
 for minecraft so you'll see 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.440
 Braille resources and heroes 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.140
 you will also take them 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.810
 drag and there it will seem that so 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.090
 you do everything there is every time so 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.520
 there is only one 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.900
 and here we have installed hero 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.320
 brahim fashion 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.240
 so i'm going to run minecraft for you 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.240
 show how it works 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.490
 sorry for meinau wait time 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.780
 my computer is a bit slow so for 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:39.690
 open minecraft when there are modes 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:41.550
 it takes a little while so in our 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.710
 future video that we will create we 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.080
 let's do create a story that's 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.270
 the story of a style that arrives in a 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.910
 world and who sees a totem and who without 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.220
 to make it go on purpose and actually it goes 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.870
 trying to survive is everything and it's okay 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.280
 to be in fact a little let's day 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:59.010
 play 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.970
 after if our series works well and 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.290
 we have gems 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.510
 we may go on doing it 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.520
 a second with other modes like 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.510
 modes like and stories kraft I 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.320
 do not know if you know 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.950
 but it's a big fashion or little ones 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.950
 fashion like that 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.129
 sorry it's a feather 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.910
 2 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.949
 back to what was said my computer 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.419
 is not rotten but extremely slow 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.419
 and completely naze 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.979
 so if my videos will succeed I will 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.509
 maybe continue buying me a new 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.090
 ordi because there it is not possible 

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:55.139
 so that's the rest of the charge is so we 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:57.419
 will create a map normally here and we 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.070
 will put in creatives because the 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:00.509
 blocks that need to have to create the 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.870
 totem so what they are worth invoked 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:05.520
 are not rare but you have to create 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.889
 go to hell and all so I'm not going 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.090
 do it that's going to be too long so 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.500
 it's very simple actually 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.750
 to have a special block called 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:22.889
 wait I'm going out of there let's go 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:24.300
 on this little hill here we are 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.190
 let's go see the inventory you can 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:31.380
 see nothing changes 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:34.470
 on the other hand if you mark soul see 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.729
 you'll see this roundup so has like 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.539
 you can see it to take it there 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:38.849
 must go to hell 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:40.789
 and you have to take water and 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.320
 little trick like that and you will create 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:45.870
 this block there called the bragg hero 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.409
 totem you will take it 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.690
 and then you take two blocks of gold and 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:55.710
 between 1 and 1 other block is called the 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.419
 leader ac here is you take it you 

00:06:55.710 --> 00:07:02.610
 also take nested to turn on the 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:04.349
 totem so once you did that one 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.699
 will create one when you go 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:12.150
 see it's very easy you'll put 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:16.620
 two blocks of gold and then you go 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:18.960
 put the block of so milk robin 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.370
 so look there is a head there are some 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:23.300
 robin heads on all sides with 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.500
 white eyes then give you a 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.840
 crisp block of gold to whom you have 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.110
 builds the totem so of course so much 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.940
 that you do not light it like this 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.740
 is fine and robin milk from fo on 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.659
 will not happen before the purchase is turned on and 

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.220
 you can see there's marked you do not 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:40.229
 know what you did so you do not know what 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:42.090
 what you did and there are the eyes 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:43.280
 become red so from that 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.820
 day there 

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.240
 the robin will haunt you and rot you 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:51.680
 life 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:54.500
 and so that's how I wanted to already 

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.800
 said but I tell them if you want to see 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:08:02.200
 how does the mode work you look 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.200
 our future video thank you gold
