00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.080 

well<00:00:23.940> I<00:00:23.970> get<00:00:24.180> asked<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:25.020> the<00:00:25.080> time<00:00:25.580> what<00:00:26.580> not<00:00:26.850> i

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
well I get asked all the time what not i

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
well I get asked all the time what not i
use<00:00:27.450> to<00:00:27.720> join<00:00:28.020> my<00:00:28.950> braided<00:00:29.400> line<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.790> my

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
use to join my braided line to my

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.000 
use to join my braided line to my
fluorocarbon<00:00:30.570> leader<00:00:30.690> and<00:00:31.020> the<00:00:31.050> not<00:00:31.770> that<00:00:31.980> I

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.010 
fluorocarbon leader and the not that I

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.080 
fluorocarbon leader and the not that I
like<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.310> best<00:00:32.460> it's<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.360> modified<00:00:33.960> Albright

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:35.090 
like the best it's a modified Albright

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.210 
like the best it's a modified Albright
w/e<00:00:36.090> not<00:00:36.390> works<00:00:36.690> well<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> problem<00:00:37.830> there

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
w/e not works well but the problem there

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.000 
w/e not works well but the problem there
is<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.940> if<00:00:39.600> you've<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:40.020> lines<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.830> have

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
is that if you've got lines that have

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.130 
is that if you've got lines that have
dissimilar<00:00:41.520> diameters<00:00:42.360> for<00:00:42.629> example<00:00:43.020> I've

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
dissimilar diameters for example I've

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.710 
dissimilar diameters for example I've
got<00:00:43.320> 30<00:00:43.650> pound<00:00:43.950> braid<00:00:44.190> on<00:00:44.489> here<00:00:44.790> which<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
got 30 pound braid on here which is the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.690 
got 30 pound braid on here which is the
same<00:00:45.930> line<00:00:46.230> diameter<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.460> equivalent

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
same line diameter to be the equivalent

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.210 
same line diameter to be the equivalent
of<00:00:48.059> an<00:00:48.210> eight<00:00:48.330> pound<00:00:48.540> mono<00:00:48.930> yet<00:00:49.620> we're<00:00:49.770> using<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
of an eight pound mono yet we're using a

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.880 
of an eight pound mono yet we're using a
30-pound<00:00:50.820> 40<00:00:51.120> litre<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> problem<00:00:52.590> becomes

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
30-pound 40 litre so the problem becomes

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.600 
30-pound 40 litre so the problem becomes
with<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.790> double<00:00:54.150> uni<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:55.290> it's<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.430> knots

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
with the double uni that it's the knots

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.790 
with the double uni that it's the knots
got<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.820> big<00:00:57.030> profile<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> going<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.769> out

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
got a big profile and going in and out

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.799 
got a big profile and going in and out
of<00:00:58.860> the<00:00:59.010> guides<00:00:59.250> all<00:00:59.610> day<00:00:59.940> long<00:01:00.180> casts<00:01:00.690> and

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
of the guides all day long casts and

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.020 
of the guides all day long casts and
lures<00:01:01.080> can<00:01:01.769> create<00:01:02.100> some<00:01:02.309> friction<00:01:02.339> there<00:01:02.879> and

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
lures can create some friction there and

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.060 
lures can create some friction there and
then<00:01:03.150> not<00:01:03.269> eventually<00:01:03.750> fails<00:01:04.019> so<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.040> to

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
then not eventually fails so I like to

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.830 
then not eventually fails so I like to
modify<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.640> all<00:01:05.850> brightest<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> much<00:01:06.510> smaller

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
modify it all brightest a much smaller

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.080 
modify it all brightest a much smaller
profile<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.400> reel<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> right<00:01:08.940> up

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
profile you you can reel it right up

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
profile you you can reel it right up
through<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.390> guides<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:09.900> no<00:01:10.110> issues<00:01:10.470> at<00:01:10.500> all

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
through the guides with no issues at all

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.070 
through the guides with no issues at all
and<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.940> I<00:01:12.180> start<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:12.630> making<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
and what I do is I start by making a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.670 
and what I do is I start by making a
loop<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.530> with<00:01:13.650> my<00:01:13.800> fluorocarbon<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.440> I<00:01:16.440> run

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
loop here with my fluorocarbon and I run

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
loop here with my fluorocarbon and I run
the<00:01:16.799> braid<00:01:17.040> through<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.490> loop<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.970> I'll<00:01:18.240> pull

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the braid through the loop and I'll pull

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.870 
the braid through the loop and I'll pull
I<00:01:18.810> don't<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.229> five<00:01:19.590> or<00:01:19.620> six<00:01:19.979> inches<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
I don't know five or six inches the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.969 
I don't know five or six inches the
trick<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.360> hold<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:22.020> three<00:01:22.290> pieces<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
trick is to hold all three pieces the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
trick is to hold all three pieces the
two<00:01:23.130> fluorocarbon<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.150> braid<00:01:24.420> between

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
two fluorocarbon in the braid between

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080 
two fluorocarbon in the braid between
your<00:01:25.320> thumb<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.560> forefinger<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.940> get

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
your thumb and forefinger and you get

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.490 
your thumb and forefinger and you get
that<00:01:27.240> pinched<00:01:27.719> and<00:01:27.840> now<00:01:27.960> I'm<00:01:28.079> going<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.320> take

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
that pinched and now I'm going to take

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.050 
that pinched and now I'm going to take
that<00:01:28.560> braided<00:01:29.189> line<00:01:29.399> I'm<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.820> go<00:01:29.939> around

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
that braided line I'm going to go around

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.649 
that braided line I'm going to go around
both<00:01:30.539> pieces<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.850> fluorocarbon<00:01:32.850> seven<00:01:33.420> times

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
both pieces a fluorocarbon seven times

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.450 
both pieces a fluorocarbon seven times
there's<00:01:34.079> three<00:01:34.969> four<00:01:36.439> five<00:01:38.329> six<00:01:39.329> seven<00:01:40.430> with<00:01:41.430> a

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
there's three four five six seven with a

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.490 
there's three four five six seven with a
little<00:01:41.640> practice<00:01:41.909> you'll<00:01:42.359> get<00:01:42.509> them<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> lay

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
little practice you'll get them to lay

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130 
little practice you'll get them to lay
nice<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.799> neat<00:01:44.219> up<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.479> leader<00:01:45.719> now<00:01:45.960> that

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
nice and neat up that leader now that

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
nice and neat up that leader now that
we've<00:01:46.259> gone<00:01:46.500> seven<00:01:47.070> when<00:01:47.430> i<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> seven

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
we've gone seven when i get to seven

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.630 
we've gone seven when i get to seven
going<00:01:48.689> away<00:01:49.020> from<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.189> loop<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.579> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
going away from the the loop and the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.789 
going away from the the loop and the
fluorocarbon<00:01:51.119> i<00:01:51.450> switch<00:01:52.049> hands<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.590> grab

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
fluorocarbon i switch hands and I grab

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.099 
fluorocarbon i switch hands and I grab
all<00:01:53.070> three<00:01:53.340> in<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.880> other<00:01:54.030> hand<00:01:54.359> I'm<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
all three in the other hand I'm going to

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.380 
all three in the other hand I'm going to
take<00:01:55.289> that<00:01:55.500> tag<00:01:55.829> end<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.789> braid<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.270> we're

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
take that tag end of the braid and we're

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
take that tag end of the braid and we're
going<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.719> seven<00:01:58.140> times<00:01:58.409> back<00:01:58.859> over<00:01:59.789> what

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
going to go seven times back over what

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.200 
going to go seven times back over what
we<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.299> did<00:02:00.570> there's<00:02:00.810> one<00:02:01.520> two<00:02:02.960> three<00:02:04.009> four

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
we just did there's one two three four

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.450 
we just did there's one two three four
five<00:02:06.740> six<00:02:07.740> and<00:02:08.130> on<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:08.670> seventh<00:02:09.179> one<00:02:10.310> when<00:02:11.310> our

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
five six and on the seventh one when our

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.840 
five six and on the seventh one when our
braid<00:02:11.790> came<00:02:12.180> through<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.810> loop<00:02:13.340> we<00:02:14.340> came<00:02:14.610> up

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
braid came through that loop we came up

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.020 
braid came through that loop we came up
with<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.540> this<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.380> so<00:02:17.070> it's<00:02:17.250> real<00:02:17.460> important

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
with it this way so it's real important

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.059 
with it this way so it's real important
now<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.210> when<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:18.900> back<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.530> go<00:02:19.710> back<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
now that when we go back we go back the

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.670 
now that when we go back we go back the
opposite<00:02:20.640> way<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:21.690> most<00:02:21.900> important<00:02:22.410> part<00:02:22.440> of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
opposite way the most important part of

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.410 
opposite way the most important part of
this<00:02:22.800> knot<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:23.850> take<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.180> tag

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
this knot is that when we take the tag

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.809 
this knot is that when we take the tag
end<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.840> go<00:02:25.020> back<00:02:25.380> the<00:02:25.650> opposite<00:02:26.160> direction<00:02:26.490> so

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
end we go back the opposite direction so

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.150 
end we go back the opposite direction so
the<00:02:27.420> tag<00:02:27.720> end<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.970> braided<00:02:30.420> line<00:02:31.160> pulse

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
the tag end of that braided line pulse

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.040 
the tag end of that braided line pulse
parallel<00:02:32.790> nice<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.080> neat

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
parallel nice and neat

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.200 
parallel nice and neat
and<00:02:35.530> you'll<00:02:35.920> know<00:02:36.100> you've<00:02:36.280> got<00:02:36.460> it<00:02:36.670> right<00:02:36.880> when

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
and you'll know you've got it right when

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.210 
and you'll know you've got it right when
you<00:02:37.330> can<00:02:37.480> take<00:02:37.690> both<00:02:37.960> pieces<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.620> braid<00:02:38.890> here

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
you can take both pieces of braid here

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.390 
you can take both pieces of braid here
at<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> end<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.500> shove<00:02:41.500> it<00:02:41.530> back<00:02:41.830> up<00:02:42.130> through

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
at the end and shove it back up through

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.100 
at the end and shove it back up through
that<00:02:42.550> loop<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:43.000> there<00:02:43.120> side<00:02:43.390> by<00:02:43.420> side<00:02:43.900> they're

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
that loop in there side by side they're

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.320 
that loop in there side by side they're
perfectly<00:02:44.500> parallel<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.150> just

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
perfectly parallel and then we just

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.030 
perfectly parallel and then we just
tighten<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.750> down<00:02:46.810> by<00:02:47.230> pulling<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.650> braid

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
tighten that down by pulling the braid

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.330 
tighten that down by pulling the braid
and<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:49.150> fluorocarbon<00:02:49.720> nice<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.530> gently<00:02:50.800> and

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and the fluorocarbon nice and gently and

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.030 
and the fluorocarbon nice and gently and
wet<00:02:51.580> it<00:02:51.730> up<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.120> that<00:02:53.050> last<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.590> bit<00:02:53.860> I<00:02:53.890> do

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
wet it up and that last little bit I do

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.610 
wet it up and that last little bit I do
is<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.490> grab<00:02:54.730> them<00:02:54.910> now<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.330> grab<00:02:55.840> the<00:02:56.050> tag<00:02:56.290> into

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
is I grab them now I grab the tag into

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.220 
is I grab them now I grab the tag into
the<00:02:56.710> fluorocarbon<00:02:57.310> in<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.700> teeth<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.960> pull

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
the fluorocarbon in my teeth and I pull

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.140 
the fluorocarbon in my teeth and I pull
all<00:02:59.470> three<00:02:59.800> at<00:02:59.920> the<00:02:59.950> same<00:03:00.040> time<00:03:00.520> but<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.850> don't

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
all three at the same time but I don't

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.110 
all three at the same time but I don't
pull<00:03:01.390> hard<00:03:01.720> but<00:03:02.320> watch<00:03:02.590> how<00:03:03.520> much<00:03:03.580> smaller

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
pull hard but watch how much smaller

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.660 
pull hard but watch how much smaller
this<00:03:04.420> not<00:03:04.720> goes<00:03:05.050> from<00:03:05.320> here<00:03:05.710> to<00:03:08.250> there<00:03:09.250> just<00:03:09.520> by

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
this not goes from here to there just by

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.390 
this not goes from here to there just by
pulling<00:03:09.970> gently<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.900> it<00:03:11.560> makes<00:03:11.740> a<00:03:11.860> very<00:03:12.070> nice

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
pulling gently and it makes a very nice

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.690 
pulling gently and it makes a very nice
compact<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.890> I<00:03:14.920> come<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:15.370> with<00:03:15.580> my

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
compact not that I come back with my

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.880 
compact not that I come back with my
flyers<00:03:16.030> and<00:03:16.990> trim<00:03:17.680> up<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.810> quick<00:03:20.080> easy<00:03:20.350> not<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
flyers and trim up so quick easy not to

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:32.420 
flyers and trim up so quick easy not to
do<00:03:22.650> turn<00:03:23.650> it<00:03:23.770> up<00:03:23.890> nice<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.130> tight

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.849 

that's<00:03:33.090> it<00:03:33.359> real<00:03:33.900> small<00:03:34.200> not<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.709> goes

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
that's it real small not that goes

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.939 
that's it real small not that goes
through<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.129> guides<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:35.670> well
