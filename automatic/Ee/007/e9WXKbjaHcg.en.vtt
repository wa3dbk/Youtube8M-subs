00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.810
 I present this simple robot 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.150
 built with the pieces of lego window 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.790
 first of all I'll show you what 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.270
 is what he does 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.220
 as you see something very simple move the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.220
 arms up and down 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.830
 the most interesting part of this model 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.160
 is the mechanics that it takes if you look at the 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.010
 movement is produced by these cams that 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.120
 we have here that we could 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.580
 change putting them in another way and 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.580
 we would get another different movement 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.359
 we can change them again now 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.350
 to make it move faster 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.350
 putting two cams 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.869
 the transmission of the movement is 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:14.490
 get in a very very very 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.490
 simple let's see it 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:26.240
 here we have the engine we have the wheels 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:29.180
 teeth that transmit the movement 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.930
 to the axis y of the axis to the cams and 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.780
 finally from the cams to the arm of the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.110
 monkey that is moving 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.400
 we control the engine by means of 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.400
 a usb cable 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.380
 that we can control with our 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:50.630
 Scratch programming environment in this 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.439
 case the programming that it takes is very 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.689
 very simple is limited to turn on and 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.689
 turn off the engine nothing more
