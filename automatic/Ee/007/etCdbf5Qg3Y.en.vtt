00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
think that's you know the case with a

lot<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.250> we<00:00:29.250> get<00:00:29.460> almost<00:00:30.179> greedy<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.929> the

lot of you we get almost greedy on the
high<00:00:31.260> forehand<00:00:31.830> volley<00:00:31.969> treating<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> like<00:00:33.239> an

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
high forehand volley treating it like an

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.569

we're looking to create you know similar
technique<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.270> would<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:10.080> a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
technique to what we would have on a

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.070 
technique to what we would have on a
standard<00:01:11.460> forehand<00:01:12.390> volley<00:01:12.479> where<00:01:12.960> we're

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
standard forehand volley where we're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.870 
standard forehand volley where we're
really<00:01:13.320> trying<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> maintain<00:01:13.950> racket<00:01:14.729> angle

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
really trying to maintain racket angle

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.260 
really trying to maintain racket angle
what<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:16.110> say<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.759> on<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> high

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
what I would say is that on the high

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.469 
what I would say is that on the high
forehand<00:01:19.049> volley<00:01:19.490> so<00:01:20.490> long<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.150> leave<00:01:21.450> my

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
forehand volley so long as I leave my

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.370 
forehand volley so long as I leave my
strings<00:01:22.290> facing<00:01:23.159> my<00:01:23.340> target<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> long

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
strings facing my target for a long

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.609 
strings facing my target for a long
enough<00:01:25.710> amount<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.159> time<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.790> think<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.110> okay

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
enough amount of time I think it is okay

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.429 
enough amount of time I think it is okay
that<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> racket<00:01:29.549> head<00:01:29.729> starts<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.750> shut<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
that the racket head starts to shut a

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.460 
that the racket head starts to shut a
little<00:01:31.829> bit<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.880> guys<00:01:33.060> will<00:01:33.299> see<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
little bit but if you guys will see it's

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310 
little bit but if you guys will see it's
a<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:35.130> gradual<00:01:35.909> shutting<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.930> racket

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
a really gradual shutting of the racket

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.800 
a really gradual shutting of the racket
head<00:01:37.470> it's<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.700> wrist<00:01:39.030> snap<00:01:39.329> where<00:01:39.659> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
head it's not the wrist snap where it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.469 
head it's not the wrist snap where it's
shut<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.380> an<00:01:40.530> instant<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.939> entire

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
shut in an instant it's this entire

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.219 
shut in an instant it's this entire
length<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.259> Swing<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.979> starting<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.820> close

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
length of Swing it's starting to close

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.649 
length of Swing it's starting to close
so<00:01:46.229> by<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.189> racket<00:01:47.640> finishes<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
so by the time the racket finishes the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
so by the time the racket finishes the
stroke<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.860> balls<00:01:50.100> already<00:01:50.520> out<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
stroke the balls already out on the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.490 
stroke the balls already out on the
other<00:01:51.060> side<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> net<00:01:51.810> that's<00:01:52.079> why<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
other side of the net that's why it's

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.639 
other side of the net that's why it's
okay<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.189> have<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.090> racket<00:01:54.810> head<00:01:54.960> shut<00:01:55.380> down

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
okay to have that racket head shut down

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
okay to have that racket head shut down
a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.490> high<00:01:56.700> forehand

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
a little bit on this high forehand

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.260 
a little bit on this high forehand
because<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.689> not<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> really<00:01:58.320> abrupt<00:01:59.270> closing

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
because it's not a really abrupt closing

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.139 
because it's not a really abrupt closing
of<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> racquet<00:02:01.020> head<00:02:01.049> okay<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.820> shot

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.300 
you guys that we should be attempting to
put<00:02:05.610> away<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:07.380> know<00:02:07.500> rather<00:02:07.920> than<00:02:08.129> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
put away so you know rather than the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.809 
put away so you know rather than the
idea<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.879> power<00:02:09.509> be<00:02:10.470> more<00:02:10.830> aware<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.489> idea

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
idea of power be more aware of the idea

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.820 
idea of power be more aware of the idea
of<00:02:11.940> where<00:02:12.150> your<00:02:12.360> opponent<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:13.020> standing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of where your opponent is standing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280 
of where your opponent is standing
and<00:02:14.070> for<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.000> most<00:02:15.180> part<00:02:15.330> just<00:02:15.840> pick<00:02:16.050> out<00:02:16.230> a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and for the most part just pick out a

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.170 
and for the most part just pick out a
good<00:02:16.590> target<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.190> your<00:02:17.340> high<00:02:17.520> forehand<00:02:18.120> volley

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
good target on your high forehand volley

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.050 
good target on your high forehand volley
and<00:02:18.660> that<00:02:19.410> way<00:02:19.680> we're<00:02:20.580> thinking<00:02:20.610> about

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
and that way we're thinking about

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.590 
and that way we're thinking about
placing<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.110> rather<00:02:23.010> than<00:02:23.520> you<00:02:24.450> know<00:02:24.570> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
placing it rather than you know just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:42.839 
placing it rather than you know just
hammering<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.650> okay<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.730> let's<00:02:26.940> take<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> look

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.789 

and<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.569> can<00:02:43.719> see<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.079> there<00:02:44.349> I<00:02:44.379> wouldn't

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
and you can see right there I wouldn't

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.300 
and you can see right there I wouldn't
say<00:02:45.099> that<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:46.090> racket<00:02:46.510> angle<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
say that that racket angle for a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.880 
say that that racket angle for a
traditional<00:02:48.840> forehand<00:02:49.840> volley<00:02:49.930> more<00:02:50.500> around

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
traditional forehand volley more around

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.199 
traditional forehand volley more around
eye<00:02:51.159> level<00:02:51.459> we<00:02:51.730> shold

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
eye level we shold

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.630 
eye level we shold
shoulder<00:02:52.689> level<00:02:52.900> would<00:02:53.709> be<00:02:53.859> okay<00:02:54.219> I<00:02:54.250> wouldn't

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
shoulder level would be okay I wouldn't

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.720 
shoulder level would be okay I wouldn't
want<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.849> see<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.480> on<00:02:56.469> a<00:02:56.530> ball<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.340> was<00:02:57.579> in
