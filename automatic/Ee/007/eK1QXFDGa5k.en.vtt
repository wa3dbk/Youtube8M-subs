00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.910 
they will end up in the same the same
place<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.060> they<00:01:54.240> were<00:01:54.590> over<00:01:55.590> there<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
place that they were over there on that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
place that they were over there on that
concrete<00:01:56.340> block<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> as<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.329> do<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.659> I'm<00:01:57.750> going

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
concrete block and as I do it I'm going

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.350 
concrete block and as I do it I'm going
to<00:01:57.930> go<00:01:58.110> frame<00:01:58.380> by<00:01:58.409> frame<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.729> try<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.969> find<00:02:00.240> my

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
to go frame by frame and try to find my

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.200 
to go frame by frame and try to find my
Queen<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.130> I've<00:02:02.280> got<00:02:02.490> any<00:02:02.670> soup

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
Queen and see if I've got any soup

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.899 
Queen and see if I've got any soup
procedure<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.899> swarm<00:02:04.229> cells<00:02:04.560> check<00:02:05.490> my<00:02:05.670> bees

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
procedure or swarm cells check my bees

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.600 
procedure or swarm cells check my bees
and<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.740> think<00:02:07.979> I'm<00:02:08.099> probably<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and and I think I'm probably going to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
and and I think I'm probably going to
pull<00:02:08.729> off<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> little<00:02:09.060> bit<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.360> honey<00:02:09.509> -<00:02:09.750> while

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
pull off a little bit of honey - while

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.000 
pull off a little bit of honey - while
I'm<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:11.069> I<00:02:11.520> know<00:02:11.700> I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
I'm at it because I know I

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.250 
I'm at it because I know I
got<00:02:12.159> some<00:02:12.400> ready<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.730> extract<00:02:13.000> so<00:02:13.930> let<00:02:14.080> me<00:02:14.140> go

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
got some ready to extract so let me go

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.229 
got some ready to extract so let me go
put<00:02:14.409> the<00:02:14.560> suit<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:14.890> well<00:02:15.400> let<00:02:15.819> me<00:02:15.849> go<00:02:16.030> put<00:02:16.209> a

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
put the suit on well let me go put a

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.009 
put the suit on well let me go put a
white<00:02:16.450> shirt<00:02:16.689> on<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.170> my<00:02:17.769> little<00:02:17.950> helmet<00:02:18.670> and

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
white shirt on and my little helmet and

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.509 
white shirt on and my little helmet and
I'll<00:02:20.019> come<00:02:20.290> back<00:02:20.319> and<00:02:20.470> we'll<00:02:20.709> mess<00:02:20.980> with<00:02:21.159> them

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
I'll come back and we'll mess with them

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.710 
I'll come back and we'll mess with them
a<00:02:22.110> little<00:02:23.159> failure<00:02:24.159> of<00:02:24.430> my<00:02:24.610> calculations<00:02:25.510> I

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
a little failure of my calculations I

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.929 
a little failure of my calculations I
didn't<00:02:26.200> take<00:02:26.319> into<00:02:26.500> account<00:02:26.620> the<00:02:27.159> weight<00:02:27.459> of

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
didn't take into account the weight of

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.619 
didn't take into account the weight of
all<00:02:28.540> those<00:02:28.810> supers<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.280> when<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.579> put<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:31.000> hive

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
all those supers so when I put the hive

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.280 
all those supers so when I put the hive
on<00:02:31.959> there<00:02:32.319> it<00:02:32.890> got<00:02:33.400> all<00:02:33.549> cattywampus<00:02:33.819> off<00:02:34.420> so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
on there it got all cattywampus off so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.960 
on there it got all cattywampus off so
for<00:02:35.769> now<00:02:35.950> I've<00:02:36.190> got<00:02:36.370> it<00:02:36.489> weighted<00:02:36.790> down<00:02:36.909> with

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
for now I've got it weighted down with

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.339 
for now I've got it weighted down with
the<00:02:37.239> brick<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:38.409> when<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:39.299> get<00:02:40.299> done<00:02:40.629> I'm<00:02:41.019> going

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
the brick but when I get done I'm going

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.780 
the brick but when I get done I'm going
to<00:02:41.439> end<00:02:41.560> up<00:02:41.620> putting<00:02:41.859> some<00:02:42.040> cinder<00:02:42.549> blocks

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to end up putting some cinder blocks

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.960 
to end up putting some cinder blocks
underneath<00:02:43.120> it<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:44.370> hold<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.519> up<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.790> little

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
underneath it to hold it up a little

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
underneath it to hold it up a little
better

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
better

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.940 
better
so<00:02:48.209> probably<00:02:49.209> cinder<00:02:49.599> blocks<00:02:49.930> are<00:02:50.319> better

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
so probably cinder blocks are better

00:02:50.950 --> 00:03:05.000 
so probably cinder blocks are better
than<00:02:51.280> rebar<00:02:52.030> for<00:02:52.359> your<00:02:52.959> high<00:02:53.139> state

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.570 

all<00:03:06.010> right<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.520> I've<00:03:06.700> got<00:03:06.730> them<00:03:07.180> all<00:03:07.800> moved<00:03:08.800> now

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
all right so I've got them all moved now

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.810 
all right so I've got them all moved now
would<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.120> do<00:03:10.270> is<00:03:10.830> reverse<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.550> put

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
would have to do is reverse it to put

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.600 
would have to do is reverse it to put
the<00:03:12.970> brood<00:03:13.210> boxes<00:03:13.720> where<00:03:13.960> they<00:03:14.140> go<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.680> I've

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
the brood boxes where they go and I've

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.720 
the brood boxes where they go and I've
got<00:03:15.790> them<00:03:15.970> just<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.270> little<00:03:16.300> bit<00:03:16.660> angry<00:03:17.610> part<00:03:18.610> of

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
got them just a little bit angry part of

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.850 
got them just a little bit angry part of
that<00:03:18.880> is<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.240> environment<00:03:19.630> part<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.590> it<00:03:20.740> is

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
that is the environment part of it is

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.280 
that is the environment part of it is
because<00:03:21.070> I'm<00:03:21.340> moving<00:03:21.490> them<00:03:21.760> but<00:03:22.660> most<00:03:22.900> of<00:03:23.110> it

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
because I'm moving them but most of it

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.670 
because I'm moving them but most of it
is<00:03:23.410> as<00:03:23.710> you<00:03:23.740> can<00:03:24.040> tell<00:03:24.280> I'm<00:03:24.490> not<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.910> gentlest

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
is as you can tell I'm not the gentlest

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.180 
is as you can tell I'm not the gentlest
slowest<00:03:26.680> individual<00:03:27.490> so<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.709> more<00:03:29.920> they're

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
slowest individual so the more they're

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.670 
slowest individual so the more they're
stinging<00:03:30.520> me<00:03:30.820> the<00:03:31.090> quicker<00:03:31.990> I<00:03:32.140> want<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> get

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
stinging me the quicker I want to get

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.130 
stinging me the quicker I want to get
done<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.970> more<00:03:34.180> they're<00:03:34.420> stinging<00:03:34.900> me

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
done so the more they're stinging me

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:58.410 
done so the more they're stinging me
back

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.020 

huh

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:14.470 

keep<00:04:02.720> yet<00:04:03.410> don't<00:04:04.400> have<00:04:04.580> a<00:04:04.610> license<00:04:10.120> yeah<00:04:11.120> I<00:04:13.480> did

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480

keep yet don't have a license yeah I did
think<00:04:14.720> was<00:04:14.900> pretty<00:04:15.140> cool<00:04:15.319> that<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.620> guy<00:04:15.980> from

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
think was pretty cool that that guy from

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.360 
think was pretty cool that that guy from
down<00:04:17.239> the<00:04:17.419> streets<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:18.019> my<00:04:18.200> half<00:04:18.440> foxes<00:04:19.190> and

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
down the streets on my half foxes and

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.500 
down the streets on my half foxes and
wanted<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:20.079> buy<00:04:21.079> some<00:04:21.380> honey<00:04:22.510> theoretically

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
wanted to buy some honey theoretically

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.260 
wanted to buy some honey theoretically
technically<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:25.010> long<00:04:25.250> as<00:04:25.400> I<00:04:25.520> sell<00:04:25.790> less<00:04:26.030> than

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
technically as long as I sell less than

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.860 
technically as long as I sell less than
150<00:04:27.169> pounds<00:04:28.160> in<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.910> year<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.270> don't<00:04:29.600> need<00:04:29.840> a

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
150 pounds in a year I don't need a

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.040 
150 pounds in a year I don't need a
license<00:04:31.210> but<00:04:32.210> I<00:04:32.240> want<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.600> get<00:04:32.720> one<00:04:32.900> anyway

license but I want to get one anyway

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.900 
license but I want to get one anyway
just<00:04:33.620> just<00:04:33.950> for<00:04:34.100> liability<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:34.970> my<00:04:35.690> extractor

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
just just for liability and my extractor

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.400 
just just for liability and my extractor
isn't<00:04:37.910> stainless<00:04:38.360> steel<00:04:38.630> so<00:04:38.960> I'm<00:04:39.080> kind<00:04:39.350> of

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
isn't stainless steel so I'm kind of

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.470 
isn't stainless steel so I'm kind of
waiting<00:04:39.650> on<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:39.860> Department<00:04:40.820> of<00:04:40.940> Ag<00:04:41.060> to<00:04:41.330> look

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
waiting on the Department of Ag to look

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.390 
waiting on the Department of Ag to look
at<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.810> because<00:04:41.930> it's<00:04:42.260> a<00:04:42.350> plastic<00:04:42.560> extractor

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
at it because it's a plastic extractor

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.550 
at it because it's a plastic extractor
but<00:04:43.580> I<00:04:44.030> do<00:04:44.390> plan<00:04:44.810> on<00:04:44.990> selling<00:04:45.350> something

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
but I do plan on selling something

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.980 
but I do plan on selling something
visually<00:04:47.919> what<00:04:48.919> I'm<00:04:49.040> what<00:04:49.400> I'm<00:04:49.550> doing<00:04:49.940> now<00:04:50.150> is

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
visually what I'm what I'm doing now is

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.719 
visually what I'm what I'm doing now is
if<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.830> look<00:04:52.040> in<00:04:52.250> there<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:53.600> ran<00:04:54.229> out<00:04:54.470> of

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
if you look in there I ran out of

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.750 
if you look in there I ran out of
foundation<00:04:55.729> for<00:04:55.970> my<00:04:56.090> frames<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:57.610> so<00:04:58.610> I've

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
foundation for my frames and so I've

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.300 
foundation for my frames and so I've
ended<00:04:59.000> up<00:04:59.180> putting<00:04:59.450> some<00:04:59.870> frames<00:05:00.800> in<00:05:01.070> there

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
ended up putting some frames in there

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.409 
ended up putting some frames in there
just<00:05:01.940> with<00:05:02.180> the<00:05:02.270> top<00:05:02.479> bars<00:05:03.580> so<00:05:04.580> what<00:05:04.940> I'm<00:05:05.060> doing

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
just with the top bars so what I'm doing

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:08.560 
just with the top bars so what I'm doing
is<00:05:05.540> I'm<00:05:05.750> kind<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:06.650> consolidating<00:05:07.520> down<00:05:07.760> the

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
is I'm kind of consolidating down the

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.170 
is I'm kind of consolidating down the
frames<00:05:08.870> with<00:05:09.050> foundations<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:09.919> call<00:05:10.220> closer

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
frames with foundations and call closer

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.960 
frames with foundations and call closer
to<00:05:11.479> the<00:05:11.600> Brut<00:05:11.840> box<00:05:12.169> and<00:05:12.530> the<00:05:13.070> ones<00:05:13.310> where<00:05:13.669> they

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
to the Brut box and the ones where they

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.590 
to the Brut box and the ones where they
have<00:05:15.010> you<00:05:16.010> know<00:05:16.160> put<00:05:16.460> honey<00:05:16.729> in<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:17.090> comb<00:05:17.270> but

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 
have you know put honey in the comb but

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.270 
have you know put honey in the comb but
it's<00:05:17.720> not<00:05:17.900> dry<00:05:18.200> enough<00:05:18.229> I'm<00:05:18.800> moving<00:05:19.100> that<00:05:19.220> up

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
it's not dry enough I'm moving that up

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.150 
it's not dry enough I'm moving that up
to<00:05:19.490> the<00:05:19.610> top<00:05:19.789> to<00:05:20.600> give<00:05:20.840> them<00:05:20.960> some<00:05:21.229> room<00:05:21.530> so

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
to the top to give them some room so

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.460 
to the top to give them some room so
they<00:05:22.370> don't<00:05:22.640> swarm<00:05:23.330> and<00:05:23.630> the<00:05:23.840> ones<00:05:24.110> with<00:05:24.440> the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
they don't swarm and the ones with the

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.980 
they don't swarm and the ones with the
foundationless<00:05:27.470> frames<00:05:28.010> are<00:05:28.510> the<00:05:29.510> closest

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
foundationless frames are the closest

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.600 
foundationless frames are the closest
ones<00:05:30.200> to<00:05:30.320> be<00:05:30.560> it<00:05:30.710> feel<00:05:30.979> that<00:05:31.010> I'm<00:05:31.370> going<00:05:31.460> to<00:05:31.550> use

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
ones to be it feel that I'm going to use

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.170 
ones to be it feel that I'm going to use
ever<00:05:31.940> later<00:05:32.360> for<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:34.220> crushing<00:05:34.789> strained

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
ever later for the crushing strained

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.800 
ever later for the crushing strained
honey<00:05:35.510> extraction<00:05:36.229> that<00:05:36.350> you'll<00:05:36.590> see<00:05:36.800> later

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
honey extraction that you'll see later

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.750 
honey extraction that you'll see later
really<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.169> all<00:05:39.289> I<00:05:39.350> keep<00:05:39.710> doing<00:05:39.919> until<00:05:40.460> I

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
really this is all I keep doing until I

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:44.680 
really this is all I keep doing until I
get<00:05:41.630> all<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.440> boxes<00:05:42.860> back<00:05:43.160> and<00:05:43.640> so<00:05:44.360> I'm<00:05:44.510> not

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
get all the boxes back and so I'm not

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.170 
get all the boxes back and so I'm not
going<00:05:44.900> to<00:05:44.990> make<00:05:45.140> you<00:05:45.289> watch<00:05:45.530> all<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.820> that<00:05:47.289> so
