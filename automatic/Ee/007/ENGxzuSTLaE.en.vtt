sometimes it can it can change in

sometimes it can it can change in
momentum<00:03:42.609> and<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.510> know<00:03:43.660> why<00:03:43.840> put<00:03:44.079> on<00:03:44.169> that<00:03:44.260> many

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
momentum and I know why put on that many

not about the results you know because

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.479 
not about the results you know because
if<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.470> was<00:03:50.650> then<00:03:50.919> I<00:03:51.010> wouldn't<00:03:51.220> have<00:03:51.280> made<00:03:51.430> that

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
if it was then I wouldn't have made that

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.809 
if it was then I wouldn't have made that
many<00:03:51.730> changes<00:03:52.299> it's<00:03:52.690> still<00:03:52.900> about<00:03:53.109> prepared

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
many changes it's still about prepared

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.909 
many changes it's still about prepared
and<00:03:54.819> by<00:03:55.810> doing<00:03:56.049> that<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.380> meant<00:03:56.739> getting

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
and by doing that it meant getting

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:01.170 
and by doing that it meant getting
everyone<00:03:57.430> on<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.549> on<00:03:57.760> the<00:03:57.819> pitch<00:03:59.160> so<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:01.060> know

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
everyone on it on the pitch so you know

know that you know when I know the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550 
know that you know when I know the
changes<00:04:07.540> wouldn't<00:04:07.780> helped<00:04:08.109> but<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:08.379> had

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
changes wouldn't helped but I had

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.050 
changes wouldn't helped but I had
nothing<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.129> with<00:04:09.310> the<00:04:09.459> players<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:09.849> come

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
nothing to do with the players that come

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.180 
nothing to do with the players that come
on<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.299> pitch<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:11.200> know<00:04:11.349> it's<00:04:11.590> when<00:04:12.069> you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
on the pitch you know it's when you

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.289 
on the pitch you know it's when you
change<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.579> many<00:04:13.019> it<00:04:14.019> is<00:04:14.290> going<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.650> affect

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
change that many it is going to affect

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.349 
change that many it is going to affect
the<00:04:16.299> fluidity<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.079> team<00:04:17.349> and<00:04:17.639> and<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:18.789> did

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
the fluidity of the team and and it did

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.469 
the fluidity of the team and and it did
do<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.599> but<00:04:20.530> you<00:04:21.160> know<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.310> think<00:04:22.060> for

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
do that but you know I think for

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.320 
do that but you know I think for
football<00:04:23.099> and<00:04:24.099> even<00:04:24.520> after<00:04:24.639> that<00:04:24.820> you<00:04:25.180> know<00:04:25.210> to

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
football and even after that you know to

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.689 
football and even after that you know to
keep<00:04:25.599> going<00:04:26.020> and<00:04:26.139> keep<00:04:26.199> looking<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.680> play<00:04:26.949> you

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
keep going and keep looking to play you

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.400 
keep going and keep looking to play you
know<00:04:27.820> I<00:04:27.849> think<00:04:28.660> the<00:04:28.750> most<00:04:28.870> important<00:04:29.380> thing

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
know I think the most important thing

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.159 
know I think the most important thing
now<00:04:29.530> is<00:04:29.710> that<00:04:30.330> whereas<00:04:31.330> in<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.840> previous

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
now is that whereas in the previous

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.750 
now is that whereas in the previous
weeks<00:04:32.440> without<00:04:33.010> the<00:04:33.159> possession<00:04:34.000> for

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
weeks without the possession for

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.640 
weeks without the possession for
not<00:04:34.940> really<00:04:35.330> probably<00:04:35.540> efforts<00:04:36.140> in<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.320> final

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
not really probably efforts in the final

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.830 
not really probably efforts in the final
theatre<00:04:37.010> thought<00:04:37.220> today<00:04:37.550> we<00:04:38.240> looked<00:04:38.450> more<00:04:38.690> of

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
theatre thought today we looked more of

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.050 
theatre thought today we looked more of
a<00:04:38.900> threat<00:04:39.050> in<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:39.350> final<00:04:39.680> third<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.760> all<00:04:40.940> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
a threat in the final third and all the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.120 
a threat in the final third and all the
opposition<00:04:41.750> normally<00:04:42.440> talk<00:04:42.620> about<00:04:42.950> new

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
opposition normally talk about new

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.770 
opposition normally talk about new
signings<00:04:43.550> into<00:04:43.850> and<00:04:44.000> we<00:04:44.120> try<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.330> steer<00:04:44.630> away

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
signings into and we try to steer away

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.970 
signings into and we try to steer away
from<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:45.200> but<00:04:45.380> you<00:04:45.500> give<00:04:45.650> us<00:04:45.740> an<00:04:45.860> opportunity

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
from that but you give us an opportunity

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.700 
from that but you give us an opportunity

thoughts on his performance and then get

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.420 
thoughts on his performance and then get
long<00:04:50.510> but<00:04:50.750> no<00:04:50.990> it<00:04:51.170> no<00:04:51.320> he<00:04:51.440> didn't<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.950> think

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
long but no it no he didn't and I think

you know we'll we'll monitor that over
the<00:04:54.920> next<00:04:54.950> couple<00:04:55.520> of<00:04:55.640> days<00:04:56.170> I<00:04:57.170> think<00:04:57.800> Scott

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
the next couple of days I think Scott

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.850 
the next couple of days I think Scott
still<00:04:58.490> needs<00:04:58.730> game<00:04:59.150> time<00:04:59.480> you<00:05:00.110> know<00:05:00.230> which<00:05:00.470> you

still needs game time you know which you

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.690 
still needs game time you know which you
know<00:05:00.980> we'll<00:05:01.190> look<00:05:01.370> to<00:05:01.550> get<00:05:01.670> him<00:05:02.230> at<00:05:03.230> least<00:05:03.700> 70
