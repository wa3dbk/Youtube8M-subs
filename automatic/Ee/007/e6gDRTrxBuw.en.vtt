00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.680
Today with Brat Girl 
we present The Grandmother.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.360
[dog sniffing]

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.080
man: Piss Chichi.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.640
Come on darling, we need to leave.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160
I know who you are. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.400
I saw you. I saw you.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.280
man: If I catch you, I’ll kill you.
Come down here, if you dare.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.520
Concha: Margarita, come here, come here.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.840
Come see who’s in the living room.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.680
Margarita: Again? Again?
I am not coming.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.840
The other day I heard you talking to yourself.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.640
You’re crazy.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.040
Concha: No, seriously. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.960
Your dad also sees it this time.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.080
Margarita: If you’re lying
you’ll be in trouble.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.960
Crazy woman!

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560
Margarita: Ohh! It’s olddy again?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.400
Concha: Margarita, don’t say
that to your grandma.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.440
grandma: Let her talk. 
She is right.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.000
I like Antonia’s house because she has that
thing called…Jacuzzi, or something like that.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.400
Or at Pepe’s house, whose wife
knows how to barbecue.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.320
Not like you, you loser, the only thing
you know how to do is bake a cake.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.840
Concha: Oh!, Mom, have you
taken your pill today?.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.400
grandma: Give me a break with the pill.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.080
If I keep taking it I’ll be as fucked-up
as you are.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.600
The only thing that pill does
is makes me fall asleep.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.120
What you have to do is go to the kitchen
and bring me back a cake and a coffee.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.720
And, do you have a job?

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.760
Antonio: Off, considering the economy
right now, there are no jobs.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.320
The situation doesn’t look good.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960
I asked Saint Pancracio.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.480
I offered him a quarter to see
if he can get me a job, but…

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.160
grandma: Shut up. 
Stop talking.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
That crazy man cannot
stop saying silly things.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.160
You have to find a job. My daughter
is exhausted from cleaning houses.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.320
Brat Girl!

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.800
Margarita: Witch!

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.560
grandma: You louse. 
You’re a bug.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.800
Margarita: You are a bug.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.080
You’re a witch. 
Witch. Witch. Witch.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.080
grandma: Disgusting girl!

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.320
Margarita: And you are an ugly
and fat witch too. Fatso!

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.120
grandma: You should be ashamed of yourself
for talking to your elders that way.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.000
Margarita: Shut up…
you retard.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.760
grandma: Did you call me a retard? 
Now you’ll see…

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680
grandma: Oh, Margarita…

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.520
Antonio: Again Margarita?

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.680
It’s always the same. Mother of God. 
This girl never changes.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.160
Margarita: Do you know what?

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.920
I am the one who will
get the last laugh.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.640
Concha: All because I didn’t want to
tell the crazy woman not to come back.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.360
I am the one who has to deal with her.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.400
male: Come here with me. I
t’s nice and cozy.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.000
Antonio: Again? 
Again around here?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.120
Get out!
I don’t want to see you around here.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.120
This girl is evil.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.240
Margarita: Yes baldy.
Leave me alone, ok?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.480
Margarita: [laughing]

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.960
Antonio: Girl, have you seen
your grandma?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.400
Your mom and I are looking for her
and we can’t find her.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.000
Margarita: No idea daddy.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.480
Antonio: Jeez with the old lady!

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:47.000
[snoring] 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.960
grandma: Where am I? 
What are you looking at?

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.880
Leave me alone. 
That brat girl will pay for it.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.160
Margarita: [laughing]
