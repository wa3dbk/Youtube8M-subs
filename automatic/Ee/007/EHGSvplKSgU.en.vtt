right now i do have arcade dots which i
will<00:00:42.480> make<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> tutorial<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:43.860> same

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
will make a tutorial of but it's same

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.799 
will make a tutorial of but it's same
principle<00:00:44.610> if<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.879> want<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.239> follow<00:00:45.660> that

tutorial with a different game on the
same<00:00:47.579> firmware<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:48.750> gonna<00:00:48.840> get

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
same firmware so I'm just gonna get

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.119 
same firmware so I'm just gonna get
started<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.440> now<00:00:49.500> as<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.800> guys<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.070> see

PlayStation Vita's firmware 3.36 and at

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.039 
PlayStation Vita's firmware 3.36 and at
least<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.580> u.s.<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.150> been<00:01:15.630> removed

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
least in the u.s. it has been removed

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.719 
least in the u.s. it has been removed
and<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.470> assuming<00:01:16.890> by<00:01:17.040> now<00:01:17.280> he<00:01:17.340> has<00:01:17.549> been

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and I'm assuming by now he has been

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.640 
and I'm assuming by now he has been
removed<00:01:18.000> worldwide<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.229> too<00:01:19.409> hard<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
removed worldwide it's not too hard to

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.070 
removed worldwide it's not too hard to
be<00:01:19.799> running<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.220> 3.36<00:01:21.180> any<00:01:21.450> sort<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> any

got the exploit files for arc to a

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.410 
got the exploit files for arc to a
custom<00:01:32.400> firmware<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.060> something<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
custom firmware which is something I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.999 
custom firmware which is something I
haven't<00:01:33.570> really<00:01:33.810> used<00:01:33.930> yet<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> i<00:01:34.740> will<00:01:34.979> be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
haven't really used yet and i will be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.280 
haven't really used yet and i will be
using<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.909> near<00:01:36.060> future<00:01:36.090> as<00:01:36.720> i<00:01:36.930> make<00:01:37.110> a
