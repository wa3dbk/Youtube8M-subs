00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
break it a little bit had a little bit

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.550 
break it a little bit had a little bit
of<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.120> funny<00:02:49.359> flavor<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:52.380> suppose<00:02:53.380> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
of a funny flavor to it suppose the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.259 
of a funny flavor to it suppose the
holes<00:02:53.709> always<00:02:53.950> works<00:02:54.130> good<00:02:54.340> keeps<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.060> flavor

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
holes always works good keeps the flavor

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:05.030 
holes always works good keeps the flavor
from<00:02:56.079> getting<00:02:56.380> too<00:02:56.500> contaminated<00:02:58.859> but<00:02:59.859> uh

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.910 

as<00:03:06.040> far<00:03:06.340> as<00:03:06.370> flavor<00:03:07.380> I'll<00:03:08.380> probably<00:03:08.560> give<00:03:08.800> this

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
as far as flavor I'll probably give this

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.160 
as far as flavor I'll probably give this
uh<00:03:12.060> as<00:03:13.060> far<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.390> labor<00:03:13.569> strings<00:03:13.840> are<00:03:13.930> probably

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
uh as far as labor strings are probably

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.250 
uh as far as labor strings are probably
this<00:03:14.319> about<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> six<00:03:14.860> or<00:03:15.010> seven<00:03:19.020> as<00:03:20.020> far<00:03:20.230> as

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
this about a six or seven as far as

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.640 
this about a six or seven as far as
cloud<00:03:20.590> output<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.220> probably<00:03:21.820> put<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.030> on<00:03:22.120> 8.5<00:03:22.390> I

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.490 

have<00:03:26.650> a<00:03:26.709> pass<00:03:26.950> ability<00:03:27.370> rating<00:03:28.050> which<00:03:29.050> shows

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
have a pass ability rating which shows

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.309 
have a pass ability rating which shows
how<00:03:29.530> like<00:03:30.510> let<00:03:31.510> this<00:03:31.600> be<00:03:31.660> more<00:03:31.930> of<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.050> group<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
how like let this be more of a group of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.030 
how like let this be more of a group of
smoke<00:03:32.920> or<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.870> know<00:03:34.989> single<00:03:35.590> session<00:03:35.770> I

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
smoke or a you know single session I

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.860 
smoke or a you know single session I
would<00:03:36.160> say<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.430> either<00:03:36.580> or<00:03:36.820> even<00:03:37.810> though

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
would say it's either or even though

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.410 
would say it's either or even though
supercrew<00:03:38.320> Klein<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:39.340> they<00:03:39.610> say<00:03:39.790> it's<00:03:39.940> not<00:03:40.030> as

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
supercrew Klein and they say it's not as

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.509 
supercrew Klein and they say it's not as
heavy<00:03:40.630> I'm<00:03:41.080> pretty<00:03:41.769> much<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.920> lightweight<00:03:42.310> but

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
heavy I'm pretty much a lightweight but

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.699 
heavy I'm pretty much a lightweight but
this<00:03:42.640> thing<00:03:42.820> has<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.750> pretty<00:03:44.080> crazy<00:03:44.410> buzz

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
this thing has a pretty crazy buzz

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.830 
this thing has a pretty crazy buzz
personally<00:03:45.700> I<00:03:45.790> think<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:46.060> because<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.450> Lotus

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
personally I think is because the Lotus

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.229 
personally I think is because the Lotus
the<00:03:46.870> loose<00:03:47.140> really<00:03:47.350> brings<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.739> out<00:03:48.090> like<00:03:49.090> that

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
the loose really brings it out like that

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.530 
the loose really brings it out like that
I<00:03:49.450> have<00:03:50.550> smoked<00:03:51.550> other<00:03:51.730> flavors<00:03:52.090> without<00:03:52.209> it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
I have smoked other flavors without it

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.509 
I have smoked other flavors without it
with<00:03:52.690> it<00:03:52.860> flavor<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.010> definitely<00:03:54.370> more

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
with it flavor is definitely more

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.210 
with it flavor is definitely more
intense<00:03:54.880> with<00:03:55.090> the<00:03:55.300> kaloud<00:03:55.720> lotus<00:03:56.130> think<00:03:57.130> it's

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
intense with the kaloud lotus think it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.940 
intense with the kaloud lotus think it's
amazing<00:03:58.110> but<00:03:59.110> uh<00:03:59.140> I<00:04:01.140> mean<00:04:02.140> overall<00:04:02.500> as<00:04:02.830> an
