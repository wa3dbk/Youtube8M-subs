 a cloud on the horizon 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.240

 dark and luminous settled over 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:26.460

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:31.020

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.479
 heavy clouds formed at 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.440
 the horizon in the middle of strange halo 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.360
 of colors 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.260
 fine dust of water invade the 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.210

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.040
 wind gusts of wind sweeping 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:35.260

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 angry when it was so beautiful it's 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.550
 so every year moko you are there for 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.170
 nothing sing for the rain 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.160
 she likes to dance when they arrive 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.180
 with us but there is a happy song 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.410
 dancing under the falling drops 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.410
 tempers the thousands 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.530
 Yes 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:04.490
 finally the sky is that little by little his 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:08.000
 broom and melissa song the rain 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.090
 tired and dance said she get in 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.950
 before she resumes moko tracking 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.200
 but thinking them she was a 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.940
 magic dancer 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 he said to himself that heaven send him these 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.830
 clouds because probably she is the only one 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.100
 from his country to be able to tame the 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.100
 rain 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:41.090
 what is the monsoon the monsoon is 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.190
 the name of a set of wind blowing 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:47.570
 in the Indian Ocean and Southeast Asia 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.970
 it is caused by the fact that the 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:54.680
 earth warms up and cools down more 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.080
 fast as the sea in the spring as he 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.360
 the temperature of the earth is nice 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.360
 goes up and gets hotter than the sea 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.070
 the warm air of the earth climbs into the 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.130
 sky and leave an area with less 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.080
 hours near the ground 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:15.550
 a wind from the sea to the earth 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.550
 then enter this area 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.650
 it is this wind that brings the big 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.650
 monsoon rains 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.520
 this can last a few months and when 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.440
 finally the sea â€‹â€‹at the same temperature as 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.440
 the earth it stops 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.110
 you 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:58.280

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.280
 my taste
