the<00:00:01.350> Nspire<00:00:01.709> ng<00:00:02.159> was<00:00:02.580> developed<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.720> encourage

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
the Nspire ng was developed to encourage

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.889 
the Nspire ng was developed to encourage
play<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.890> first<00:00:05.130> time<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.759> you<00:00:06.359> put<00:00:06.810> an

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
play the first time that you put an

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.870 
play the first time that you put an
object<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.710> table<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.280> recognizes

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
object on the table and it recognizes

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.030 
object on the table and it recognizes
what<00:00:09.269> that<00:00:09.420> object<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.230> then<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.650> reacts

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
what that object is and then it reacts

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.490 
what that object is and then it reacts
the<00:00:11.580> children<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.150> go<00:00:12.330> crazy<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.960> it<00:00:13.320> does

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
the children just go crazy and it does

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.259 
the children just go crazy and it does
something<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.920> never<00:00:14.130> expected<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.849> computer

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
inspiring the next generation when you

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.170 
inspiring the next generation when you
talk<00:00:39.030> about<00:00:39.059> real<00:00:39.629> serious<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> fun<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.910> real

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.270 
talk about real serious and fun the real
is<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.989> only<00:00:43.320> does<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.680> interact<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
is not only does it interact with a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.119 
is not only does it interact with a
child<00:00:44.370> touching<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> surface<00:00:45.680> but<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
child touching the surface but it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.549

interacts with real objects children

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.500 
interacts with real objects children
should<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.800> hands-on<00:00:50.340> play<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.300> takes

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
should have hands-on play so this takes

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.420 
should have hands-on play so this takes
that<00:00:51.750> hands-on<00:00:52.140> play<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.649> puts<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
that hands-on play it puts it on to the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.310 
that hands-on play it puts it on to the
technology<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.270> interacts<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
technology and it interacts in a

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.650 
technology and it interacts in a
seamless<00:00:55.590> way<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.129> serious<00:00:56.489> part<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:57.059> yes<00:00:57.449> it

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
seamless way the serious part is yes it

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.959 
seamless way the serious part is yes it
does<00:00:57.840> cover<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.770> math<00:00:59.010> standards<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.789> does

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
does cover the math standards it does

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.910 
does cover the math standards it does
cover<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.480> literacy<00:01:00.930> standards<00:01:01.170> but<00:01:01.800> it

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
cover the literacy standards but it

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
cover the literacy standards but it
covers<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.340> much<00:01:02.489> more<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.940> covers<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> higher

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
covers so much more it covers the higher

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.270 
covers so much more it covers the higher
level<00:01:03.989> thinking<00:01:04.229> standards<00:01:04.860> when<00:01:05.129> you've

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
level thinking standards when you've

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.250 
level thinking standards when you've
watched<00:01:05.519> them<00:01:05.880> explore<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:06.960> they're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
watched them explore and play they're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
watched them explore and play they're
doing<00:01:07.500> higher-level<00:01:07.920> thinking<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.820> when<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
doing higher-level thinking and when you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.870 
doing higher-level thinking and when you
see<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.540> react<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:11.189> new<00:01:11.400> ways<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
see them react to it and the new ways to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
see them react to it and the new ways to
stay<00:01:12.090> find<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.720> interact<00:01:13.080> with<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
stay find to interact with it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.890 
stay find to interact with it
it<00:01:13.920> gives<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.250> goosebumps<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> fun

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it gives you goosebumps and then the fun

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600 
it gives you goosebumps and then the fun
part<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> most<00:01:16.950> obvious<00:01:17.159> when

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
part is I think the most obvious when

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.950 
part is I think the most obvious when
you<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> kids<00:01:18.180> playing<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
you see the kids playing it that you

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050 
you see the kids playing it that you
know<00:01:19.259> they're<00:01:19.530> having<00:01:19.860> fun<00:01:20.070> they're<00:01:20.430> learning

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
know they're having fun they're learning

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.620 
know they're having fun they're learning
at<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> same<00:01:21.659> time

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
at the same time

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.859 
at the same time
that<00:01:23.259> combination<00:01:23.649> is<00:01:24.040> just<00:01:24.310> magical<00:01:24.869> it's

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
that combination is just magical it's

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.120 
that combination is just magical it's
incredible<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:27.039> just<00:01:27.539> came<00:01:28.539> together

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
incredible you just came together

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.740 
incredible you just came together
creating<00:01:30.130> together<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:31.299> children<00:01:31.659> are

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
creating together the children are

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.389 
creating together the children are
actually<00:01:31.990> teaching<00:01:32.680> each<00:01:32.799> other<00:01:33.070> there's

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
actually teaching each other there's

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.399 
actually teaching each other there's
there's<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:33.939> many<00:01:34.119> ways<00:01:34.509> that<00:01:34.539> the<00:01:34.930> games<00:01:35.140> can

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
there's so many ways that the games can

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.469 
there's so many ways that the games can
go<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:35.950> completely<00:01:36.520> open-ended<00:01:36.880> you<00:01:37.270> start

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
go it's completely open-ended you start

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.810 
go it's completely open-ended you start
counting<00:01:37.659> putting<00:01:38.649> items<00:01:38.860> together<00:01:39.399> that

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
counting putting items together that

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.419 
counting putting items together that
they<00:01:39.909> look<00:01:40.090> the<00:01:40.240> same<00:01:40.740> color<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.100> they're<00:01:42.280> the
