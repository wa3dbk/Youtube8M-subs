00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.689
 at the beginning of the universe there was 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 this same process for the first time but 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.160
 on a much larger scale 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.300
 gravity compressed the clouds of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.480
 hydrogen for millions of years up 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.420
 that in the center 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.680
 the hydrogen was so hot that 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.680
 it began to merge 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.370
 the first star came to life 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.640
 and poured his energy to the universe 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.739
 it was a product of the laws of the 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.329
 nature and was formed with the 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.699
 raw material that remained of the big-bang 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.789
 It was almost 100 times bigger than 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.770
 our sun and it gave off a blue light 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.140
 Dark 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.980
 that star was not alone during 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.980
 long time 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.780
 and other stars went on 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.680
 the same thing happens to the sun 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.030
 which is where we get the energy that 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.030
 we need to live 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 but there was still a lot to do before 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.820
 to get where we are today 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 you can not build a world like 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.140
 ours alone with simple gases like the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.140
 hydrogen and helium you need everything 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.070
 type of elements elements such as 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.720
 oxygen the carbon the iron and many 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.869
 plus 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.150
 we got lucky again because it turns out 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.970
 that the same process that made the 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.270
 stars will shine also created 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.960
 materials like oxygen the carbon or 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.960
 the iron 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:31.230
 It turns out that by chance the stars 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.230
 they are giant factories 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.490
 to see how a star works 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.790
 imagine that we can split one by the 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790
 half 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.340
 just like in the mini star that 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.860
 we create the hydrogen atoms are 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.150
 merge creating the helium that produces the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.150
 star energy 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.230
 but helium is somewhat heavier than 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.490
 hydrogen so it concentrates on the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.490
 center of the star 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.950
 now the helium atoms take the 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.950
 leadership 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:19.319
 when fusing, even more energy is produced 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.319
 and create a new element 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.860
 the carbon 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.390
 the vital basis of every living thing 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.240
 the process is repeated again and again and the 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.050
 star is covered in layers like 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.670
 one onion 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.010
 a huge onion 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.130
 in the center are the most 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:49.780
 heavy as the neon the oxygen and for 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.550
 last the iron 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.710
 then everything changes 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.110
 iron does not produce energy at 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.590
 merge so the fire starts to 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.590
 go out 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.210
 iron is accumulating in the nucleus of 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.680
 the star until almost all the 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.680
 fuel is finished 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.150
 then gravity acts and crushes the 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:22.620
 star over itself 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.889
 as the core is compressed 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:31.130
 its temperature increases to be 100 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.130
 times hotter than the sun's core 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.310
 in the end the star collapses and 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.310
 explode 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.440
 this is a supernova 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:10.130
 the death of a star and the 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.130
 birth of something new 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.120
 in these brief microseconds a wave 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.870
 expansive huge goes through the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.780
 star 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.880
 the blast is so powerful that it causes 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:27.440
 part of the iron is melted with elements 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.840
 even heavier 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.080
 this is how the elements are formed 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.520
 heavy as gold platinum or the 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.129
 lead 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.729
 they are forged in the heart of a star 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:42.059
 about to explode 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.060
 so if you have a gold ring 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.550
 value it well 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.980
 because that metal was formed in a flash 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.290
 of light millions of years ago 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:57.090
 the end of the process that produced the 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:57.090
 elements that surround us today
