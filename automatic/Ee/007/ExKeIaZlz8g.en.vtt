00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
right now of mirrors edge that I think

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.350 
right now of mirrors edge that I think
really<00:01:19.130> gives<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.280> good<00:01:20.490> idea<00:01:20.550> what<00:01:21.240> you

maybe<00:01:25.260> don't<00:01:25.470> watch<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.770> video<00:01:25.980> maybe<00:01:26.220> watch

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
maybe don't watch this video maybe watch

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.430 
maybe don't watch this video maybe watch
like<00:01:26.730> five<00:01:27.150> seconds<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.690> it<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.260> still

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
like five seconds of it but it's still

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.050 
like five seconds of it but it's still
very<00:01:28.680> very<00:01:28.860> interesting<00:01:29.550> I<00:01:29.700> still<00:01:30.030> don't

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
very very interesting I still don't

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.000 
very very interesting I still don't
entirely<00:01:30.780> understand<00:01:31.440> how<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.710> works

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
entirely understand how it works

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.130 
entirely understand how it works
obviously<00:01:33.000> because<00:01:33.330> I'm<00:01:33.480> not<00:01:33.660> like<00:01:33.900> an

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
obviously because I'm not like an

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
obviously because I'm not like an
engineering<00:01:34.710> scientist<00:01:35.370> person<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> think

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
engineering scientist person but I think

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.970 
engineering scientist person but I think
watching<00:01:36.420> somebody<00:01:36.900> utilize<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> in<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:37.980 
watching somebody utilize it in this

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.240 
watching somebody utilize it in this

until now called spy

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.860 
until now called spy
now<00:02:03.020> has<00:02:03.380> an<00:02:03.620> actual<00:02:04.070> facts<00:02:04.280> name<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:05.270> evil

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
now has an actual facts name the evil

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.200 
now has an actual facts name the evil
within<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:07.160> they<00:02:07.280> put<00:02:07.430> out<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.550> trailer<00:02:08.000> and

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
within so they put out a trailer and

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.210 
within so they put out a trailer and
it's<00:02:08.450> not<00:02:08.600> cinematic<00:02:09.350> it's<00:02:09.530> not<00:02:09.680> gameplay

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
it's not cinematic it's not gameplay

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.810 
it's not cinematic it's not gameplay
it's<00:02:10.550> entirely<00:02:10.940> acted<00:02:11.600> out<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.110> I<00:02:13.070> realized

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
it's entirely acted out and I realized

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.930 
it's entirely acted out and I realized
that<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.330> have<00:02:14.540> really<00:02:15.080> strong<00:02:15.700> opinions<00:02:16.700> on

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
that I have really strong opinions on

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.060 
that I have really strong opinions on
this<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.750> what<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.050> assume<00:02:18.500> from<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
this so what can we assume from a

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.390 
this so what can we assume from a
trailer<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:20.440> we<00:02:21.440> can<00:02:21.770> assume<00:02:22.340> that

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
trailer like this we can assume that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.330 
trailer like this we can assume that
it's<00:02:22.790> going<00:02:22.940> to<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.090> pretty<00:02:23.420> generic<00:02:24.380> now<00:02:25.040> some

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
it's going to be pretty generic now some

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.400 
it's going to be pretty generic now some
games<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.790> really<00:02:26.180> pull<00:02:26.450> off<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.990> live<00:02:27.200> action

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
games can really pull off a live action

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.890 
games can really pull off a live action
trailer<00:02:27.710> the<00:02:28.400> games<00:02:28.730> where<00:02:29.180> people<00:02:29.750> know

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
trailer the games where people know

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.720 
trailer the games where people know
exactly<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.770> expect<00:02:30.800> they<00:02:31.460> know<00:02:31.610> the

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
exactly what to expect they know the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.390 
exactly what to expect they know the
mechanics<00:02:32.060> maybe<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.170> sequel<00:02:33.650> maybe<00:02:34.250> it's

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
mechanics maybe it's a sequel maybe it's

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
mechanics maybe it's a sequel maybe it's
set<00:02:34.610> in<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.790> world<00:02:34.820> that<00:02:35.240> they're<00:02:35.390> very

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
set in a world that they're very

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.630 
set in a world that they're very
familiar<00:02:35.780> with<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.710> a<00:02:36.740> live<00:02:37.070> action<00:02:37.310> trailer

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
familiar with so a live action trailer

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.060 
familiar with so a live action trailer
really<00:02:38.390> gets<00:02:38.570> them<00:02:38.750> jazz<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.500> excited

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
really gets them jazz and excited

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.250 
really gets them jazz and excited
because<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.730> solidifies<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.630> now<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:41.870> take<00:02:42.200> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
because it solidifies it now you take a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.060 
because it solidifies it now you take a
game<00:02:42.500> like<00:02:42.740> spy<00:02:43.280> /<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.720> evil<00:02:45.110> within<00:02:45.260> which

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
game like spy / the evil within which

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.800 
game like spy / the evil within which
nobody<00:02:46.430> really<00:02:46.790> knows<00:02:47.060> a<00:02:47.090> lot<00:02:47.450> about<00:02:47.510> besides

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
nobody really knows a lot about besides

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.180 
nobody really knows a lot about besides
the<00:02:48.080> fact<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.500> is<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.680> survival<00:02:49.160> horror

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
the fact that it is a survival horror

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
the fact that it is a survival horror
game<00:02:49.730> and<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.390> give<00:02:50.570> it<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.690> live<00:02:50.870> action

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
game and you give it a live action

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.440 
game and you give it a live action
trailer<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.980> takes<00:02:52.190> place<00:02:52.400> maybe<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.330> an

because<00:04:02.840> a<00:04:03.350> lot<00:04:03.710> of<00:04:03.740> times<00:04:04.069> companies<00:04:04.400> will

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
because a lot of times companies will

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.340 
because a lot of times companies will
just<00:04:05.000> beat<00:04:05.450> something<00:04:05.870> into<00:04:06.020> the<00:04:06.110> ground

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
just beat something into the ground

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.320 
just beat something into the ground
until<00:04:06.830> people<00:04:07.040> just<00:04:07.370> literally<00:04:07.760> aren't

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
until people just literally aren't

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.180 
until people just literally aren't
buying<00:04:08.569> it<00:04:08.780> anymore<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.440> I<00:04:09.770> think<00:04:09.830> that

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
buying it anymore and I think that

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.449 
buying it anymore and I think that
