lose weight I just would create a
deficit<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.310> about<00:01:38.460> 500<00:01:38.820> calories<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> day<00:01:39.509> you

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
deficit of about 500 calories a day you

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.440 
deficit of about 500 calories a day you
know<00:01:40.290> forcing<00:01:40.590> my<00:01:40.740> body<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.189> burn<00:01:41.790> some<00:01:42.119> stored

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
know forcing my body to burn some stored

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.960 
know forcing my body to burn some stored
energy<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:43.409> fat<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.640> says<00:01:44.850> about

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
energy some fat and this says about

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
energy some fat and this says about
2,400<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.770> know<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.159> gives<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.399> an<00:01:47.460> idea

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
2,400 so you know just gives you an idea

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
2,400 so you know just gives you an idea
and<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.329> from<00:01:48.479> there<00:01:48.659> what<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.079> do<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
and then from there what you can do is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
and then from there what you can do is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.680 
energy so all we're doing in our diet is
transforming<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.170> potential

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
transforming that potential

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.980
