00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
in in our studies we came across this

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.530 
in in our studies we came across this
unique<00:02:24.920> group<00:02:25.100> the<00:02:25.280> tier-one<00:02:25.670> operators<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
unique group the tier-one operators and

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.320 
unique group the tier-one operators and
once<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.340> were<00:02:28.340> able<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.700> connect<00:02:29.030> with<00:02:29.090> them

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
once we were able to connect with them

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.900 
once we were able to connect with them
and<00:02:29.570> better<00:02:29.780> understand<00:02:30.580> you<00:02:31.580> know<00:02:31.700> their

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
experiences and and how they work it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.070 
experiences and and how they work it's
at<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.060> point<00:02:35.120> we<00:02:35.330> realized<00:02:35.570> this<00:02:35.840> was<00:02:36.050> a

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
at that point we realized this was a

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.050 
at that point we realized this was a
perfect<00:02:36.530> fit<00:02:36.770> for<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.370> next<00:02:37.580> medal<00:02:37.820> of<00:02:37.880> honor

tier one we wanted to make you know we

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.080 
tier one we wanted to make you know we
wanted<00:03:36.709> people<00:03:36.739> to<00:03:36.950> realize<00:03:37.250> that<00:03:37.549> that<00:03:37.790> not

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
ultimately going to be taking on

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.259 
ultimately going to be taking on
challenges<00:03:43.870> that<00:03:44.870> are<00:03:45.590> very<00:03:46.579> difficult<00:03:46.820> for

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
challenges that are very difficult for

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.479 
challenges that are very difficult for
most<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.200> you<00:03:48.380> should<00:03:48.590> be<00:03:48.739> rewarded<00:03:49.310> by

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
most and and you should be rewarded by

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:50.949 
most and and you should be rewarded by
being<00:03:49.519> able<00:03:50.120> to<00:03:50.239> get<00:03:50.390> through<00:03:50.750> those

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
being able to get through those

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.670 
being able to get through those
challenges<00:03:52.180> effectively<00:03:53.180> and<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.780> tier<00:03:54.500> one

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
challenges effectively and so tier one

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.259 
challenges effectively and so tier one
mode<00:03:54.890> was<00:03:55.100> implemented<00:03:55.760> where<00:03:55.970> it<00:03:56.120> basically

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
mode was implemented where it basically

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.380 
mode was implemented where it basically
becomes<00:03:56.780> a<00:03:57.380> system<00:03:58.130> where<00:03:58.340> you're<00:03:59.060> playing

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390
