bottles which then allow the light that

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.450 
bottles which then allow the light that
came<00:00:47.390> up<00:00:47.600> out<00:00:47.930> of<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.170> carton<00:00:48.469> to<00:00:49.039> reflect

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
came up out of the carton to reflect

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.779 
came up out of the carton to reflect
back<00:00:49.760> into<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.059> bottles<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:51.340> but<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.430> carton

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
back into the bottles so but the carton

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.229 
back into the bottles so but the carton
under<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:53.210> like<00:00:54.109> cactus<00:00:54.770> KF<00:00:55.250> 36<00:00:55.969> set<00:00:56.149> at

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
under there like cactus KF 36 set at

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.509 
under there like cactus KF 36 set at
full<00:00:56.510> power<00:00:56.719> inside<00:00:57.199> there<00:00:57.469> and<00:00:57.649> it's<00:00:58.280> being

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
full power inside there and it's being

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.240 
full power inside there and it's being
set<00:00:58.910> off<00:00:59.059> by<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.480> capture<00:01:00.109> to<00:01:00.469> be<00:01:00.620> two<00:01:00.829> remotes

set off by the capture to be two remotes

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.340 
set off by the capture to be two remotes
so<00:01:02.000> I've<00:01:02.149> got<00:01:02.329> the<00:01:02.359> remote<00:01:02.809> hanging<00:01:03.230> at<00:01:03.289> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
we're certainly in that channels we've

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.220 
we're certainly in that channels we've
obviously<00:02:16.760> got<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.240> spike<00:02:17.570> at<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:17.810> back<00:02:18.020> end

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
obviously got to spike at the back end

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.690 
obviously got to spike at the back end
in<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> channel<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.160> students<00:02:19.640> are

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
in the channel so that students are

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.900 
in the channel so that students are
black<00:02:19.940> in<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.180> background<00:02:21.550> so<00:02:22.550> you<00:02:22.610> can<00:02:22.730> see

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
black in the background so you can see

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.360 
black in the background so you can see
them<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.180> with<00:02:23.930> some<00:02:24.080> nice<00:02:24.290> definition<00:02:24.770> in<00:02:25.130> the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
them in with some nice definition in the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.570 
them in with some nice definition in the
water<00:02:25.850> droplets<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.710> goal<00:02:27.920> looks<00:02:28.310> real

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
water droplets and the goal looks real

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.940 
water droplets and the goal looks real
goals<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> can<00:02:29.480> actually<00:02:29.570> see<00:02:29.840> top<00:02:30.770> of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
goals and you can actually see top of

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.220 
goals and you can actually see top of
the<00:02:31.040> lives<00:02:31.360> let's<00:02:32.360> take<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.720> same<00:02:32.930> shot

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
the lives let's take the same shot

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.970 
the lives let's take the same shot
without<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.490> use<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:36.380> white<00:02:36.530> phone<00:02:36.740> call

without the use of the white phone call

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:48.280 
without the use of the white phone call
here<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:47.120> lose<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.420> definition<00:02:47.959> at<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> top

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
here you lose the definition at the top

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.360 
here you lose the definition at the top
of<00:02:48.320> our<00:02:48.500> bottles<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.380> don't<00:02:51.740> get<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:52.100> same

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
of our bottles and don't get that same

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.699 
of our bottles and don't get that same
reflection<00:02:53.000> down<00:02:53.209> on<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.959> next<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.530 
bottles either and the front label
doesn't<00:02:56.630> look<00:02:56.870> it<00:02:56.990> effective<00:02:58.209> if<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.330> take

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
doesn't look it effective if you take

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.040 
doesn't look it effective if you take
away<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:01.030> local<00:03:02.030> boards<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:02.420> the<00:03:02.510> sides<00:03:02.780> and

away the local boards to the sides and

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.070 
away the local boards to the sides and
take<00:03:06.050> the<00:03:06.230> same<00:03:06.470> image<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.220> time<00:03:07.720> we<00:03:08.720> will<00:03:08.930> use

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
take the same image the time we will use

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:20.660 
take the same image the time we will use
the<00:03:09.260> top<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.790> give<00:03:10.940> us<00:03:11.090> some<00:03:11.300> light

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.370 

we<00:03:21.670> certainly<00:03:21.880> fill<00:03:22.240> in<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.570> tops<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.230> the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
we certainly fill in the tops of the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.700 
we certainly fill in the tops of the
bottle<00:03:23.920> caps<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.640> the<00:03:25.300> next<00:03:25.570> we're<00:03:26.320> losing<00:03:26.650> a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
bottle caps and the next we're losing a

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:27.900 
bottle caps and the next we're losing a
little<00:03:26.860> bit<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.220> bottle<00:03:27.430> here<00:03:27.700> around

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
little bit of this bottle here around

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.450 
little bit of this bottle here around
the<00:03:28.120> edge<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:29.260> can<00:03:29.410> see<00:03:29.620> if<00:03:29.710> we<00:03:29.890> come<00:03:30.430> across

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
the edge you can see if we come across

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:38.910 
the edge you can see if we come across
their<00:03:31.860> repairs<00:03:32.860> on<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.100> other<00:03:33.250> images<00:03:37.920> what's

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
their repairs on the other images what's

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.310 
their repairs on the other images what's
on<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> cactus<00:03:39.660> that's<00:03:40.660> all<00:03:40.810> right<00:03:40.840> also<00:03:41.080> on

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320

the canon 40d here I've got my

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.210 
the canon 40d here I've got my
polarizing<00:03:43.750> filter<00:03:44.080> I've<00:03:44.680> dialed<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:44.980> in

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
polarizing filter I've dialed that in

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:46.680 
polarizing filter I've dialed that in
just<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.520> get<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:45.760> reflections<00:03:46.240> right<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:46.660> I

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
just to get the reflections right so I

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.780 
just to get the reflections right so I
can<00:03:46.840> control<00:03:47.200> where<00:03:47.830> abouts<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> reflections
