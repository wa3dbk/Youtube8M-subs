00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
mechanically and I was not a believer in

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.119 
mechanically and I was not a believer in
the<00:01:02.730> system<00:01:03.210> until<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:04.019> pulled<00:01:04.290> out<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> box<00:01:04.830> at

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the system until I pulled out a box at

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.219 
the system until I pulled out a box at
need<00:01:05.280> tuning<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:06.030> sure<00:01:06.240> enough<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.689> went<00:01:06.930> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
need tuning and sure enough it went it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
need tuning and sure enough it went it
went<00:01:07.409> right<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.890> work<00:01:07.920> automatically<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> did

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
went right to work automatically and did

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.670 
went right to work automatically and did
it<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.890> I'm<00:01:10.890> pretty<00:01:11.610> impressed<00:01:11.820> with<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
it so I'm pretty impressed with that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.570 
it so I'm pretty impressed with that
let's<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:18.110> we're<00:01:19.110> something<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.740> plays<00:01:20.189> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
let's see we're something it plays and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.260 
let's see we're something it plays and
sounds<00:01:20.759> like<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.420> any<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:23.150> gifts<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sounds like about any other gifts and

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.420 
sounds like about any other gifts and
I've<00:01:24.360> ever<00:01:24.540> played<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.259> bring<00:01:26.100> press

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:53.070 

alternate<00:01:41.670> tunings

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.040 

okay<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:55.360> don't<00:01:56.360> know<00:01:56.480> this<00:01:56.690> is<00:01:56.750> going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.960> take

okay I don't know this is going to take

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.170 
okay I don't know this is going to take
some<00:01:57.320> doing<00:01:57.830> I<00:01:57.980> guess<00:01:58.190> learning<00:01:58.730> how<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.940> do

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
some doing I guess learning how to do

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.290 
some doing I guess learning how to do
that<00:01:59.480> but<00:01:59.720> just<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:01.510> tuning<00:02:02.510> it<00:02:02.690> up<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:05.210> know

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
that but just just tuning it up you know

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.060 
that but just just tuning it up you know
into<00:02:05.720> standard<00:02:06.260> teen<00:02:06.500> was<00:02:06.860> really<00:02:07.190> easy

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
into standard teen was really easy

it will start going to work and if you

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.770 
it will start going to work and if you
need<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> find<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.850> anything<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.360> hit<00:02:29.690> the

need to find to anything just hit the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.390 
need to find to anything just hit the
string<00:02:30.110> individually<00:02:30.830> because<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.130> will<00:02:31.220> tell

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
string individually because it will tell

string individually because it will tell
you<00:02:31.520> on<00:02:31.580> there<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:32.180> when<00:02:32.690> everything<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.200> good

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you on there and when everything is good

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.380 
you on there and when everything is good
it's<00:02:33.709> flashing<00:02:34.040> green<00:02:34.459> it<00:02:34.880> shuts<00:02:35.150> off

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
it's flashing green it shuts off

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.620 
it's flashing green it shuts off
automatically<00:02:37.060> there<00:02:38.060> you<00:02:38.150> go<00:02:38.330> you're<00:02:38.600> in

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
automatically there you go you're in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.900 
automatically there you go you're in
tune<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:40.510> apparently<00:02:42.520> with<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> few<00:02:43.760> more

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
tune so apparently with a few more

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.790 
tune so apparently with a few more
controls<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.750> put<00:02:45.020> it<00:02:45.110> into<00:02:45.230> alternate

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
controls you can put it into alternate

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.710 
controls you can put it into alternate
tunings<00:02:46.040> which<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.730> really<00:02:46.970> what<00:02:47.150> I<00:02:47.209> got<00:02:47.480> this

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
tunings which is really what I got this

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.960 
tunings which is really what I got this
for<00:02:48.020> so<00:02:52.240> who<00:02:53.240> knows<00:02:53.420> how<00:02:53.720> long<00:02:54.490> how<00:02:55.490> many<00:02:55.730> years

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
for so who knows how long how many years

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.479 
for so who knows how long how many years
that<00:02:56.240> will<00:02:56.420> last<00:02:56.660> it<00:02:57.380> may<00:02:57.620> not<00:02:57.800> last<00:02:58.040> for

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
that will last it may not last for

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.320

customization on Gibson guitar because
it<00:05:21.589> might<00:05:21.739> mess<00:05:21.799> up<00:05:22.009> the<00:05:22.369> resale<00:05:22.879> or<00:05:22.939> something

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:30.439 
this one just I think to me this would

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:35.369 
this one just I think to me this would
really<00:05:30.679> pop<00:05:31.069> if<00:05:31.579> the<00:05:32.360> pickups<00:05:33.349> were

really pop if the pickups were

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.769 
really pop if the pickups were
cream-colored<00:05:36.379> and<00:05:36.649> the<00:05:37.299> pick<00:05:38.299> guard<00:05:38.329> was

00:05:38.769 --> 00:05:38.779 
cream-colored and the pick guard was

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:42.149 
cream-colored and the pick guard was
cream-colored<00:05:39.529> you<00:05:39.679> know<00:05:39.799> against<00:05:40.249> that

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:42.159 
cream-colored you know against that

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:46.119 
cream-colored you know against that
green<00:05:43.689> green<00:05:44.689> painting<00:05:45.169> scheme<00:05:45.529> it<00:05:45.769> really

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:46.129 
green green painting scheme it really

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.179 
green green painting scheme it really
pop<00:05:46.369> out<00:05:46.579> you<00:05:46.969> know<00:05:47.119> it<00:05:48.050> accentuated<00:05:48.529> really

00:05:52.619 --> 00:05:52.629
