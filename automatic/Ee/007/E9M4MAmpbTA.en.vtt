00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
once you do complete the field order I'd

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
once you do complete the field order I'd
normally<00:01:36.900> drop<00:01:37.350> some<00:01:37.650> sort<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> care<00:01:38.280> package

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
normally drop some sort of care package

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.670 
normally drop some sort of care package
and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.420> there's<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.869> chance<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.560> will

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and then there's a chance that you will

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.190

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.099 
with your claws which is pretty awesome

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
and I just recommend using that ability

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.900 
and I just recommend using that ability
because<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.470> is<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.769> base<00:02:53.980> ability<00:02:54.489> that

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
because that is the base ability that

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.789 
because that is the base ability that
you<00:02:55.090> will<00:02:55.269> be<00:02:55.299> using<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.019> predator<00:02:56.440> now

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
you will be using on the predator now

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.860 
you will be using on the predator now
the<00:02:56.859> next<00:02:56.950> ability<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.700> have<00:02:57.730> is<00:02:58.120> the<00:02:58.299> plasma

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the next ability you have is the plasma

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.080 
the next ability you have is the plasma
gun<00:02:59.079> now<00:02:59.500> this<00:02:59.680> looks<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.459> enemies<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.000> it

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
gun now this looks on to enemies and it

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.940 
gun now this looks on to enemies and it
is<00:03:01.209> pretty<00:03:01.599> damn<00:03:01.840> awesome<00:03:02.079> now<00:03:02.680> there<00:03:02.829> is<00:03:02.920> a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
is pretty damn awesome now there is a

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.910 
is pretty damn awesome now there is a
lock<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.370> time<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.180> think<00:03:04.269> it's<00:03:04.540> about<00:03:04.920> 7-10

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
lock on time and I think it's about 7-10

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.280 
lock on time and I think it's about 7-10
second<00:03:06.430> reload<00:03:07.180> time<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:07.780> it's<00:03:07.900> not<00:03:08.019> too

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
second reload time so it's not too

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.470 
second reload time so it's not too

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.750 
advantage whilst playing online the
other<00:03:43.810> day<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.650> kept<00:03:45.010> hearing<00:03:45.310> the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
other day and I kept hearing the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.280 
other day and I kept hearing the
laughing<00:03:46.269> and<00:03:46.389> I<00:03:46.419> wasn't<00:03:46.810> sure<00:03:46.959> what<00:03:47.139> it<00:03:47.199> was

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
laughing and I wasn't sure what it was

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.930 
laughing and I wasn't sure what it was
but<00:03:47.650> I<00:03:47.919> found<00:03:48.160> out<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.519> was<00:03:48.609> actually<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
but I found out it was actually the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.089 
but I found out it was actually the
predator<00:03:49.480> when<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.079> does<00:03:50.230> go<00:03:50.379> down<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.010> then

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
predator when it does go down and then

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:52.860 
predator when it does go down and then
when<00:03:51.250> you<00:03:51.340> enter<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.790> number<00:03:51.819> it<00:03:52.389> does

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
when you enter that number it does

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.229 
when you enter that number it does
automatically<00:03:53.620> call<00:03:54.010> kem<00:03:54.519> strike<00:03:54.849> in<00:03:55.060> and

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
automatically call kem strike in and

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.879 
automatically call kem strike in and
then<00:03:55.629> it<00:03:55.750> kills<00:03:56.049> everyone<00:03:56.349> on<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.620> enemy<00:03:56.709> team

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
then it kills everyone on the enemy team

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.740 
then it kills everyone on the enemy team
and<00:03:57.310> it<00:03:57.639> makes<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.000> laughing<00:03:58.389> noise<00:03:58.540> so

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
and it makes the laughing noise so

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.509 
and it makes the laughing noise so
that's<00:03:58.930> what<00:03:59.109> that<00:03:59.139> noise<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.530> if<00:03:59.919> you<00:04:00.310> guys

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
that's what that noise is if you guys

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.909 
that's what that noise is if you guys
didn't<00:04:00.940> already<00:04:01.030> know<00:04:01.150> what<00:04:01.930> it<00:04:02.079> was<00:04:02.319> now<00:04:02.739> then

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
didn't already know what it was now then

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.979 
didn't already know what it was now then
the<00:04:03.040> main<00:04:03.220> features<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.269> predator<00:04:04.840> I

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
the main features of the predator I

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.869 
the main features of the predator I
definitely<00:04:05.230> recommend<00:04:05.560> trying<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:06.549> a

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:06.879 
definitely recommend trying it it's a

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.180 
definitely recommend trying it it's a
really<00:04:07.209> good<00:04:07.569> feel<00:04:08.169> daughter<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.889> it's<00:04:09.010> sort

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
really good feel daughter and it's sort

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.860 
really good feel daughter and it's sort
of<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.579> Michael<00:04:09.760> Myers<00:04:10.090> one<00:04:10.329> that<00:04:10.750> we

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
of like the Michael Myers one that we

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.259 
of like the Michael Myers one that we
did<00:04:11.079> see<00:04:11.290> in<00:04:11.440> deal<00:04:11.680> see<00:04:12.010> one<00:04:12.340> now<00:04:12.790> I'm<00:04:12.879> guessing

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
did see in deal see one now I'm guessing

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:14.759 
did see in deal see one now I'm guessing
they're<00:04:13.389> going<00:04:13.599> to<00:04:13.690> do<00:04:13.810> something<00:04:14.319> similar

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
they're going to do something similar

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.069 
they're going to do something similar
how<00:04:15.129> they<00:04:15.280> did<00:04:15.519> in<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.879> DLC<00:04:16.329> as<00:04:16.449> well<00:04:16.630> so

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
how they did in this DLC as well so

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.800 
how they did in this DLC as well so
expect<00:04:17.590> some<00:04:17.650> sort<00:04:18.130> of<00:04:18.220> character<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:18.940> DLC

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
expect some sort of character in DLC

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.810 
expect some sort of character in DLC
three<00:04:20.199> and<00:04:20.380> four<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:20.769> well<00:04:21.010> because<00:04:21.669> they

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
three and four as well because they

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.339 
three and four as well because they
probably<00:04:22.120> will<00:04:22.419> do<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.840> considering

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
probably will do that considering

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:25.650 
probably will do that considering
they've<00:04:23.500> done<00:04:23.680> it<00:04:23.830> in<00:04:23.950> DLC<00:04:24.789> one<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.240> two

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
they've done it in DLC one and two

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.870 
they've done it in DLC one and two
ready<00:04:25.780> so<00:04:26.170> expect<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.860> and<00:04:27.070> once<00:04:27.430> we<00:04:27.580> do<00:04:27.730> get

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
ready so expect that and once we do get

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850 
ready so expect that and once we do get
more<00:04:28.060> information<00:04:28.210> on<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.690> new<00:04:28.720> DLC<00:04:29.290> I<00:04:29.500> will
