00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 Did you see there in the report how it is 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.339
 important to stimulate the brain and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.720
 correct orientation is also required. 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.059
 because it's not easy 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.400
 experts say that the 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.620
 life in which we learn most until the three 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
 years and over the years 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.570
 some exercises can do very well 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.699
 for that part of the human body 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.949
 so to know where to start 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.019
 we invite the chemical engineer 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.939
 Carlos Gymnastics Instructor 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.710
 maurice meadow he has already made more than five 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.840
 thousand lectures in Brazil and in other 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.489
 countries on this subject will bring 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.309
 some tips for us, thank you very much for the 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 participation cars good morning good day 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.420
 Pleased satisfaction to be here on the reef. 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.520
 with you to start what is the 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.270
 brain fuel 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.420
 the gaga is brain gasoline half water 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.550
 how soon does the first thing cause 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.039
 of the day drink a glass of water 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.379
 we have 100 billion neurons and 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.219
 they communicate by electrical impulses 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.520
 with water conducts electricity she does 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.559
 reasoning is fast and helps in memory 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.020
 For those who forget then who does not take 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.150
 water can be a bit much head and I 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.150
 I say the motto is car do not walk without 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.000
 gasoline and brain does not work without water 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.210
 and feeding food also fruits 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.530
 which have water in the natural form and vegetables 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.570
 vegetables 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.070
 they are healthier because I go 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.140
 moisturize the body 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.299
 we saw in the project report 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.009
 education all the explanation about the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.710
 We also want other 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.869
 explanations about the right hemispheres 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.490
 and left and we would like you 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.220
 Also explain if we're going to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.079
 put here an image explain next 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 right there we have a brain 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.490
 I would like you to accompany us 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.920
 here looks what happens on the right side 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.920
 on the left side the right side of the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.070
 brain is the emotional and creative part 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 the left side is a logical part and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.219
 rational 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 we use both sides of the brain 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.210
 when you are happy 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.790
 emotion took over when you are 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.189
 planning to go home, I 'm going to do it 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.179
 this first reason took over 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.459
 but the ideal is the two sides of the brain 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.560
 working together at the same time 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.170
 example is when you book diesel 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.120
 I did not understand, I want to remember the name but 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.459
 I can not do it because the hemispheres 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.250
 are mismatched 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.800
 Our goal is to fit them so that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.410
 united as a gear have a 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.209
 brain work this part better 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.660
 longitudinal of the absurd 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.390
 we love corpus callosum exactly where 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.519
 they connect an excellent workout 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.980
 in brain gym for this is hand 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.989
 right on left leg left hand 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.269
 on the right leg when you do 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.000
 cross-movements 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.819
 the brain is always the opposite of the body 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.580
 moved right hand who works brain 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.670
 left wrist left leg who 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.220
 works right brain wrenched hand 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.010
 right leg with the left leg and 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.069
 teco had to put together 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.260
 so for example walking is proven 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.190
 which is good for memory for the activity 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.940
 cerebral 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.400
 the elderly who walks every 30 minutes 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.760
 an hour in the park while he walks 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.940
 he does this movement of integration and 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.100
 keeps his brain more active and to 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.620
 who is waking up now is already a 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.730
 exercise in court by exercise 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.250
 you can do 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.590
 the company for any age people 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.079
 use two fingers and I sure think I think 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.370
 Please entered a window and 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:41.790
 in the forehead of the eyes during a 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.130
 minute we do a circular massage 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.889
 we use both hands because they are two 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.120
 sides of the brain these points 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:55.139
 neurovascular acupuncture 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.319
 blood circulation in the frontal lobe is 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:01.560
 technical name of the smart side 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.690
 brain is so simple but there is 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.319
 party that the person may wonder 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.840
 scientific principle is like an elevator 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.480
 he directs to the higher mental 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.910
 the top of the brains when the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.090
 people are stressed tired measuring 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.970
 she always makes energy of being 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.820
 actually in sediment energy and you 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.340
 complains of back and neck pain 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.430
 to luca anatomically 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.250

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.560
 this stressed does not learn does not produce 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.949
 I call this exercise to massage 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:41.780
 attests an elevator it redirects to 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:44.580
 the upstairs concentration attention 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.669

 Alzheimer's keep a clear mind while 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.270
 to Rome every day, we must make 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.520
 morning when you wake up there's that thing 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.090
 I woke up I got up but not yet 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.889
 I woke up, so are you going to drink your water? 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.800
 breathe but act attitudes people do 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.810
 exercise of self-esteem opened the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.750
 arm hug 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.840
 I love myself, I like myself and it stimulates a 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:18.900
 of the thymus glands that ultimately produce 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.940
 which are well-being hormones 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:24.060
 serotonin is known as the hormone 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.800
 Happiness is exactly what we have. 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.919
 all this information in the book that 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.169
 is releasing the cd just remember almeirim 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.240
 The Brain Gym Book is the result of 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.610
 a study I did at the University of 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.320
 california in the united states with doctor 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.479
 denison who is phd 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.570
 We're bringing to Brazil, are you? 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:45.060
 32 simple one-minute exercises 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.760
 that anyone can do for 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.270

 performance avoids white at the time of the test 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:04.160
 and we go here on reef meire do 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.020
 free workshops with the demonstration 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:09.479
 these exercises to whoever you want 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:11.370
 learn to practice where the launch is 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.070
 Where are the workshops going to be the hotel?
