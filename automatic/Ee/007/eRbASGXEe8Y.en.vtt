00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
there are things about this game which

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
are not like all the other hack and

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
guess as a studio we like to do is not

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.119

not<00:00:51.460> make<00:00:51.730> games<00:00:52.030> have<00:00:52.449> banged<00:00:52.780> Alan<00:00:53.199> down<00:00:54.040> the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129 
not make games have banged Alan down the

always off to one side slightly

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.580 
always off to one side slightly
right<00:00:59.310> the<00:00:59.400> way<00:00:59.520> we've<00:00:59.790> used<00:01:00.410> battle<00:01:01.410> scenes
