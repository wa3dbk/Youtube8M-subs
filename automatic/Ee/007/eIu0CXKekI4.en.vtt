00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.929 
inside this would not be an open-cell
suit<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.159> not<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> neoprene<00:01:05.790> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
suit because it's not the neoprene and

suit because it's not the neoprene and
it's<00:01:06.030> raw<00:01:06.150> state<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> makes<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.049> suit<00:01:07.229> less

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it's raw state it makes a suit less

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.800 
it's raw state it makes a suit less
stretchy<00:01:07.830> because<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.520> two<00:01:09.210> jerseys<00:01:09.630> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
stretchy because you have two jerseys on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.539 
stretchy because you have two jerseys on
it<00:01:09.990> instead<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.500> one<00:01:10.830> somewhat

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
it instead of just one somewhat

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
it instead of just one somewhat
synthetics<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.299> not<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.600> any<00:01:12.900> jersey<00:01:13.320> on

synthetics you do not have any jersey on

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
synthetics you do not have any jersey on
them<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.520> makes<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.090> stretchy<00:01:15.479> but

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
because it is neoprene it's not very

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.370 
because it is neoprene it's not very
good<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.300> leave<00:04:54.450> it<00:04:54.540> in<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.690> Sun<00:04:54.840> cooking<00:04:55.230> out

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
when the arena's at the foam starts to

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.059 
when the arena's at the foam starts to

constantly<00:07:05.849> throughout<00:07:06.089> the<00:07:06.180> day<00:07:06.379> so<00:07:07.379> over

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:07.559 
constantly throughout the day so over

00:07:07.559 --> 00:07:08.989 
constantly throughout the day so over
the<00:07:07.649> years<00:07:07.680> a<00:07:07.979> three<00:07:08.399> mil<00:07:08.550> suit<00:07:08.729> like<00:07:08.879> this

00:07:08.989 --> 00:07:08.999 
the years a three mil suit like this

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.939 
the years a three mil suit like this
might<00:07:09.240> turn<00:07:09.389> into<00:07:09.449> a<00:07:09.659> 1.5<00:07:10.259> mil<00:07:10.499> suit<00:07:10.710> maybe

00:07:10.939 --> 00:07:10.949 
might turn into a 1.5 mil suit maybe

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:14.529 
might turn into a 1.5 mil suit maybe
after<00:07:11.249> a<00:07:11.370> year<00:07:11.430> or<00:07:11.699> two<00:07:11.849> so<00:07:12.809> keep<00:07:12.990> that<00:07:13.110> in<00:07:13.229> mind

00:07:14.529 --> 00:07:14.539 
after a year or two so keep that in mind

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.790 
after a year or two so keep that in mind
aside<00:07:15.539> from<00:07:15.569> that<00:07:15.809> I<00:07:16.020> mean<00:07:16.349> that's<00:07:16.559> pretty

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
aside from that I mean that's pretty

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.309 
aside from that I mean that's pretty
much<00:07:16.949> it<00:07:17.129> on<00:07:17.219> wetsuits<00:07:17.639> sometimes<00:07:18.089> also<00:07:18.330> suits

00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 
much it on wetsuits sometimes also suits

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.989 
much it on wetsuits sometimes also suits
like<00:07:19.499> this<00:07:19.710> to<00:07:19.860> have<00:07:20.009> integrated<00:07:20.520> hoods

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:20.999 
like this to have integrated hoods

00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:23.299 
like this to have integrated hoods
make<00:07:21.960> sure<00:07:22.110> you<00:07:22.229> always<00:07:22.379> have<00:07:22.589> water<00:07:22.830> between

00:07:23.299 --> 00:07:23.309 
make sure you always have water between

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:24.829 
make sure you always have water between
your<00:07:23.460> ears<00:07:23.639> and<00:07:23.939> in<00:07:24.059> between<00:07:24.210> the<00:07:24.479> knee<00:07:24.599> okay

00:07:24.829 --> 00:07:24.839 
your ears and in between the knee okay

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.929 
your ears and in between the knee okay
so<00:07:24.899> you<00:07:25.080> can<00:07:25.229> equalize<00:07:25.559> what<00:07:26.399> a<00:07:26.430> lot<00:07:26.580> of<00:07:26.699> people

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:26.939 
so you can equalize what a lot of people

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:30.529 
so you can equalize what a lot of people
will<00:07:27.059> do<00:07:27.240> is<00:07:27.449> they'll<00:07:28.020> heat<00:07:28.229> up<00:07:28.379> a<00:07:28.589> pin<00:07:29.039> and<00:07:29.969> put

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 
will do is they'll heat up a pin and put

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:33.079 
will do is they'll heat up a pin and put
poke<00:07:30.779> a<00:07:30.809> hole<00:07:30.960> where<00:07:31.319> your<00:07:31.409> ears<00:07:31.649> are<00:07:31.889> and<00:07:32.129> you

00:07:35.059 --> 00:07:35.069 
want to heat it up so it cauterizes the

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:37.100 
want to heat it up so it cauterizes the
neoprene<00:07:35.520> and<00:07:35.580> cauterizes<00:07:36.300> the<00:07:36.449> jersey

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110 
neoprene and cauterizes the jersey

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.409 
neoprene and cauterizes the jersey
fabric<00:07:37.289> if<00:07:37.649> not<00:07:37.889> it'll<00:07:38.399> just<00:07:38.669> rip<00:07:38.819> it<00:07:38.849> up<00:07:39.089> it

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 
fabric if not it'll just rip it up it

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.480
