this<00:00:00.210> video<00:00:00.599> we're<00:00:00.930> going<00:00:01.020> to<00:00:01.110> take<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.350> look<00:00:01.620> at

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
this video we're going to take a look at

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.220 
this video we're going to take a look at
how<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> utilize<00:00:02.820> Adobe<00:00:03.419> Encore<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:04.410> build<00:00:04.950> a

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:06.230 
how to utilize Adobe Encore to build a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.520 
how to utilize Adobe Encore to build a
loopable<00:00:07.429> DVD<00:00:08.719> now<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.230> build<00:00:10.410> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
loopable DVD now when you build a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
loopable DVD now when you build a
loopable<00:00:10.830> DVD<00:00:11.370> in<00:00:11.519> some<00:00:11.790> cases<00:00:12.059> you'll<00:00:12.389> have

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
loopable DVD in some cases you'll have

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.770 
loopable DVD in some cases you'll have
controls<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.650> remote<00:00:13.980> itself<00:00:14.360> to<00:00:15.360> simply

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
controls on the remote itself to simply

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.090 
controls on the remote itself to simply
just<00:00:15.960> press<00:00:16.170> loop<00:00:16.699> or<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.150> know<00:00:18.560> create<00:00:19.560> DVD

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
just press loop or you know create DVD

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.189 
just press loop or you know create DVD
to<00:00:20.310> loop<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> remote<00:00:21.300> control<00:00:21.660> button<00:00:21.869> and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
to loop on the remote control button and

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.009 
to loop on the remote control button and
it<00:00:22.320> will<00:00:22.470> loop<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.369> lot<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.359> times<00:00:24.600> you'll

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it will loop but a lot of times you'll

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.660 
it will loop but a lot of times you'll
lose<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> remote<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:26.130> where<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.310> won't<00:00:26.430> be

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
lose the remote to where it won't be

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.450 
lose the remote to where it won't be
available<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:28.019> those<00:00:28.680> controls<00:00:29.220> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
available on there or those controls you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
available on there or those controls you
lose<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> remote<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> controls<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.750> on<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
lose the remote the controls not on the

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.040 
lose the remote the controls not on the
monitor<00:00:31.550> or<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:33.149> number<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.600> different<00:00:33.930> issues

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
monitor or a number of different issues

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.360 
monitor or a number of different issues
so<00:00:34.469> it's<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.739> good<00:00:34.920> idea<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.280> have<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:37.370> control

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
so it's a good idea to have this control

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.479 
so it's a good idea to have this control
built<00:00:38.670> into<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.570> DVD<00:00:39.780> itself<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.190> keep<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
built into the DVD itself to keep it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.139 
built into the DVD itself to keep it
very<00:00:41.700> simple<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.309> really<00:00:44.879> no

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
very simple and and really and really no

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.840 
very simple and and really and really no
fuss<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.809> little<00:00:46.079> laborious<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:46.890> do<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.700> go

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
fuss it's a little laborious to do to go

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.279 
fuss it's a little laborious to do to go
through<00:00:48.149> encore<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> used<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.020> be<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> lot

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
through encore it used to be a lot

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.520 
through encore it used to be a lot
easier<00:00:49.320> actually<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> little

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
easier actually but it is a little

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.950 
easier actually but it is a little
laborious<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> works<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.510> makes<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> very

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
laborious but it works it makes it very

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.250 
laborious but it works it makes it very
simple<00:00:55.320> for<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> end<00:00:57.239> user<00:00:57.510> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
simple for the for the end user to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
simple for the for the end user to
control<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.730> just<00:00:59.850> pop

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
control what it is because they just pop

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.500 
control what it is because they just pop
it<00:01:00.210> in<00:01:00.359> at<00:01:00.570> loops<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.530> no<00:01:01.710> fuss<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.699> what

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it in at loops and it's no fuss so what

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.170 
it in at loops and it's no fuss so what
I<00:01:03.539> will<00:01:03.769> what<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:04.799> will<00:01:05.129> be<00:01:05.309> using<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.970> create

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I will what I will be using to create

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
I will what I will be using to create

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
dynamic link but if you do not have that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.410 
dynamic link but if you do not have that
you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:29.040> import<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.850> you've<00:01:30.000> got<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> video

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you can import if you've got a video

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.200 
you can import if you've got a video
file<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.200> would<00:01:31.740> suggest<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.670> important<00:01:33.119> as

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
file I would suggest you important as

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.069 
file I would suggest you important as
timeline<00:01:34.110> makes<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.590> much<00:01:34.710> easier<00:01:35.780> if<00:01:36.780> you've

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
timeline makes it much easier if you've

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.530 
timeline makes it much easier if you've
just<00:01:37.350> got<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:37.920> video<00:01:38.790> file<00:01:39.060> wouldn't<00:01:39.390> suggest

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
just got a video file wouldn't suggest

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.300 
just got a video file wouldn't suggest
you<00:01:39.960> go<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.259> route<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.650> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.100> have

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you go that route but if you just have

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.840 
you go that route but if you just have
an<00:01:41.520> avi<00:01:41.960> audio/video<00:01:42.960> file<00:01:43.229> you've<00:01:43.979> got<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.280> MOV

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
an avi audio/video file you've got a MOV

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.230 
an avi audio/video file you've got a MOV
or<00:01:44.880> maybe<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> file<00:01:45.890> then<00:01:46.890> import<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.640> timeline

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
or maybe I file then import as timeline

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.270 
or maybe I file then import as timeline
would<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.189> this

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
would be the way you want to go for this

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850 
would be the way you want to go for this
process<00:01:50.820> but<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.840> go<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> Adobe

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
process but I'm going to go to Adobe

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.270 
process but I'm going to go to Adobe
dynamic<00:01:52.979> link<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.329> going<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.509> click<00:01:54.689> on

dynamic link and I'm going to click on
After<00:01:56.280> Effects<00:01:56.520> composition<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:58.200> will

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
After Effects composition and this will

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.740 
After Effects composition and this will
basically<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:59.250> search<00:01:59.700> for<00:01:59.729> what<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> have

on your on your hard drive so I've got
some<00:02:05.579> material<00:02:06.000> here<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
some material here you want to go to

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.449 
some material here you want to go to
encore<00:02:08.069> looping<00:02:09.060> DVD<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:11.009> left<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.310> loop

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
encore looping DVD and the left to loop

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.300 
encore looping DVD and the left to loop
and<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> takes<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> few<00:02:12.629> seconds<00:02:13.050> for

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
and it takes just a few seconds for

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.500 
and it takes just a few seconds for
after<00:02:14.520> effects<00:02:14.849> to<00:02:15.090> find<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
after effects to find the the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.050 
after effects to find the the
information<00:02:19.140> it's<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:20.310> utilizing<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
information it's it's utilizing the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.150 
information it's it's utilizing the
Adobe<00:02:21.480> dynamic<00:02:21.630> link<00:02:21.930> server<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.069> a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
Adobe dynamic link server so it's a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.690 
Adobe dynamic link server so it's a
little<00:02:23.370> sluggish<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.930> takes<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:26.190> you

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
little sluggish so it takes really you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.360 
little sluggish so it takes really you
know<00:02:26.819> 10<00:02:27.300> 10<00:02:27.660> seconds<00:02:28.110> or<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> find<00:02:28.890> what

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
know 10 10 seconds or so to find what

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.479 
know 10 10 seconds or so to find what
what<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> wants<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:31.010> here<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.160> I've<00:02:32.370> got

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
what it wants and here it is I've got

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.300 
what it wants and here it is I've got
heart<00:02:32.760> cop<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.410> want<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.099> I<00:02:35.130> go

you so the first thing we want to do is
build<00:03:13.380> it<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.709> loop<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:15.000> will<00:03:15.360> deselect

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
build it to loop so I will deselect

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.979 
build it to loop so I will deselect
everything<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.590> I<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.540> that<00:03:18.540> brings
