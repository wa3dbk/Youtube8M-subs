 finally here it is one plus one one 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.320
 very very interesting smartphone 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.820
 really top hardware features of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.529
 range that price content then one 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.580
 smartphone to really see and from 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.410
 try out 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.329
 today evident first and first 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.369
 impressions then later the videos 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.240
 review and also according to yours 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.829
 questions 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.689
 let's start with a roundup of 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.630
 processor technical features 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.359
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 2.5 gigahertz 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:37.000
 and 3 gigabytes and the godfather ram memory 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.579
 330 to the 13 megapixel GPU the camera 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.949
 on the back with double LED flash capable of 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.010
 record videos up to 4k quality 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.859
 here we have a third microphone here 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.769
 secondary near the door for le 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.750
 one 3.5 mm search for one of the two microphones 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.089
 second vowels the other for removal 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.039
 background noise and calls 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.109
 we then have slots for the micro sd e 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.839
 barbells and a volume with a feedback 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.360
 hard on the left side here 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.850
 below two jbl speakers with 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.990
 microphone and micro usb port then 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.869
 stereo speakers 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.280
 on the front the 5.5 inch displays but 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:13.450
 on the right side the power button 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.909
 switching off and stand by 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.030
 I said 5.5-inch display with 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.280
 milan resolution 20 x 1080 and the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.009
 pixel density solutions equal to 400 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.960
 ppi on top the capsule 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.509
 audio with the proximity sensor e 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.310
 notification led brightness in this 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.500
 case not seen and 5 camera 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.270
 front megapixel on the bottom 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.979
 then under the display three soft keys 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.500
 touch that can also be tried at 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.680
 Home menu screen and back are 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.890
 backlit but slightly and not yes 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.969
 it can only increase that much it seems 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.159
 so let's light up intuitively so we see 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.259
 start-up times in the full meantime 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.820
 technical characteristics 3g l 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.649
 wifi bluetooth 4.1 and nfc connectivity 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.229
 gps and 3.100 milian battery for then a 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.100
 this is one plus one not really missing 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.560
 nothing 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.080
 you have seen the start up times that thanks 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.320
 to Rome 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 baiano January fashions s unique has happened in 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.100
 very few seconds thanks to startup 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.080
 rapid and software optimization between 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.700
 with this smartphone 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.010
 you have seen here the led of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.810
 notification you only have a little bit of audio and 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.540
 I speak to you, however, of building 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.630
 material on the back cover in plastic 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 baby skin very similar to the touch 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.380
 however, the former 5 is smoother and less so 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 gummy on the front we have 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.160
 this display with gorilla glass if between 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.320
 the glass therefore very very resistant 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.990
 a seal around the display 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.550
 very very thin rubber then and 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.110
 camera and then plastic and aluminum 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.250
 immediately below 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.690
 I don't know why this started 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.790
 song and oh well we continue however with 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.310
 the first impressions I said the 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.290
 construction is perfect and surgical in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.660
 every detail I found no faults from 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.910
 no part either on the sides or on the net 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.880
 on the front so really really nice 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.980
 immediately if we talk about a startup then 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.140
 with little experience they made a 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.760
 very good product immediately on the e level 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.650
 constructive about the economy 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.590
 intuitive presents big hit due 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.540
 of the 5.5 inch displays but if 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.840
 notice the edges are quite narrow 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.519
 and on the back the cover is rounded and this 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.680
 gives the smartphone ergonomics 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.239
 and more his live building anyway 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.120
 to be used with one hand and then 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.080
 we want and use a use of it 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.330
 a secondary one 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.400
 also because they are not present and among the 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.170
 settings despite being an intuitive and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600
 very very customizable on the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.010
 on the interface on features e 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.510
 about features and we have 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.060
 one-handed use function 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.930
 sin concerning other first opinions 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.920
 that I had then while 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.380
 we download applications while we are 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.690
 on the camera and this is an indication of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.340
 heavy use of the smartphone begins 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.520
 to warm up a bit on the part here in 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.310
 high on the back and tends to warm up a bit 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.460
 I haven't tried that much because I have it 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.140
 tried just a few hours or so 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.030
 I'll talk more about it in the review where 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.070
 maybe I will highlight problems of 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.600
 overheating which concerns says the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.390
 capsule in audio I had the chance 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.980
 to make a call and I found the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.690
 volume a little bassino if we are in a 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.800
 very very large environment 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.290
 we probably struggle to 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.580
 listen to our interlocutor 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.520
 the feedback is instead of the keyboard 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.120
 therefore the vibration is a bit dry 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.910
 I thought better instead I found it a little 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.710
 dry just to access the manager 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.220
 double tap on the home button but that's not it 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.580
 you already know 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.430
 and what else one of his assets with the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.810
 cyanogenmod 11s therefore ultra 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.970
 customizable inside the 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.980
 settings through these screen 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.130
 these cards mainly but also 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.440
 through the team showcase application 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.990
 which allows you to download themes 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.240
 additional for the interface a 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.800
 very very interesting device the 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.540
 price is a pity for the 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.700
 availability a little difficult given that 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.860
 will be available with the first invitations 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.510
 towards the end of May and at the moment 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.130
 only 100 people in the world are 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.800
 managed to get it through the contest 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.100
 stopped app est however with a cost not 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.840
 not really that equal to zero for 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.940
 This apparent before first impression 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.190
 I would say that everything is obviously and we will do 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.300
 from the video review soon you can 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.890
 let us join the questions within 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.470
 comment inside the forum but first 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.190
 a section dedicated to one plus one 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.380
 question to answer but obviously 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.520
 in the review and we're going to follow 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.720
 in a few days 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.520
 for the moment I would say that it is all one 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.520
 greeting to michael for android puntonet
