there's one bridge rectifier out here

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.420 
there's one bridge rectifier out here
and<00:03:09.270> one<00:03:09.870> in<00:03:10.050> the<00:03:10.140> out<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.530> which<00:03:11.010> basically

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
and one in the out there which basically

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
and one in the out there which basically
gives<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.970> 12<00:03:12.630> diodes<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.490> total<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:15.090> this<00:03:15.120> is

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
gives you 12 diodes all total so this is

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.790 
gives you 12 diodes all total so this is
this<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.440> our<00:03:16.590> 18<00:03:16.860> diode<00:03:17.520> setup<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.260> as<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.650> say

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
this is our 18 diode setup and as I say

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.160 
this is our 18 diode setup and as I say
we<00:03:19.920> can<00:03:20.040> put<00:03:20.190> any<00:03:20.430> any<00:03:20.790> type<00:03:21.480> of<00:03:21.510> full<00:03:21.870> pulley

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
we can put any any type of full pulley

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.080 
we can put any any type of full pulley
on<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:22.800> want<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.760> different

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
on it that you want the different

on it that you want the different
mounting<00:03:24.450> housings<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.530> can<00:03:25.709> adapt<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.310> to

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
mounting housings you can adapt it to

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.760 
mounting housings you can adapt it to
the<00:03:26.550> Ford<00:03:26.820> applications<00:03:27.540> anything<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.530> want

the Ford applications anything you want

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.710 
the Ford applications anything you want
this<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.220> absolutely<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.910> toughest

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
this is absolutely the toughest
