00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
background is green so I'm gonna have to
get<00:01:50.970> rid<00:01:51.149> of<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.390> go<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.899> select<00:01:52.350> color<00:01:52.829> range

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
get rid of that go to select color range

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.010 
get rid of that go to select color range
use<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.850> eyedropper<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.390> select<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.810> green

I'm<00:02:16.490> gonna<00:02:16.700> hit<00:02:16.880> undo<00:02:17.270> low<00:02:17.510> because<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.170> do

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
I'm gonna hit undo low because we do

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.400 
I'm gonna hit undo low because we do
want<00:02:18.620> our<00:02:18.920> background<00:02:19.630> okay<00:02:20.630> gorilla<00:02:21.080> doesn't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
want our background okay gorilla doesn't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.830 
want our background okay gorilla doesn't
seem<00:02:21.710> a<00:02:21.860> fan<00:02:22.430> of<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> background<00:02:23.210> layer<00:02:23.480> so

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
seem a fan of the background layer so

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.540 
seem a fan of the background layer so
let's<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.500> hide<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.710> layer<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.400> we<00:02:25.430> can

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
let's just hide that layer so we can

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.200 
let's just hide that layer so we can
keep<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:25.940> real<00:02:26.210> happy<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:28.130> may<00:02:28.370> notice<00:02:28.850> that<00:02:28.880> on

our blog a lot of times we have more
than<00:02:31.040> one<00:02:31.250> gorilla<00:02:31.400> one<00:02:32.270> way<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> achieve<00:02:32.930> that

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
than one gorilla one way to achieve that

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.800 
than one gorilla one way to achieve that
is<00:02:33.440> by<00:02:33.470> duplicating<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.460> layer<00:02:34.700> simply<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.780> to

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
is by duplicating the layer simply go to

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.110 
is by duplicating the layer simply go to
the<00:02:36.080> layer<00:02:36.260> window<00:02:36.560> again<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.280> drag<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
the layer window again and drag the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.850 
the layer window again and drag the
gorilla<00:02:38.420> layer<00:02:38.690> on<00:02:38.930> top<00:02:39.140> of<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.440> new<00:02:39.620> layer

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
gorilla layer on top of the new layer

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.880 
gorilla layer on top of the new layer
icon<00:02:40.240> slide<00:02:41.240> them<00:02:41.630> over<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.930> little<00:02:42.140> bit<00:02:42.350> now

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
icon slide them over a little bit now

third gorilla shall we mmm read that lay
it<00:02:50.180> down<00:02:50.210> duplicate<00:02:51.200> layer<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:51.830> yeah<00:02:52.760> look<00:02:53.180> at

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
it down duplicate layer and yeah look at

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.840 
it down duplicate layer and yeah look at
that<00:02:53.420> blue<00:02:53.630> 3<00:02:53.930> Rosee

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850

one<00:03:09.560> of<00:03:09.650> the<00:03:09.710> problems<00:03:10.130> with<00:03:10.310> multiple

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
one of the problems with multiple

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.340 
one of the problems with multiple
gorillas<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.450> that<00:03:11.660> they<00:03:11.840> tend<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.260> get

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
gorillas is that they tend to get

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.710 
gorillas is that they tend to get
agitated<00:03:12.620> when<00:03:13.250> there<00:03:13.489> are<00:03:13.550> a<00:03:13.610> lot<00:03:13.820> of<00:03:13.850> them<00:03:14.120> so

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
agitated when there are a lot of them so

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.800 
agitated when there are a lot of them so
what<00:03:15.080> we're<00:03:15.200> gonna<00:03:15.320> do<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.950> get<00:03:16.910> rid<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.270> two<00:03:17.750> of

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
what we're gonna do is get rid of two of

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.199 
what we're gonna do is get rid of two of
the<00:03:18.020> copies<00:03:18.440> that<00:03:18.470> we<00:03:18.739> just<00:03:18.950> made<00:03:19.280> first<00:03:19.970> one

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
the copies that we just made first one

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.440 
the copies that we just made first one
you<00:03:20.300> can<00:03:20.420> do<00:03:20.570> is<00:03:20.810> hide<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.440> layer<00:03:22.209> click<00:03:23.209> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
you can do is hide the layer click the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.170 
you can do is hide the layer click the
eyeball<00:03:23.600> right<00:03:24.290> there<00:03:24.650> there<00:03:25.340> goes<00:03:25.550> one<00:03:25.940> and

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
eyeball right there there goes one and

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.570 
eyeball right there there goes one and
then<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.140> second<00:03:27.560> one<00:03:27.680> were<00:03:27.860> actually<00:03:28.070> gonna

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
then the second one were actually gonna

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.400 
then the second one were actually gonna
throw<00:03:29.000> in<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.300> trash<00:03:29.660> like<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:30.050> showed<00:03:30.290> you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
throw in the trash like we showed you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.820 
throw in the trash like we showed you
before<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.980> there<00:03:31.790> he<00:03:32.209> goes<00:03:32.239> oh<00:03:32.750> right<00:03:33.620> and
