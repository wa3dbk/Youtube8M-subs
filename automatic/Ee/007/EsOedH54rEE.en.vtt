00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
water spritzing throughout the day and

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.680 
water spritzing throughout the day and
that<00:00:44.910> styling<00:00:45.809> cream<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:46.289> keep<00:00:47.039> riri<00:00:47.940> you

can<00:00:49.039> reuse<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.250> throughout<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.059> day<00:00:51.260> so<00:00:52.260> you

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
can reuse it throughout the day so you

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
can reuse it throughout the day so you
want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> comb<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.920> hair<00:00:53.039> straight<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:54.360> brush

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
want to comb your hair straight or brush

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.170 
want to comb your hair straight or brush
it<00:00:54.780> straight

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.000 

and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:03.810> want<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.200> to<00:01:04.350> maintain<00:01:04.590> its

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
and then if you want it to maintain its

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.010 
and then if you want it to maintain its
straightness<00:01:05.520> what<00:01:06.120> I<00:01:06.150> recommend<00:01:06.690> doing<00:01:06.810> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
straightness what I recommend doing is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.990 
straightness what I recommend doing is
blow-drying<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.980> while<00:01:08.340> it's<00:01:08.490> still<00:01:08.580> slightly

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
blow-drying it while it's still slightly

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.840 
blow-drying it while it's still slightly
damp<00:01:09.200> that<00:01:10.200> way<00:01:10.440> you<00:01:11.160> know<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.430> go<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.730> and

damp that way you know if you go out and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850
