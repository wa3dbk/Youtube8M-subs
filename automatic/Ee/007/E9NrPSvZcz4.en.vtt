00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.540
 the life 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.639
 Today I'm going to teach you how to prepare a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.680
 Dehydrated carrot is the mother 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.960
 simple more let's do with the micro 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:17.500
 name then we have here are two 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.270
 peeled washed carrots I like 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.130
 peel them 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.660
 with the peeler I find it much more 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 simple is much more practical 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.919
 nothing does not need that the courts 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.780
 excessively it's just a cut 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.920
 normal 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.530
 slowly if we have it here given the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.239
 knife 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.280
 on several covers it is not necessary that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.660
 be very thin then with these 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.309
 carrots that we're going to make we're going to 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.579
 take a microwave and we're going to 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:53.239
 have for about 15 18 minutes knoll and 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:54.710
 being you at 300 power if 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.870
 we put more power what will happen 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.180
 is that it is one more grace and if we put 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.399
 less and we want to do more then you 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.880
 we increase the time the same problem 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.180
 see you in 15 minutes once 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.250
 another thing we can do is 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.160
 with a potato peeler or the area 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.260
 clean we can go pulling these strips and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.730
 if we have a much better mandolin 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.490
 ready with a little bit of skill and 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.490
 making a constant pressure and clear 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.590
 It is simple finite and we have big 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.740
 but I took it out of the microwave I like it 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.540
 put it on an absorbent paper for 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.460
 that finished cooling and stay 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.950
 completely hard when he has passed his 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.530
 18 minutes may still some of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 the tips will be soft in the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.890
 microwave but the moment they have 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 five or six minutes of fixed rest 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.750
 let's take this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.930
 is fully aware these 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.150
 phenomenal long strips for snacking 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.090
 for a cheese creamer to clean 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.440
 the time we put the bread sticks 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.910
 we accompany with these girls of 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.110
 election crispy carrot 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.610
 dehydrated and we will surprise you a lot 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.200
 here we have the carrot we have 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.719
 made small principles fixed 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.300
 We can store this in a jar of 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.640
 glass in a dry place and if it's going to 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.030
 keep for a long time we are worth 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.470
 for soups paradises for sauces for 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:24.330
 bring a crispy on top of it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.610
 on the set the parts arrive on top of the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.980
 euro and soto and will give us our 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.820
 crunchy very rich and for example also 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.820
 we can make dust 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.540
 the color to taste our children 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.010
 fix 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.430
 eye 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.430
 one 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.820
 d 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.220
 with such a simple thing in the end is a 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.540
 little patience 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.750
 complicated berlin 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.620
 see how beautiful the color can be 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.140
 contribute 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.510
 this carrot powder for anyone 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.989
 of our arms 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.540
 well you've seen how easy 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.290
 I would have loved to have carrots 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.939
 more colors to give more contrast but 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.900
 well these hours that we have in 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.459
 house we usually find and 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.549
 we can give a tone a little color 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.519
 different to our very easy stews 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.040
 we will do this is preserved all the time 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.340
 that we want 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.609
 those of more possibilities for this salt 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.239
 of carrot 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:53.349
 these carrot pikes you tell and 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.349
 we keep learning together 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.599
 how we see each other
