 your gadget from mechanical damage 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:59.370

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.979
 on the other hand let's try 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 see how it works in my opinion 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.770
 just sounds to protect 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.240
 which each user must have 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.680
 to protect the apparatus 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.450

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.009
 the battery still does not protect 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:16.970
 no film and all electronic 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:18.880
