00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
also very bouncy the only thing I don't

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.850 
also very bouncy the only thing I don't
really<00:02:45.330> like<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:45.840> it<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:46.620> very

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
really like is that it is very very

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.030 
really like is that it is very very
glossy<00:02:47.549> so<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.260> just<00:02:49.349> looks<00:02:49.829> a<00:02:49.920> little

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
glossy so it it just looks a little

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.059 
glossy so it it just looks a little
strange<00:02:50.310> a<00:02:50.880> little<00:02:51.180> bit<00:02:51.329> but<00:02:52.079> overall<00:02:52.709> I

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
strange a little bit but overall I

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:54.800 
strange a little bit but overall I
really<00:02:53.099> like<00:02:53.549> this<00:02:53.790> style<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> in<00:02:54.660> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
really like this style of it in the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.110 
really like this style of it in the
design<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:56.160> course<00:02:56.519> since<00:02:56.760> it's<00:02:56.849> rubber

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
design and of course since it's rubber

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.600 
design and of course since it's rubber
it's<00:02:57.329> going<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.569> be<00:02:57.660> glossy<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.349> and<00:02:58.590> there's<00:02:59.549> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
it's going to be glossy so and there's a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.369 
it's going to be glossy so and there's a
light<00:02:59.879> shining<00:03:00.120> directly<00:03:00.390> on<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.049> I<00:03:01.079> guess

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
light shining directly on it so I guess

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.350 
light shining directly on it so I guess
it's<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.769> big<00:03:01.950> deal<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.640> really<00:03:03.180> like
