00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:04.089
 there 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.170
 the dollar ended another edition of the computer program that this 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.380
 I'm a shy guy in the attack. 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:16.420
 of the sidekick of the program and is this you accompany souza accompanied the first 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.140
 editions of the religious and 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
 between them so far for the first time and was spent with those of the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 to realize that he stayed with tripoli march in the rc program 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.649
 We were two and three months old. 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.870
 Why did this happen? This was the time it took for me to receive my 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.479
 new camera to do this program is so in order to make the program on screen 

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:38.350
 long 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.960
 the consocial high-definition television 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.479
 so I bought a new camera that captured 1 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.739
 some time to be given this delay is due to the fact that I have 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.400
 bought the camera and the battle fund 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.980
 they were not able to fight the prediction is that we will be very happy that 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.600
 website is precisely the theme 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.750
 the program dir today 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.100
 the attacks on dilma have been on me 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.590
 in technical itápolis and it is not something that would have irritated the security 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.820
 perhaps even by geographic distance 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.800
 the sooner rebel secitec he already trusted country any of the two years I 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.090
 I bought things I needed and I still had no problem other than clear 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.549
 the delay to deliver to the south by means of some combat 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.890
 until são paulo 11 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 it's a far away region 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.520
 and what you can find 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.670
 need eight children 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 all or 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.950
 a lot of things I like to compare these sites and with the street Santa Ifigênia 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.030
 electronics paradise 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.399
 here in Sao Paulo 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.950

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.470
 Digital audio cables reality thought in high definition 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.500

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.060
 adapters to take high east date 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.130
 outlet adapter you charge your phone or if it is a 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.620
 direct USB pair in the straw had side 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.010
 the car cigarette tuner 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.599
 has an extension and stand out as the ports of access to petar computers 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.629
 this extension there you will expand the number of sep ports of your machine 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.639
 your old man's too much h with seven points of high quality has company binoculars 

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.079
 lanterns 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:25.760
 video cameras like this and also the godmother of his 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.920
 the attack I discovered this site 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.390
 when he went to buy a gaviria horse that are paulo fiesp work in the 50 and 100 reais 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.289
 by an hdmi cable nothing justifies picking up that weight the car 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.779
 and I've been in your car that costs a few dollars a few dollars still 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:44.659
 it seems that 5 6 reais 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:49.429
 never bm on that works perfectly to people made magazine 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:50.330
 a test 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.250
 a neighbor realized that carlos de Achilles digital mission as is the case 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.999
 of hdmi and did not need the site 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.419
 high quality the high price with that hair suspected enough to transmit 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.409
 the sign and high quality what we took into account products as already said 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.890
 low quality of cool products 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 the only care you have to have is not to buy anything that costs more than 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.689
 fifty reais up to 50 dollars 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.419
 so your purchase costs more than 50 dollars it will be downloaded by arriving 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.759
 in brazil the federal police will collect tax in brazil we know 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.459
 what a shame of expensive 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.329
 the payment the girl makes the payment through the site people 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:36.739
 concerned is the payment already on the traditional on the internet is not the 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.069
 your credit card 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.959
 in the middle club you pay the club can and technically the main pass the 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.089
 payment in the claudio strinati case that the system of purchases more secure than 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:53.779
 exists on the internet is the main expected landscapes color product 

00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:58.119
 I do not like the $ 50 paid after the pepal 

00:03:58.119 --> 00:04:01.599
 for two months you receive the product in your home 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.709
 Look takes longer It pays here's the tip then 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:09.410
 computer program selection can prevent many fear 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.130
 As an address the mayor explained the dealer because he had 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.189
 public has nothing 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.499
 1 public server said 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.699
 but quoted to do the shopping 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:24.569
 quietly only if you have any questions about computers and the internet and 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.650
 who will try to solve it 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.199
 write to smile ended up at computers and respond with little I 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.850
 I'm going to try that the tendency was for us to come back with one more tip. 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.699
 talk next year 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.380
