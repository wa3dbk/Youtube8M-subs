thought<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> I<00:01:05.850> guess<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.450> thought<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.110> was

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
thought of I guess I thought it was

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
thought of I guess I thought it was
quite<00:01:07.470> different<00:01:07.619> brother<00:01:07.890> bonus<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.460> quite

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
quite different brother bonus or quite

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.750

big<00:01:08.909> discrepancies<00:01:09.510> between<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:10.229> thought<00:01:11.010> on

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
big discrepancies between but thought on

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
big discrepancies between but thought on
the<00:01:11.880> whole<00:01:12.060> got<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> point<00:01:12.840> across<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.650> could

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the whole got the point across you could

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.840 
the whole got the point across you could
watch<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> without<00:01:14.189> reading<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> books<00:01:14.729> his

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
watch it without reading the books his

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
watch it without reading the books his
way<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.240> think<00:01:15.630> when<00:01:15.810> Harry<00:01:16.229> at<00:01:16.380> his<00:01:16.470> trial

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
way I think when Harry at his trial

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
way I think when Harry at his trial
about<00:01:17.490> whether<00:01:17.640> he<00:01:17.670> gets<00:01:17.970> both<00:01:18.240> mobiles

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
about whether he gets both mobiles

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
about whether he gets both mobiles
monetary<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.500> seen<00:01:19.710> because<00:01:19.890> all<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.880> actors

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
monetary be seen because all the actors

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
monetary be seen because all the actors
all<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> extras<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> were<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:23.159> getting

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
all the extras in it were really getting

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.039 
all the extras in it were really getting
into<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.670> quite<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> lot<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> meant<00:01:24.780> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
into it quite a lot and it meant that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
into it quite a lot and it meant that
you<00:01:25.530> could<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.920> relate

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you could really relate

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.670 
you could really relate
would<00:01:28.030> be<00:01:28.150> feeling<00:01:28.509> and<00:01:28.720> about<00:01:29.530> how

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
would be feeling and about how

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.410 
would be feeling and about how
Dumbledore's<00:01:30.130> you<00:01:30.310> gave<00:01:30.700> her<00:01:30.850> angry<00:01:31.210> but

holding back so I've got all the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460 
holding back so I've got all the
absolute<00:01:33.610> nothingness<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.299> I<00:01:34.780> kind<00:01:35.409> of

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
absolute nothingness that I kind of

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.910 
absolute nothingness that I kind of
enjoyed<00:01:35.890> it<00:01:36.220> because<00:01:36.880> I'm<00:01:37.600> kwadwo<00:01:38.170> Kyle<00:01:38.380> stone

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.999 
enjoyed it because I'm kwadwo Kyle stone
and<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.820> I<00:01:40.299> like<00:01:40.659> the<00:01:41.049> way<00:01:41.170> some<00:01:41.229> of<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.710> was<00:01:41.829> done

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
and I I like the way some of it was done

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.120 
and I I like the way some of it was done
but<00:01:42.460> because<00:01:42.759> I've<00:01:43.450> read<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.689> books<00:01:44.100> some<00:01:45.100> of

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
but because I've read the books some of

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.090 
but because I've read the books some of
it<00:01:45.399> was<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.939> lot<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.360> difference<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.679> it<00:01:47.950> was

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
it was a lot of difference so it was

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.999 
it was a lot of difference so it was
kind<00:01:48.340> of<00:01:48.369> hard<00:01:48.549> to<00:01:48.670> sit<00:01:49.030> them<00:01:49.270> flames<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.799> I

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
kind of hard to sit them flames and I

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.859 
kind of hard to sit them flames and I
think<00:01:51.250> it<00:01:51.340> would<00:01:51.490> be<00:01:51.520> better<00:01:51.820> if<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.420> had<00:01:52.630> not

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
think it would be better if you had not

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.359 
think it would be better if you had not
read<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.289> book<00:01:53.500> it<00:01:53.799> would<00:01:53.979> have<00:01:54.070> been<00:01:54.130> a

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
read the book it would have been a

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.270 
read the book it would have been a
better<00:01:55.299> film<00:01:55.720> to<00:01:55.960> watch<00:01:55.990> I<00:01:56.530> thought<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.130> was

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
better film to watch I thought it was

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.560 
better film to watch I thought it was
really<00:01:57.610> exciting<00:01:58.119> but<00:01:58.330> it<00:01:58.420> was<00:01:58.539> a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
really exciting but it was a

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.590 
really exciting but it was a
disappointment<00:01:59.319> compared<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.429> the<00:02:00.520> book<00:02:00.700> why

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
disappointment compared to the book why

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.199 
disappointment compared to the book why
would<00:02:01.780> that<00:02:01.929> I<00:02:02.740> thought<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.399> book<00:02:03.580> contained

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209 
would that I thought the book contained

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.789 
would that I thought the book contained
a<00:02:04.270> lot<00:02:04.390> more<00:02:04.509> information<00:02:05.080> but<00:02:05.259> they<00:02:05.319> muddled

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
a lot more information but they muddled

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.440 
a lot more information but they muddled
this<00:02:05.950> up<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.310> film<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.060> scenes<00:02:07.299> are

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
this up in the film and the scenes are

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.259 
this up in the film and the scenes are
in<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.630> different<00:02:07.810> order<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.709> was<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> lot<00:02:09.069> more

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
in a different order it was a lot more

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.270 
in a different order it was a lot more
sinister<00:02:10.269> and<00:02:10.410> thought<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:11.530> characters<00:02:11.980> were

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
sinister and thought the characters were

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.430 
sinister and thought the characters were
a<00:02:12.519> lot<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:13.000> similar<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.870> their<00:02:14.019> characters

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
a lot more similar to their characters

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.530 
a lot more similar to their characters
shown<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.130> books<00:02:15.310> i<00:02:15.549> feel<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.180> gripping

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
shown in the books i feel is gripping

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.320

and<00:02:16.810> dramatic<00:02:17.769> from<00:02:17.980> beginning<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.400> end<00:02:18.489> it

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
and dramatic from beginning to end it

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.330 
and dramatic from beginning to end it
was<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.600> it<00:02:19.690> really<00:02:19.900> kicks<00:02:20.200> you<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:21.220> know
