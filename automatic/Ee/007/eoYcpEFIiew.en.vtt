00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you around 50k below of 25k is minimal

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.650 
you around 50k below of 25k is minimal
and<00:00:40.579> 70s<00:00:41.579> what<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:41.879> you're<00:00:42.149> not<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.420> on<00:00:42.480> pay

74<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:44.219> our<00:00:44.550> world<00:00:45.329> depending<00:00:45.780> as

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
74 but it's also our world depending as

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.549 
74 but it's also our world depending as
some<00:00:48.690> worlds<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> different<00:00:49.289> prices

some worlds have different prices

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.090 
some worlds have different prices
rhythms<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> population

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
rhythms just because of population

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.850 
rhythms just because of population
levels<00:00:53.870> levels<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> population<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.680> guess

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
levels levels of the population I guess

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
levels levels of the population I guess
