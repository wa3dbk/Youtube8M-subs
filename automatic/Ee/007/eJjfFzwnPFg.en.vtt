00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
because although he's got one less

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.619 
because although he's got one less
defense<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.040> Leighton<00:00:41.040> Baines<00:00:41.270> it's<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.600> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
defense and Leighton Baines it's good to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.220 
defense and Leighton Baines it's good to
have<00:00:42.809> he's<00:00:43.320> got<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:44.030> phenomenally<00:00:45.030> huge<00:00:45.899> amount

of pace compared to him which is really

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.410 
of pace compared to him which is really

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
game and in this first game I'm playing

think getting all know he had a decent
team<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:48.990> think<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.619> can't<00:01:50.340> really<00:01:50.549> remember<00:01:50.670> it

goal<00:02:23.189> and<00:02:23.459> then<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.700> think<00:02:23.970> his<00:02:24.090> centre-back

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
goal and then I think his centre-back

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.259 
goal and then I think his centre-back
also<00:02:25.019> got<00:02:25.200> word<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.439> his<00:02:25.920> amazing<00:02:26.640> package<00:02:26.849> and

also got word of his amazing package and

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.399 
also got word of his amazing package and
decided<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:28.489> let<00:02:29.489> him<00:02:29.700> have<00:02:30.000> an<00:02:30.180> easy<00:02:30.359> goal<00:02:30.689> and

decided to let him have an easy goal and

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.500 
decided to let him have an easy goal and
then<00:02:31.829> finally<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.400> think<00:02:32.760> his<00:02:32.939> defense<00:02:33.299> just

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
then finally I think his defense just

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.119 
then finally I think his defense just
gave<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.900> was<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.290> yeah<00:02:34.500> let's<00:02:34.680> give<00:02:34.920> him<00:02:34.980> the

four<00:03:48.750> four<00:03:49.049> two<00:03:49.319> formations<00:03:49.680> or<00:03:50.190> about<00:03:50.340> five

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
four four two formations or about five

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.559 
four four two formations or about five
grand<00:03:51.709> so<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:52.919> it's<00:03:53.760> definitely<00:03:54.299> not<00:03:54.510> easy

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
grand so it's it's definitely not easy

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.140 
grand so it's it's definitely not easy
finding<00:03:55.199> someone<00:03:55.379> in<00:03:55.859> your<00:03:56.040> formation<00:03:56.459> that's

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
finding someone in your formation that's

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.059 
finding someone in your formation that's
and<00:03:58.459> who's<00:03:59.459> like<00:03:59.819> an<00:04:00.000> 84<00:04:00.510> left<00:04:01.319> midfielder<00:04:01.889> so

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
and who's like an 84 left midfielder so

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.250 
and who's like an 84 left midfielder so
that<00:04:02.220> was<00:04:02.400> bit<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.180> pain<00:04:03.419> but<00:04:03.720> Zhukov<00:04:04.229> is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
that was bit of a pain but Zhukov is

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.089 
that was bit of a pain but Zhukov is
very<00:04:04.889> very<00:04:05.790> talented<00:04:06.030> his<00:04:06.780> stats<00:04:07.109> almost

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
very very talented his stats almost

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.599 
very very talented his stats almost
equal<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.970> of<00:04:09.030> mallu<00:04:09.540> ders<00:04:10.430> he's<00:04:11.430> just

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
equal that of mallu ders he's just

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:14.839 
equal that of mallu ders he's just
slightly<00:04:11.970> worse<00:04:12.540> in<00:04:13.040> pretty<00:04:14.040> much<00:04:14.099> all<00:04:14.400> areas

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
slightly worse in pretty much all areas

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.969 
slightly worse in pretty much all areas
i<00:04:14.970> think<00:04:15.209> there<00:04:15.629> might<00:04:15.750> be<00:04:15.810> so<00:04:16.079> and<00:04:16.470> i<00:04:16.560> can't<00:04:16.889> i

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
i think there might be so and i can't i

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.610 
i think there might be so and i can't i
went<00:04:17.190> away<00:04:17.280> for<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.760> little<00:04:17.940> while<00:04:18.500> during<00:04:19.500> this

in the past on my previous account some

Zhirkov and it told me i had duplicates

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
Zhirkov and it told me i had duplicates
in<00:04:40.020> my<00:04:40.260> club<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.860> it<00:04:41.400> turns<00:04:41.639> out<00:04:41.850> that<00:04:41.910> i

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
in my club and it turns out that i

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.570 
in my club and it turns out that i
actually<00:04:42.450> they<00:04:43.440> have<00:04:43.590> just<00:04:43.919> been<00:04:44.100> sent<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.430> my

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.490 
actually they have just been sent to my
club<00:04:45.060> i<00:04:45.240> think<00:04:45.450> if<00:04:45.570> you<00:04:45.720> don't<00:04:45.930> if<00:04:46.169> you<00:04:46.230> buy

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
club i think if you don't if you buy

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.790 
club i think if you don't if you buy
players<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.310> don't<00:04:47.550> play<00:04:48.150> with<00:04:48.360> them

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
players and you don't play with them

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.610 
players and you don't play with them
they<00:04:49.800> go<00:04:49.980> straight<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.700> your<00:04:51.260> club<00:04:52.260> they<00:04:52.470> get

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
they go straight to your club they get

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.050 
they go straight to your club they get
put<00:04:52.800> in<00:04:52.889> your<00:04:53.010> club<00:04:53.250> for<00:04:53.400> some<00:04:53.550> reason<00:04:53.910> which

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
put in your club for some reason which

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.430 
put in your club for some reason which
is<00:04:54.090> odd<00:04:54.360> because<00:04:54.389> i<00:04:54.720> don't<00:04:54.900> know<00:04:54.960> why<00:04:55.139> some<00:04:55.410> of

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
is odd because i don't know why some of

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.170 
is odd because i don't know why some of
the<00:04:55.620> other<00:04:55.770> ones<00:04:56.010> got<00:04:56.250> in<00:04:56.490> there<00:04:56.850> I<00:04:56.880> think<00:04:56.940> it's

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
the other ones got in there I think it's

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.719 
the other ones got in there I think it's
the<00:04:57.330> newest<00:04:57.660> players<00:04:57.900> or<00:04:58.139> something<00:04:58.729> it
