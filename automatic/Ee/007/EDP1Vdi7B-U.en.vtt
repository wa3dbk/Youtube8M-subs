 here the bracket continues 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.239
 leave an inch of margin 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.699
 the fabric a little hard 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.620

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.420
 are long spots left soft inter 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.550
 I only work on the most important parts because the fabric is a lot 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.550
 tough 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.370
 where there are drawings made with chalk 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.370
 once the angle passes crosswise 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.370
 this is a finished result here you see a little insignia 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.200

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 especially on the front 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.279
 open flaps of fabric with your hands 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 the fillets remain hanging 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.159
 now I cut with the missing files 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 being careful, of course, do not cut the fabric 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 here's how it comes 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.579
 it is difficult to open the slow points, I help myself with the scissors there 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.579
 I insert more inside and then open from inside 

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.419
