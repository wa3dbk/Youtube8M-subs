00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
branch where the forks have pretty much

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.039

with<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.780> my<00:01:07.350> saw<00:01:09.229> open<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.320> up

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
with I'm going to take my saw open it up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.370 
with I'm going to take my saw open it up
I'm<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> make<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> cut<00:01:12.540> about<00:01:12.780> here<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
I'm going to make a cut about here to

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.140 
I'm going to make a cut about here to
cut<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.710> end<00:01:13.920> off<00:01:14.100> now<00:01:14.760> when<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:14.970> cutting

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
cut this end off now when I'm cutting

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.330 
cut this end off now when I'm cutting
with<00:01:15.390> this<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> want<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.200> safe<00:01:16.500> if<00:01:17.189> you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
with this or I want to be safe if you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
with this or I want to be safe if you
cut<00:01:17.520> quite<00:01:17.700> vigorously<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> saw<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.140> could

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
cut quite vigorously with a saw it could

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.039 
cut quite vigorously with a saw it could
jump<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.100> slice<00:01:20.729> your<00:01:20.939> hand<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.450> one

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
jump out and slice your hand here one

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
jump out and slice your hand here one
way<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> limit<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.759> put<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:24.030> finger

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
way to limit this is to put your finger

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.969 
way to limit this is to put your finger
on<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> top<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> top<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
on the top like that because the top is

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.039 
on the top like that because the top is
completely<00:01:26.430> safe<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.570> way<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> stops

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
completely safe and that way it stops

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.710 
completely safe and that way it stops
you<00:01:28.170> saw<00:01:28.380> jumping<00:01:28.799> out<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> I'll<00:01:30.479> start

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
you saw jumping out so I'll start

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.050 
you saw jumping out so I'll start
cutting<00:01:30.869> slowly<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.710> gently<00:01:31.950> let<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.790> weight

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
cutting slowly and gently let the weight

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.899 
cutting slowly and gently let the weight
of<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.360> straw<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> work<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.340> eventually

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
of the straw do the work and eventually

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.990 
of the straw do the work and eventually
that<00:01:36.570> will<00:01:36.689> fall<00:01:36.900> off<00:01:37.079> like<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> now<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> need

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
that will fall off like that now I need

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.640 
that will fall off like that now I need
to<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.360> off<00:01:39.479> here<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.439> do

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to take this off here and here I can do

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.359 
to take this off here and here I can do
the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.920> again

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the same again

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.609 
the same again
but<00:01:41.790> there's<00:01:41.939> less<00:01:42.030> tension<00:01:42.329> on<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.689> so<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.259> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
but there's less tension on it so if I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.030 
but there's less tension on it so if I
needed<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:45.270> neck<00:01:45.420> cut<00:01:45.750> with<00:01:46.680> my<00:01:46.860> arm

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
needed to I can neck cut with my arm

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
this room here this you know just

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.250 
this room here this you know just
carving<00:02:21.430> in<00:02:21.579> here<00:02:21.849> like<00:02:22.150> this<00:02:22.390> make<00:02:23.049> a<00:02:23.079> little

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
carving in here like this make a little

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530 
carving in here like this make a little
stop<00:02:23.530> cut<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.310> carve<00:02:24.549> up<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.879> it<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
stop cut and carve up to it just to

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.929 
stop cut and carve up to it just to
knock<00:02:25.720> out<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.019> fibers<00:02:26.489> that's<00:02:27.489> roughly

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
knock out the fibers that's roughly

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.530 
knock out the fibers that's roughly
about<00:02:28.510> level<00:02:29.670> then<00:02:30.670> what<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.819> need<00:02:30.909> to<00:02:31.030> do<00:02:31.180> is

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
about level then what I need to do is

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.140 
about level then what I need to do is
carve<00:02:31.900> some<00:02:32.049> recesses<00:02:32.590> on<00:02:32.920> either<00:02:33.519> side<00:02:33.849> where

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
carve some recesses on either side where

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.569 
carve some recesses on either side where
those<00:02:34.299> marks<00:02:34.540> are<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.709> bands<00:02:35.980> will<00:02:36.340> wrap

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
those marks are so the bands will wrap

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.940 
those marks are so the bands will wrap
around<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.690> wood<00:02:37.900> itself<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.620> doesn't<00:02:38.769> have

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
around the wood itself and doesn't have

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.800 
around the wood itself and doesn't have
to<00:02:39.069> go<00:02:39.159> around<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.400> full<00:02:39.609> circumference<00:02:40.150> so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
to go around the full circumference so

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.780 
to go around the full circumference so
it<00:02:40.900> goes<00:02:41.079> through<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.379> narrow<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.769> bit<00:02:42.069> therefore

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
it goes through a narrow a bit therefore

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.819 
it goes through a narrow a bit therefore
making<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.269> fit<00:02:43.480> tighter<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.319> I'll<00:02:44.409> just<00:02:44.560> carve

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
making it fit tighter so I'll just carve

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.819 
making it fit tighter so I'll just carve
those<00:02:44.980> in<00:02:45.250> there

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
those in there

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.440 
those in there
okay<00:02:47.829> so<00:02:47.890> I've<00:02:48.099> carved<00:02:48.340> in<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.819> two<00:02:49.030> recesses

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
okay so I've carved in the two recesses

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.449 
okay so I've carved in the two recesses
here<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.930> here<00:02:50.109> where<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:50.980> power<00:02:51.159> band<00:02:51.370> is

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
here and here where the power band is

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.490 
here and here where the power band is
going<00:02:51.549> to<00:02:51.609> be<00:02:51.700> located<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.450> now<00:02:52.930> need<00:02:53.139> to<00:02:53.170> cut

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
going to be located I now need to cut

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.930 
going to be located I now need to cut
these<00:02:53.709> two<00:02:54.129> lengths<00:02:54.310> so<00:02:54.519> I'm<00:02:54.609> just<00:02:54.760> going<00:02:54.909> to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
these two lengths so I'm just going to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.849 
these two lengths so I'm just going to
cut<00:02:55.150> them<00:02:55.299> off<00:02:55.420> about<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.049> half<00:02:56.109> a<00:02:56.349> centimeter

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
cut them off about a half a centimeter

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.699 
cut them off about a half a centimeter
above<00:02:57.220> each<00:02:57.700> one<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.750> use<00:02:58.900> my<00:02:59.049> luck<00:02:59.260> Lander<00:02:59.590> so

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
above each one and use my luck Lander so

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.890 
above each one and use my luck Lander so
for<00:02:59.980> this<00:03:00.120> I'm<00:03:01.120> going<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:01.359> place<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.750> wood

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
for this I'm going to place the wood

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.680 
for this I'm going to place the wood
between<00:03:02.139> my<00:03:02.379> legs<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:02.829> grip<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.659> place<00:03:04.659> the

of<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.659> store<00:03:07.900> making<00:03:08.470> sure<00:03:08.739> my<00:03:08.889> thumb<00:03:09.190> is<00:03:09.430> at

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
of the store making sure my thumb is at

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:16.770 
of the store making sure my thumb is at
lie<00:03:10.000> underneath<00:03:14.730> okay<00:03:15.730> now<00:03:16.120> come<00:03:16.389> to<00:03:16.690> the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
lie underneath okay now come to the

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.449 
lie underneath okay now come to the
point<00:03:16.959> where<00:03:17.109> we<00:03:17.199> need<00:03:17.349> to<00:03:17.379> lash<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:18.220> power

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
point where we need to lash the power

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.030 
point where we need to lash the power
bands<00:03:18.819> onto<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.750> fork<00:03:19.959> stick<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:20.889> going

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
bands onto the fork stick and I'm going

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.309 
bands onto the fork stick and I'm going
to<00:03:21.099> use<00:03:21.220> dental<00:03:21.459> floss<00:03:21.669> for<00:03:22.090> this<00:03:22.239> but<00:03:23.169> there's

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
to use dental floss for this but there's

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.259 
to use dental floss for this but there's
a<00:03:23.349> really<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.250> important<00:03:24.819> not<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.209> you

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
a really really important not that you

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.430 
a really really important not that you
need<00:03:25.419> to<00:03:25.540> know<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:25.810> this<00:03:25.930> I'm<00:03:26.139> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.349> show

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
need to know for this I'm going to show

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.680 
need to know for this I'm going to show
you<00:03:26.620> how<00:03:26.799> to<00:03:26.829> tie<00:03:27.129> it<00:03:27.190> with<00:03:27.940> some<00:03:28.180> thicker<00:03:28.389> cord

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
you how to tie it with some thicker cord

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.759 
you how to tie it with some thicker cord
like<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:28.900> because<00:03:29.319> it<00:03:29.440> would<00:03:29.530> be<00:03:29.590> a<00:03:29.620> bit

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
like this because it would be a bit

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.960 
like this because it would be a bit
difficult<00:03:29.949> to<00:03:30.190> see<00:03:30.250> with<00:03:30.400> dental<00:03:30.730> floss

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
difficult to see with dental floss

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.900 
difficult to see with dental floss
so<00:03:31.690> not<00:03:31.870> call<00:03:32.139> the<00:03:32.260> constrictor<00:03:32.859> knot

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
so not call the constrictor knot

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.409 
so not call the constrictor knot
basically<00:03:33.910> you<00:03:34.150> take<00:03:34.389> your<00:03:34.690> piece<00:03:35.500> of<00:03:35.739> cord

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
basically you take your piece of cord

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:40.589 
basically you take your piece of cord
make<00:03:37.419> a<00:03:37.629> loop<00:03:37.959> in<00:03:38.079> it<00:03:38.199> like<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.459> once<00:03:40.449> you've

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
make a loop in it like this once you've

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.809 
make a loop in it like this once you've
got<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:40.840> loop<00:03:41.079> take<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:41.889> piece<00:03:42.280> this<00:03:42.760> piece

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
got that loop take this piece this piece

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.050 
got that loop take this piece this piece
here<00:03:43.389> pass<00:03:44.079> it<00:03:44.230> underneath<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:45.400> part<00:03:45.760> here

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
here pass it underneath this part here

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.080 
here pass it underneath this part here
and<00:03:46.680> over<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.799> top<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.160> see<00:03:48.190> how<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:48.730> flip

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
and over the top you see how the to flip

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.559 
and over the top you see how the to flip
together<00:03:50.310> to<00:03:51.310> make<00:03:51.519> a<00:03:51.790> constrictor<00:03:52.540> knot

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
together to make a constrictor knot

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.770 
together to make a constrictor knot
which<00:03:52.840> is<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.989> really<00:03:53.349> tight<00:03:53.889> non<00:03:54.459> slip<00:03:54.760> knot

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.450 

so<00:04:01.780> let's<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.020> can<00:04:02.170> strict<00:04:02.410> or<00:04:02.500> not<00:04:02.530> I'm<00:04:03.280> now

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
so let's you can strict or not I'm now

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.720 
so let's you can strict or not I'm now
going<00:04:03.640> to<00:04:03.700> lash<00:04:04.440> powerbands<00:04:05.490> onto<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.580> wood

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
going to lash powerbands onto the wood

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.090 
going to lash powerbands onto the wood
using<00:04:07.210> dental<00:04:07.540> floss<00:04:07.900> about<00:04:08.470> an<00:04:08.590> inch<00:04:08.740> of<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
using dental floss about an inch of the

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.010 
using dental floss about an inch of the
power<00:04:09.280> band<00:04:09.520> and<00:04:10.180> bend<00:04:10.420> it<00:04:10.510> over<00:04:10.630> like<00:04:10.870> that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.020 
power band and bend it over like that

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.870 
power band and bend it over like that
and<00:04:11.170> I'm<00:04:11.350> going<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.530> make<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.160> constrictor<00:04:12.850> knot

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
and I'm going to make a constrictor knot

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.990 
and I'm going to make a constrictor knot
and<00:04:13.390> put<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.810> around<00:04:14.260> this<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:15.070> so<00:04:15.820> I'll<00:04:15.880> do

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
and put it around this here so I'll do

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.430 
and put it around this here so I'll do
that<00:04:16.030> with<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.299> dental<00:04:16.630> floss<00:04:16.720> this<00:04:17.019> is<00:04:17.170> quite

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
that with the dental floss this is quite

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.539 
that with the dental floss this is quite
a<00:04:17.470> fiddly<00:04:17.920> job<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:20.350> dental<00:04:20.709> floss<00:04:20.920> is<00:04:21.160> so

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
a fiddly job this dental floss is so

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.480 
a fiddly job this dental floss is so
thin<00:04:22.110> but<00:04:23.110> the<00:04:23.230> great<00:04:23.410> point<00:04:23.680> about<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.920> is<00:04:24.070> is

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
thin but the great point about it is is

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.480 
thin but the great point about it is is
it's<00:04:25.000> really<00:04:25.420> really<00:04:25.600> strong<00:04:29.190> okay<00:04:30.220> so<00:04:30.400> I've

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
it's really really strong okay so I've

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.450 
it's really really strong okay so I've
made<00:04:30.640> a<00:04:30.700> constrictor<00:04:31.240> knot<00:04:31.270> there<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:32.370> want<00:04:33.370> to

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:33.460 
made a constrictor knot there I want to

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.070 
made a constrictor knot there I want to
fold<00:04:33.820> about<00:04:34.030> an<00:04:34.180> inch<00:04:34.360> of<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:34.660> power<00:04:34.870> band

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
fold about an inch of the power band

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.880 
fold about an inch of the power band
over<00:04:35.880> put<00:04:36.880> that<00:04:37.030> around<00:04:37.260> or<00:04:38.260> one<00:04:38.530> end<00:04:38.680> in<00:04:38.770> my

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
over put that around or one end in my

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.730 
over put that around or one end in my
teeth<00:04:40.740> slide<00:04:41.740> it<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:41.950> to<00:04:41.980> where<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.220> need<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:42.430> and

then pull it up now once you've done

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.250 
then pull it up now once you've done
that<00:04:48.090> because<00:04:49.090> dental<00:04:49.270> floss<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.720> waxed<00:04:50.140> and

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
that because dental floss is waxed and

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.810 
that because dental floss is waxed and
there's<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.470> little<00:04:50.770> bit<00:04:51.010> sleepy<00:04:51.280> although<00:04:51.700> the

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
there's a little bit sleepy although the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.730 
there's a little bit sleepy although the
constrictor<00:04:52.270> knot<00:04:52.300> is<00:04:52.510> really<00:04:52.930> good<00:04:53.110> knot<00:04:53.290> it

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
constrictor knot is really good knot it

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.380 
constrictor knot is really good knot it
does<00:04:54.130> have<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.340> tendency<00:04:54.550> to<00:04:54.940> come<00:04:55.060> and<00:04:55.240> done

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:55.390 
does have a tendency to come and done

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.570 
does have a tendency to come and done
when<00:04:55.960> being<00:04:56.260> used<00:04:56.470> with<00:04:56.650> dental<00:04:57.040> floss<00:04:57.280> it's

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
when being used with dental floss it's

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.160 
when being used with dental floss it's
still<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:57.910> best<00:04:58.030> not<00:04:58.270> for<00:04:58.510> the<00:04:58.570> job<00:04:58.810> but<00:04:59.080> you

00:04:59.160 --> 00:04:59.170 
still the best not for the job but you

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.290 
still the best not for the job but you
need<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.410> put<00:04:59.590> a<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.250> overhand<00:05:00.850> knot<00:05:01.120> on

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
need to put a little overhand knot on

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.090 
need to put a little overhand knot on
top<00:05:01.590> like<00:05:02.590> that<00:05:02.800> just<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.520> reinforce<00:05:03.940> it<00:05:05.100> then

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
top like that just to reinforce it then

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.100 
top like that just to reinforce it then
you've<00:05:06.220> got<00:05:06.370> your<00:05:06.490> loop<00:05:06.640> like<00:05:06.850> this<00:05:07.060> which<00:05:07.930> can

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
you've got your loop like this which can

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.740 
you've got your loop like this which can
then<00:05:08.290> stretch<00:05:08.980> over

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.470 

one<00:05:12.750> of<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:12.960> forks<00:05:13.370> like<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.580> there<00:05:15.150> we<00:05:15.210> go

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
one of the forks like that there we go

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.880 
one of the forks like that there we go
that's<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.900> slingshot<00:05:16.380> done<00:05:17.930> and<00:05:18.930> that's<00:05:19.740> how

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:19.890 
that's the slingshot done and that's how

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.370 
that's the slingshot done and that's how
to<00:05:19.950> make<00:05:20.070> a<00:05:20.100> slingshot
