pretty<00:01:37.479> high-tech<00:01:37.630> it<00:01:38.439> is<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:39.700> thing<00:01:39.880> that<00:01:40.060> I

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
pretty high-tech it is one thing that I

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.840 
pretty high-tech it is one thing that I
you<00:01:40.689> know<00:01:40.810> we<00:01:40.990> have<00:01:41.290> been<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.850> loosely

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
you know we have been so loosely

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.240 
you know we have been so loosely
handling<00:01:43.479> these<00:01:43.630> chilies<00:01:44.049> but<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:45.009> want<00:01:45.189> to

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
handling these chilies but you want to

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.249 
handling these chilies but you want to
be<00:01:45.340> careful<00:01:45.729> because<00:01:46.390> that<00:01:46.540> spice<00:01:46.990> can

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
be careful because that spice can

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.440 
be careful because that spice can
translate<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.130> those<00:01:48.369> fingertips<00:01:48.759> so<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
translate to those fingertips so you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
translate to those fingertips so you
don't<00:01:49.600> want<00:01:49.720> to<00:01:49.780> rub<00:01:49.900> your<00:01:50.020> eyes<00:01:50.170> or<00:01:50.409> no<00:01:50.860> no

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.169 
right now and while that's happening we
can<00:02:05.390> do<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.720> very<00:02:05.990> mundane<00:02:06.350> task<00:02:07.100> of<00:02:07.640> peeling

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
can do the very mundane task of peeling

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.020 
can do the very mundane task of peeling
peeling<00:02:08.599> our<00:02:08.899> garlic<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.610> again<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.880> is<00:02:11.000> a

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
peeling our garlic and again this is a

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.370 
peeling our garlic and again this is a
little<00:02:11.270> bit<00:02:11.360> like<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.630> chilli<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:12.050> you<00:02:12.170> like<00:02:12.349> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
little bit like the chilli if you like a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.559 
little bit like the chilli if you like a
very<00:02:12.770> garlicky<00:02:13.069> flavor<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:14.180> can<00:02:14.330> add<00:02:14.540> a

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
very garlicky flavor you can add a

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.240 
very garlicky flavor you can add a
little<00:02:14.840> bit<00:02:14.930> more<00:02:15.050> but<00:02:15.620> for<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:15.890> amount<00:02:16.190> of

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
little bit more but for this amount of

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.970 
little bit more but for this amount of
peppers<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.940> think<00:02:17.330> about<00:02:17.480> four<00:02:17.900> cloves<00:02:18.769> of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
peppers I think about four cloves of

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.440 
peppers I think about four cloves of
garlic<00:02:19.340> would<00:02:19.459> work<00:02:19.700> great<00:02:19.910> so<00:02:22.239> we<00:02:23.239> have<00:02:23.330> our

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
garlic would work great so we have our

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.610 
garlic would work great so we have our
strained<00:02:24.849> rehydrated<00:02:25.849> sponge<00:02:26.810> rehydrated

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
strained rehydrated sponge rehydrated

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.710 
strained rehydrated sponge rehydrated
strains<00:02:28.099> screen<00:02:28.610> put<00:02:29.180> them<00:02:29.330> in<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> blender

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
strains screen put them in the blender

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.780 
strains screen put them in the blender
mm-hmm<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.860> make<00:02:31.160> sure<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.340> get<00:02:31.489> all<00:02:31.640> those

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
mm-hmm we make sure to get all those

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.820 
mm-hmm we make sure to get all those
seeds<00:02:32.150> right<00:02:32.900> because<00:02:33.319> that's<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.680> hot

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
seeds right because that's where the hot

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.590 
seeds right because that's where the hot
power<00:02:34.069> is<00:02:34.340> where<00:02:34.519> some<00:02:34.700> of<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:34.850> hot<00:02:35.030> power<00:02:35.269> is

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
power is where some of the hot power is

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.570 
power is where some of the hot power is
and<00:02:36.350> then<00:02:36.739> we're<00:02:36.860> gonna<00:02:36.980> keep<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.370> water

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and then we're gonna keep the water

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.130 
and then we're gonna keep the water
because<00:02:37.940> we<00:02:38.060> might<00:02:38.239> want<00:02:38.480> if<00:02:38.540> we<00:02:38.660> need<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.810> thin

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
because we might want if we need to thin

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.410 
because we might want if we need to thin
out<00:02:39.319> our<00:02:39.530> hot<00:02:40.310> sauce<00:02:40.519> it's<00:02:40.940> a<00:02:41.030> good<00:02:41.150> thing<00:02:41.299> to

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420

use<00:02:41.540> then<00:02:42.410> next<00:02:43.010> thing<00:02:43.130> we're<00:02:43.280> gonna<00:02:43.370> do<00:02:43.519> is

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
use then next thing we're gonna do is

research about what makes Tabasco sauce

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.910 
research about what makes Tabasco sauce
so<00:03:13.519> delicious<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.269> what<00:03:15.049> they<00:03:15.230> do<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.739> they

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
so delicious and what they do is they

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.069 
so delicious and what they do is they
aged<00:03:16.190> all<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.790> their<00:03:16.940> hot<00:03:17.150> sauce<00:03:17.420> in<00:03:17.720> oak

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
aged all of their hot sauce in oak

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.860 
aged all of their hot sauce in oak
barrels<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:19.730> thought<00:03:19.880> too<00:03:20.090> I<00:03:20.329> thought<00:03:20.570> how

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
barrels and I thought too I thought how

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.810 
barrels and I thought too I thought how
do<00:03:20.930> we<00:03:21.140> get<00:03:21.290> that<00:03:21.440> oaky<00:03:21.829> flavor<00:03:21.980> in<00:03:22.430> this

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
do we get that oaky flavor in this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.569 
do we get that oaky flavor in this
without<00:03:23.390> oak<00:03:23.630> barrels<00:03:23.989> right<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.769> so<00:03:24.980> why

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:25.579 
without oak barrels right and so why

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.670 
without oak barrels right and so why
don't<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:25.790> choose<00:03:26.090> a<00:03:26.150> Spanish<00:03:26.810> sherry<00:03:27.319> that's

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
don't we choose a Spanish sherry that's

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.530 
don't we choose a Spanish sherry that's
aged<00:03:28.130> in<00:03:28.519> oak<00:03:28.640> barrels<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.329> will<00:03:29.420> give

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
aged in oak barrels and that will give

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.420 
aged in oak barrels and that will give
us<00:03:29.569> some<00:03:29.810> of<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:29.989> flavor<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.560> think<00:03:31.160> we'll

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
us some of the flavor I think we'll

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.309 
us some of the flavor I think we'll
start<00:03:31.609> with<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.760> tablespoon<00:03:32.299> of<00:03:32.390> this<00:03:32.540> in<00:03:32.750> also

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
start with a tablespoon of this in also

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:35.259 
start with a tablespoon of this in also
and<00:03:33.560> then<00:03:34.100> we<00:03:34.250> will<00:03:34.370> adjust<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.940> when<00:03:35.150> we

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
and then we will adjust that when we

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.509 
and then we will adjust that when we
need<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.630> what<00:03:36.200> about<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.470> garlic<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.280> put

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519
