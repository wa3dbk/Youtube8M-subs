what tools you need what methods you
should<00:00:39.989> use<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.559> assemble<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.190> order<00:00:41.489> you

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
should use to assemble it what order you

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
should use to assemble it what order you
should<00:00:41.820> assemble<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.329> kinda<00:00:42.629> jig<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
should assemble it kinda jig it how the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
should assemble it kinda jig it how the
pin<00:00:44.010> method<00:00:44.250> works<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:45.030> glues<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.570> use<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.260> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
pin method works what glues to use and a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.660 
pin method works what glues to use and a
whole<00:00:46.530> host<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.950> other<00:00:47.129> things

coming up through this fight from my

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.310 
coming up through this fight from my
tank<00:01:07.190> my<00:01:08.000> zero<00:01:08.300> head<00:01:08.600> level<00:01:08.810> is<00:01:09.050> up<00:01:09.230> about<00:01:09.560> here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
tank my zero head level is up about here

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.850 
tank my zero head level is up about here
the<00:01:11.860> water<00:01:12.100> then<00:01:12.810> there's<00:01:13.810> a<00:01:13.900> tap<00:01:14.200> here<00:01:14.560> that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
the water then there's a tap here that

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.440 
the water then there's a tap here that
will<00:01:15.040> eventually<00:01:15.220> be<00:01:15.580> for<00:01:15.820> my<00:01:15.910> skimmer<00:01:16.240> and

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
will eventually be for my skimmer and

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.900 
will eventually be for my skimmer and
then<00:01:17.050> there<00:01:17.260> is<00:01:17.500> a<00:01:17.860> dream<00:01:18.130> for<00:01:18.190> everything

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
then there is a dream for everything

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.000 
then there is a dream for everything
else<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.870> water<00:01:20.020> comes<00:01:20.380> through<00:01:20.650> here<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
else the water comes through here and

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.760 
else the water comes through here and
goes<00:01:21.190> into<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.520> mesh<00:01:21.760> filter<00:01:22.270> and<00:01:23.050> then<00:01:23.440> it<00:01:23.590> goes

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
goes into a mesh filter and then it goes

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.890 
goes into a mesh filter and then it goes
down<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:24.490> area<00:01:24.730> is<00:01:25.030> actually<00:01:25.240> for<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:25.750> mess

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
down this area is actually for the mess

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.820 
down this area is actually for the mess
filter<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.710> hang<00:01:27.040> down<00:01:28.050> if<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.260> bubbles<00:01:29.590> keep

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
filter to hang down if the bubbles keep

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.800 
filter to hang down if the bubbles keep
pulling<00:01:30.160> it<00:01:30.190> up<00:01:30.400> so<00:01:30.730> it's<00:01:31.210> just<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.480> way<00:01:31.600> it<00:01:31.690> is

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
pulling it up so it's just the way it is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.650 
pulling it up so it's just the way it is
it<00:01:32.380> then<00:01:32.650> goes<00:01:32.920> through<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:33.340> hole<00:01:33.700> here<00:01:34.090> goes

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
it then goes through a hole here goes

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.660 
it then goes through a hole here goes
through<00:01:34.960> some<00:01:35.140> Rockwell's<00:01:35.620> hole<00:01:35.800> not<00:01:36.130> all<00:01:36.400> the

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
through some Rockwell's hole not all the

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.580 
through some Rockwell's hole not all the
rock<00:01:36.850> rubble<00:01:37.180> is<00:01:37.300> in<00:01:37.450> place<00:01:37.690> here<00:01:38.260> let<00:01:38.380> me<00:01:38.440> move

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
rock rubble is in place here let me move

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.560 
rock rubble is in place here let me move
the<00:01:38.770> camera<00:01:38.980> you'll<00:01:39.850> get<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> better<00:01:40.210> view<00:01:40.480> of

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
the camera you'll get a better view of

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.690 
the camera you'll get a better view of
what<00:01:40.870> I'm<00:01:40.960> talking<00:01:41.170> about

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 

there<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.300> go<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.080> you<00:01:49.260> can<00:01:49.500> see<00:01:49.650> the<00:01:49.770> water

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
there you go so you can see the water

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.149 
there you go so you can see the water
comes<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.550> the<00:01:50.670> rock<00:01:50.850> rubble<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:52.080> is<00:01:52.409> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
comes up to the rock rubble this is a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.000 
comes up to the rock rubble this is a
bypass<00:01:53.729> valve<00:01:54.120> so<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:55.050> drops<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.620> through

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
bypass valve so this drops down through

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.210 
bypass valve so this drops down through
here<00:01:56.400> and<00:01:56.780> there's<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> valve<00:01:58.140> underneath<00:01:58.950> here

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
here and there's a valve underneath here

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.890 
here and there's a valve underneath here
that<00:01:59.250> allows<00:01:59.640> me<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.970> adjust<00:02:00.300> how<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.540> water

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
that allows me to adjust how much water

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.930 
that allows me to adjust how much water
goes<00:02:01.140> through<00:02:01.200> here<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> purpose<00:02:02.790> of

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
goes through here and the purpose of

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.940 
goes through here and the purpose of
this<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.660> regulate<00:02:04.080> how<00:02:04.440> much<00:02:04.619> water<00:02:04.860> goes

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
this is to regulate how much water goes

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.180 
this is to regulate how much water goes
to<00:02:05.310> Norma<00:02:05.580> kitchen<00:02:06.470> now<00:02:07.470> if<00:02:07.590> you've<00:02:07.710> seen<00:02:07.740> some

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to Norma kitchen now if you've seen some

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.880 
to Norma kitchen now if you've seen some
of<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.310> other<00:02:08.429> videos<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.240> know<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.890> I've

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
of my other videos you know that I've

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.360 
of my other videos you know that I've
taken<00:02:11.220> a<00:02:11.550> overflow<00:02:12.330> design<00:02:12.980> that's<00:02:13.980> commonly

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
taken a overflow design that's commonly

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.370 
taken a overflow design that's commonly
called<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.030> bean<00:02:15.239> animal<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.080> I've<00:02:16.200> done

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
called the bean animal and I've done

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.949 
called the bean animal and I've done
some<00:02:16.530> things<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:16.890> I<00:02:16.980> think<00:02:17.040> improve<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.690> I

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
some things that I think improve it so I

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.520 
some things that I think improve it so I
use<00:02:19.590> two<00:02:20.280> primary<00:02:20.970> overflow<00:02:21.690> drains<00:02:22.020> also

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
use two primary overflow drains also

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.440 
use two primary overflow drains also
third<00:02:22.739> backup<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.580> right<00:02:24.000> now<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.180> have<00:02:24.420> it

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
third backup and right now I have it

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.120 
third backup and right now I have it
adjusted<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.410> backup<00:02:25.620> drips

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
adjusted so that the backup drips

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.800 
adjusted so that the backup drips
constantly<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:28.560> allows<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:30.060> water<00:02:30.600> not

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
constantly and that allows the water not

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.550 
constantly and that allows the water not
to<00:02:30.959> get<00:02:31.110> stale<00:02:31.380> that's<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:31.800> there<00:02:33.019> so<00:02:34.019> this<00:02:34.500> is

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
to get stale that's in there so this is

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.100 
to get stale that's in there so this is
my<00:02:35.220> refugium<00:02:35.790> underneath<00:02:36.450> here<00:02:36.780> is<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
my refugium underneath here is the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.360 
my refugium underneath here is the
actual<00:02:37.560> return<00:02:37.950> sunk<00:02:38.570> again<00:02:39.570> let<00:02:39.900> me<00:02:39.930> move<00:02:40.110> it

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
actual return sunk again let me move it

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.310 
actual return sunk again let me move it
okay<00:02:41.370> so<00:02:41.489> in<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.510> area<00:02:42.870> I'll<00:02:43.019> eventually

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
okay so in this area I'll eventually

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.170 
okay so in this area I'll eventually
have<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:43.739> deep<00:02:43.950> sand<00:02:44.310> bed<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.670> about<00:02:44.910> four

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
have a deep sand bed of about four

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.850 
have a deep sand bed of about four
inches<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.650> I'll<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:48.230> algae<00:02:49.230> macro

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
inches and then I'll have algae macro

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.940 
inches and then I'll have algae macro
algae<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.340> grows<00:02:50.610> here<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:51.900> have<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.799> digital

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
algae that grows here I have a digital

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.699 
algae that grows here I have a digital
aquatic<00:02:53.519> treat<00:02:53.730> keeper<00:02:54.150> system<00:02:54.600> but<00:02:55.440> they

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
aquatic treat keeper system but they

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.789 
aquatic treat keeper system but they
have<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.070> been<00:02:56.220> able<00:02:56.310> to<00:02:56.430> produce<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:57.799> salt

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
have not been able to produce a salt

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.949 
have not been able to produce a salt
probe<00:02:59.130> or<00:02:59.459> salinity<00:02:59.970> probe<00:03:00.180> since<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.570> found<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
probe or salinity probe since I found it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.759 
probe or salinity probe since I found it
so<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.470> have<00:03:01.829> an<00:03:02.070> expensive<00:03:03.440> specific<00:03:04.440> gravity

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
so I have an expensive specific gravity

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.300 
so I have an expensive specific gravity
meter<00:03:05.269> I'm<00:03:06.269> using<00:03:06.570> an<00:03:06.870> inexpensive<00:03:07.140> roof<00:03:08.040> type

it<00:05:05.309> goes<00:05:05.550> up<00:05:06.259> there's<00:05:07.259> another<00:05:07.849> union<00:05:08.849> here<00:05:09.059> so

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:09.269 
it goes up there's another union here so

00:05:09.269 --> 00:05:11.179 
it goes up there's another union here so
I<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.479> do<00:05:09.569> maintenance<00:05:09.869> on<00:05:10.199> on<00:05:10.589> the<00:05:10.739> pump<00:05:10.979> if<00:05:11.099> I

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:11.189 
I can do maintenance on on the pump if I

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:13.399 
I can do maintenance on on the pump if I
need<00:05:11.399> to<00:05:11.580> there's<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:12.389> valve<00:05:12.659> to<00:05:12.929> cut<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.229> off

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.409 
need to there's a valve to cut this off

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:15.229 
need to there's a valve to cut this off
and<00:05:13.709> then<00:05:13.830> there's<00:05:13.979> a<00:05:14.069> one-way<00:05:14.369> flow<00:05:14.610> valve<00:05:14.909> so

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:15.239 
and then there's a one-way flow valve so

00:05:15.239 --> 00:05:17.359 
and then there's a one-way flow valve so
that<00:05:15.419> if<00:05:15.539> something<00:05:15.779> ever<00:05:15.989> happens<00:05:16.529> my<00:05:17.099> tank

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:20.350 
that if something ever happens my tank
does<00:05:17.610> not<00:05:17.789> drain<00:05:18.029> back<00:05:18.300> into<00:05:18.330> my<00:05:18.929> sump<00:05:19.229> and

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
does not drain back into my sump and

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.290 
does not drain back into my sump and
here<00:05:21.360> you<00:05:21.569> see<00:05:21.779> the<00:05:22.610> return<00:05:23.610> line<00:05:23.909> from<00:05:24.179> the
