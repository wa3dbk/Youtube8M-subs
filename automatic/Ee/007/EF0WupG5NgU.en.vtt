00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.200
 hi girls then today i want to do 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.240
 this video dedicated to serves a little 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.059
 to instagram photos because i receive 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.549
 always lots of filter requests 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.530
 that I use on the light effects of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.270
 photos etcetera etc. I show 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.460
 all the waters all the effects all 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.920
 what uses point in my photos 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.269
 on instagram all the apps I use 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.470
 for the photographs are in this 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 folder now I'll show you how 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.400
 I 've been editing my selphy for a while now 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.620
 discovered this so I wanted to make you from 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:41.789
 know is called face tune here I go 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 to import the photo usually that 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.680
 I do go to correct if I have 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:50.030
 some pimples some imperfection 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.859
 I make the image in a big way 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.340
 clicco smooth so it takes away precisely 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:59.699
 the imperfections of the skin and then I go 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.829
 simply to pass over the image 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.829
 in this way here is an elf 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.420
 ok by pressing here at the bottom right 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.280
 you can see the first one and the next one is not there 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.610
 I have taken away a great deal of difference 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.040
 some eyeshadow pleats here and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.140
 then some pimple when I want that 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.300
 the colors are beautiful especially strong 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.620
 I have to tell you more about landscapes than with 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.410
 self I go on wired peak is select blue 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:38.520
 sky that makes my colors very much 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.230
 stronger and brighter in this case not 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.270
 I'm going to emphasize the colors because 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.490
 anyway, I usually do it 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.140
 in landscapes when I photograph some 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.880
 produced other things you ask me in 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.650
 lots of how do i add 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.170
 light effects and hearts etcetera 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.600
 etc. this app is called piquet fax 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.440
 that allows me to do it now vi 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.180
 I show how to select mine 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.040
 picture spike chrome 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:08.310
 and then here I go to choose light and here 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.830
 there are all the effects I use 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:16.250
 here they are usually here 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.530
 little stars and little hearts 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.690
 here we are at times then I use that but 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.250
 plus because I like the filters of 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.250
 this patriots I show 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.300
 here they are, I really like it 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.690
 here then there are other apps he uses 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 a little more rarely this serves for 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.760
 double the image has effect 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.910
 mirror is this instead in st size mi 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.160
 need if I want to load the preview 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.530
 of the videos on mixed media that you do n't like 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.100
 size and different from a shape 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.570
 rectangular apple narrows and causes that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.120
 I can also upload to instagram 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:58.290
 now this does not interest us is then 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 what i do for the selphy and go 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:07.019
 on instagram load the photo I click next 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.510
 then I click on the settings I go to 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.750
 modify in case there is need if the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.850
 photo maybe it is 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.210
 a lot of dark I'm going to increase a 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.820
 the brightness in this way i 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:22.900
 contrasts here too you can play a 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.070
 bit right now I do not go 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.450
 change it 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:30.610
 these usually do not touch is one thing 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.959
 that I always do is instead use 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:37.650
 sharper to make the image more more 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.490
 defined rendering mar makes the photo more 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:44.440
 thus defined thus evola 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.680
 basically my photo is ready for 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.970
 being loaded I don't always do 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.830
 all this I wanted you to see a 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.600
 pear because you ask me very much 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.190
 often these are all the apps that 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.050
 use for my photos on instagram 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.280
 I really hope I answered them all 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.500
 how many your questions 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.739
 some other trick that I want you 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.989
 give to position the phone when 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.880
 you take a picture the best thing is 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.880
 take less I do the advice I keep 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.770
 always in front it is slightly above 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.660
 not that much because I see some photos 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.799
 that seem to be taken from the ceiling 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.590
 another thing I want to advise you 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.880
 because I see so many photos on instagram 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.950
 but they are dark 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.450
 the best thing when you take one 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.570
 photos also for videos and this is worth a 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.610
 for everything it is always to put on 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.350
 in front of one I end up in a source of 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.360
 light the best thing is sunlight 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.220
 better they are window bellardi and with 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.400
 lots of light and this will help 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.190
 certainly to make it better 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.990
 in short your photos and no boys 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.580
 that's all for today maybe later 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.100
 I will make you an updated video because 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.080
 I always discover lots of new apps for 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.180
 the bikes on easter in three but don't kiss 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.180
 one to the next bye
