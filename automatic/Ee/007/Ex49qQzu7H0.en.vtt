going to be talking to you about the

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to be talking to you about the
importance<00:00:08.250> of<00:00:08.309> footwork<00:00:08.639> on<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.910> overhead

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
importance of footwork on the overhead

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.020 
importance of footwork on the overhead
oftentimes<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.070> players<00:00:11.459> when<00:00:11.879> they're

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
oftentimes I see players when they're

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.430 
oftentimes I see players when they're
playing<00:00:12.150> they're<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.629> the<00:00:12.719> volley<00:00:12.900> position

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
playing they're in the volley position

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.020 
playing they're in the volley position
and<00:00:13.950> whenever<00:00:14.070> they've<00:00:14.339> over<00:00:14.579> head<00:00:14.700> goes<00:00:14.849> up

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
and whenever they've over head goes up

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.760 
and whenever they've over head goes up
in<00:00:15.150> there<00:00:15.299> they<00:00:15.509> stay<00:00:15.749> facing<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.289> court<00:00:16.560> and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
in there they stay facing the court and

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.040 
in there they stay facing the court and
they<00:00:17.070> move<00:00:17.280> back<00:00:17.550> tipped<00:00:18.330> over<00:00:18.540> head<00:00:18.840> like

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
they move back tipped over head like

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.840 
they move back tipped over head like
this<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.530> this<00:00:19.950> is<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.370> problem<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:20.730> that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
this and this is the problem with that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.550 
this and this is the problem with that
is<00:00:21.030> that<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.720> contact<00:00:22.140> point<00:00:22.380> on<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
is that the contact point on the

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.430 
is that the contact point on the
overhead<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.520> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.820> see<00:00:24.440> my

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
overhead is here and as you can see my

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
overhead is here and as you can see my
ball<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.770> going<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.920> go<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> wrong

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
like this is hard for me to cover ground

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
like this is hard for me to cover ground
i'm<00:01:37.229> not<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.530> balanced<00:01:38.039> i<00:01:38.189> stand<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.609> chance

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
i'm not very balanced i stand the chance

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.310 
i'm not very balanced i stand the chance
