00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.090
 I 'm telling you 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.180
 plus 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.790
 do not 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.790
 t 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.540
 and 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:23.590
 or not 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.850
 Let's see 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.070
 What's up 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:02:01.210
 now the game is very important 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.890
 against the pointer and with claw and with 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.280
 everyone's effort we could take out the 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.690
 party forward much claw between all 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 we all supported each other even though they expelled us 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.470
 to one but we have to keep fighting 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.930
 so we get expelled we have to be with 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.380
 everything there to throw us head for that is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.810
 that's why he called us the one 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.400
 always bringing out that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.820
 feature that we have not 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 in the claw that is always comes out in the 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.900
 party if it's important that can not be 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.420
 losing one of the categories has to 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.830
 lose your grip on the water the commitment 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.280
 of us is to win all matches 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.380
 if we want to champion we had drawn 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.910
 half of reaching the tip and swallowing 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.250
 the tip we had to beat everyone 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.530
 the teams the first three matches 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.720
 they are won that rescues from your 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.290
 players that he did today in the field of 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.720
 game beyond the 2 to 1 good the order 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.020
 the tactical order and the effort in the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.300
 team at all times never play 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.710
 he never lowered his arms and we work for 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.150
 the triumph in all in all 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.150
 landmarks in the countryside
