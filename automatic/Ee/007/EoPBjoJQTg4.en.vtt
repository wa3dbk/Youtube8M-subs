00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone with you shrimp today we 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.020
 Consider a rather unusual mod. 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 which will add helicopters to the game but 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.429
 This is not ordinary helicopters for 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 passenger transportation and these are the most 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.619
 real combat and let's see 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.869
 what they are and what 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.289
 they are generally capable and the very first 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.810
 the helicopter is called hey hey 64 and let's 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.029
 perhaps his zaspuna and as you can see 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.429
 This helicopter looks pretty 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.070
 seriously well and now perhaps let's 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.870
 crawled into the cockpit for this to us 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.420
 you need to hover over the helicopter and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.879
 click the right mouse button now our 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.700
 the helicopter automatically wound up and already 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.860
 ready to take off the truth of this helicopter 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.170
 there is one single minus is 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 he is that he is not very heavy 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 management but I think it's not like that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.449
 too, and a serious problem as well 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.370
 how does this helicopter military have it 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.230
 quick weapon called 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 chain gandhi tom to start from it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.440
 shooting you need to click on the right 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.420
 mouse button 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.880
 Well, accordingly, this machine guns 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.189
 there is a small recharge every 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.350
 15 shots also if you are now 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.510
 look at the bottom left of the screen 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.479
 you will see three very necessary and 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 indispensable instrument is compass tachometer 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.570
 and hours 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 Well, who does not know what a tachometer is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.830
 such a device that shows 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.229
 engine crankshaft speed 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.810
 well or roughly speaking it measures power 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.880
 engine and in this helicopter it just 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.100
 necessary for example and can slow down 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.650
 helicopter rotor speed that 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.750
 pretty good feature 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.180
 Well, I also think that the clock is 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.280
 The interface of this helicopter is also no less 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.890
 useful with them you can accurately 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.259
 determine game time meant how much 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.899
 morning comes or just give a hint 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.360
 I also forgot to pass a passerby 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.009
 note one very important fact fly 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 on this helicopter you can how many 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.570
 please since he doesn't have a gas tank and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.759
 accordingly not what kind of fuel is it not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.619
 it is probably possible in it initially 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210
 was built perpetual motion well or 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.540
 something like that 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.390
 Well, and now let's get out of and from 64 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.840
 consider the remaining two helicopters if 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.700
 h 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.129
 they are almost the same 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.530
 among themselves, except that only external 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.709
 form original color's example 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.660
 a helicopter called hey hey 6 from their 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.300
 fellow he differs only in his 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.819
 shape slender machine gun if in the first 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.430
 the helicopter stood a changan machine gun if i 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.280
 not mistaken and shot them 15 shots 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.379
 then this machine gun is called a minigun and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.870
 recharged it after only 100 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.120
 shots well and the third most recent 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 the helicopter is no different from the very 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.500
 first only if this 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.200
 specific military paint but also in 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.510
 principle on this probably all here is 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.239
 awesome mod adding helicopters to 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.670
 Maynkavt today we looked at you 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.190
 and with you there was a shrimp subscribe to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.329
 my channel put likes before meeting and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.870
 good luck to you 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:09.980
 been on an end and chips and picking on 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:16.380
 internal but for now hours we added 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.220
 danger job one pickaxe. nick became to 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.120
 son man's you cancel 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.120
 staged
