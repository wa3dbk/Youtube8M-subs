00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 I want to share with you the photo that the 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:08.099
 joao batista would do great caico 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.599
 from the north sent John is a police officer and 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.240
 that the black horse has been a great 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 partner in the work of the mounted police 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.109
 it is also resistant to 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.750
 perfectly adapted to the climate 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.180
 semiarid 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.029
 with the word man from the field 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 Sponsorship of Malacara boots and boutiques is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.789
 higher 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 the rustic with the right measure of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.340
 Today's participation is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.829
 of Campinas Sao Paulo and that writes us 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.690
 is the fable resends it says the following 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.910
 valeria has a mangalarga horse 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 Paulista but I want to try 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.760
 a Creole horse for his reports 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.680
 I see that it is a great animal but 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 watching the videos I found the Creole with 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 A little low stature is normal of breed 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 or is this my impression or responding 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.699
 The question of the fab already making the rescue 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.309
 history or the history that 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.829
 have shaped the Creole race in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 five centuries ago the horses of the race 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.750
 Spanish was a horse known for 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.110
 small size but a height 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.790
 considered today a height is relevant 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.189
 around 1 meter 46 1 meter and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.590
 forty-eight in height are these 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:21.479
 horses are the forerunners of the breed 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 Creole and basically was arrived at 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.540
 to the racial state we know today 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 is guided by associations is more 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.619
 traditional breeds as an association 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.659
 that was a dictatorship of course 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.259
 within the standard ratio of 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.020
 of the creole breed is then he 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.270
 is included among the measures of a 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.720
 meters and 50 meters to 50 meters 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.979
 males and one meter and 38 and one meter 48 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.140
 for females there is this 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.360
 basically 10 centimeters difference 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.250
 to understand the various lineages 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.860
 some images that reproduce animals 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.140
 a slightly higher cut in agencies where 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 of animals of a smaller size but 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 basically by keeping the center of the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.720
 gravity of the horse a little closer 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.490
 of the ground are horses with 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.390
 a very great vocation for the work 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.580
 with governments then they need to have 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.160
 certain proportionality 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.450
 within their measures which may 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.450
 develop your movements very well
