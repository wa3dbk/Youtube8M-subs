00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.160
 Which means when someone says, "This bike has soul." 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.040
 How do we recognize its existence? 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.780
 Generally, the soul is the self. 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.940
 the "I" that inhabits the body, and acts through it. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.580
 So, can we meet her on a motorcycle? 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.620
 In my opinion, yes. We can. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.060
 I'm not saying that all bikes really have a soul. 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.800
 But there are some who seem to have it. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.380
 That's what I'm going to talk about in the next few minutes. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460
 Welcome, 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.640
 to Racer TV. 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.980
 So if you are looking for a soulful bike, try to find a good old Moto. 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.880
 I think I can share, that my little Honda CB 125, is definitely in that category. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.160
 Every time I use it, it seems to have some kind of will of its own. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.540
 Sometimes the engine picks up at first. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.140
 And other times, not even that. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.300
 There are days when he's doing wonderfully well. 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.400
 But not every day. 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.060
 From far to far, there are times when the front wheel shakes at 50 km / h. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.580
 as if afraid. 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.420
 And when the engine is cold, a small rater will occur at the first (brake) braking. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.580
 It is in this kind of times when the owner needs to learn some ritual techniques, 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.460
 to handle the bike in the best possible way. 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.240
 As if Moto needed a little attention and some care to work properly. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.740
 That's why people often say, "That Moto seems to know your Owner." 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.120
 And this is what I consider, "A Moto with a Soul". 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:53.860
 I recognize that some new and modern motorcycles may have a strong personality or even character. 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.080
 But technically, they are too perfect. 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:06.340
 Because every time we use them, they will behave exactly the way they are waiting. 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.880
 But with old bikes, every day is different. 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.520
 There are always things that seem to come from a certain will of the bike. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.280
 As if it were transmitting emotions. 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.240
 Touching the soul of the driver. 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.500
 And to provide a life, with latitude. 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.360
 What more could we wish for, from a good old Cafe Racer. 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.380
 Thank you for watching Racer TV. 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.960
 And as always, 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.420
 I hope to see you next week.
