00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.640
 seeds here are specific the 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.000
 let's do the following way 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.769
 it's going to be seeds that have that kind 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.749

 have you said and the next week or the 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.100
 next day I have a seed with that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.600
 youtube the specific agree or 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.730
 the seed of that youtube in specific 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.520
 with everything that version 1.2 of 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.140
 agreement guys if you like this idea 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.940
 let's put a limit of 500 likes 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.590
 we reach 500 likes means that 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.980
 you want me to do this kind of series of 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.140
 agreement 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.420
 of the seeds so nothing said that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.730
 let's start today is 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.500
 obviously untied laces for 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:19.540
 start the series unleashes 2 hd with c 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.070
 uppercase d uppercase hyd too 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.570
 capital letters we're going to put them in creative 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:28.670
 and the seeds laces untie 2 hd 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.680
 we are going to create it because without pressure 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.240
 point 8 pin pin that starts generating 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.530
 there that is charging the world is 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.650
 generating the land by building the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 ground and once done as you see 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.420
 I leave just this this is from me 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.490
 with minecraft he knows that I hate the rain 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.960
 and that's why the desert appears next 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.570
 because you already know that in the desert 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.280
 it rains then it's wonderful agreement 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.220
 you have some saved do not be careful 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.930
 behind the typical but you will tell me and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.780
 cords there is no more in this seed this 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.190
 it's the beginning and the end, not guys, not you 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.560
 I explained before that it was more seed very 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.300
 simple is the one of cordes to all but 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.360
 it was so simple that it was the best seed 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.380
 for me to be able to start guys what 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:12.970
 you have to do is nothing else to start 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.530
 run at these coordinates minus 711 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.430
 store height good height is different 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.430
 no thousand 18 with you want here very low 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.230
 untied laces 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.620
 there is 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.130
 he is the one who has capitalized it 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.950
 forgive me guys we put minus 771 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.580
 who has been a feito such or a thousand 18 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.680
 they are worth 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.040
 just these coordinates here and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.840
 in agreement , this is where you have 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.310
 that start building is worth because I 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.370
 I have made the seed from this 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.390
 what you see here is an island 6 the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 dwarf is worth as you see there is the end the 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.380
 surround water water water and there is the end 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.600
 that is, it is in anda but that has this 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.140
 island that is special this island that 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:11.530
 the center has a village with 1 2 3 and 4 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.440
 crops ie potatoes carrots 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.600
 and free wheat here you have it already 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.520
 because if you start it here 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.780
 apart you are on foot there is apart from the 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.760
 villagers you can make a farm 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.770
 very nice villagers you have also 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.750
 horses cows sheep and pigs that had 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.730
 here are the pigs pigs 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.459
 you will feel all the animals in the 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.650
 own island is worth apart from having things 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.300
 green and others obviously you will tell me 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 hear and the way in which we think the 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.140
 to take out because here so I see no 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.790
 there is no single tree is apt you see there 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.739
 right there you have your tree 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.410
 okay agreement 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.060
 you have sand and others to pierre all the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.590
 crystal of the world and more and then apart 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.750
 from the cave I do not have to the cave the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.690
 program only brings that but for this 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.850
 side we found this beautiful cave 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:02.260
 it 's a pass of how it's been 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.420
 generated and what good tickets and has 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.069
 You can go to different places of 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.079
 agreement is a gigantic one that runs 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:08.560
 the whole island in that cave we're going to 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:11.040
 find 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.799
 You can also give here 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.239
 we are going to find a path to lava 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.269
 there's all of us guys we're going to 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:21.810
 find in that cave two things to the side 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.229
 here right here next to us we have a 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:31.050
 skeletons stand that is in less 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:35.930
 784 height 100 955 such that here height 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.930
 it does not have the height of 35 but good 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.580
 like this night vision 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.070
 and here is a skeletons spam with two 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.890
 chests between them we have a mount 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.180
 of iron and a saddle is worth saying 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.530
 that takes them we were up already 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.770
 we would have our own horse for 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.660
 go around the island some food something 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.120
 rope rope that suits us well and a 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.460
 water bucket then also also 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.990
 we would have more wheat other armor 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.090
 iron with another antilles saddle 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.880
 reviled horses some gunpowder something 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.860
 of the rest a music disc and another 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.690
 cubit is better apart than you can 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.560
 make a written farm because if 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.600
 on the island it's worth it because if you look 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.390
 you have arrived here here is the spam 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.340
 right here and there we have the island is 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.530
 say about 15 blocks from the island is 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.670
 say that you have a farm on your own 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.800
 island that you can do things 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.570

 I release without problems that we have more 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:53.159
 below here we are 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:55.620
 at least 875 35 in height 1,112 us 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.659
 let's find a ballet dungeon in 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.819
 this mcmoran I think that over here there is 

00:05:57.659 --> 00:06:02.280
 That is we 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:05.069
 this here in which there is another mount 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.860
 more and watermelons santiagueros del 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:10.530
 ballet melon seeds that always 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.770
 it comes very very very well something iron and 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.840
 Lapis it is not bad what 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.270
 we can find the part of here 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.310
 we will surely find ourselves in this 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:25.729
 I do not remember where, but I 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.729
 I saw before there is an east of poisonous spiders 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.120
 sometimes we see it here 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:36.010
 we are not seeing it 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.530
 do not see it, do not find it right now 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.850
 but over here there is a expand laws 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.260
 risky therefore you also have 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.520
 we could make a spider farm 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.340
 poisonous according we would have 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.740
 skeletons and spiders - as because if 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:49.139
 free 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.780
 what else do we have, you will tell me hey and the 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:54.150
 pumpkin where he took it out look at your 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.979
 commit suicide is worth a moment so that 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:00.030
 see what and nothing else start anything else 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:04.650
 start to see if we see it I remember 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:06.750
 here in the sheet there are the veis 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.960
 just start right here 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.250
 pumpkins is therefore worth in the 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.860
 populated we had all the ingredients 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:17.360
 here pumpkins the other we have the 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.360
 melons by the way that's what 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:22.000
 eye to the data look at this generation guys 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.090
 let's finish with this generation what 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.990
 what are you talking about we have pumpkins 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.990
 we have 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.650
 the pumpkins here later in the village 

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:33.539
 carrots cakes and wheat then also 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.340
 under the town we have the melons 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:37.080
 so we have all the crops 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.610
 besides the island itself brings all the 

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.560
 animals that we can tame 

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.180
 some way except the threadbare but there 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.199
 a social end with which you go a 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.340
 little exploration that are a 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:47.470
 little that you already have it 

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.970
 and then you also have terminal years and 

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:51.220
 you have everything, that is, easier than 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.630
 an impossible seed you like to give and 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.940
