use<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.210> option<00:01:44.689> key<00:01:44.899> just<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.200> erase<00:01:45.530> this

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
use the option key just to erase this

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.679 
use the option key just to erase this
little<00:01:46.189> bit<00:01:46.369> here<00:01:46.670> that<00:01:46.700> went<00:01:46.999> on<00:01:47.119> her<00:01:47.240> eyelash

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
I change the exposure for example so if

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.600 
I change the exposure for example so if
I<00:02:12.110> bring<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.440> exposure<00:02:12.770> up<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.250> really

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
some sharpness not too much though

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.640 
some sharpness not too much though
because<00:02:47.090> obviously<00:02:47.510> if<00:02:47.960> you<00:02:48.050> go<00:02:48.170> too<00:02:48.230> much

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
because obviously if you go too much

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.440 
because obviously if you go too much
with<00:02:48.890> it<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.130> kind<00:02:49.580> of<00:02:49.640> looks<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:49.880> little<00:02:49.940> kooky

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
with it it kind of looks a little kooky

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.480 
with it it kind of looks a little kooky
so<00:02:51.230> just<00:02:51.440> a<00:02:51.500> little<00:02:51.560> bit<00:02:51.740> of<00:02:51.860> sharpness<00:02:52.130> just

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
so just a little bit of sharpness just

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.000 
so just a little bit of sharpness just
to<00:02:52.580> sharpen<00:02:52.790> things<00:02:53.090> up<00:02:53.330> just<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.660> hair<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:54.110> I'm

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
to sharpen things up just a hair and I'm

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.520 
to sharpen things up just a hair and I'm
going<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.190> add<00:02:55.400> some<00:02:55.910> contrast<00:02:56.870> I'm<00:02:57.230> sorry

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530

clarity actually interesting how the
clarity<00:03:07.060> really<00:03:08.060> brings<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.630> together<00:03:08.810> like

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
clarity really brings it together like

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.670 
clarity really brings it together like
that<00:03:09.350> okay<00:03:10.010> cool<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.670> now<00:03:11.570> so<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:12.320> done

something like that just a little bit

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.680 
something like that just a little bit
like<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:30.880> maybe<00:05:31.880> I'll<00:05:32.000> take<00:05:32.120> the<00:05:32.270> clarity

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
like that maybe I'll take the clarity

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:39.190 
like that maybe I'll take the clarity
down<00:05:32.900> just<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.290> hair<00:05:33.320> and<00:05:37.840> they'll<00:05:38.840> take<00:05:39.050> the

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
down just a hair and they'll take the

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.080 
down just a hair and they'll take the
sharpness<00:05:39.500> down<00:05:39.830> just<00:05:40.100> a<00:05:40.160> little<00:05:40.370> bit<00:05:40.490> as<00:05:40.610> well

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.510 

and<00:05:44.090> let's<00:05:44.900> see<00:05:45.170> well<00:05:45.620> let<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:46.010> saturation

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:46.520 
and let's see well let the saturation

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.160 
and let's see well let the saturation
we'll<00:05:46.910> just<00:05:47.090> bring<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.330> saturation<00:05:47.510> down

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
we'll just bring the saturation down

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.200 
we'll just bring the saturation down
just<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.560> little<00:05:48.800> bit<00:05:51.490> now<00:05:52.490> it<00:05:52.610> looks<00:05:52.760> black<00:05:52.970> and

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
just a little bit now it looks black and

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.450 
just a little bit now it looks black and
white<00:05:53.360> we'll<00:05:53.600> bring<00:05:53.720> it<00:05:53.840> down<00:05:53.960> to<00:05:54.110> there<00:05:54.460> and

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
white we'll bring it down to there and

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.230 
white we'll bring it down to there and
we'll<00:05:56.300> just<00:05:56.330> add<00:05:56.660> a<00:05:56.690> tiny<00:05:57.200> tiny<00:05:57.560> bit<00:05:57.740> more

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
we'll just add a tiny tiny bit more

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.130 
we'll just add a tiny tiny bit more
because<00:05:59.240> obviously<00:05:59.420> I<00:05:59.690> don't<00:05:59.840> want<00:05:59.960> to<00:06:00.020> see

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
because obviously I don't want to see

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.940 
because obviously I don't want to see
lines<00:06:00.500> from<00:06:01.100> this<00:06:02.470> somewhere<00:06:03.470> like<00:06:03.710> that

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950 
lines from this somewhere like that

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.220 
lines from this somewhere like that
that's<00:06:04.310> actually<00:06:04.790> pretty<00:06:05.300> pretty<00:06:05.660> pretty

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
that's actually pretty pretty pretty

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.500 
that's actually pretty pretty pretty
cool<00:06:06.530> somewhere<00:06:07.250> in<00:06:07.370> that<00:06:07.400> range<00:06:07.730> okay<00:06:08.270> cool

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
cool somewhere in that range okay cool

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:11.290 
cool somewhere in that range okay cool
so<00:06:08.720> that's<00:06:09.500> it<00:06:09.800> so<00:06:10.280> watch<00:06:10.490> what<00:06:10.670> happens<00:06:11.030> now

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
so that's it so watch what happens now

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.540 
so that's it so watch what happens now
if<00:06:11.840> I<00:06:12.050> turn<00:06:12.260> off<00:06:12.440> this<00:06:12.650> effect<00:06:13.040> that<00:06:13.220> I<00:06:13.280> just

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
if I turn off this effect that I just

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.870 
if I turn off this effect that I just
added<00:06:16.450> you<00:06:17.450> can<00:06:17.600> see<00:06:17.780> how<00:06:17.930> much<00:06:18.080> redder<00:06:18.350> it<00:06:18.530> was

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
added you can see how much redder it was

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.980 
added you can see how much redder it was
so<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.060> just<00:06:20.330> is<00:06:20.450> a<00:06:20.480> subtle<00:06:20.960> difference

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:20.990 
so that just is a subtle difference

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.870 
so that just is a subtle difference
there<00:06:21.500> just<00:06:21.740> brought<00:06:22.010> those<00:06:22.250> things<00:06:22.640> down

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 
there just brought those things down

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.550 
there just brought those things down
just<00:06:22.910> a<00:06:23.270> little<00:06:23.300> bit<00:06:23.540> so<00:06:23.810> let's<00:06:24.080> zoom<00:06:24.140> out<00:06:24.410> of

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
just a little bit so let's zoom out of

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.790 
just a little bit so let's zoom out of
this<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:26.360> Wow<00:06:26.660> look<00:06:27.080> at<00:06:27.140> those<00:06:27.290> eyes<00:06:27.530> those

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
this and Wow look at those eyes those

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.010 
this and Wow look at those eyes those
eyes<00:06:27.950> are<00:06:28.130> really<00:06:28.460> popping<00:06:28.730> and<00:06:29.150> they<00:06:29.720> still

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.020 
eyes are really popping and they still

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.200 
eyes are really popping and they still
retain<00:06:30.320> that<00:06:30.830> natural<00:06:31.340> look<00:06:31.580> so<00:06:31.790> that's

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
retain that natural look so that's

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.910 
retain that natural look so that's
pretty<00:06:32.420> cool<00:06:32.660> isn't<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:33.080> that's<00:06:33.410> it<00:06:33.590> for<00:06:33.740> now

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:33.920
