00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.139 

in<00:00:03.830> this<00:00:04.830> chapter<00:00:05.160> I<00:00:05.519> want<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:05.759> show<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:06.000> how

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:06.149 
in this chapter I want to show you how

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.720 
in this chapter I want to show you how
to<00:00:06.210> control<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.899> twist<00:00:07.309> along<00:00:08.309> the<00:00:08.430> spinal

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
to control the twist along the spinal

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.869 
to control the twist along the spinal
column<00:00:09.170> this<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.290> going<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> require<00:00:10.799> yet<00:00:11.459> more

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
column this is going to require yet more

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.980 
column this is going to require yet more
point<00:00:12.240> helpers<00:00:12.799> but<00:00:13.799> I've<00:00:13.860> always<00:00:14.010> said<00:00:14.250> it

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
point helpers but I've always said it

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.150 
point helpers but I've always said it
doesn't<00:00:15.990> matter<00:00:16.170> how<00:00:16.410> many<00:00:16.560> point<00:00:16.859> helpers

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
doesn't matter how many point helpers

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.650 
doesn't matter how many point helpers
you<00:00:17.279> have<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.609> rake<00:00:17.820> as<00:00:18.119> long<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.390> they're

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you have in a rake as long as they're

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.220 
you have in a rake as long as they're
there<00:00:18.900> for<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.110> purpose<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> reason<00:00:24.230> we're

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
there for a purpose and a reason we're

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.320 
there for a purpose and a reason we're
going<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.440> be<00:00:25.500> using<00:00:25.740> these<00:00:26.280> ones<00:00:26.610> that<00:00:27.240> are

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
going to be using these ones that are

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.950 
going to be using these ones that are
actually<00:00:27.510> set<00:00:27.960> along<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.650> path<00:00:29.220> constraint

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
actually set along the path constraint

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.090 
actually set along the path constraint
initially<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:32.899> an<00:00:33.899> orientation<00:00:34.410> control

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
initially as an orientation control

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.549 
initially as an orientation control
based<00:00:38.100> on<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.429> rotation<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.239> our<00:00:40.199> control

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
based on the rotation of our control

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.680 
based on the rotation of our control
objects<00:00:43.789> what<00:00:44.789> we're<00:00:44.909> first<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.539> is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
objects what we're first going to do is

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
objects what we're first going to do is
take<00:00:45.870> each<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.469> these<00:00:49.219> objects<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.309> are<00:00:50.460> on

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
take each of these objects that are on

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.259 
take each of these objects that are on
the<00:00:50.670> path<00:00:50.879> constraint<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.710> constrain<00:00:52.710> them

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
the path constraint and constrain them

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.389 
the path constraint and constrain them
to<00:00:54.269> their<00:00:54.420> corresponding<00:00:54.659> control<00:00:55.409> and<00:00:55.710> once

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
to their corresponding control and once

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.639 
to their corresponding control and once
again<00:00:56.549> the<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.420> are<00:00:57.479> up<00:00:57.659> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> middle

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
again the two that are up in the middle

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.110 
again the two that are up in the middle
of<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.889> back<00:00:59.159> there<00:00:59.969> will<00:01:00.120> be<00:01:01.999> mixed<00:01:02.999> between

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
of the back there will be mixed between

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.929 
of the back there will be mixed between
these<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:04.019> controls<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.769> their<00:01:04.890> orientation

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.160 

so<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.140> orientation<00:01:10.140> constraint<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so to orientation constraint and you can

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.740 
so to orientation constraint and you can
see<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.439> flip<00:01:13.649> around<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
see it flip around so that it's in the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.819 
see it flip around so that it's in the
direction<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:16.049> this<00:01:16.890> object<00:01:17.210> to<00:01:18.210> go<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.359> local

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:18.829 
direction of this object to go to local

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.050 
direction of this object to go to local
you'll<00:01:19.829> see<00:01:20.039> that<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> aligned<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:20.789> it<00:01:20.880> on<00:01:20.969> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you'll see that it's aligned to it on a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.139 
you'll see that it's aligned to it on a
local<00:01:21.270> axis<00:01:21.780> now<00:01:23.869> the<00:01:24.869> next<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.880> this<00:01:26.880> will<00:01:27.030> be

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
local axis now the next one this will be

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.859 
local axis now the next one this will be
a<00:01:27.180> hundred<00:01:27.390> percent<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:29.570> I'll<00:01:30.570> do

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
a hundred percent to this one I'll do

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.330 
a hundred percent to this one I'll do
the<00:01:30.990> top<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.259> it'll<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.100> hundred<00:01:32.159> percent

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the top one it'll be one hundred percent

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.169 
the top one it'll be one hundred percent
to<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.789> top<00:01:33.000> one<00:01:34.520> next<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.640> down<00:01:35.880> we're<00:01:36.060> going

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
to the top one next one down we're going

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:44.679 
to the top one next one down we're going
to<00:01:36.270> do<00:01:36.979> 66.5<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.460> hear<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.740> 33.5<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:41.039> hear<00:01:41.340> so

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.450 

66.5<00:01:45.689> flips

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:02:00.440 

33.5<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.159> way<00:01:56.250> around<00:01:56.810> 66.5<00:01:59.450> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
33.5 and the other way around 66.5 to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.679 
33.5 and the other way around 66.5 to
the<00:02:00.570> bottom<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:02.929> 33.5<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> top<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:06.360> again

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the bottom and 33.5 to the top now again

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.300 
the bottom and 33.5 to the top now again
you<00:02:06.720> can<00:02:07.020> play<00:02:07.259> around<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.740> these<00:02:07.829> values

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you can play around with these values

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
you can play around with these values
and<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:09.060> different<00:02:09.479> results<00:02:12.050> now<00:02:13.050> you'll

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
and get different results now you'll

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.850 
and get different results now you'll
notice<00:02:14.239> when<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.300> rotate<00:02:17.720> these<00:02:18.720> controls<00:02:19.319> it's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
notice when I rotate these controls it's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.410 
notice when I rotate these controls it's
actually<00:02:20.040> rotating<00:02:22.730> these<00:02:23.730> point<00:02:24.060> helpers

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
actually rotating these point helpers

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.850 
actually rotating these point helpers
now<00:02:24.599> instead<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:24.959> just<00:02:25.580> moving<00:02:26.580> them<00:02:27.860> this

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
now instead of just moving them this

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.319 
now instead of just moving them this
means<00:02:29.130> when<00:02:29.310> I<00:02:29.340> go<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.549> twist<00:02:32.150> I'm<00:02:33.150> actually

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
means when I go to twist I'm actually

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.380 
means when I go to twist I'm actually
getting<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:34.130> result<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.250> each<00:02:35.459> one<00:02:35.730> twist<00:02:36.299> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
getting a result of each one twist a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.699 
getting a result of each one twist a
little<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.780> down<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.200> spine<00:02:39.349> if<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.500> twist

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
little more down the spine if I twist

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.030 
little more down the spine if I twist
from<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:40.920> center<00:02:42.620> you<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.739> see<00:02:43.920> they're

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
from the center you can see they're

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.530 
from the center you can see they're
twisting<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.549> up<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.880> spine<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.269> way<00:02:45.420> I'm

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
twisting off up the spine this way I'm

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.670 
twisting off up the spine this way I'm
getting<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.810> twist<00:02:46.140> basically<00:02:46.680> from<00:02:46.950> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
getting a twist basically from the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.520 
getting a twist basically from the
middle<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.890> back<00:02:50.069> up<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.790> end<00:02:51.510> down<00:02:52.019> which

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
middle of the back up and end down which

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.610 
middle of the back up and end down which
we<00:02:52.709> couldn't<00:02:53.010> have<00:02:53.099> achieved<00:02:53.760> before<00:02:54.209> if<00:02:54.630> we'd

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
we couldn't have achieved before if we'd

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.009 
we couldn't have achieved before if we'd
used<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:56.280> built-in<00:02:56.700> spline<00:02:57.269> ik<00:02:57.480> modifier<00:03:00.019> the

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
used the built-in spline ik modifier the

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.660 
used the built-in spline ik modifier the
next<00:03:01.290> step<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.650> to<00:03:01.769> add<00:03:01.829> a<00:03:01.889> few<00:03:02.220> more<00:03:02.280> point

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
next step is to add a few more point

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.910 
next step is to add a few more point
helpers<00:03:03.060> first<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.870> look<00:03:04.049> at<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.560> that<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.769> know

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
helpers first to look at so that we know

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.280 
helpers first to look at so that we know
they're<00:03:05.100> actually<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.269> space<00:03:07.019> and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
they're actually out in space and

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.780 
they're actually out in space and
something<00:03:07.560> to<00:03:07.620> look<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:10.519> once<00:03:11.519> again<00:03:11.730> I'm

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
something to look at once again I'm

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.680 
something to look at once again I'm
going<00:03:11.910> to<00:03:11.970> use<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.120> point<00:03:12.420> helper<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:14.690> let's

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
going to use a point helper and let's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.180 
going to use a point helper and let's
change<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.109> display<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.859> the<00:03:16.950> center

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
change the display to just the center

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.259 
change the display to just the center
marker<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.670> time<00:03:18.200> and<00:03:19.850> make<00:03:20.850> sure<00:03:21.000> that<00:03:21.150> we

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
marker this time and make sure that we

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.910 
marker this time and make sure that we
have<00:03:21.450> things<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.900> are<00:03:21.959> all<00:03:22.620> aligned

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
have things that are all aligned

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.319 
have things that are all aligned
properly<00:03:23.160> I'm<00:03:23.880> going<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.120> line<00:03:24.299> it

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
properly I'm going to line it

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:28.190 
properly I'm going to line it
orientational<00:03:25.139> II<00:03:26.750> see<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:27.989> it's<00:03:28.109> going

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
orientational II see the one it's going

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.440 
orientational II see the one it's going
to<00:03:28.290> be<00:03:28.350> linked<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.850> so<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.060> set<00:03:30.269> this

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
to be linked to so I'm going to set this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.420 
to be linked to so I'm going to set this
point<00:03:30.959> helper<00:03:31.400> out<00:03:32.400> here<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.739> this<00:03:34.739> point

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
point helper out here and this point

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.570 
point helper out here and this point
helper<00:03:35.639> is<00:03:36.630> going<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.349> get<00:03:37.440> linked

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.710 

to<00:03:41.580> this<00:03:41.670> point<00:03:41.909> helper<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.510> when<00:03:42.599> this

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
to this point helper so that when this

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.020 
to this point helper so that when this
one<00:03:42.930> rotates<00:03:43.409> it's<00:03:43.680> moving<00:03:44.069> this<00:03:44.549> around<00:03:44.760> in

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
one rotates it's moving this around in

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.880 
one rotates it's moving this around in
space<00:03:45.120> now<00:03:45.510> so<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:45.989> see<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:48.530> this<00:03:49.530> point

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
space now so you can see that this point

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.420 
space now so you can see that this point
helper<00:03:50.099> is<00:03:50.280> rotating<00:03:50.909> around<00:03:51.000> with<00:03:51.299> it<00:03:52.430> I've

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
helper is rotating around with it I've

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.970 
helper is rotating around with it I've
set<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.090> up<00:03:54.209> here<00:03:54.390> somewhere<00:03:54.659> because<00:03:55.140> this<00:03:55.799> is

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
set it up here somewhere because this is

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.160 
set it up here somewhere because this is
going<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.189> control<00:03:56.640> the<00:03:57.269> up<00:03:57.420> node<00:03:57.629> of<00:03:57.930> this

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
going to control the up node of this

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.259 
going to control the up node of this
bone<00:03:58.700> let's<00:03:59.700> make<00:03:59.849> a<00:03:59.879> few<00:04:00.150> more<00:04:00.329> of<00:04:00.420> these<00:04:00.569> and

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.860 

I'm<00:04:06.269> going<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.450> link<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:06.750> one<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.760> this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
I'm going to link this one to this

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.120 
I'm going to link this one to this
helper

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.220 

I'm<00:04:17.640> going<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:17.850> link<00:04:18.000> this<00:04:18.180> one<00:04:18.420> to<00:04:18.660> this

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
I'm going to link this one to this

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.980 
I'm going to link this one to this
helper<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:21.080> one<00:04:22.080> more<00:04:22.290> for<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.470> bottom

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.500 

so<00:04:29.560> now<00:04:29.770> you<00:04:29.830> can<00:04:29.980> see<00:04:30.010> when<00:04:30.340> we<00:04:30.490> again<00:04:31.060> rotate

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
so now you can see when we again rotate

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.540 
so now you can see when we again rotate
it<00:04:31.690> all<00:04:32.410> those<00:04:32.590> little<00:04:32.770> point<00:04:33.070> helpers<00:04:33.400> are

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
it all those little point helpers are

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.250 
it all those little point helpers are
moving<00:04:33.820> out<00:04:33.940> in<00:04:34.090> space<00:04:34.360> now

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.060 

the<00:04:41.800> next<00:04:42.070> step<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.430> to<00:04:42.550> set<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.530> up<00:04:44.710> note<00:04:44.920> of

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the next step is to set the up note of

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.700 
the next step is to set the up note of
each<00:04:45.160> of<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.460> bones<00:04:46.380> let's<00:04:47.380> just<00:04:47.560> make<00:04:47.650> sure

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
each of the bones let's just make sure

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.290 
each of the bones let's just make sure
we<00:04:47.920> get<00:04:48.010> our<00:04:48.070> bones<00:04:48.370> orientated<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.120> right

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
we get our bones orientated the right

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.280 
we get our bones orientated the right
way<00:04:51.180> easiest<00:04:52.180> way<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.330> do<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.690> is<00:04:52.750> just<00:04:52.900> turn

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290 
way easiest way to do that is just turn

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.270 
way easiest way to do that is just turn
on<00:04:53.320> a<00:04:53.710> front<00:04:54.310> fin<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:55.650> right<00:04:56.650> off<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.860> bat<00:04:57.130> you

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
on a front fin and right off the bat you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.380 
on a front fin and right off the bat you
can<00:04:57.400> see<00:04:57.580> that<00:04:57.610> one<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:57.880> our<00:04:57.940> bones<00:04:58.210> is

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
can see that one of our bones is

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.530 
can see that one of our bones is
actually<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:58.780> opposite<00:04:59.080> way<00:04:59.200> around
