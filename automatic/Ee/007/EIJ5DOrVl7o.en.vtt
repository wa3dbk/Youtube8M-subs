a Camry with a v6 engine the next step

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.250 
a Camry with a v6 engine the next step
is<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.640> drain<00:00:12.820> the<00:00:12.940> transmission<00:00:13.480> fluid<00:00:13.660> this

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.260 
is to drain the transmission fluid this

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.080 
is to drain the transmission fluid this
is<00:00:14.320> the<00:00:14.620> pan<00:00:14.980> on<00:00:15.220> the<00:00:15.340> driver<00:00:15.610> side<00:00:15.760> of<00:00:15.970> the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
is the pan on the driver side of the

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.810 
is the pan on the driver side of the
vehicle<00:00:16.180> I'm<00:00:16.720> using<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.440> 10<00:00:17.680> millimeter<00:00:18.040> hex

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
vehicle I'm using a 10 millimeter hex
socket<00:00:19.150> to<00:00:20.110> release<00:00:20.770> the<00:00:21.250> bolt

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.890 

once<00:00:36.489> most<00:00:36.700> of<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.940> transmission<00:00:37.480> fluid<00:00:37.630> has

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
once most of the transmission fluid has

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.900 
once most of the transmission fluid has
been<00:00:38.079> drained<00:00:38.350> out<00:00:38.530> we<00:00:39.340> need<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.579> drop<00:00:39.760> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
been drained out we need to drop the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.570 
been drained out we need to drop the
transmission<00:00:40.480> pan<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.860> do<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.160> we<00:00:42.430> need<00:00:42.550> to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
transmission pan to do that we need to

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.270 
transmission pan to do that we need to
remove<00:00:42.910> 17<00:00:43.570> 10<00:00:43.870> millimeter<00:00:44.379> bolts<00:00:44.830> that<00:00:45.220> go

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
remove 17 10 millimeter bolts that go

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.330 
remove 17 10 millimeter bolts that go
around<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.760> perimeter<00:00:46.000> of<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.420> pan<00:00:47.340> okay

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:48.340 
around the perimeter of the pan okay

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.549 
around the perimeter of the pan okay
here<00:00:48.580> we've<00:00:48.760> got<00:00:48.970> all<00:00:49.210> 17<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.080> the<00:00:50.379> 10

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
here we've got all 17 of the 10

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.490 
here we've got all 17 of the 10
millimeter<00:00:51.330> bolts<00:00:52.330> removed<00:00:53.170> from<00:00:53.350> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
millimeter bolts removed from the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.549 
millimeter bolts removed from the
transmission<00:00:53.980> pan<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.930> now<00:00:56.080> we<00:00:56.140> just<00:00:56.230> have<00:00:56.440> to

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
transmission pan so now we just have to

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:09.600 
transmission pan so now we just have to
pry<00:00:56.860> it<00:00:56.890> off<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:09.040> here<00:01:09.190> we've<00:01:09.310> got<00:01:09.370> the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
pry it off so here we've got the

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.520 
pry it off so here we've got the
transmission<00:01:09.909> pan<00:01:10.360> removed<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.080> this<00:01:11.290> is<00:01:11.409> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
transmission pan removed and this is the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.310 
transmission pan removed and this is the
filter<00:01:11.799> that<00:01:11.950> we<00:01:12.190> need<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.460> remove<00:01:12.760> and<00:01:13.030> change

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
filter that we need to remove and change

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.990 
filter that we need to remove and change
so<00:01:14.320> there's<00:01:14.590> three<00:01:14.950> ten<00:01:15.190> millimeter<00:01:15.700> bolts

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
so there's three ten millimeter bolts

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.210 
so there's three ten millimeter bolts
that<00:01:16.420> hold<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.780> on<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:17.229> up<00:01:17.380> front<00:01:17.590> here<00:01:18.010> and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
that hold it on to up front here and

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:39.130 
that hold it on to up front here and
then<00:01:18.400> one<00:01:18.580> at<00:01:18.700> the<00:01:18.790> back

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.209 

just<00:01:40.140> need<00:01:40.289> to<00:01:40.319> release<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:40.829> wire<00:01:43.219> and

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
just need to release this wire and

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.130 
just need to release this wire and
that's<00:01:44.429> the<00:01:44.579> transmission<00:01:45.149> filter<00:01:45.569> here's

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that's the transmission filter here's

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.139 
that's the transmission filter here's
what<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.439> valve<00:01:46.649> body<00:01:46.920> looks<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.459> I'm<00:01:47.909> just

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
what the valve body looks like I'm just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.990 
what the valve body looks like I'm just
going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> leave<00:01:48.569> that<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.959> drain<00:01:49.729> and<00:01:50.729> these

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
going to leave that to drain and these

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
going to leave that to drain and these
are<00:01:51.179> the<00:01:51.299> three<00:01:51.600> ten<00:01:52.079> millimeter<00:01:52.530> bolts<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
are the three ten millimeter bolts that

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.389 
are the three ten millimeter bolts that
I<00:01:53.819> took<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.299> to<00:01:54.990> get<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.259> filter<00:01:55.619> off<00:01:55.799> here's

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
I took off to get the filter off here's

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.520 
I took off to get the filter off here's
the<00:01:56.609> old<00:01:56.759> transmission<00:01:57.209> filter<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.349> is

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the old transmission filter and this is

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.370 
the old transmission filter and this is
the<00:01:58.649> new<00:01:58.829> one<00:02:02.000> look<00:02:03.000> exactly<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.569> same<00:02:03.899> you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the new one look exactly the same you

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.679 
the new one look exactly the same you
have<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.709> the<00:02:04.799> transmission<00:02:05.159> pan<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:06.629> to

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
have got the transmission pan going to

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.029 
have got the transmission pan going to
take<00:02:06.810> note<00:02:06.989> of<00:02:07.020> where<00:02:07.349> the<00:02:07.530> magnets<00:02:07.920> are

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
take note of where the magnets are

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.219 
take note of where the magnets are
located<00:02:08.579> so<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> clean<00:02:09.720> them<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:10.079> can

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
located so when you clean them you can

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:17.199 
located so when you clean them you can
put<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.459> same<00:02:11.670> exact<00:02:12.030> location
