look<00:02:52.630> at<00:02:52.750> it<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:52.930> way<00:02:53.110> all<00:02:53.230> right<00:02:53.370> call<00:02:54.370> of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
look at it this way all right call of

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.130 
look at it this way all right call of

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
duty 4 modern warfare had problems and

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.280 
duty 4 modern warfare had problems and
compared<00:02:59.140> to<00:03:00.450> call<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.570> duty<00:03:01.810> titles<00:03:02.170> of

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
compared to call of duty titles of

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.949 
compared to call of duty titles of
recent<00:03:02.620> vintage<00:03:03.040> modern<00:03:03.760> warfare<00:03:04.180> was<00:03:04.660> bare

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
bones completely bare bones and even so

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.740 
bones completely bare bones and even so
much<00:03:09.340> as<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.519> black<00:03:10.090> ops<00:03:10.739> introduced<00:03:11.739> a

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
much as it black ops introduced a

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.030 
much as it black ops introduced a
completely<00:03:13.750> new<00:03:14.019> level<00:03:14.290> it<00:03:14.650> was<00:03:14.830> completely

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
completely new level it was completely

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.000 
completely new level it was completely
redone<00:03:16.000> the<00:03:16.329> level<00:03:16.900> of<00:03:16.959> customizability<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
redone the level of customizability and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.319 
redone the level of customizability and
things<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.519> could<00:03:18.700> do<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:18.970> make<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
things that you could do to make the

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.210 
things that you could do to make the
game<00:03:19.540> your<00:03:19.750> own<00:03:19.930> there's<00:03:20.620> none<00:03:20.860> of<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.010> in

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
game your own there's none of that in

call<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.430> duty<00:03:21.579> 4<00:03:22.000> call<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.570> duty<00:03:22.840> 4<00:03:22.870> is<00:03:23.140> very

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
call of duty 4 call of duty 4 is very

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.890 
call of duty 4 call of duty 4 is very
bare-bones<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.190> was<00:03:24.280> revolutionary<00:03:24.900> to

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
bare-bones but it was revolutionary to

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.770 
bare-bones but it was revolutionary to
the<00:03:26.049> series<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:27.640> think<00:03:27.880> when<00:03:28.000> people<00:03:28.030> talk

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
the series and I think when people talk

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.660 
the series and I think when people talk
about<00:03:28.810> innovation<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.860> think<00:03:30.160> what<00:03:30.430> they<00:03:30.519> want

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
about innovation I think what they want

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.610 
about innovation I think what they want
is<00:03:30.820> revolutionary<00:03:31.600> innovation<00:03:31.989> call<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.440> duty

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
is revolutionary innovation call of duty

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.729 
is revolutionary innovation call of duty
4<00:03:32.650> was<00:03:33.040> revolutionary<00:03:33.880> uh<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:35.200> everything

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
4 was revolutionary uh and everything

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.699 
4 was revolutionary uh and everything
after<00:03:35.890> that<00:03:36.070> built<00:03:36.640> on<00:03:37.380> they<00:03:38.380> tried<00:03:38.680> to

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
after that built on they tried to

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.860 
after that built on they tried to
innovate<00:03:39.310> building<00:03:39.760> on<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:39.910> revolutionary

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
innovate building on that revolutionary

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.340 
innovate building on that revolutionary
innovation<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.799> you<00:03:42.640> get<00:03:42.910> games<00:03:43.239> like<00:03:43.840> a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
innovation and you get games like a

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.370 
innovation and you get games like a

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
that eventually ghosts none of them were

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.650 
that eventually ghosts none of them were
really<00:03:53.670> revolutionary<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.209> way<00:03:55.360> that

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
really revolutionary in the way that

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.550 
really revolutionary in the way that
call<00:03:55.930> of<00:03:55.959> duty<00:03:56.380> 4<00:03:56.410> was<00:03:56.980> and<00:03:57.750> I'll<00:03:58.750> say<00:03:59.530> that

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
call of duty 4 was and I'll say that

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.660 
call of duty 4 was and I'll say that
while<00:04:00.510> advanced<00:04:01.510> warfare<00:04:02.130> also<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.430> not

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
while advanced warfare also is not

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.789 
while advanced warfare also is not
revolutionary<00:04:04.600> in<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:05.079> way<00:04:05.230> that<00:04:05.410> call<00:04:05.620> of

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
revolutionary in the way that call of

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:09.240 
revolutionary in the way that call of
duty<00:04:06.070> 4<00:04:06.100> was<00:04:06.610> its<00:04:07.269> innovative<00:04:07.750> in<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.230> way<00:04:08.410> that

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
duty 4 was its innovative in a way that
