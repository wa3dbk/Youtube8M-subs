your type and now you place a repeater

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.869 
your type and now you place a repeater
at<00:02:08.190> two<00:02:08.670> ticks<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:10.379> keep<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.459> the

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
at two ticks and you keep going on the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
to place the redstone dust here because

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.290 
to place the redstone dust here because
it's<00:02:15.960> really<00:02:16.110> important<00:02:16.890> else<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.940> won't<00:02:18.150> work

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
it's really important else it won't work

it's really important else it won't work
and<00:02:18.870> what<00:02:19.710> you<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.160> do<00:02:20.280> now<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.850> you<00:02:21.120> want

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
ticks and there we go that's the basic

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.870 
ticks and there we go that's the basic
mechanism<00:02:51.840> everything<00:02:52.740> is<00:02:52.860> running<00:02:53.130> but<00:02:53.520> make

sure yeah you have to add a red Stowe
you<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.580> add<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> redstone<00:02:57.300> here<00:02:57.630> as<00:02:57.780> well

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
you have to add a redstone here as well

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.770 
you have to add a redstone here as well
and<00:02:58.470> everything<00:02:59.400> will<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.820> working<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> way

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
and everything will be working that way

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.140 
and everything will be working that way
you<00:03:00.840> want<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.380> work<00:03:01.560> so<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.000> wanna

do now is make sure to add a stone here

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030 
do now is make sure to add a stone here
a<00:03:05.850> stone<00:03:06.330> there<00:03:06.630> as<00:03:06.840> stone<00:03:07.200> there<00:03:07.560> or<00:03:07.920> the

good at killing you for a short I

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.440 
good at killing you for a short I
noticed<00:03:23.250> that<00:03:23.430> when<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:23.760> be<00:03:24.030> looked<00:03:24.180> at<00:03:24.330> on

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
noticed that when I be looked at on

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.310 
noticed that when I be looked at on
these<00:03:24.630> for<00:03:24.870> craft

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
these for craft

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.360 
these for craft
anyways<00:03:26.070> so<00:03:27.020> let's<00:03:28.020> get<00:03:28.320> up<00:03:28.530> a<00:03:28.920> few<00:03:29.190> blocks

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
anyways so let's get up a few blocks

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.729 
anyways so let's get up a few blocks
here<00:03:29.700> again<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.720> is<00:03:30.959> where<00:03:31.200> you<00:03:31.320> would<00:03:31.440> drop

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
here again this is where you would drop

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.680 
here again this is where you would drop
the<00:03:31.950> blazes<00:03:32.340> in<00:03:32.520> we<00:03:32.700> can<00:03:32.880> place<00:03:33.120> one<00:03:33.330> here<00:03:33.540> from

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
the blazes in we can place one here from

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.370 
the blazes in we can place one here from
now<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.400> keep<00:03:35.400> going<00:03:35.880> down<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.450> little<00:03:37.170> bit

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
now and keep going down a little bit

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.790 
now and keep going down a little bit
here

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
here

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.670 
here
I<00:03:37.830> think<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:39.030> yes<00:03:39.300> so<00:03:39.570> they<00:03:39.720> don't<00:03:39.989> jump<00:03:40.410> up

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
I think it's yes so they don't jump up

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.190 
I think it's yes so they don't jump up
into<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.370> crusher<00:03:41.820> again<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.870> do<00:03:43.020> some

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
into the crusher again you can do some

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080 
into the crusher again you can do some
experimenting<00:03:43.950> with<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:44.310> I'm<00:03:44.640> not<00:03:44.880> really

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
experimenting with that I'm not really

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.120 
experimenting with that I'm not really
sure<00:03:45.360> I'm<00:03:45.660> I<00:03:46.020> will<00:03:46.350> have<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.650> change<00:03:46.890> something

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
sure I'm I will have to change something

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.460 
sure I'm I will have to change something
some<00:03:47.459> visa<00:03:47.670> craft<00:03:48.000> as<00:03:48.180> well<00:03:48.390> but<00:03:49.260> if

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
some visa craft as well but if

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.170 
some visa craft as well but if
everything<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.220> working<00:03:50.280> all<00:03:50.820> right

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
everything is working all right

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660 
everything is working all right
and<00:03:51.450> correct<00:03:52.080> now<00:03:52.320> he<00:03:52.680> would<00:03:52.830> end<00:03:53.070> up<00:03:53.370> as<00:03:53.610> a

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
and correct now he would end up as a
