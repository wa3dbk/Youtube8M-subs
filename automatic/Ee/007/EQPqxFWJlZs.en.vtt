comfortable and surrounded by luxury at
the<00:02:20.780> same<00:02:20.989> time<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:22.160> it's<00:02:22.280> probably<00:02:22.459> a<00:02:22.610> little

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the same time and it's probably a little

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550 
the same time and it's probably a little
bit<00:02:22.880> difficult<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.480> see<00:02:23.660> on<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.930> camera<00:02:24.170> but

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
bit difficult to see on the camera but

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.410 
bit difficult to see on the camera but
it<00:02:24.709> does<00:02:24.890> write<00:02:25.220> obviously<00:02:25.849> higher<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
it does write obviously higher than a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.290 
it does write obviously higher than a
traditional<00:02:27.580> sedan<00:02:28.660> sedan<00:02:29.660> yeah<00:02:30.170> but<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.670> get

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
traditional sedan sedan yeah but you get

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.809 
traditional sedan sedan yeah but you get
the<00:02:32.450> versatility<00:02:32.930> of<00:02:33.230> the<00:02:34.100> SUV

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
the versatility of the SUV

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.150 
the versatility of the SUV
hence<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.360> being<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.750> crossover<00:02:36.160> crossover

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
hence it being a crossover crossover

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.039 
hence it being a crossover crossover
vehicle<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.030> know<00:02:38.120> what<00:02:38.299> you<00:02:38.420> do<00:02:38.600> feel<00:02:38.840> that
