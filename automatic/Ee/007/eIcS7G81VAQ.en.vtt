00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.580
 huh 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 huh 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:16.119
 very well today we deal with every kind of final is really very complicated 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.960
 which is that of September 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.989
 hola bishop 

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.520
 value card 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.019
 to check 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.340
 let's examine exposure 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.649
 I promise you bobbins 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.899
 the starting position has been chosen in a very active way that you can read 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:32.760
 happen 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.710
 cr here is here crystal el ferilli 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.900
 23% really a jerk val try 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.980
 of interest at 4 years 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.700
 let's start with the opposition that he simplified 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.150
 therefore chickpeas it will be easier to understand how to checkmate in this 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.040
 position 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.900
 trying to understand why you can checkmate in this position 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.510
 we have read that there are different ways to checkmate 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.030
 cavallotti &amp; lt &amp; lt 3 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.860
 one of the essential conditions our trade fairs leather goods 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.320
 it must be the same color so thanks campochiaro 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.620
 in the story of the same color in which we want to hear the king in the corner 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.770
 in fact it does not support that campochiaro 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 it's the same color 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.189
 of where we want to go to tighten in the corner 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.460
 if he claims it would have been too dark it would no longer be 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.450
 it was possible to checkmate in that corner we would have had to give in 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.820
 this other corner 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.990
 then 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.900
 this is one of the social conditions then we have for you 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.900
 no iphone in that position 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.980
 arreter are placed side by side which are both on white cases 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.890
 this is one of the strongest positions in which 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.670
 It is possible to put 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.650
 bishop and horse 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.170
 why 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.180
 even if the king had not been there 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.800
 the factor 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.170
 is that 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.330
 the white bishop simone only on white houses 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.589
 and the horse put on the white house shows only surprises 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:20.700
 what's that shell armor 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.299
 current state visit 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.480
 so at least one piece people like most holy. alfierenero positioning the 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:33.550
 neck on white therefore perfect the optimal condition to be able to give 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.099
 the biggest attack on these two 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.660
 very powerful prices 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.239
 in this position assholes 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.510
 in fact, it's not really these two pieces that I really can't 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.469
 does not do 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.550
 to limit 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.539
 the entrance 

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:51.599
 it also runs to the center 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.659
 errebi closed in the corner because now let's try to sow 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 the mythical black king secondary 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.479
 can remain india 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.169
 coleman v8 mandarin 8 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.079
 fornarina 7 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.049
 can ride a bike 7 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.440
 can go to c8 and establish tim d8 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.960
 in these cases to surround then 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.130
 because he can't go right 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.820
 dd 8 then 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.159
 it is confined to this means therefore what happens 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.319
 let's see how to cultivate 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.409
 we said we have to push the corner 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.919
 so to do it is our first goal will be beautiful d 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.629
 lovere in such a way that 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.349
 will go to push 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.100
 campiano the premier in the corner then 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.100
 this will be our plan via leopardi 24 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:49.609
 of serious 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.499
 c8 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.359
 e7 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.850
 king viotto 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.870
 rt 8 therefore this our first floor has been admitted 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.659
 practically 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:07.949
 so we have the chance to be my hero 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:14.079
 to go over the houses the c8 feet 8 now deliver 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.079
 always with the same ubi 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:22.469
 b7 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:25.400
 d7 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.080
 rb 8 I now have a new bear app to have 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.710
 always 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.419
 in Florence 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:35.039
 because this thing 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:36.760
 why not tell me now 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.510
 the king is obviously going to try to catch bishop with us 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.340
 la7 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.379
 and now the standard bearer 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.030
 short shorts 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.629
 further consolidation 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:52.629
 the possibility of dust 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:59.080
 faker contracts go here could not go here therefore a3 practically 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.300
 natural boundary to a few available cases 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.930
 so with this night the roof windows literally 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.930
 the beautiful escape routes will be 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.809
 so now it's up 

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:14.809
 a 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.819
 metalfire c8 

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.289
 r 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.379
 d8 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.379
 now we take advantage of the fact that only a few moves are available 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.060
 so the question is only one in c7 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.060
 to do this let's go first to the g8 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.730
 the premier forced to move 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:37.809
 after that 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:41.829
 I 27 and also target cost has been reached 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:45.990
 knowing that 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.990
 the rona ancona rsonline 8 to 7 and cannot go anywhere else because here is the fair 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.539
 it is here charrere 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.229
 so we can move the fair 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.210
 why 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:59.619
 to the task of blocking coffee 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:03.399
 the king does not opus alto sarca task said of the escape 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:06.559
 vb6 

00:06:06.559 --> 00:06:10.449
 the only piece we can move installed now is black 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.610
 8 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:15.749
 horse 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:18.080
 e7 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.909
 37 

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:22.419
 you will have been there 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:25.819
 obviously Sunday channel to dispose mail always 8 

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.719
 Bishop 

00:06:28.719 --> 00:06:29.990
 MI7 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.710
 now that is checkmate
