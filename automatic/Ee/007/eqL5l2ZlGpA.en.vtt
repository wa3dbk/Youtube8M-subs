lesson we will look at how a message

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.490 
lesson we will look at how a message
instead<00:01:05.860> mittenz<00:01:06.280> between<00:01:06.670> neurons<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:08.290> let's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
instead mittenz between neurons so let's

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.539 
instead mittenz between neurons so let's
introduce<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.700> synapse<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.590> synapse<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
introduce the synapse the synapse is the

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.279 
introduce the synapse the synapse is the
area<00:01:12.880> where<00:01:13.149> information<00:01:13.420> from<00:01:13.899> one<00:01:14.079> neuron

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289 
area where information from one neuron

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.090 
area where information from one neuron
is<00:01:14.619> transferred<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.640> another<00:01:15.820> neuron<00:01:17.100> there

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
is transferred to another neuron there

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.950 
is transferred to another neuron there
are<00:01:18.280> three<00:01:18.549> important<00:01:19.060> parts<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.539> synapse

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
are three important parts of the synapse

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.440 
are three important parts of the synapse
the<00:01:20.679> presynaptic<00:01:21.130> neuron<00:01:21.729> is<00:01:21.939> the<00:01:22.240> neuron

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
the presynaptic neuron is the neuron

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.749 
the presynaptic neuron is the neuron
transferring<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.229> message<00:01:23.759> the

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
transferring the message the

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:26.279 
transferring the message the
postsynaptic<00:01:25.179> neuron<00:01:25.479> receives<00:01:26.079> the

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
postsynaptic neuron receives the

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.200 
postsynaptic neuron receives the
information<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.759> little<00:01:27.999> gap<00:01:28.179> between

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
information and the little gap between

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.520 
information and the little gap between
them<00:01:28.719> is<00:01:28.840> called<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.380> synaptic<00:01:29.590> cleft<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
them is called the synaptic cleft the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.109 
them is called the synaptic cleft the
neurons<00:01:32.890> are<00:01:33.039> very<00:01:33.219> close<00:01:33.490> but<00:01:33.759> they<00:01:33.850> do<00:01:33.909> not

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
neurons are very close but they do not

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:36.539 
neurons are very close but they do not
touch<00:01:34.439> so<00:01:35.439> there<00:01:35.590> needs<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.829> be<00:01:35.979> something<00:01:36.219> to

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
touch so there needs to be something to

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.039 
touch so there needs to be something to
get<00:01:36.729> the<00:01:36.909> message<00:01:37.240> across<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.840> synaptic

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
get the message across the synaptic

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.510 
get the message across the synaptic
cleft<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.409> where<00:01:41.770> neurotransmitters

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
cleft this is where neurotransmitters

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.469 
cleft this is where neurotransmitters
come<00:01:42.700> in<00:01:44.939> neurotransmitters<00:01:45.939> are<00:01:46.060> chemical

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
come in neurotransmitters are chemical

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.569 
come in neurotransmitters are chemical
messages<00:01:46.899> that<00:01:47.829> are<00:01:47.950> released<00:01:48.280> by<00:01:48.520> the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
messages that are released by the

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.039 
messages that are released by the
presynaptic<00:01:49.090> neuron<00:01:49.600> when<00:01:49.899> it's

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
presynaptic neuron when it's

neurotransmitter travels across the
synaptic<00:01:53.979> cleft<00:01:56.520> neurotransmitters<00:01:57.520> are

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
synaptic cleft neurotransmitters are

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.080 
synaptic cleft neurotransmitters are
like<00:01:57.850> keys<00:01:58.060> that<00:01:58.329> fit<00:01:58.539> to<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.719> specific<00:01:59.229> lock

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
like keys that fit to a specific lock

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.459 
like keys that fit to a specific lock
these<00:02:01.090> locks<00:02:01.389> are<00:02:01.630> located<00:02:02.259> on<00:02:02.380> the

they are enjoying what they do so the

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.580 
they are enjoying what they do so the
brain<00:03:41.819> releases<00:03:42.060> dopamine<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.930> this

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
brain releases dopamine and this

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.379 
brain releases dopamine and this

this<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.099> where<00:04:29.460> we<00:04:29.550> need<00:04:29.669> to<00:04:29.700> look<00:04:29.940> a<00:04:29.969> bit

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
this is where we need to look a bit

not just a collection of neurons we know

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.830 
not just a collection of neurons we know
seven<00:04:34.730> different<00:04:34.880> areas<00:04:35.360> in<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.600> brain<00:04:35.720> that

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
seven different areas in the brain that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.940 
seven different areas in the brain that
all<00:04:36.140> have<00:04:36.320> specialized<00:04:36.830> role<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:37.340> functions

all have specialized role and functions

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.940 
all have specialized role and functions
so<00:04:39.950> when<00:04:40.100> we<00:04:40.220> notice<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> B<00:04:41.410> one<00:04:42.410> area<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:42.890> the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
so when we notice a B one area in the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.850 
so when we notice a B one area in the
brain<00:04:43.160> releases<00:04:43.520> the<00:04:43.910> shape<00:04:44.150> one<00:04:45.080> area<00:04:45.470> the

brain releases the shape one area the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.160 
brain releases the shape one area the
sound<00:04:46.160> and<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.820> other<00:04:47.030> one<00:04:47.270> how<00:04:47.840> we<00:04:47.900> feel

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
sound and the other one how we feel

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.560 
sound and the other one how we feel
anxious<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:49.700> let's<00:04:49.880> look<00:04:50.030> at<00:04:50.180> the<00:04:50.240> different
