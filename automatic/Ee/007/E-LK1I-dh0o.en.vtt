00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.050
 hello friends how are you in the video of 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.840
 Today I'm going to teach you how to be a simple 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.119
 braid of 600 of the family of 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.500
 yacarÃ© tenderloin braids but before 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.720
 show them how it's done we 're going to 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.250
 send a greeting to gabriel strap that 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.890
 He was the one who sent me a video tutorial 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.779
 so I can share this 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.449
 braid with you good we are going to 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.699
 start to make the braid divide 3 and 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.660
 3 for each hand and we will cross the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.820
 medium 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.270
 and once we cross it they will go back to 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.270
 its place 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.370
 thus 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.490
 now let's start from the side 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.490
 left doing on one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.470
 under 2 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.220
 and go back to the middle doing on one 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.220
 we adjust 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.280
 now on the right side we do about 1 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.680
 under 2 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.040
 and go back to the right side doing about 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.040
 one 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:22.399
 on the left side as you will see is very 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.399
 easy makes about 1 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.290
 under 2 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.799
 and come back on one 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.240
 on the right side on one 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.920
 under 2 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.280
 and come back on one 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.050
 the left radius about 1 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.550
 under 2 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.550
 come back on one 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.900
 the right side on one 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.250
 under 2 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:07.220
 come back on one 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.220
 the left side on one 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.950
 low 2 and come back on 1 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.630
 As you can see it is very easy to do 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.120
 well he explained it to him for the last time 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.980
 very simple and very easy the time that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.240
 is further back will work from this 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.170
 way it's going to be about 1 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.170
 under 2 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.710
 and will return on one to its place 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.210
 the one that is further back is that of the 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.270
 left is going to be about one 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.940
 will go under 2 and will come back on 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:48.130
 a good one and we do so until we give the 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.320
 long we want our braid to 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.000
 finish this braid good as I say 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.280
 always the shots in the braids 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.190
 depends on what you are going to use it 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.960
 each one if it were to be a bracelet 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.330
 I would turn it into a round braid 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.220
 of 6 I make a little button and ready 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.810
 good to leave it when we go to 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.340
 rest we grasped the time that is 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.129
 further back we make this movement 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.660
 and there we leave it, we already know by 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.519
 what when we have to work again 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.739
 we have to continue with that time 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.019
 good friends one more video was finished 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.640
 as I always tell you the circuit to have 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.860
 a like a like 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.049
 leave your work comment subscribe 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.379
 I know it's very important and we see the 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.379
