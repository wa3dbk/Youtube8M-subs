00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
lay down on a chair might happen to be

lay down on a chair might happen to be
like<00:02:07.790> a<00:02:07.940> tattooing<00:02:08.540> chair<00:02:08.780> so<00:02:09.290> I<00:02:09.320> laid<00:02:09.560> on<00:02:09.800> my

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
like a tattooing chair so I laid on my

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.100 
like a tattooing chair so I laid on my
back<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.430> was<00:02:10.610> kind<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:10.940> slanted<00:02:11.450> at<00:02:11.570> an<00:02:11.690> angle

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
back I was kind of slanted at an angle

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.770 
back I was kind of slanted at an angle
so<00:02:12.350> I<00:02:12.530> was<00:02:12.710> like<00:02:12.860> leaning<00:02:13.250> back<00:02:13.510> kind<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.630> like

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
so I was like leaning back kind of like

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.190 
so I was like leaning back kind of like
that<00:02:15.340> and<00:02:16.340> all<00:02:16.760> he<00:02:16.970> did<00:02:17.120> is<00:02:17.180> he<00:02:17.300> sterilized<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.280 
that and all he did is he sterilized the
area<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:18.890> he<00:02:19.100> used<00:02:19.370> clamps<00:02:20.030> to<00:02:20.540> pull<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
area and he used clamps to pull out the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.920 
area and he used clamps to pull out the
skin<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:22.280> he<00:02:22.460> knows<00:02:22.670> where<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.030> pierce<00:02:23.450> it<00:02:23.660> at

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
skin so he knows where to pierce it at

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.920 
skin so he knows where to pierce it at
and<00:02:24.230> they<00:02:25.190> use<00:02:25.460> clamps<00:02:25.850> to<00:02:26.150> hold<00:02:26.180> that<00:02:26.510> open

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.110 
and they use clamps to hold that open
and<00:02:27.080> everything<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.070> he<00:02:28.370> pierced<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.880> with<00:02:29.090> a

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
and everything so he pierced it with a

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.420 
and everything so he pierced it with a
thick<00:02:29.600> needle<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.560> needle<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:31.070> hollow

thick needle and the needle is hollow

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.570

about<00:02:39.410> I<00:02:39.560> needed<00:02:39.890> at<00:02:40.130> home<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:42.940> if<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.150> did<00:02:44.360> it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
about I needed at home you if you did it

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.120 
about I needed at home you if you did it
at<00:02:44.600> home<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.140> would<00:02:45.260> do<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.560> a<00:02:45.680> regular

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
at home you would do it with a regular

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.100 
at home you would do it with a regular
needle<00:02:46.370> or<00:02:46.730> maybe<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.180> jewelry<00:02:47.600> but<00:02:47.810> then<00:02:47.990> you

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
needle or maybe the jewelry but then you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.660 
needle or maybe the jewelry but then you
would<00:02:48.230> have<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.500> take<00:02:48.709> out<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> needle<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
would have to take out the needle and

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.730 
would have to take out the needle and
then<00:02:49.880> shove<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.570> jewelry<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.170> there<00:02:51.380> and<00:02:51.620> that

then shove the jewelry in there and that

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.350 
then shove the jewelry in there and that
could<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.100> very<00:02:52.310> painful<00:02:52.550> at<00:02:52.940> least<00:02:53.120> that's

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
could be very painful at least that's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.840 
could be very painful at least that's
what<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.600> imagine<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:54.350> to<00:02:54.500> be<00:02:54.650> but<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.580> shop

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
what I imagine it to be but and the shop

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.000 
what I imagine it to be but and the shop
is<00:02:56.030> like<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.360> one-step<00:02:56.959> process<00:02:57.020> they<00:02:57.680> pierce

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
is like a one-step process they pierce

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.949 
is like a one-step process they pierce
it<00:02:58.250> put<00:02:58.610> in<00:02:58.820> the<00:02:58.970> jewelry<00:02:59.300> at<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.480> same<00:02:59.660> time

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
it put in the jewelry at the same time

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:06.220 
it put in the jewelry at the same time
and<00:03:00.290> then<00:03:00.590> you're<00:03:00.709> done<00:03:03.670> and<00:03:04.900> of<00:03:05.900> course<00:03:06.110> they

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
and then you're done and of course they

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.870 
and then you're done and of course they
