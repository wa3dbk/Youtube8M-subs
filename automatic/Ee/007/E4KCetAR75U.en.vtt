absolute<00:01:43.950> perfection<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.599> is<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> bit

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
absolute perfection and it is a bit

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
absolute perfection and it is a bit
tougher<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.920> spread<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.610> batter<00:01:47.789> but<00:01:48.060> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
tougher to spread the batter but you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.570 
tougher to spread the batter but you
know<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.599> is<00:01:48.750> was<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:50.340> most

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
know what it is was it the most

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.219

important<00:01:51.209> thing<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.630> when<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.959> spread

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
important thing is that when you spread

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.320 
important thing is that when you spread
this<00:01:52.349> out<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.770> your<00:01:52.950> pan<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.729> spread<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.149> out

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
nice and evenly that way when it bakes

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.969 
nice and evenly that way when it bakes
up<00:01:56.819> it<00:01:57.000> bakes<00:01:57.209> up<00:01:57.390> evenly<00:01:57.810> one<00:01:58.590> side<00:01:58.800> isn't
