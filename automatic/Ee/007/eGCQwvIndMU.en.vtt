00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.530 

so<00:00:01.199> in<00:00:01.560> this<00:00:02.310> video<00:00:02.669> I'm<00:00:02.909> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.149> do<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.360> best

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
so in this video I'm going to do my best

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.260 
so in this video I'm going to do my best
to<00:00:03.689> explain<00:00:03.840> diffusion<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:04.950> osmosis<00:00:05.190> in<00:00:05.940> less

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
to explain diffusion and osmosis in less

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.530 
to explain diffusion and osmosis in less
than<00:00:06.660> five<00:00:06.930> minutes<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.799> let's<00:00:08.189> begin

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
than five minutes so let's begin

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.060 
than five minutes so let's begin
diffusion<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.719> movement<00:00:10.019> of<00:00:10.500> molecules

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
diffusion is the movement of molecules

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.629 
diffusion is the movement of molecules
from<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.969> region<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> high<00:00:12.780> concentration<00:00:13.070> to<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
from a region of high concentration to a

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.660 
from a region of high concentration to a
region<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:15.210> low<00:00:15.480> concentration<00:00:16.369> now<00:00:17.369> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
region of low concentration now the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
region of low concentration now the
reason<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.180> happens<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.810> because<00:00:18.900> these

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
reason this happens is because these

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.150 
reason this happens is because these
molecules<00:00:19.890> possess<00:00:20.430> energy<00:00:21.800> they<00:00:22.800> are<00:00:22.920> moving

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
molecules possess energy they are moving

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.849 
molecules possess energy they are moving
around<00:00:23.660> randomly<00:00:24.660> because<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.680> something

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
around randomly because of something

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.310 
around randomly because of something
called<00:00:26.039> Brownian<00:00:26.760> motion<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.810> they<00:00:27.990> possess

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
called Brownian motion so they possess

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.689 
called Brownian motion so they possess
energy<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:29.010> they're<00:00:29.130> moving<00:00:29.460> around

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
energy and they're moving around

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.609 
energy and they're moving around
randomly<00:00:29.970> they're<00:00:30.539> bouncing<00:00:31.080> off<00:00:31.230> each<00:00:31.260> other

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
randomly they're bouncing off each other

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.889 
randomly they're bouncing off each other
and<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.460> will<00:00:32.579> happen<00:00:32.880> eventually<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.600> they

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
and what will happen eventually is they

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.620 
and what will happen eventually is they
will<00:00:34.050> spread<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> fill<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> entire

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
will spread and fill out the entire

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.700 
will spread and fill out the entire
container<00:00:36.710> now<00:00:37.710> when<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.100> happens<00:00:38.480> the<00:00:39.710> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
container now when this happens the the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
container now when this happens the the
container<00:00:41.190> with<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.700> molecules<00:00:42.149> within<00:00:42.390> the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
container with the molecules within the

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690 
container with the molecules within the
container<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.530> stable<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.250> it's<00:00:44.460> more

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
container are more stable so it's more

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
container are more stable so it's more
energetically<00:00:45.510> beneficial<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
energetically beneficial for the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.270 
energetically beneficial for the
molecules<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.660> be<00:00:48.809> spread<00:00:49.140> out<00:00:49.170> rather<00:00:50.039> than

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
molecules to be spread out rather than

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.389 
molecules to be spread out rather than
to<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.550> closely<00:00:51.030> compacted<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.079> corner

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
to be closely compacted in one corner

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.310 
to be closely compacted in one corner
this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> basics<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> diffusion<00:00:54.719> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
this is the basics of diffusion the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.920 
this is the basics of diffusion the
ability<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.070> molecules<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:57.120> move<00:00:57.360> from

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
ability of these molecules to move from

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
ability of these molecules to move from
a<00:00:58.140> high<00:00:58.699> region<00:00:59.699> oh<00:00:59.899> sorry<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.020> high

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a high region oh sorry a high

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.700 
a high region oh sorry a high
concentration<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.730> low<00:01:02.960> concentration<00:01:03.960> and

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
concentration to a low concentration and

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.950 
concentration to a low concentration and
spread<00:01:05.369> out<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.479> are<00:01:06.540> four<00:01:06.750> factors

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
spread out now there are four factors

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.609 
spread out now there are four factors
which<00:01:07.790> affect<00:01:08.790> diffusion<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.290> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
which affect diffusion this is the the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
which affect diffusion this is the the
first<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.040> sorry<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.840> concentration

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
first one sorry is concentration

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
first one sorry is concentration
gradient<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:14.040> what<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> means<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.270> there

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
gradient now what this means is if there

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
gradient now what this means is if there
is<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> higher<00:01:15.960> concentration<00:01:16.939> gradient<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is a higher concentration gradient that

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.230 
is a higher concentration gradient that
means<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.020> difference<00:01:19.259> between<00:01:20.240> the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
means the difference between the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
means the difference between the
molecules<00:01:21.869> in<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> high<00:01:22.290> concentration<00:01:23.100> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
molecules in the high concentration and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.330 
molecules in the high concentration and
the<00:01:23.820> low<00:01:23.970> concentration<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.020> much<00:01:25.350> bigger<00:01:25.590> so

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
the low concentration is much bigger so

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.980 
the low concentration is much bigger so
there<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:26.970> molecules<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
there are a lot of molecules here and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
there are a lot of molecules here and
less<00:01:28.650> here<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.610> because<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> lot

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
less here so because there are a lot

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.480 
less here so because there are a lot
more<00:01:30.540> molecules<00:01:31.229> here<00:01:31.439> they<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.100> balance

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
more molecules here they will balance

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.429 
more molecules here they will balance
against<00:01:32.880> each<00:01:33.000> other<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:33.420> spread<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
against each other and spread so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.819 
against each other and spread so
diffusion<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.189> occur<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> lot<00:01:35.970> faster

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
diffusion will occur a lot faster

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.240 
diffusion will occur a lot faster
temperature<00:01:37.829> now<00:01:38.820> when<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:40.380> heat<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
temperature now when you heat the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.910 
temperature now when you heat the
container<00:01:41.720> the<00:01:42.720> molecules<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.409> gain<00:01:43.619> more

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
container the molecules will gain more

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.830 
container the molecules will gain more
energy<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:45.090> they<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.360> more<00:01:45.630> energy

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
energy when they have more energy

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
energy when they have more energy
they'll<00:01:46.680> bounce<00:01:46.950> off<00:01:47.220> each<00:01:47.399> other<00:01:47.640> faster<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
they'll bounce off each other faster and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.660 
they'll bounce off each other faster and
they<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.659> move<00:01:48.869> around<00:01:49.020> faster<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.310> turn

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
they will move around faster and in turn

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.580 
they will move around faster and in turn
they<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.030> spread<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> fill<00:01:52.350> out<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
they will spread and fill out the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.719 
they will spread and fill out the
container<00:01:52.920> quicker

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
container quicker

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.410 
container quicker
the<00:01:54.659> third<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.380> molecular<00:01:56.040> weight<00:01:56.420> molecules

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
the third is molecular weight molecules

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.690 
the third is molecular weight molecules
which<00:01:57.930> are<00:01:58.110> heavy<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.829> move<00:01:59.070> around<00:01:59.280> slower

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
which are heavy will move around slower

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
which are heavy will move around slower
and<00:02:00.000> molecules<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.290> low<00:02:01.590> molecular

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
and molecules which have a low molecular

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.700 
and molecules which have a low molecular
weight<00:02:02.820> will<00:02:03.119> move<00:02:03.299> out<00:02:03.479> faster<00:02:04.100> so<00:02:05.100> if<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
weight will move out faster so if the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.190 
weight will move out faster so if the
molecular<00:02:07.710> weight<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.459> low<00:02:09.060> diffusion<00:02:09.989> will

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
molecular weight is low diffusion will

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.930 
molecular weight is low diffusion will
occur<00:02:10.470> fast

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
occur fast

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.840 
and if the molecule err weight is high
diffusion<00:02:14.600> will<00:02:14.900> occur<00:02:15.170> slower<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
diffusion will occur slower and the

here<00:02:23.620> what<00:02:24.620> will<00:02:24.770> happen<00:02:25.100> is<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:26.090> molecules

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
here what will happen is the molecules

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.460 
here what will happen is the molecules
they<00:02:27.380> don't<00:02:27.590> have<00:02:27.740> to<00:02:27.920> spread<00:02:28.250> out<00:02:28.460> as<00:02:28.640> far<00:02:29.090> as

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
they don't have to spread out as far as

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.100 
they don't have to spread out as far as
before<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:30.860> they<00:02:31.280> will<00:02:31.730> spread<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:32.810> fill<00:02:32.960> out

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.410 
this smaller container a lot quicker
this<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:37.010> how<00:02:37.700> pressure<00:02:38.090> works<00:02:38.500> when

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
this is how pressure works when

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.870 
this is how pressure works when
affecting<00:02:41.420> diffusion<00:02:41.900> now

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880

that's<00:02:43.880> pressure<00:02:44.150> done<00:02:44.420> now<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.750> will<00:02:44.990> look<00:02:45.140> at

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
that's pressure done now we will look at

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.130 
that's pressure done now we will look at
as<00:02:45.380> Moses<00:02:45.910> it's<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.030> similar<00:02:47.450> very<00:02:47.750> similar

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
as Moses it's a similar very similar

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.590 
as Moses it's a similar very similar
concept<00:02:48.490> the<00:02:49.490> molecules<00:02:49.970> will<00:02:50.150> move<00:02:50.180> from

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
concept the molecules will move from

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.440 
concept the molecules will move from
high<00:02:51.020> to<00:02:51.590> low<00:02:51.620> concentration<00:02:52.100> but<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.150> main

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
high to low concentration but the main

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.780 
high to low concentration but the main
difference<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.830> will<00:02:54.980> move<00:02:55.160> across<00:02:55.460> a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
difference is they will move across a

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.200 
difference is they will move across a
partially<00:02:56.570> permeable<00:02:57.100> membrane<00:02:58.100> what<00:02:58.940> this

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
partially permeable membrane what this

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.080 
partially permeable membrane what this
means<00:02:59.510> is<00:02:59.810> that<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.440> membrane<00:03:01.010> can<00:03:01.790> only

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
means is that the membrane can only

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.350 
means is that the membrane can only
allow<00:03:02.630> some<00:03:03.200> of<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.680> molecules<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.400> transfer
