something approaching the new code so

something approaching the new code so

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
intentions in mind in the design one was

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.360 
intentions in mind in the design one was
correction<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.140> the<00:05:00.260> flaws<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.500> the<00:05:00.980> coding

the second intention I had in creating
the<00:05:17.270> new<00:05:17.390> code<00:05:17.630> was<00:05:17.870> I<00:05:18.140> wanted<00:05:18.860> to<00:05:18.920> see<00:05:19.010> whether

the new code was I wanted to see whether

the new code was I wanted to see whether
I<00:05:19.370> could<00:05:19.460> create<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.760> code<00:05:20.050> which<00:05:21.050> could<00:05:21.380> not<00:05:21.680> be

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
I could create a code which could not be

themselves were congruent I think I
