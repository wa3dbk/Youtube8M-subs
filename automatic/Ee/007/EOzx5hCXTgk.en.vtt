never found the time or money to upgrade
my<00:00:36.360> walls<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.200> very<00:00:37.410> bad<00:00:37.649> because<00:00:38.190> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
my walls which is very bad because it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.970 
my walls which is very bad because it
makes<00:00:38.489> me<00:00:38.700> lose<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.239> battles<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.980> as

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
makes me lose a lot of battles and as

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.450 
makes me lose a lot of battles and as
you<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.540> ones<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.989> actually

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
you can see the ones that actually

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
you can see the ones that actually
people<00:00:44.460> attack<00:00:45.239> me<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> lot<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:45.930> units

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
people attack me with a lot of units

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.290 
people attack me with a lot of units
those<00:00:47.280> are<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.579> ones<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.820> lose<00:00:48.030> because

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
those are the ones I lose because

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.880 
those are the ones I lose because
there's<00:00:48.629> too<00:00:48.870> many<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.320> my<00:00:49.469> walls<00:00:49.710> aren't

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
there's too many and my walls aren't

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
there's too many and my walls aren't
strong<00:00:50.190> enough<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.610> hold<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:51.030> back<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.559> if

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
strong enough to hold them back and if

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
strong enough to hold them back and if
they<00:00:52.739> were<00:00:52.800> if<00:00:53.309> they<00:00:53.460> were<00:00:53.520> level<00:00:53.850> eight<00:00:54.030> right

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
they were if they were level eight right

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
they were if they were level eight right
now<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.690> could<00:00:54.989> win<00:00:55.170> every<00:00:55.559> single<00:00:55.590> defense

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
now I could win every single defense

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.549 
now I could win every single defense
that's<00:00:56.550> attacking<00:00:56.879> me<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.449> but<00:00:58.140> since

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
that's attacking me right now but since

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.680 
that's attacking me right now but since
they're<00:00:58.739> not<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.180> reason<00:01:00.329> because

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
they're not I can and the reason because

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.770 
they're not I can and the reason because
of<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:02.100> level<00:01:02.820> six<00:01:03.030> wall<00:01:03.300> has

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
of that is because a level six wall has

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.830 
of that is because a level six wall has
2,000<00:01:04.500> health<00:01:04.710> now<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.119> these<00:01:06.299> bombers

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
2,000 health now one of these bombers

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.660 
2,000 health now one of these bombers
right<00:01:07.049> here<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.710> basically<00:01:07.920> take<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
right here it can basically take that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.090 
right here it can basically take that
out<00:01:08.850> it's<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.600> level<00:01:09.750> five<00:01:10.049> bomber<00:01:10.350> I'll<00:01:10.710> show

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
out it's a level five bomber I'll show

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.870 
out it's a level five bomber I'll show
you<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> stats<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.650> it<00:01:13.650> does<00:01:14.070> 46

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you the stats of it and it does 46

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.060 
you the stats of it and it does 46
damage<00:01:15.330> time<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> 40<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.770> against

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
damage time is 40 because it's against

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
damage time is 40 because it's against
walls<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.939> that's<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.509> pretty<00:01:18.659> steep<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
walls so that's that's pretty steep and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.850 
walls so that's that's pretty steep and
that<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.920> almost<00:01:20.990> almost<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> wall

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that can almost almost take out the wall

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
that can almost almost take out the wall
has<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> tiny<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.880> health<00:01:24.060> left<00:01:24.270> but

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
has like a tiny bit of health left but

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.880 
has like a tiny bit of health left but
the<00:01:24.540> Gunners<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.080> take<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.439> out<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:25.710> one

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
the Gunners can take that out in one

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.300 
the Gunners can take that out in one
shot<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:27.259> that's<00:01:28.259> why<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.560> attack<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.130> put

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
shot so that's why when I attack I put

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
shot so that's why when I attack I put
the<00:01:29.400> Gunners<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.850> first<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.450> then<00:01:30.720> when

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
the Gunners in first and then when

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.719 
the Gunners in first and then when
they're<00:01:31.200> attacking<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.740> wall<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> bomb

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
they're attacking the wall I put a bomb

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
they're attacking the wall I put a bomb
in<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.090> finish<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> wall<00:01:33.689> off<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.650> makes

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
in to finish the wall off and that makes

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.590 
in to finish the wall off and that makes
it<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.280> fast<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> Gunners<00:01:36.240> don't<00:01:36.420> take

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it so fast and the Gunners don't take

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.770 
it so fast and the Gunners don't take
much<00:01:36.840> damage<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.960> tips<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.290> your<00:01:40.409> base<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.359 
walls is basically up read them whenever
you<00:01:44.970> can<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> worker<00:01:46.649> available

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
you can if you have a worker available

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.639 
you can if you have a worker available
and<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> ton<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> gold<00:01:48.530> upgrade<00:01:49.530> your

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
and you have a ton of gold upgrade your

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.190 
and you have a ton of gold upgrade your
walls<00:01:49.950> instead<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:50.579> tower<00:01:50.820> because<00:01:51.329> even

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
walls instead of a tower because even

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.139 
walls instead of a tower because even
though<00:01:52.290> your<00:01:52.439> towers<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:52.920> better<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.909> towel

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
though your towers are better your towel

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.450 
though your towers are better your towel
towers<00:01:54.840> will<00:01:55.110> last<00:01:55.350> longer<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.100> stronger

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
towers will last longer with stronger

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.600 
towers will last longer with stronger
walls<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> have<00:01:57.990> level<00:01:58.649> 7<00:01:59.009> walls<00:01:59.250> and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
walls so if you have level 7 walls and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.600 
walls so if you have level 7 walls and
level<00:02:00.390> 8<00:02:00.869> hours<00:02:01.469> these<00:02:01.680> are<00:02:01.860> level<00:02:02.100> nines<00:02:02.280> but

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
level 8 hours these are level nines but

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.539 
level 8 hours these are level nines but
level<00:02:02.939> 8<00:02:03.090> hours<00:02:03.479> don't<00:02:03.630> do<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> much<00:02:04.110> damage

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
level 8 hours don't do that much damage

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
level 8 hours don't do that much damage
still<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.909> walls<00:02:06.119> will<00:02:06.420> hold<00:02:06.689> them<00:02:06.840> back<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
still the walls will hold them back so

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.350 
still the walls will hold them back so
your<00:02:07.619> level<00:02:07.920> 8<00:02:08.069> towers<00:02:08.520> will<00:02:08.700> do<00:02:08.849> more<00:02:09.060> damage

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
your level 8 towers will do more damage

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.470 
your level 8 towers will do more damage
than<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> level<00:02:10.619> nine<00:02:10.890> tower<00:02:11.310> with<00:02:11.879> level<00:02:12.209> six

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
than a level nine tower with level six

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.550 
than a level nine tower with level six
walls

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
walls

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.410
