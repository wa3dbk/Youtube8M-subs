doesn't actually on the a and I've also
done<00:03:32.260> that<00:03:32.380> underneath<00:03:32.770> so<00:03:33.010> it's<00:03:33.130> easier<00:03:33.550> when

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
done that underneath so it's easier when

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.090 
done that underneath so it's easier when
it<00:03:33.910> comes<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.270> printing<00:03:34.600> on<00:03:34.800> it's<00:03:35.800> not<00:03:35.980> too

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
it comes to printing on it's not too

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.590 
it comes to printing on it's not too
easy<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.489> explain<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:37.030> but<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.330> look<00:03:37.480> at

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
easy to explain it but if you look at

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
easy to explain it but if you look at
the<00:03:37.660> picture<00:03:37.989> you<00:03:38.020> can<00:03:38.200> see<00:03:38.230> what<00:03:38.470> I've<00:03:38.560> done

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.400 
so next I just got my black fabric paint
and<00:03:43.270> I<00:03:43.330> put<00:03:43.480> a<00:03:43.510> piece<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.720> cardboard<00:03:44.140> between

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
and I put a piece of cardboard between

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.690 
and I put a piece of cardboard between
the<00:03:44.590> two<00:03:44.770> layers<00:03:44.950> of<00:03:45.040> my<00:03:45.220> kitchen<00:03:45.400> to<00:03:45.610> make

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
the two layers of my kitchen to make

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.510 
the two layers of my kitchen to make
sure<00:03:45.850> my<00:03:45.940> design<00:03:46.270> didn't<00:03:46.540> fit<00:03:46.720> onto<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:46.959> back

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
sure my design didn't fit onto the back

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.949 
sure my design didn't fit onto the back
next<00:03:48.520> I<00:03:48.610> just<00:03:48.640> put<00:03:48.880> my<00:03:48.970> first<00:03:49.239> word<00:03:49.450> template

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
next I just put my first word template

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.690 
next I just put my first word template
which<00:03:50.140> with<00:03:50.290> mischief<00:03:50.680> and<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:51.040> lined<00:03:51.459> it<00:03:51.610> up

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
which with mischief and I lined it up

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.340 
which with mischief and I lined it up
using<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.120> top<00:03:52.570> of<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.780> fish<00:03:52.959> which<00:03:53.200> is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
using the top of the fish which is

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.250 
using the top of the fish which is
everything<00:03:53.680> straight<00:03:53.980> line<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:55.260> moving

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
everything straight line and moving

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.660 
everything straight line and moving
little<00:03:56.590> bit<00:03:56.709> of<00:03:56.769> tape<00:03:56.980> those<00:03:57.190> on<00:03:57.340> the<00:03:57.400> corner

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
little bit of tape those on the corner

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.250 
little bit of tape those on the corner
to<00:03:57.820> hold<00:03:57.910> interface<00:03:58.390> but<00:03:58.600> I<00:03:58.630> do<00:03:58.720> support<00:03:59.049> it

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
to hold interface but I do support it

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.789 
to hold interface but I do support it
with<00:03:59.350> my<00:03:59.470> arm<00:04:00.660> next<00:04:01.660> I<00:04:01.930> literally<00:04:02.440> just<00:04:02.650> use<00:04:02.769> a

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
with my arm next I literally just use a

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.860 
with my arm next I literally just use a
cosmetic<00:04:03.370> sponge<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.910> fact<00:04:04.180> on<00:04:04.420> my<00:04:04.540> favorite

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
I suggest dabbing on rather than

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.840 
I suggest dabbing on rather than
painting<00:04:08.860> on<00:04:09.100> to<00:04:09.220> make<00:04:09.370> sure<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.670> doesn't

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
painting on to make sure it doesn't

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.789

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
fabric and we're then obviously not

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
fabric and we're then obviously not
stick<00:04:13.720> between<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.110> lines
