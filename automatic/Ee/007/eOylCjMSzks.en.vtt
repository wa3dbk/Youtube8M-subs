don't get like a super clumpy look let's

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.280 
don't get like a super clumpy look let's
go<00:04:01.099> I<00:04:01.430> like<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.120> start<00:04:02.599> in<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.110> middle

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
go I like to start in the middle

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.530 
go I like to start in the middle
sometimes<00:04:03.920> like<00:04:04.280> right<00:04:04.310> where<00:04:04.700> my<00:04:04.730> pupil<00:04:05.360> is

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
sometimes like right where my pupil is

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.150 
sometimes like right where my pupil is
and<00:04:05.840> then<00:04:05.959> work<00:04:06.170> my<00:04:06.200> way<00:04:06.350> out<00:04:06.530> and<00:04:06.709> then<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.040> go

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
and then work my way out and then you go

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.520 
and then work my way out and then you go
back<00:04:07.190> and<00:04:07.370> work<00:04:07.819> my<00:04:08.060> way<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.080> middle<00:04:09.380> I

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
back and work my way in to the middle I

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:18.920 
back and work my way in to the middle I
hope<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.860> makes<00:04:10.040> sense

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.349 

so<00:04:19.530> as<00:04:19.709> you<00:04:19.859> can<00:04:19.979> see<00:04:20.220> I<00:04:20.250> test<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.759> inner<00:04:20.970> line

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
so as you can see I test the inner line

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.810 
so as you can see I test the inner line
on<00:04:21.750> quite<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> bit<00:04:22.800> center<00:04:23.220> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:23.550> it<00:04:23.639> got<00:04:23.759> a

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
on quite a bit center and then it got a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.730 
on quite a bit center and then it got a
little<00:04:24.060> bit<00:04:24.270> bigger<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.930> rounder<00:04:25.199> right

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
little bit bigger and rounder right

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.070 
little bit bigger and rounder right
around<00:04:25.919> my<00:04:26.130> people<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.729> I<00:04:27.300> put<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.840> liner

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
around my people and I put the liner

around my people and I put the liner
like<00:04:28.470> in<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.710> inner<00:04:28.949> water<00:04:29.340> line<00:04:29.580> okay

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
like in the inner water line okay

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
so what I'm going to do is take a little

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.900 
so what I'm going to do is take a little
bit<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.289> my<00:04:43.410> duo<00:04:43.680> glue<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.280> put<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:44.580> on<00:04:44.729> the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
bit of my duo glue and put it on the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.300 
bit of my duo glue and put it on the
little<00:04:45.210> plastic<00:04:45.720> lash<00:04:46.320> container<00:04:46.860> like<00:04:47.100> that

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
little plastic lash container like that

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.670 
little plastic lash container like that
and<00:04:47.729> set<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.150> aside<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.720> let<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:48.990> get<00:04:49.080> tacky<00:04:49.380> I

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
and set it aside and let it get tacky I

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.400 
and set it aside and let it get tacky I
usually<00:04:50.310> like<00:04:50.460> to<00:04:50.520> wait<00:04:50.880> like<00:04:51.180> at<00:04:51.720> least<00:04:52.080> 30

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
usually like to wait like at least 30

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.110 
usually like to wait like at least 30
seconds<00:04:52.889> for<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.160> glue<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.370> get<00:04:53.580> tacky<00:04:53.940> but

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
seconds for the glue to get tacky but

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.580 
seconds for the glue to get tacky but
sometimes<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.720> can<00:04:54.840> go<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.020> little<00:04:55.139> longer<00:04:55.320> and

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
sometimes you can go a little longer and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.589 
sometimes you can go a little longer and
it's<00:04:55.740> just<00:04:55.889> easier<00:04:56.039> for<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.580> glue<00:04:56.849> to<00:04:56.880> like

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
it's just easier for the glue to like

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:00.080 
it's just easier for the glue to like
adhere<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.380> your<00:04:58.410> on<00:04:58.889> to<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.310> lashes<00:04:59.699> and<00:04:59.880> into

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
adhere to your on to the lashes and into

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.749 
adhere to your on to the lashes and into
your<00:05:00.210> eyes<00:05:00.330> so<00:05:01.020> set<00:05:01.380> that<00:05:01.560> aside<00:05:01.680> let's<00:05:02.639> do

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:02.759
