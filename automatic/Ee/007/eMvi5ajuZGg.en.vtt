00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Day 8

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Lois: "When I entered the house today to
do some work I found that the temperature

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in here is only 8Â°C. The two furnaces in
here went out so I spent half an hour

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to raise the temperature in the car
workshop. And while I wait for the

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
temperature to raise again I will draw
the iron rings for my speakers

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so I can get them manufactured and
don't lose precious time."

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Day 9

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Lois: "Finally it begins!

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.000
The car dashboard will be removed now
so let's look what's hidden behind

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.500
it and how I will place the speakers
best."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.500
Lois: "So, here is the precious piece!

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.500
It's done!"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Lois: "Okay I would fancy it this way:
Right and left I want to leave it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000
like it is now and I also want to
keep the optics like that, also the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.500
bow upwards except that it all will
be a bit higher so I can meet the

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.000
4cm of additional height...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
okay I think I wil just make it 3cm
so I have enough expansion space left...

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
next... this part will be removed
because I want to use the width of

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the center console for the App Radio
... which I want to place here...

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
usually this is where the normal radio
and the air conditioner system is

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:06.000
placed... for the time being I want
to place these switches up here on

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.500
the right and left side of the speedo
which will be placed about here...

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:18.500
but the hood will be as big as this...
I don't want a slim and narrow hood

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:26.000
but a big and constant one...
although this might look stupid...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
if this part remains straight, it
wouldn't look good if I make the

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000
hood go forward like this...
probably the view axis will remain

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
like this... so I will create a
constant hood which will end

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
straight here at the front...
with the speedo here, the switches

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.500
beside it, two on the left and two
with the speedo here, the switches

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.000
Hammer: "The speedo as far over as possible..."

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Lois: "Yeah, right... like this...

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:01.500
I will cut this part... this part will be
moved to the back... and here in this

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:07.500
width the center console will be placed so
I can take it out if I want to...

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:15.000
and also rearrange it if I want to... so
if it's necessary the right and left part

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
can be kept individually and independent
from the center console...

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the airbag will be removed and the space
can be used for the bass-midrange speaker

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
which will be placed about here... it will
blast at the front and the tweeter will

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:36.000
sit here... and those air outlets... hmmm
... either I will remove them

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
or set them right and left beside the 
center console."

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Hammer: "Lois, you also want to have a
place to put your iPod if possible,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
is that correct?"

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Lois: "Not exactly, but yes, I want a place
to put my Smartphone..."

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.500
Hammer: "Or... yeah... your Smartphone...
and if this is about... that... as wide as

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.500
on air outlet... you can put it aside so
it is possible to pull it out, put your

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.000
Smartphone in and push it back in again..."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Lois: "Yeah, sounds good! Or maybe I could
do it the same way as I did in my A4...

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.500
where I just have to push the Smartphone
in like a card reader, like a slot...

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.000
but this could be difficult... so I
think the version with the drawer is better...

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
well it's not easier..."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Hammer: "...not easier but more elegant!"

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Lois: "Yeah, mor elegant! Aaaand bonus
points for Hammer! Cool idea!"
