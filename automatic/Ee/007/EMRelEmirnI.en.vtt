00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.820 
mmm-hmm the next one actually is a
double<00:04:37.400> stop<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:37.879> you<00:04:38.389> are<00:04:39.050> going<00:04:39.619> to<00:04:39.740> do<00:04:39.800> a

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
double stop so you are going to do a

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.379 
double stop so you are going to do a
slight<00:04:40.099> bid<00:04:40.869> keeping<00:04:41.869> the<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.319> B<00:04:42.499> string<00:04:43.389> non

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
slight bid keeping the the B string non

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:52.649 
slight bid keeping the the B string non
moving<00:04:44.839> and<00:04:45.039> bending<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.490> g<00:04:46.729> string<00:04:50.289> so

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
moving and bending the g string so

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.299 
moving and bending the g string so
keeping<00:04:53.659> that<00:04:53.719> B<00:04:53.990> string<00:04:54.289> non<00:04:54.499> moving<00:04:54.710> keeps

00:04:55.299 --> 00:04:55.309 
keeping that B string non moving keeps

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:58.269 
keeping that B string non moving keeps
your<00:04:56.300> basically<00:04:56.569> getting<00:04:56.779> a<00:04:56.930> unison<00:04:57.680> double

00:04:58.269 --> 00:04:58.279 
your basically getting a unison double

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:00.639 
your basically getting a unison double
stop<00:04:58.460> Bend<00:04:58.789> with<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.210> g<00:04:59.509> string<00:04:59.839> bending<00:05:00.469> up

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:00.649 
stop Bend with the g string bending up

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:08.029 
stop Bend with the g string bending up
to<00:05:00.889> pitch<00:05:01.460> with<00:05:01.999> the<00:05:02.509> B<00:05:02.659> string

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.290 

and<00:05:08.460> then<00:05:08.779> pull<00:05:09.779> off<00:05:10.369> to<00:05:11.369> the<00:05:11.580> fifth<00:05:11.819> fret<00:05:11.999> on

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
and then pull off to the fifth fret on

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.929 
and then pull off to the fifth fret on
the<00:05:12.360> g<00:05:12.659> string<00:05:12.689> so<00:05:13.229> together<00:05:14.039> it<00:05:14.249> sounds<00:05:14.729> like

00:05:14.929 --> 00:05:14.939 
the g string so together it sounds like

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:43.640 
the g string so together it sounds like
this

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.830
