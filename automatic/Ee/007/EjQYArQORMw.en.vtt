00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
few wraps blue thread and so it's just

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900 
few wraps blue thread and so it's just
bread<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> leader<00:00:37.920> which<00:00:38.160> we've<00:00:38.370> painted<00:00:38.610> with

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
bread a leader which we've painted with

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540 
bread a leader which we've painted with
a<00:00:38.940> sharpie<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.890> I'm<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.250> trim<00:00:41.430> off

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
a sharpie and I'm just going to trim off

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.979 
a sharpie and I'm just going to trim off
the<00:00:41.700> excess<00:00:46.789> leave<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.969> little<00:00:48.120> flat<00:00:48.750> there

so<00:00:49.200> we<00:00:49.350> don't<00:00:49.739> get<00:00:49.860> too<00:00:50.070> much<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.399> step<00:00:50.700> and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
so we don't get too much of a step and

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.799 
so we don't get too much of a step and
it<00:00:51.480> also<00:00:51.629> helps<00:00:52.050> keep<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.579> fly<00:00:53.579> secure<00:00:54.120> I'm

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
it also helps keep the fly secure I'm

try this on with a figure eight also

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.160 
try this on with a figure eight also
going<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.500> move<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.829> hackle<00:02:54.159> out<00:02:54.250> of<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.489> way

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
going to move the hackle out of the way

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.750 
going to move the hackle out of the way
put<00:02:56.170> it<00:02:56.290> back<00:02:56.439> a<00:02:56.500> little

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
and we're just going to figure 8 this

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.949 
and we're just going to figure 8 this
one<00:03:01.439> up<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:02.000> worry<00:03:03.000> about<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.299> length<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.780> can

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
one up to worry about the length we can

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.890 
one up to worry about the length we can
trim<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.319> size<00:03:04.439> afterwards<00:03:05.129> just<00:03:05.220> want<00:03:05.579> to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
trim it to size afterwards just want to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.350 
trim it to size afterwards just want to
enough<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.500> secure<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:07.950> into<00:03:08.069> place<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:12.239> that's

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
enough to secure it into place so that's

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.180 
enough to secure it into place so that's
two<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.019> two<00:03:13.079> back<00:03:14.269> wine<00:03:15.269> this<00:03:16.190> thread

yeah I'm going to bring the foam forward
spread<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.780> crackle<00:03:30.780> down<00:03:30.959> for<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.549> legs<00:03:32.549> and

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849 
spread the crackle down for the legs and

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.069 
spread the crackle down for the legs and
the<00:03:32.909> wings<00:03:34.099> just<00:03:35.099> bring<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.640> phone<00:03:36.239> forward

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
the wings just bring this phone forward

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.309 
the wings just bring this phone forward
over<00:03:37.560> try<00:03:38.400> and<00:03:38.579> keep<00:03:38.700> their<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.720> between<00:03:40.139> the

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
over try and keep their it between the

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.309 
over try and keep their it between the
two<00:03:40.500> eyes<00:03:41.239> and<00:03:42.239> then<00:03:42.389> we'll<00:03:42.599> tie<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.260> one

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
two eyes and then we'll tie that one

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:54.820 
two eyes and then we'll tie that one
down<00:03:43.650> over<00:03:47.030> there<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.090> shank

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.210 

then<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.550> can<00:03:55.760> trim<00:03:56.000> off<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.300> excess<00:03:56.600> foam

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
then we can trim off the excess foam

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.690 
then we can trim off the excess foam
leave<00:03:58.220> a<00:03:58.250> little<00:03:58.460> bit<00:03:58.610> of<00:03:58.670> a<00:03:58.820> tag<00:04:00.460> help<00:04:01.460> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
leave a little bit of a tag help the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.760 
leave a little bit of a tag help the
floats<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.650> we<00:04:03.770> can<00:04:04.480> use<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.770> multiple

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
floats and then we can use a multiple

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.550 
floats and then we can use a multiple
turn<00:04:07.150> for<00:04:08.150> turn<00:04:08.420> whip<00:04:08.630> finish<00:04:08.990> on<00:04:09.230> the<00:04:09.350> back

behind the eyes and that is most of the

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.930 
behind the eyes and that is most of the
tying<00:04:17.870> done<00:04:18.200> now<00:04:18.440> we're<00:04:18.680> going<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:18.890> take<00:04:19.700> this

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
one off we're going to even up the wings

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.730 
one off we're going to even up the wings
try<00:04:23.330> not<00:04:23.480> to<00:04:23.540> leave<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:23.900> wings<00:04:24.080> too<00:04:24.500> long

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
try not to leave the wings too long

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.250 
try not to leave the wings too long
there's<00:04:25.670> no<00:04:25.790> point<00:04:26.120> leaving<00:04:26.690> a<00:04:26.750> long<00:04:26.990> wing

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
there's no point leaving a long wing

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.380 
there's no point leaving a long wing
