00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.310
 boys greetings are always in red bol 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.349
 welcome back to this new video is 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.330
 More than a month has passed since boxing 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.890
 previous I said oh well we also do 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.210
 this given the light that was so 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.739
 kind to send me some other headphones 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.900
 of course this for free 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.089
 review this review is a 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.309
 word is a big word these videos don't 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:39.600
 they were paid in no way by 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.769
 lightech therefore I will not be part that is 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.320
 I will list strengths and weaknesses depending on 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.329
 of my personal experiences 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.000
 these headphones are obviously adjustable 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.520
 they have a microphone that you will hear at the end 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.160
 of the video test have the connector 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.190
 gold plated are 5.1 surround 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.379
 year the part in which they are regulated by 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.739
 metal light up when the 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.850
 attached to the computer well isolate the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.740
 ears are quite large 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.470
 pavilions have precisely the 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.050
 remote control there in the headphone cord 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.390
 to adjust the volume, etc. are a lot 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.270
 comfortable do not bother him in the head 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.550
 try it for a few hours and the sound is 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.710
 clean enough the bass is heard 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.440
 well and vibrate for the headphones from 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.330
 gaming is going very well now you are hearing 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.610
 my voice with my usual microphone 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.280
 feel the difference with the microphone 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.950
 of the microphone test headphones of the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.450
 scorpion araf dell'Aitec since when 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.489
 I'm recording I see it's a lot more 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.599
 sensitive of the previous headphones 

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:40.179
 previous 

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:42.039
 the level is much higher despite 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.289
 had to put the volume anyway 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:47.140
 microphone level the microphone level a 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.550
 100 from windows feels without having to 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.390
 attach the microphone to the mouth 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.929
 in fact now I'm wearing them 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.989
 normally the microphone will be around 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.910
 67 centimeters from the mouth and feels yes 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:02:00.700
 see you see who's recording 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.500
 at least keeping the mic ad activated 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.810
 I didn't understand a high level 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.209
 because but there is a slight rustling sound 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.129
 in the headphones if you are listening 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:11.050
 something doesn't bother but they have been 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:13.540
 listening to nothing maybe remember a little 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.870
 annoyance but maybe a problem 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.670
 headphones that I have maybe 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.680
 but so with tips I don't know since I have 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.599
 tried only these drawing our own 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.370
 conclude this microphone apart from 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.200
 background noise that makes and maybe 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.700
 due to too high a volume level 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.799
 that I put on windows that I repeat 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.080
 I put it to a hundred has a very quality 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.060
 high compared to the headphones too 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.819
 I showed you the other time, that is, the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.650
 voice at low highs and hot the only one 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.900
 the problem is precisely the rustling of 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.640
 background that if you use the headphones on 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.440
 teamspeak there is a function that there 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.209
 automatically removes the noise of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.620
 background then the others do not 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.769
 they will therefore feel good to play 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.829
 online and talk if you want to talk 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.950
 video comment video gameplay videos 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:56.900
 where do you speak etc. are fine if with 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.180
 a software thibaud assica went to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.220
 select the piece where you feel 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.140
 the rustling and remove it so it 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.090
 will remove throughout the audio track for 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.590
 what they cost are just fine 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.879
 as a microphone 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.379
 I was positively surprised 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:13.700
 because they range from 32 to 42 euros 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.530
 these prices I found them on 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.140
 findprices ie linking description 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.019
 or on amazon if you want to be safe 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.150
 find them from the 43 44 euros only that there is 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.630
 there are only three left so you see 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.120
 a little you 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.040
 thank you again light for this gift 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.579
 in quotes and we'll talk soon 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.579
