00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.319
 Welcome to this youtube 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.020
 Video 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.090
 Today I show you the iphone 5 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.040
 or I'll show you yet 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.389
 not just like that the iphone 5 of the 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.549
 detailed test 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.800
 Of course, that's mine too 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.250
 we have the white and the two here 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 black iphone 5 as said all the way 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.060
 detailed video where I exactly you 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.250
 explains what all this can do 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 with the predecessor beats like that in the 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.439
 difference to samsung galaxy s3 or 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.360
 the htc onyx and so on and so on 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.130
 there will be videos of me 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.590
 No, today I want you something different 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.290
 show I want to show you today that 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.760
 i have this iphone before ten 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.399
 get days with us in Switzerland 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.700
 is it possible to use the iphone since 28 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.070
 Purchase september and I am 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.770
 concerned of a broken iphone so 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.649
 these iphone stories the iphone 5 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.600
 quasi out of the box to have an effect 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.440
 that is also the case with my model 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.910
 but not the scratch that's it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.680
 which is most obvious 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.330
 Occurs that the devices already scratched 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.710
 that is luckily with me at all 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 not the case take a look at it 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.460
 a wonderful I found it 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.340
 really wonderful 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.720
 no i have another problem and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 Although you hear it very well, you hear that 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.990
 That's why I'm clattering that's it 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:27.240
 iphone what is this is the battery 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.759
 which is not attached properly so 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 obviously with this iphone here 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.280
 The battery was not right 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.320
 glued or the glue has come off 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.200
 so it wobbles a bit plays 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 for the functionality so far none 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400
 roll the iphone works completely 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.290
 Of course, perfect is perfect 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.299
 1000 francs for such a device pays the 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.130
 I do not want it to work, especially since yes 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.799
 also do not know then then in the future not 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.350
 Something else or something dissolves 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.470
 So that's what he of course is 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.450
 unacceptable 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.189
 maybe here with others at the second 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.829
 Model rights got the white 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.570
 that has no problems 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.969
 there is no clinking that has 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.430
 no scratches and so on 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.930
 Also a very nice device 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.789
 Personally, I like it even more 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.409
 a little better than the black model 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.879
 I'm pretty much alone with that 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.219
 When I read that most people find that 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.719
 black model nicely no matter i'm in 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.049
 happy situation that I have two 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.700
 can 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.670
 that's why I have a black and a 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.890
 white but as I said this here 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.209
 that must go back I already have 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.829
 of course with apple contact 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.450
 The easiest way to go is to go 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.519
 in an apple retail store if that's it 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.310
 Unfortunately we only have one in Switzerland 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.629
 zurich and in geneva so far available and 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.129
 if you do that then you can 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.200
 you can get that right from there 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.329
 this is a new device for that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.579
 Clearly a small recommendation from me 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:43.750
 he does it before he leaves if you are 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.659
 have such a problem that the iphone 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.040
 quasi out of the box has an error or 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:49.180
 also if you have the feeling yours 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.099
 iphone has a mistake 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.950
 then go make a genius bar appointment 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.629
 off on apple de or apple ch or 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.700
 apple.com / retail 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.560
 then you select your store and do 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.510
 an appointment at the genius bar all the way 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.280
 Simply from the ground if you just 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.859
 So run into the store and say hey 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.450
 guys listen to that then become 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:12.189
 The immediately say yes is clear 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.440
 defective but under circumstances they have 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.510
 then no replacement device ready because the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.069
 yes, at the moment the iphone 5 are yes 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.900
 still very much sought after 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.780
 delivery time in the online store is four 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.340
 weeks so also the apple retail 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.290
 stores are usually open at noon 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.389
 no more and sell all if 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.919
 But you make a genie start date 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:31.449
 then you can be sure that that 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:33.310
 device is then replaced immediately 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:35.650
 you obviously have devices 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.329
 reserved for just such cases so 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.280
 That's the best way to do it 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.069
 you may also have defective equipment 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.079
 a normal apple premium reseller 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.389
 there it is usually the case 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.889
 then send in the device and do is 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.599
 do not replace immediately then you have to 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:51.489
 quit a short time on it 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.859
 yes, of course, is an annoying thing 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.939
 basically where also I have to 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.590
 say you should not do all that 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:58.780
 overvalue I have so many 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 smartphones with me getting through 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.689
 my hands are going 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.280
 I had had similar with samsung since 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.379
 I have a screen with a yellow 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.790
 stich at htc the battery was broken 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:08.319
 and so on I already have 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.909
 various such things are done 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.650
 not just making it happen at apple 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:13.120
 can 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.979
 but that actually asks 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.290
 most of the time, how are you? 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:19.630
 manufacturer with and around apple 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.150
 actually pretty cool if you have one 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.140
 apple store did that then 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.140
 excellent then you can easily 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.730
 then exchange directly on site 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.350
 if you do not have that you have to stop 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.700
 Call the hotline and recommend 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.370
 to send that one to you or something 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.780
 and if you do a little stalk 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.980
 maybe they send even 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.780
 a device that I do not know exactly 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.850
 but of course you have to, of course 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.080
 change 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.520
 So I wanted to show you briefly 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.470
 as long as I still have it here 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.630
 So with me no scratches or 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.640
 the like no bumps nothing at all 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.730
 device works great but how 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.380
 said there is something wobbling it feels 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.060
 if you swing it back and forth that there 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.650
 Some mass is free to move 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.750
 and that floats accordingly is one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.820
 bit irritating because he has the iphone 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.560
 5 is extremely much easier than that 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.570
 predecessor which falls on one anyway 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.070
 that you are very much a man here 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.600
 has light device in hand and if 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.160
 one then has the feeling that in there 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.990
 is still something resonates course 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.730
 it is not clear you can not 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.160
 accept with such an expensive device 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.420
 otherwise not more so that must 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.550
 I'll change that too 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.980
 do next week but I thought so 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.380
 Just show you this before I 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.110
 then this again gets in the way of it 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.870
 exchange a new one for a flawless one 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.780
 as I said the detailed test of 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.210
 iphone 5 with the predecessor the iphone 4s 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.100
 and with the best known and best 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.330
 android smartphones which there is of me 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.820
 still in the next few weeks 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.860
 you see that on eager point ch and 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.930
 of course on youtube videos as well 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.880
 I would turn to it 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.620
 that's just times that I just you 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.840
 wanted to show how such a broken device 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.880
 Of course, it is not possible to look like that now 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.380
 the hyper bad defect because I 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.780
 It could take ten days 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.890
 every day so has no in the moment 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.770
 no influence on the 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.690
 functionality could also be like that 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.400
 yes does not work or that it just like 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:05.170
 said scratched looks like this or something like that 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.360
 this is not the case here but anyway 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.680
 as I said is annoying thing 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.600
 exchanged and then I have one again 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.540
 very nice new addition to this white 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.640
 I did not want any problems 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.770
 that makes you show your best thanks 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.190
 that was already blood frick for eager 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.390
 Points 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:21.390
 until next time bye
