00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.039
 you know how to adjust the rear-view mirrors and your 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.570
 car shows how this detail can prevent accidents in saving lives 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.310
 the numbers are alarming 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.340
 according to the detran gaucho last year only on the streets of porto alegre 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.450
 were 1 6 thousand 395 accidents with victims reckless speeding 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.300
 and alcohol consumption are among the most frequent reasons for 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.710
 traffic deaths 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.700
 nazak another element that can also be dangerous many accidents happen 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.640
 incorrect adjustment of the rearview mirrors 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 creating an area not covered by peripheral vision and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.550
 in the rearview mirror 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.140
 the instructor of the driver training center of fisio jÃ©ferson cardozo 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.010
 teach correct adjustment of mirrors 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.370
 shops uniqlo the right hordes so he has to privilege to see 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.440
 enough from the street 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.880
 have to open it 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.950
 from outside that have arrived rather than the vehicle was arrested 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.150
 a little more open than that yet 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450
 for him now has to 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.820
 they climbed a little bit him because the beds to see 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.850
 they appear right in the middle of the river runs through 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.650
 little higher 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.840
 it is 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.320
 it means to him that it generates a bit of a change of name 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.550
 and quite a bit here the important thing was that it has no strength 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.130
 stretched on the floor on the left just like on the right 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.840
 He has to appear a lot on the street. 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.330
 this among the orientei year he has to appear other the two sides of the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.020
 rear windshield 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.180
 we did a simple test to show how you can not see a car 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.200
 in certain 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.470
 however rearview mirror observed the queirolo repressors 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 one observes a red valley bar 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.050
 this time he just climbed into the rearview mirror and stayed in the 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.069
 covered 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.619
 not covered by translation is that it's the right spot 

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:16.389
 but not always the regulation of the mirrors solve the problem 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:18.519
 the other tips score 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:19.649
 March 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:24.240
 good time driving vehicle making a change of track 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.039
 he can there are the head 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:30.629
 for this moment to look forward to the rapid increase generate plans look at 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.239
 front so as not to lose the focus of the main that is to observe the front 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.180
 in addition it can take your body 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.270
 and to the head 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.500
 later when this movement is made 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.160
 it has increased our coverage of nature, it has decreased and 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.670
 not him
