00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.750
 we will leave this picture alone 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.750
 We wait until the process finishes 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.970

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.959
 once that process is over, we will 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.849
 an icon appears on the desktop and it 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.010

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.070

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.000
 touch nothing so that the process advances 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.000
 quickly 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.510
 and here we are ending with this 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.910
 process we do not touch anything just wait 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.500
 until the pc is restarted so that the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.500
 process is successfully completed 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.070
 once you restart your pc they will open 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.960
 several windows you just have to 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:27.030
