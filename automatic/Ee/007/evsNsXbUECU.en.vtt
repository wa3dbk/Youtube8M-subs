00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
and to be honest I don't even think well

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.140 
and to be honest I don't even think well
he<00:02:43.019> certainly<00:02:43.530> not<00:02:43.950> he<00:02:44.220> individually<00:02:44.970> reeked

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
he certainly not he individually reeked

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
he certainly not he individually reeked
well<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.019> mean<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.290> buck<00:02:46.440> stops<00:02:46.769> at<00:02:46.980> any<00:02:47.160> CEO

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.500 
well I mean the buck stops at any CEO
but<00:02:48.030> he<00:02:49.019> doesn't<00:02:49.349> deserve<00:02:49.530> a<00:02:50.220> 50%<00:02:51.180> pay<00:02:51.480> cut

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
but he doesn't deserve a 50% pay cut

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.800 
but he doesn't deserve a 50% pay cut
like<00:02:52.049> he's<00:02:52.549> at<00:02:53.549> least<00:02:53.819> he's<00:02:54.090> recognizing<00:02:54.599> the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
like he's at least he's recognizing the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.600 
like he's at least he's recognizing the
problem<00:02:55.200> making<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.650> price<00:02:55.860> cut<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.400> sales

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610

problem making the price cut that sales
are<00:02:56.790> slow<00:02:57.000> right<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.680> he's<00:02:58.680> nipping<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.130> in<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
are slow right so he's nipping it in the

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.740 
are slow right so he's nipping it in the
bud<00:02:59.340> but<00:02:59.700> he's<00:02:59.790> still<00:03:00.090> going<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.420> punish

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750

on those two because if profits aren't
high<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.840> quarter<00:03:34.440> then<00:03:35.430> that's<00:03:35.790> that<00:03:36.209> just

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
high this quarter then that's that just

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
the reason that he mentions Kyoto is I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.480 
the reason that he mentions Kyoto is I
know<00:04:23.760> that<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.150> Japan<00:04:24.289> regional<00:04:25.289> business

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
know that in Japan regional business

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.189 
know that in Japan regional business
dealings<00:04:26.970> are<00:04:27.150> a<00:04:27.180> pretty<00:04:27.389> big<00:04:27.479> deal<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.139> that

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
dealings are a pretty big deal and that

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.370 
dealings are a pretty big deal and that
Kyoto<00:04:28.620> has<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.460> particular<00:04:30.090> style<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:31.080> doing

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
Kyoto has a particular style of doing

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.719 
Kyoto has a particular style of doing
business<00:04:31.590> that<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.099> very<00:04:32.310> different<00:04:32.550> from

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
business that is very different from

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.110 
business that is very different from
every<00:04:33.660> other<00:04:33.810> region<00:04:34.229> in<00:04:34.500> Japan<00:04:34.830> I<00:04:35.099> think<00:04:36.000> it's

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
every other region in Japan I think it's

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.370 
every other region in Japan I think it's
more<00:04:36.240> reserved<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.930> more<00:04:37.050> conservative

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
more reserved and more conservative

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.830 
more reserved and more conservative
maybe<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.460> opposite<00:04:38.819> of<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:39.030> no<00:04:39.419> no<00:04:39.569> it<00:04:39.720> is

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
maybe the opposite of that no no it is

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.140 
maybe the opposite of that no no it is
and<00:04:40.110> that's<00:04:40.560> why<00:04:40.710> it's<00:04:40.889> so<00:04:41.099> like<00:04:41.520> notable<00:04:42.030> is

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and that's why it's so like notable is

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.029 
and that's why it's so like notable is
because<00:04:42.449> you<00:04:42.780> don't<00:04:42.930> expect<00:04:43.259> a<00:04:43.410> Nintendo<00:04:43.919> to

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
because you don't expect a Nintendo to

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.010 
because you don't expect a Nintendo to
be<00:04:44.160> based<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.759> a<00:04:44.880> region<00:04:45.210> where<00:04:45.479> of

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
be based in a region where of

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.420 
be based in a region where of
conservative<00:04:47.750> attitudes<00:04:48.750> anyways<00:04:49.770> so<00:04:50.250> he

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
conservative attitudes anyways so he

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.010 
conservative attitudes anyways so he
responds<00:04:50.910> just<00:04:50.940> by<00:04:51.210> saying<00:04:51.509> like<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:51.930> is

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
not big on it but Vegas is particularly

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.589 
not big on it but Vegas is particularly
for<00:05:59.430> Canadians<00:05:59.940> and<00:06:00.060> I'm<00:06:00.150> sure<00:06:00.330> a<00:06:00.360> lot<00:06:00.449> of

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
for Canadians and I'm sure a lot of

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:03.409 
for Canadians and I'm sure a lot of
other<00:06:00.750> countries<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.500> cheap<00:06:02.280> to<00:06:02.550> fly<00:06:02.729> to<00:06:02.880> like

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 
other countries is cheap to fly to like

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.230 
other countries is cheap to fly to like
they<00:06:04.259> subsidize<00:06:04.740> all<00:06:05.039> their<00:06:05.219> flights<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.940> I

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
they subsidize all their flights and I

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.760 
they subsidize all their flights and I
think<00:06:06.419> they<00:06:06.509> have<00:06:06.630> very<00:06:06.870> little<00:06:07.139> taxes<00:06:07.620> on

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
think they have very little taxes on

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.170 
think they have very little taxes on
their<00:06:07.919> runways<00:06:08.280> and<00:06:08.490> stuff<00:06:08.729> just<00:06:08.969> to<00:06:09.090> make

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
their runways and stuff just to make

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.029 
their runways and stuff just to make
sure<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.719> they<00:06:10.229> get<00:06:10.380> as<00:06:10.469> many<00:06:10.620> tourists

00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 
sure that they get as many tourists

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.020 
sure that they get as many tourists
there<00:06:11.190> as<00:06:11.280> possible<00:06:11.430> because<00:06:11.699> that's<00:06:11.849> what

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
there as possible because that's what

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.820 
there as possible because that's what
they<00:06:12.120> need<00:06:12.300> that's<00:06:12.479> what<00:06:12.810> they<00:06:12.960> run<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.650> city

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
they need that's what they run the city

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.219 
they need that's what they run the city
on<00:06:14.009> second<00:06:14.729> of<00:06:14.789> all<00:06:14.909> the<00:06:15.330> whole<00:06:15.449> place<00:06:15.870> is
