a wing on the outer corner and I just

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.330 
a wing on the outer corner and I just
like<00:01:45.240> using<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.930> wet<00:01:46.200> eye<00:01:46.380> shadow<00:01:46.800> because<00:01:47.040> it

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
like using a wet eye shadow because it

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.000 
like using a wet eye shadow because it
gives<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.910> bit<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.479> softer<00:01:48.990> look<00:01:49.620> for

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
gives a little bit of a softer look for

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.820 
gives a little bit of a softer look for
a<00:01:50.040> winged<00:01:51.000> liner<00:01:51.150> rather<00:01:51.750> than<00:01:52.260> using<00:01:52.620> a

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
a winged liner rather than using a

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.070 
a winged liner rather than using a
liquid<00:01:53.220> liner

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.830 

then<00:01:57.010> to<00:01:57.220> finish<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.790> eyes<00:01:57.970> I'm<00:01:58.390> using<00:01:58.570> the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
then to finish the eyes I'm using the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.680 
then to finish the eyes I'm using the
covergirl<00:01:59.230> LashBlast<00:01:59.710> mascara<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:01.150> the<00:02:01.420> color

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690
