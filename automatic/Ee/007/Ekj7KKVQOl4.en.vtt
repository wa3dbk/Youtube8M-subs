00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.369
 endodontic therapy is a 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.139
 excellent treatment as if a nerve 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:18.689
 of your tooth damages you by any 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 reason contrary to common opinion 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.460
 Endodontic therapy does not have to be 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.890
 an uncomfortable experience the causes of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.770
 nerve damage include caries a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 broken tooth a big covered the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.880
 Preparation of the crown near the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.400
 nerve or trauma 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.470
 once the nerve can not heal the 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.660
 endodontics may be the only option of 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.310
 treatment available to avoid 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 tooth extraction 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.420
 once the nerve dies the bacteria 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 can infect the channels within the 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.190
 tooth what nerve occupies bacterium 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.310
 multiplied can overflow the channels 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.739
 his body fights the invasion this battle 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.840
 lowercase can cause many deaths of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.510
 the cell that can result in the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.760
 formation of an access the death of a 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.860
 nerve and the accumulation of pressure in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.410
 the abscess can lead to pain 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 can push the tooth legally from 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.300
 its position for this reason the patients 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 they complain often that the tooth 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.700
 painful is the only tooth that touches the 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 body can not clean the bacteria from 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.740
 the root canals by itself the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.290
 endodontic therapy thoroughly cleans the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.200
 channels of irritant bacteria using a 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.119
 instrument for cleaning then 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.550
 the channels are filled with a material of 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.300
 sealing and a temporary cap is placed 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.300
 over the tooth 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.850
 once the cleaning has been done and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.470
 the clogged the infected infected area 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.300
 usually quickly 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.850
 however there may be a certain 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.090
 bother for a few days before 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.880
 the area feels more normal step 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.580
 next is to permanently repair the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.240
 tooth replacing the temporary cap 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.520
 by a permanent called a base to the 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.830
 conclude this procedure can be 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:10.380
 necessary to install the posts in the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.380
 channels to help consolidate the base 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.180
 finally a crown covers the area 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.300
 whole to provide a cover 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.210
 protective for the tooth 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.150
 The final steps of the repair should 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.220
 be finished but a treated tooth 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.980
 only with endodontics can 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.720
 need to be removed due to tooth decay 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.720
 recurrent or a fracture 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.420
 endodontic therapy can save a 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.720
 tooth that would otherwise have to be 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.820
 extracted although often the cost is 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.770
 endodontic therapy will cost less 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.320
 in the long term that the treatments 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.740
 available to replace a tooth 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.740
 lost
