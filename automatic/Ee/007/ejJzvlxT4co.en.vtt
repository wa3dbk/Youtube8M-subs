of<00:04:19.630> how<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:20.110> belt<00:04:20.500> goes<00:04:20.830> on<00:04:21.720> okay<00:04:22.720> because

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
of how this belt goes on okay because

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.950 
of how this belt goes on okay because
don't<00:04:23.890> want<00:04:24.100> that<00:04:24.250> belt<00:04:24.640> wrapped<00:04:25.330> up<00:04:25.630> around

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
don't want that belt wrapped up around

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.450 
don't want that belt wrapped up around
these<00:04:26.230> pins<00:04:27.780> now<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:28.810> believe<00:04:29.170> that<00:04:29.200> belt<00:04:29.680> has

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
these pins now I believe that belt has

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.740 
these pins now I believe that belt has
to<00:04:30.610> come<00:04:30.930> around<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:34.240> we<00:04:34.330> have<00:04:34.450> to<00:04:34.540> pull

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
to come around this so we have to pull

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.480 
to come around this so we have to pull
that<00:04:34.900> up<00:04:34.960> around<00:04:35.380> that<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.160> because

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
that up around that like that because

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.120 
that up around that like that because
that's<00:04:36.700> going<00:04:36.970> up<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.300> there<00:04:37.770> and<00:04:38.770> one<00:04:38.920> that

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
that's going up in there and one that

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.890 
that's going up in there and one that
when<00:04:39.640> we<00:04:39.760> get<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.030> deck<00:04:40.210> hooked<00:04:40.450> up<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.780> raise

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
when we get the deck hooked up and raise

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.560 
when we get the deck hooked up and raise
it<00:04:41.140> up<00:04:41.290> this<00:04:42.280> belts<00:04:42.700> gonna<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.150> go<00:04:43.270> around

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
it up this belts gonna have to go around

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.650 
it up this belts gonna have to go around
here<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.140> around<00:04:44.800> here<00:04:45.010> and<00:04:45.820> then<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:46.480> then
