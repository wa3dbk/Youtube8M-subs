00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
now the reason I'm doing this is because

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.250 
now the reason I'm doing this is because
a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.529> while<00:00:25.740> ago<00:00:25.980> um<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.970> was<00:00:27.900> considering

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
a little while ago um I was considering

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.099 
a little while ago um I was considering
purchasing<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.640> was<00:00:29.820> told<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> they

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
purchasing it and I was told that they

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.010 
purchasing it and I was told that they
break<00:00:31.500> very<00:00:32.130> easily<00:00:32.390> now<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> watched<00:00:33.780> some

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
break very easily now I watched some

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.020 
break very easily now I watched some
reviews<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.309> figured<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.820> don't

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
reviews on it and I figured you don't

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.459

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
costume and if worse comes to worst I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.209 
costume and if worse comes to worst I
will<00:00:44.520> contact<00:00:45.180> cement<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.660> back<00:00:45.840> together<00:00:46.219> the

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
will contact cement it back together the

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.430 
will contact cement it back together the
issue<00:00:47.370> being<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.539> area<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.230> area

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
issue being this area and this area

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.779 
issue being this area and this area
would<00:00:49.770> separate<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> gem<00:00:52.430> which<00:00:53.430> seemed

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
would separate from the gem which seemed

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.139 
would separate from the gem which seemed
to<00:00:54.120> be<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.390> huge<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.699> common

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
to be a huge thing and pretty common

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.810 
to be a huge thing and pretty common
with<00:00:57.270> most<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.719> wands<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.430> was<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> bit

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
with most of the wands so I was a bit

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
with most of the wands so I was a bit
skeptical<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.449> figured<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.870> what<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
skeptical but I figured you know what I

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.830 
skeptical but I figured you know what I
have<00:01:01.379> ways<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.890> can<00:01:02.010> fix<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> went

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
have ways that I can fix this so I went

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.200 
have ways that I can fix this so I went
and<00:01:03.899> bought<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.170> anyway<00:01:04.470> well<00:01:04.799> today<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.909> bought

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
and bought it anyway well today I bought

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
and bought it anyway well today I bought
it<00:01:06.390> well<00:01:07.229> today<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.680> came<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.659> I<00:01:09.659> realized

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
it well today it came in and I realized

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.070 
it well today it came in and I realized
that<00:01:10.740> my<00:01:11.490> wand<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.000> actually<00:01:12.390> different<00:01:12.930> from

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that my wand is actually different from

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.560 
that my wand is actually different from
the<00:01:13.200> ones<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.530> seen<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.920> past<00:01:14.150> um<00:01:15.180> my

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the ones I've seen in the past um my

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.600 
the ones I've seen in the past um my
wand<00:01:15.890> has<00:01:17.119> what<00:01:18.119> appears<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.659> metal<00:01:19.140> rod

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
wand has what appears to be a metal rod

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.130 
wand has what appears to be a metal rod
actually<00:01:20.610> going<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.869> jewel

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
actually going right through the jewel

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.609 
actually going right through the jewel
so<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.460> wouldn't<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.509> discouraged<00:01:25.110> from<00:01:25.380> buying

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so I wouldn't be discouraged from buying

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.160 
so I wouldn't be discouraged from buying
this<00:01:25.860> wand<00:01:26.130> anymore<00:01:26.670> because<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.900> noble

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
this wand anymore because the noble

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.660 
this wand anymore because the noble
collection<00:01:28.290> has<00:01:28.650> clearly<00:01:28.979> had<00:01:29.369> enough

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
collection has clearly had enough

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.880 
collection has clearly had enough
problems<00:01:30.150> with<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.140> they've<00:01:31.290> decided<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
problems with it that they've decided to

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
problems with it that they've decided to
reinforce<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.759> now<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.689> not<00:01:33.840> like<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.590> most

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
reinforce it now it's not like the most

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
reinforce it now it's not like the most
beautiful<00:01:35.310> job<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> world<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.630> rod<00:01:36.780> is

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
beautiful job in the world the rod is

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.319 
beautiful job in the world the rod is
off-center<00:01:37.430> but<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> hold<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.150> at<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
off-center but if you hold it at a

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.969 
off-center but if you hold it at a
distance<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.990> don't<00:01:40.020> even<00:01:40.320> notice<00:01:40.650> it's

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
distance you don't even notice it's

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030 
distance you don't even notice it's
there<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.780> have<00:01:42.780> no<00:01:42.930> qualms<00:01:43.320> with<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.860> would

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
there I have no qualms with it I would

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.130 
there I have no qualms with it I would
rather<00:01:44.310> have<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:44.759> in<00:01:44.909> there<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.869> have
