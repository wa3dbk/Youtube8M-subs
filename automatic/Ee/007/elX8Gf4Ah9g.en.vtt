it<00:01:04.260> took<00:01:04.860> me<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> little<00:01:05.250> while<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.610> hone<00:01:06.270> my

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it took me a little while to hone my

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.230 
it took me a little while to hone my
skills<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.650> once<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.070> got<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> had<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the controls were pretty standard right

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.359

click to aim left-click to fire and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910

there<00:01:14.760> was<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.210> noob<00:01:15.420> tube<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> had

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
there was even a noob tube but I had

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
there was even a noob tube but I had
enough<00:01:17.189> class<00:01:17.580> tonight<00:01:17.939> music<00:01:18.600> gameplay<00:01:19.470> was

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
enough class tonight music gameplay was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.100 
enough class tonight music gameplay was
very<00:01:20.100> smooth<00:01:20.549> but<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.090> noticed<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> as<00:01:21.840> soon

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
very smooth but I noticed that as soon

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770 
very smooth but I noticed that as soon
as<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.380> spawned<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.130> had<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.820> act<00:01:24.000> quickly

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
as I spawned I had to act quickly

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
as I spawned I had to act quickly
since<00:01:25.170> spawn<00:01:25.439> killing<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:25.950> common<00:01:26.430> one<00:01:27.060> thing

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
since spawn killing is common one thing

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.179 
since spawn killing is common one thing
I<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.869> liked<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.439> continuous

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I really liked was the continuous

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
I really liked was the continuous
gameplay<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:30.000> was<00:01:30.360> never<00:01:30.689> at<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> lobby<00:01:31.290> screen

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
