without<00:00:45.719> stuff<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.890> probably

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
without stuff like this I probably

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.880 
without stuff like this I probably
wouldn't<00:00:48.030> be<00:00:48.260> practicing<00:00:49.260> my<00:00:49.440> basic

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
wouldn't be practicing my basic

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.170 
wouldn't be practicing my basic
rudiments<00:00:50.280> without<00:00:50.670> stuff<00:00:50.879> like<00:00:51.030> this

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
rudiments without stuff like this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.900 
rudiments without stuff like this
because<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.350> almost<00:00:52.530> never<00:00:52.890> do<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.610> devil's

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
because I almost never do the devil's

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.459 
because I almost never do the devil's
and<00:00:54.329> all<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> stuff<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.930> probably<00:00:55.170> should

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
and all that stuff I probably should

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.639 
and all that stuff I probably should
need<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:56.000> regain<00:00:57.000> focus<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.719> thanks<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.410> your
