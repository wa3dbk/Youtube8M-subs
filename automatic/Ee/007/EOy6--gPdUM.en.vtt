00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.430 
single one of the keys can be
reprogrammed<00:02:31.620> using<00:02:32.160> macros<00:02:32.640> so<00:02:33.599> how<00:02:34.230> can<00:02:34.290> you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
reprogrammed using macros so how can you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.900

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
how many times that they're building a

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.550 
how many times that they're building a
certain<00:03:03.329> unit<00:03:03.569> let's<00:03:03.720> say<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.959> starcraft<00:03:04.410> 2

thin and it does actually have an

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.159 
thin and it does actually have an
ethernet<00:04:11.040> port<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.970> has<00:04:12.959> that
