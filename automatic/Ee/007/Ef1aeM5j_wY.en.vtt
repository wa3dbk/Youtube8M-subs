00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:05.600
 analysis of personal and red data 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.709
 in this video I will show you how to write ours on the table 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:16.210
 milano on the table is a very beautiful flowering and is very useful especially if you are 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.329
 is inserted 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.709
 the magic trick in which it is fundamental 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.759
 to the viewer as spectators 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.389
 that the pace of the savory you are playing is actually 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.210
 a turkey kiss by the sea and not made up 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.910
 in this case it is enough on the table 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.150
 executed 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.470
 the face of the fairies facing upwards 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.300
 let's go see the fetus 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.640
 there he is 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.120
 the fairies arrange themselves evenly on the surface 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.199
 then i love you 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:02.199
 with the initial position 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.729
 the beauty and the memory of a hand are 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.729
 on the short side of the bass 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.300
 in the place 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.300
 we find the thumb 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.010
 on the wolf there are those who say instead 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.990
 which serves to give you the review 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.370
 to the fratte 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.560
 and who is the one who answers 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.110
 uniformly 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.100
 on self 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.640
 to perform this writing 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.170
 things are necessary the first did the file just because yes 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.579
 surrenders draws to a point 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.920
 in the American mix 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
 second thing a rough surface 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.690
 we list local part of the necessary resistance 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.260
 because you can stand up 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.190
 and lite let's go and see how it works 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.920
 initial position 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 we put the kiss on the table 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.830
 blade moves slowly 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.630
 putting all the cypresses raises as it moves 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.630
 this to release the potatoes 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.719
 we still do 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.129
 starting position 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.129
 the hand moves the fingers are raised 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.689
 done 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:33.839
 flowering is even better if done 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.669
 with the face of the revenue 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:37.539
 upward 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:42.569
 now let's see how to turn the nose on the table first 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.179
 what you have to insert the fingers of one hand under one end of the ribbon 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.259
 it rises 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:57.709
 the e kate remain of cricket in this case because the surface on curious, 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.089
 frying 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.949
 it's very wet 

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:02.970
 at this point we can or 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.480
 complete the rollover 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.369
 or even 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.109
 and manipulate 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.619
 pillar 

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:14.049
 simply by moving 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.129
 overturning 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.129
 climate controls 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.069
 do you still have 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.189
 here it is quality I am under reserve of the madman 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:41.439
 dog overturning 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.609
 how do you now take the cards back into your hand 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.609
 it's the elegant way 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:53.679
 the three castles in Rome under how to iron and the other 

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:59.109
 ii we push forward again until the bortellina ribbon 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:01.889
 at this point 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.779
 declare the thumb 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.369
 above the palace 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.669
 who returns 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.669
 compact hand 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.679
 many greetings dangerous 7
