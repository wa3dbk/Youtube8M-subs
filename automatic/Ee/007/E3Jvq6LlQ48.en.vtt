exams investigative skill assessments

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.580 
exams investigative skill assessments
which<00:05:02.880> are<00:05:03.419> basically<00:05:03.810> you<00:05:04.080> do<00:05:04.229> a<00:05:04.260> science

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
which are basically you do a science

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.350 
which are basically you do a science
experiment<00:05:04.860> you<00:05:05.130> answer<00:05:05.460> questions<00:05:06.000> on<00:05:06.150> them

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
experiment you answer questions on them

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.930 
experiment you answer questions on them
and<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.020> exam<00:05:07.289> paper<00:05:07.590> which<00:05:08.100> wasn't<00:05:08.850> too

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
and in the exam paper which wasn't too

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.670 
and in the exam paper which wasn't too
bad<00:05:09.180> for<00:05:09.449> our<00:05:09.479> biology<00:05:10.080> one<00:05:10.229> we<00:05:10.350> were<00:05:10.440> burning

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
bad for our biology one we were burning

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.800 
bad for our biology one we were burning
crackers<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.639> marshmallows<00:05:11.820> to<00:05:12.419> determine

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
crackers and marshmallows to determine

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.990 
crackers and marshmallows to determine
the<00:05:13.229> energy<00:05:13.710> content<00:05:13.949> releasing<00:05:14.550> just<00:05:14.880> the

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
the energy content releasing just the

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.570 
the energy content releasing just the
worst<00:05:15.270> experiment<00:05:16.020> think<00:05:16.620> I've<00:05:16.740> ever<00:05:16.979> had<00:05:17.370> to

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
worst experiment think I've ever had to

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.480 
worst experiment think I've ever had to
do<00:05:17.850> it<00:05:18.090> like<00:05:18.510> so<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.710> terrible<00:05:20.099> but<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.280> guess

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
do it like so so terrible but I guess

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:21.409 
do it like so so terrible but I guess
that's<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.729> good<00:05:20.849> thing<00:05:20.910> because<00:05:21.120> when<00:05:21.330> it

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
that's a good thing because when it

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.750 
that's a good thing because when it
comes<00:05:21.599> to<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.750> exams<00:05:22.110> I<00:05:22.590> can<00:05:23.250> you<00:05:23.460> know<00:05:23.550> write

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
comes to the exams I can you know write

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.760 
comes to the exams I can you know write
loads<00:05:24.090> about<00:05:24.240> how<00:05:24.570> terrible<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.229> experiment

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
loads about how terrible the experiment

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.450 
loads about how terrible the experiment
was<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.389> how<00:05:27.530> unreliable<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.740> imprecise<00:05:29.430> and

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460 
was and how unreliable and imprecise and

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.159 
was and how unreliable and imprecise and
on<00:05:29.880> accurate<00:05:30.360> it<00:05:30.449> was<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.750> all<00:05:30.810> that<00:05:30.840> kind<00:05:31.110> of

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
on accurate it was and all that kind of

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.580 
on accurate it was and all that kind of
stuff<00:05:31.289> so<00:05:31.740> yeah<00:05:32.729> everything's<00:05:33.479> really<00:05:33.750> going

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
stuff so yeah everything's really going
