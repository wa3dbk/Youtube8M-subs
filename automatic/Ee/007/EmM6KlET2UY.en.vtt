everybody to participate that's ideal
and<00:00:23.320> you<00:00:23.679> know<00:00:23.829> typically<00:00:24.550> most<00:00:25.029> people<00:00:25.659> in

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
and you know typically most people in

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.609 
and you know typically most people in
the<00:00:25.810> family<00:00:25.929> are<00:00:26.079> gonna<00:00:26.140> have<00:00:26.349> a<00:00:26.380> similar

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
the family are gonna have a similar

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:27.899 
the family are gonna have a similar
genetic<00:00:26.859> background<00:00:27.579> and<00:00:27.730> they're<00:00:27.849> gonna

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:27.909 
genetic background and they're gonna

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.479 
genetic background and they're gonna
probably<00:00:28.509> benefit<00:00:29.259> from<00:00:29.289> the<00:00:29.710> same<00:00:29.890> diet<00:00:30.189> and

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
probably benefit from the same diet and

probably benefit from the same diet and
one<00:00:30.579> way<00:00:30.730> or<00:00:30.789> another<00:00:30.849> you<00:00:31.210> might<00:00:31.329> have<00:00:31.449> one

one way or another you might have one

autoimmune or father with migraines or

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.750 
autoimmune or father with migraines or
something<00:00:37.840> often<00:00:38.530> they<00:00:38.620> will<00:00:38.739> all<00:00:38.980> benefit<00:00:39.550> so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
something often they will all benefit so

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.340 
something often they will all benefit so
I<00:00:39.940> would<00:00:40.149> really<00:00:40.570> work<00:00:40.660> on<00:00:40.809> putting<00:00:40.960> the<00:00:41.109> whole

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
I would really work on putting the whole

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.709 
I would really work on putting the whole
family<00:00:41.920> on<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.190> diet<00:00:42.370> when<00:00:42.609> you<00:00:42.699> can<00:00:42.940> remove

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
family on the diet when you can remove

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.779 
family on the diet when you can remove
anything<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.320> you<00:00:44.500> know<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.859> be<00:00:45.100> an<00:00:45.219> allergen

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
anything that you know to be an allergen

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.790 
anything that you know to be an allergen
or<00:00:46.030> suspect<00:00:46.660> to<00:00:46.750> be<00:00:46.840> an<00:00:46.929> allergen<00:00:47.350> right<00:00:47.530> away

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
or suspect to be an allergen right away

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.069 
or suspect to be an allergen right away
and<00:00:48.129> then<00:00:48.160> begin<00:00:48.850> to<00:00:49.030> add<00:00:49.179> some<00:00:49.570> nutrient

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
and then begin to add some nutrient

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.410 
and then begin to add some nutrient
dense<00:00:50.260> foods<00:00:50.649> this<00:00:51.010> is<00:00:51.190> a<00:00:51.219> long-term<00:00:52.120> process

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
dense foods this is a long-term process

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.329 
dense foods this is a long-term process
you<00:00:52.750> can<00:00:52.780> start<00:00:53.199> right<00:00:53.289> now<00:00:53.469> and<00:00:53.829> this<00:00:54.160> is

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
you can start right now and this is

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.009 
you can start right now and this is
something<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.730> probably<00:00:54.940> work<00:00:55.359> on<00:00:55.539> for<00:00:55.809> years

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
something you probably work on for years

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.049 
something you probably work on for years
just<00:00:56.260> getting<00:00:56.800> more<00:00:57.010> nutrient-dense<00:00:57.609> foods

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
just getting more nutrient-dense foods

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.200 
just getting more nutrient-dense foods
in<00:00:58.300> there<00:00:59.100> fermented<00:01:00.100> foods<00:01:00.339> adding<00:01:00.820> those<00:01:00.969> as

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
in there fermented foods adding those as

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.939 
in there fermented foods adding those as
you<00:01:01.359> can<00:01:01.659> and<00:01:01.989> then<00:01:02.050> we<00:01:02.499> are<00:01:02.589> going<00:01:02.679> to<00:01:02.769> do<00:01:02.859> is

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
you can and then we are going to do is

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.680 
you can and then we are going to do is
you're<00:01:03.010> going<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.219> introduce<00:01:03.699> gluten<00:01:04.600> and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
you're going to introduce gluten and

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.650 
you're going to introduce gluten and
casein<00:01:04.900> free<00:01:05.280> substitutes<00:01:06.280> before<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.360> take

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
casein free substitutes before you take

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.050 
casein free substitutes before you take
out<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:08.020> gluten<00:01:08.410> and<00:01:08.470> casein<00:01:08.680> then<00:01:09.550> you<00:01:09.910> can

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
out that gluten and casein then you can

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.520 
out that gluten and casein then you can
start<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.510> implement<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.170> gluten

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
start to implement the gluten

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.680 
start to implement the gluten
casein-free<00:01:11.680> diet<00:01:12.100> at<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.670> point<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.180> then

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
casein-free diet at that point and then

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.210 
casein-free diet at that point and then
from<00:01:14.020> there<00:01:14.230> determine<00:01:14.740> if<00:01:14.830> there's<00:01:15.010> other

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
from there determine if there's other

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.470 
from there determine if there's other
foods<00:01:15.640> that<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.300> child<00:01:16.540> also<00:01:16.810> intolerant<00:01:17.590> to

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:18.480 
foods that the child also intolerant to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.570 
foods that the child also intolerant to
so<00:01:19.480> you<00:01:19.540> want<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:19.810> chart<00:01:20.200> your<00:01:20.290> progress<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
so you want to chart your progress you

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.120 
so you want to chart your progress you
really<00:01:21.970> want<00:01:22.660> to<00:01:22.810> have<00:01:23.200> an<00:01:23.350> idea<00:01:23.650> and<00:01:23.800> only<00:01:23.980> do

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
really want to have an idea and only do

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.170 
really want to have an idea and only do
one<00:01:24.370> thing<00:01:24.400> at<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.820> time<00:01:24.910> because<00:01:25.900> if<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:27.180> start

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
one thing at a time because if you start

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:29.640 
one thing at a time because if you start
two<00:01:28.420> or<00:01:28.510> three<00:01:28.690> different<00:01:28.870> interventions<00:01:29.500> at

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
two or three different interventions at

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.460 
two or three different interventions at
once<00:01:29.860> it's<00:01:30.310> hard<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.730> know<00:01:30.940> what<00:01:31.840> is<00:01:32.080> helping

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
once it's hard to know what is helping

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.680 
once it's hard to know what is helping
them<00:01:32.860> and<00:01:33.160> what<00:01:33.400> is<00:01:33.580> not<00:01:34.060> or<00:01:34.330> if<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:34.510> see

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
them and what is not or if you see

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.630 
them and what is not or if you see
something<00:01:34.900> negative<00:01:35.620> your<00:01:36.100> it's<00:01:36.430> going<00:01:36.580> to

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
something negative your it's going to

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.310 
something negative your it's going to
heart<00:01:36.820> be<00:01:36.910> hard<00:01:37.120> to<00:01:37.210> know<00:01:37.330> so<00:01:37.750> start<00:01:37.990> with<00:01:38.080> one

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
heart be hard to know so start with one

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.740 
heart be hard to know so start with one
thing<00:01:38.590> and<00:01:38.770> take<00:01:39.250> some<00:01:39.520> notes<00:01:39.730> keep<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.510> diet

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
thing and take some notes keep a diet

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.780 
thing and take some notes keep a diet
record<00:01:41.170> if<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.980> then<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.460> can<00:01:42.610> start

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
record if you can and then you can start

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.400 
record if you can and then you can start
to<00:01:43.030> see<00:01:43.060> some<00:01:43.300> other<00:01:43.600> patterns<00:01:44.110> like<00:01:44.230> wow

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
to see some other patterns like wow

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.160 
to see some other patterns like wow
every<00:01:45.190> time<00:01:45.370> I<00:01:45.400> give<00:01:45.640> him<00:01:46.150> corn<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.810> every<00:01:46.990> time

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
every time I give him corn or every time

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.430 
every time I give him corn or every time
I<00:01:47.200> give<00:01:47.470> her<00:01:48.450> peaches<00:01:49.450> or<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.140> know<00:01:50.260> whatever

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
I give her peaches or you know whatever

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.590 
I give her peaches or you know whatever
it<00:01:50.650> might<00:01:50.740> be<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:51.100> see<00:01:51.580> a<00:01:51.610> problem<00:01:51.940> and<00:01:52.330> then<00:01:52.450> you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
it might be I see a problem and then you

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.180 
it might be I see a problem and then you
can<00:01:52.720> start<00:01:52.930> to<00:01:53.020> make<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.410> pattern<00:01:53.770> but<00:01:54.010> if<00:01:54.100> you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
can start to make a pattern but if you

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.460 
can start to make a pattern but if you
try<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.400> think<00:01:54.730> back<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.570> really<00:01:56.140> hard<00:01:56.350> to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
try to think back it's really hard to

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.110 
try to think back it's really hard to
try<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.680> find<00:01:57.370> any<00:01:57.580> up<00:01:57.880> pattern<00:01:58.750> to<00:01:58.960> it<00:01:58.990> and

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.120 
try to find any up pattern to it and

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.290 
try to find any up pattern to it and
then<00:02:01.120> you<00:02:01.240> want<00:02:01.390> to<00:02:01.450> watch<00:02:01.750> for<00:02:02.290> signs<00:02:02.590> of

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
then you want to watch for signs of

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.000 
then you want to watch for signs of
regression<00:02:04.300> because<00:02:04.900> regression<00:02:05.650> can<00:02:05.860> be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
regression because regression can be

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.520 
regression because regression can be
good<00:02:06.460> or<00:02:06.760> it<00:02:06.790> can<00:02:06.970> be<00:02:07.090> bad<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:07.690> for<00:02:08.050> instance<00:02:08.110> if

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
good or it can be bad so for instance if

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.779 
good or it can be bad so for instance if
you<00:02:08.709> take<00:02:08.950> out<00:02:09.069> gluten<00:02:09.310> k

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
you take out gluten k

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.630 
you take out gluten k
scene<00:02:09.969> and<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.959> are<00:02:11.379> not<00:02:11.799> doing<00:02:12.129> well<00:02:12.280> it

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
scene and they are not doing well it

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.059 
scene and they are not doing well it
could<00:02:13.299> be<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.959> they're<00:02:14.590> going<00:02:14.859> through<00:02:15.010> a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
could be because they're going through a

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.619 
could be because they're going through a
little<00:02:15.280> bit<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.400> an<00:02:15.519> opiate<00:02:15.879> withdrawal<00:02:16.359> and

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
little bit of an opiate withdrawal and

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.360 
little bit of an opiate withdrawal and
hopefully<00:02:17.590> we're<00:02:17.890> going<00:02:18.010> to<00:02:18.069> talk<00:02:18.189> in<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
hopefully we're going to talk in the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.800 
hopefully we're going to talk in the
afternoon<00:02:18.700> about<00:02:18.790> doing<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.150> slowly<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
afternoon about doing it slowly and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.300 
afternoon about doing it slowly and
hopefully<00:02:20.200> avoiding<00:02:20.439> some<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.709> that<00:02:20.859> but<00:02:21.219> if

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
hopefully avoiding some of that but if

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.089 
hopefully avoiding some of that but if
they're<00:02:21.579> really<00:02:22.239> unhappy<00:02:22.959> or<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.680> mean<00:02:23.890> think

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
they're really unhappy or I mean think

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.890 
they're really unhappy or I mean think
about<00:02:24.159> if<00:02:24.459> someone<00:02:24.909> is<00:02:25.030> detoxing<00:02:25.659> from<00:02:25.689> heroin

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
about if someone is detoxing from heroin

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.229 
about if someone is detoxing from heroin
or<00:02:26.439> something<00:02:26.470> or<00:02:27.010> or<00:02:27.220> whatever<00:02:27.909> that<00:02:27.970> might

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
or something or or whatever that might

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.970 
or something or or whatever that might
be<00:02:28.299> they<00:02:28.840> might<00:02:29.079> not<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.319> feeling<00:02:29.709> so<00:02:29.859> good

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
be they might not be feeling so good

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.630 
be they might not be feeling so good
they<00:02:30.129> might<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.430> cranky<00:02:30.790> they<00:02:30.909> might<00:02:31.090> be<00:02:31.349> angry

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
they might be cranky they might be angry

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.699 
they might be cranky they might be angry
is<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.359> when<00:02:34.510> we<00:02:34.599> took<00:02:34.840> out<00:02:35.019> the<00:02:35.290> gluten

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
is it that when we took out the gluten

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.410 
is it that when we took out the gluten
that<00:02:36.189> they're<00:02:36.430> having<00:02:36.579> a<00:02:36.819> little<00:02:37.060> bit<00:02:37.180> of<00:02:37.209> a

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
that they're having a little bit of a

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.569 
that they're having a little bit of a
reaction<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.470> that's<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.099> to<00:02:39.159> clear<00:02:39.430> up

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
reaction and that's going to clear up

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:40.709 
reaction and that's going to clear up
pretty<00:02:39.819> rapidly<00:02:40.269> they're<00:02:40.450> going<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.629> feel

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:40.719 
pretty rapidly they're going to feel

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:42.509 
pretty rapidly they're going to feel
great<00:02:40.750> in<00:02:41.200> a<00:02:41.260> short<00:02:41.469> period<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.709> time<00:02:41.769> or<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.370> it

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
great in a short period of time or is it

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.520 
great in a short period of time or is it
that<00:02:42.609> we<00:02:42.730> just<00:02:42.909> substituted<00:02:43.420> corn<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:44.019> corn

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
that we just substituted corn and corn

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.770 
that we just substituted corn and corn
is<00:02:44.680> equally<00:02:45.129> problematic<00:02:45.430> food<00:02:46.030> and<00:02:46.269> now

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
is equally problematic food and now

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.780 
is equally problematic food and now
we're<00:02:47.079> seeing<00:02:47.349> a<00:02:47.439> negative<00:02:47.980> thing<00:02:48.220> from<00:02:48.400> corn

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
we're seeing a negative thing from corn

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.729 
we're seeing a negative thing from corn
so<00:02:49.239> what<00:02:49.419> we<00:02:49.510> want<00:02:49.689> we<00:02:49.840> need<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.139> kind<00:02:50.349> of<00:02:50.470> be

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
so what we want we need to kind of be

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.220 
so what we want we need to kind of be
our<00:02:50.950> own<00:02:51.099> detectives<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:51.909> again<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.780> moms

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
our own detectives and again you moms

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.780 
our own detectives and again you moms
and<00:02:53.439> dads<00:02:53.530> are<00:02:53.829> with<00:02:53.950> your<00:02:54.069> children<00:02:54.280> all<00:02:54.609> the

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
and dads are with your children all the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.369 
and dads are with your children all the
time<00:02:55.000> you<00:02:55.419> know<00:02:55.599> them<00:02:55.750> better<00:02:55.900> than<00:02:55.989> anybody

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
time you know them better than anybody

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.129 
time you know them better than anybody
else<00:02:56.709> does<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.519> have<00:02:57.879> this<00:02:58.060> gut<00:02:58.269> instinct<00:02:58.840> go

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
else does you have this gut instinct go

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.020 
else does you have this gut instinct go
with<00:02:59.500> your<00:02:59.739> gut<00:02:59.769> if<00:03:00.220> you<00:03:00.459> feel<00:03:00.669> like<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:00.939> know

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
with your gut if you feel like you know

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.990 
with your gut if you feel like you know
what<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.269> isn't<00:03:01.480> right<00:03:01.870> then<00:03:02.409> back<00:03:02.829> up<00:03:03.099> state

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
what this isn't right then back up state

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.849 
what this isn't right then back up state
you<00:03:04.180> know<00:03:04.269> start<00:03:04.659> over<00:03:04.780> again<00:03:04.959> start<00:03:05.590> fresh

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
you know start over again start fresh

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:07.349 
you know start over again start fresh
and<00:03:05.889> figure<00:03:06.310> out<00:03:06.340> where<00:03:06.579> to<00:03:06.639> go<00:03:06.879> from<00:03:07.090> there

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
and figure out where to go from there

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:09.449 
and figure out where to go from there
but<00:03:07.930> you<00:03:08.230> have<00:03:08.439> to<00:03:08.590> kind<00:03:08.919> of<00:03:09.010> do<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.189> little

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
but you have to kind of do a little

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.020 
but you have to kind of do a little
interpretation<00:03:10.329> usually<00:03:10.989> if<00:03:11.109> something<00:03:11.560> is

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
interpretation usually if something is

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.140 
interpretation usually if something is
fairly<00:03:13.030> mild<00:03:13.599> and<00:03:14.049> short-lived<00:03:14.799> it<00:03:15.400> usually

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
fairly mild and short-lived it usually

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.330 
fairly mild and short-lived it usually
is<00:03:16.239> something<00:03:16.720> that<00:03:16.989> was<00:03:17.260> kind<00:03:17.590> of<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.739> positive

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
is something that was kind of a positive

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.240
