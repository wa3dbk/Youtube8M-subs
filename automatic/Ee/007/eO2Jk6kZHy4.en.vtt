00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
over the course of about a year I work

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.020 
over the course of about a year I work
through<00:02:28.410> all<00:02:28.590> these<00:02:28.740> lessons<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.400> exercises

what I needed it opened up a whole new
world<00:02:37.560> of<00:02:37.770> possibilities<00:02:37.830> and<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.780> made

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
world of possibilities and it just made

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.810 
world of possibilities and it just made
music<00:02:40.530> a<00:02:40.650> whole<00:02:40.830> lot<00:02:41.100> more<00:02:41.220> fun<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.730> exciting

exercises<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.260> course<00:02:49.560> were<00:02:49.800> just

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
exercises in that course were just

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.920 
exercises in that course were just
mind-numbing<00:02:50.910> ly<00:02:51.150> repetitive<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:51.960> tedious

them and at some point something clicked
and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.700> said<00:03:23.850> wow<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.239> know<00:03:24.330> this<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
and I said wow you know this this is the

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.070 
and I said wow you know this this is the
perfect<00:03:26.250> way<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.760> introduce<00:03:27.209> ear<00:03:27.780> training

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
perfect way to introduce ear training

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.320 
perfect way to introduce ear training
music<00:03:28.440> theory<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> there<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.030> lot<00:03:30.060> of

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
music theory and there are a lot of

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.910 
music theory and there are a lot of
reasons<00:03:30.720> but<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.050> biggest<00:03:31.410> one<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.739> that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
reasons but the biggest one is that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.160 
reasons but the biggest one is that
these<00:03:32.040> games<00:03:32.400> they<00:03:33.180> inject<00:03:33.510> an<00:03:33.630> element<00:03:34.080> of

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
these games they inject an element of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.759 
these games they inject an element of
fun<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.890> excitement<00:03:35.720> into<00:03:36.720> an<00:03:37.019> area<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.650> music

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
fun and excitement into an area of music

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.800 
fun and excitement into an area of music
practice<00:03:38.160> it's<00:03:38.550> absolutely<00:03:39.030> essential<00:03:39.300> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
practice it's absolutely essential and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.949 
practice it's absolutely essential and
yet<00:03:40.440> very<00:03:40.470> often<00:03:41.040> neglected<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:42.660> reason

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
yet very often neglected and the reason

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.509 
yet very often neglected and the reason
it's<00:03:43.110> neglected<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.650> because<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.070> perceived

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
it's neglected is because it's perceived

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.640 
it's neglected is because it's perceived
as<00:03:44.900> difficult<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:46.140> not<00:03:46.410> fun<00:03:48.050> so<00:03:49.050> together

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
as difficult and not fun so together

with my team we we got to work and we

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.920 
with my team we we got to work and we
built<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.610> system<00:03:54.000> that's<00:03:54.180> called<00:03:54.450> theta

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
of classroom plan which at the time we

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.020 
of classroom plan which at the time we
did<00:04:41.260> so<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:41.980> we<00:04:42.220> got<00:04:42.370> busy<00:04:42.610> and<00:04:42.700> we<00:04:42.790> made<00:04:43.000> one

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
did so we we got busy and we made one

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.200 
did so we we got busy and we made one
and<00:04:43.420> we<00:04:43.540> built<00:04:43.800> features<00:04:44.800> into<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.310> system<00:04:45.730> so

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
and we built features into the system so

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.490 
and we built features into the system so
that<00:04:46.240> teachers<00:04:46.720> could<00:04:46.900> create<00:04:47.140> game

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
that teachers could create game

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.530 
that teachers could create game
assignments<00:04:48.100> online<00:04:48.460> and<00:04:48.730> track<00:04:49.360> their

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
assignments online and track their

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.380 
assignments online and track their
students<00:04:49.960> progress<00:04:50.110> online<00:04:51.030> so<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.120> idea<00:04:52.330> is

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
students progress online so the idea is

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.850 
students progress online so the idea is
to<00:04:52.480> keep<00:04:52.600> everything<00:04:52.930> on<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.230> web<00:04:53.500> so<00:04:53.800> you

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
to keep everything on the web so you

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.280 
to keep everything on the web so you
have<00:04:53.980> no<00:04:54.160> need<00:04:54.310> for<00:04:54.540> paper-based<00:04:55.540> assignments

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
have no need for paper-based assignments

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.320 
have no need for paper-based assignments
and<00:04:56.500> and<00:04:56.860> no<00:04:57.130> need<00:04:57.370> for<00:04:57.700> installing<00:04:58.210> any

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
and and no need for installing any

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.490 
and and no need for installing any
software<00:04:59.670> and<00:05:00.670> so<00:05:00.850> far<00:05:01.060> we<00:05:01.180> built<00:05:01.390> 25<00:05:01.840> of<00:05:02.350> these

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500
