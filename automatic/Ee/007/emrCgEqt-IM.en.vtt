00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:03.989
 the beach of Oostende later in the evening 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.910
 good afternoon young 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.490
 Monday good afternoon purchased Italian for adults aged five and six thousand 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.799
 is really just after this fall 3 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.109
 the france started the swamps and of course that the 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.939
 goal line technology that happened again after the game via twitter account 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.179
 I wondered about a throw too soon 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:27.899
 but I do have the impression that the Netherlands is a bit overrun with a hernia I have 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.849
 I honestly did not see it all because it was the first reaction because I had to 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.100
 world-scale flying I also went to the police station two hours later 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.600
 its when i got what do you do when you think along with a house 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 ok that's the best result 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.140
 years earlier that is true that we currently have never been on the 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.140
 driveway after the tires between the two countries the closure applies again within 24 hours 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.930
 a competition in my hands and something easier I thought myself 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.520
 other purposes so practice about it 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.930
 those signature geriatricians when I have the button and focus on it I had to 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.650
 travel plieger after a hotel by the middle pins according to the law whereby 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.670
 the door to prepare for the door the next duel france 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.040
 However, those who give him the trip themselves decide that they may be safe as quickly as possible 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.380
 by customers so that just should never know that they do this again 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.250
 most important tips about the target line technology 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.210
 now being applied to this wk in itself 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.840
 it was clear because they also helped me with this goal after which the discussion was over 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 goalkeeper looking over the entire line by hand 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.320
 Do you want to say the first part of the goal line technology applies to me 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.119
 namely that it was not a goal when the hunter was seated at the position of the seat 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.759
 that animation it was third further started and then it became clear that there 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.880
 indeed a goal was what had happened that you know you too 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.079
 comment provides them at that time let the point difference between you 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.729
 as a viewer in the netherlands and as commentator of the batu news hour 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.729
 boxtel the children there are a few colleagues the huge big screens and 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.899
 there with those the line with the expectation that moment some concrete step on 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.100
 your screen is the entire stadium that you do of all respondents it seems 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.370
 concrete evidence or not 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.390
 players the audience I am also myself because I do look at that big one 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.149
 screen I don't look at a nice club 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.980
 actually so come logical 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.700
 apparently not spared on those big screens with a part of that letter 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.390
 from that moment and now also on screen and then the screens went out 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 So I said yes that what is there for the youth is precisely designed to make it a whole lot better 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.750
 To make crimes and hope for totally cool is the fact that there is also one 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.999
 overjoyed del bosque 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:25.929
 With the assumptions that I took I did not know in the meantime Union 

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:30.499
 as a viewer both on pile ball on the pole also fell back then already won from 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:31.469
 the bogeyman 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.299
 Kolvenbag on my team once in the stadium at that time and not seen yet 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.600
 not too d i just go to the game 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.060
 called and the belgian colleague of the us we both panic on the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.210
 parish france but it runs all over belgium is angry with me 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.980
 He did not receive a cent grant for you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.759
 that is something different than after that consumer 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.639
 while you think i have a nice trip for me of course you can do it 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.520
 commenting is a combination of 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.300
 monitor and even on your TV moment that you have the same subscription to the monitor 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.600
 I kind of wondered about the situation but then it was like that 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.650
 Clearly everyone nice Schermbeck players looked at the screen in it 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.900
 stadium music i hope the screen and i look at the response for you too 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.969
 a comment from that 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.699
 this factory and then had an angry young were the regular what is that 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:17.050
 well or not the goat farm yes yes but that gave goals 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.160
 it made perfect sense that at that moment I enjoy focusing on your easy 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.270
 hear those tourists traveling to the big screen looking at money 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.220
 have sparta responses and I have that moment that you have seen 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.290
 deeper in there will be the beautiful spring and then the new ones 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.819
 referees 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.969
 karoubi mohammed below if the politicians this is a beautiful city 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:39.039
 gets 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:42.539
 yes but i just said that this is it does appeal to a new pitch because of this 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:45.579
 a cockatoo even though a bit of pitty medium tires frustrated people 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.319
 also once could express an opinion that could not be good on twitter 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.589
 they didn't play any stamp, it is true that you 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:54.999
 inner fantastic image got very nice sharp every song has done with 

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.529
 the mega screen a relatively easy to judge others when I was there 

00:03:58.529 --> 00:04:01.669
 then they would be him for it makes more sense if they 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.869
 just in Hilversum in need is to sit very nice big screen 

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.199
 exactly what is the added value that you sit there 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.789
 7 that brought the cursor along and painful times impressive remark is made 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:12.829
 about the theme 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.769
 of course you always consider whether you should go there 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.479
 April 30 together we are absolutely always in favor of ter 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.930
 definite settlements 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.699
 are you on the place of the perpetrator you should actually be that goes for 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.370
 It's actually already decided it's always easy to jump from 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.460
 scheveningen eyes interchangeable devices but you actually hear almost 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.169
 win every match 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.389
 target audience 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.580
 I was there in that period last year but then for the first time in my life 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.490
 and the goes next 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.199
 spain against 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:40.400
 chili that seems like a really nice game to the netherlands australia and 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.840
 I have an awful lot in it when it comes to goal line technology 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.960
 sit watching jaime alguersuari at the end of last year to the light i look at 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.599
 My millions do not be afraid 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:51.789
 when they have an intermediate and that's it 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.469
 Agents drove right now I really have a penalty here Algeria 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:59.139
 is incredible failure to hope that all good kotaro thank you 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.400
 all kinds of success to the neighborhood 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.539
 overlooked 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:02.779
 So
