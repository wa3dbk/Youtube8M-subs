hi<00:00:04.670> I'm<00:00:04.970> going<00:00:05.180> to<00:00:05.240> show<00:00:05.390> you<00:00:05.450> how<00:00:05.660> to<00:00:05.689> change

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:05.990 
hi I'm going to show you how to change

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.210 
hi I'm going to show you how to change
the<00:00:06.200> response<00:00:06.649> on<00:00:07.370> this<00:00:07.580> AMT<00:00:08.090> volume<00:00:08.510> pedal

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:09.220 
the response on this AMT volume pedal

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.829 
the response on this AMT volume pedal
it's<00:00:10.220> a<00:00:10.309> really<00:00:10.580> cool<00:00:10.760> little<00:00:11.300> volume<00:00:11.510> pedal

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
it's a really cool little volume pedal

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.770 
it's a really cool little volume pedal
ah<00:00:12.110> but<00:00:12.919> it<00:00:13.009> doesn't<00:00:13.309> have<00:00:13.459> much<00:00:13.610> travel<00:00:14.089> and<00:00:14.240> a

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
ah but it doesn't have much travel and a

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.870 
ah but it doesn't have much travel and a
lot<00:00:14.959> of<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.169> travel<00:00:15.530> is<00:00:15.650> dead<00:00:15.860> space<00:00:16.039> at<00:00:16.700> the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
lot of the travel is dead space at the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.730 
lot of the travel is dead space at the
back<00:00:17.030> end<00:00:17.330> the<00:00:17.480> silent<00:00:17.990> part<00:00:18.289> and<00:00:18.590> at<00:00:18.650> the

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
back end the silent part and at the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.530 
back end the silent part and at the
front<00:00:18.950> and<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:19.280> full<00:00:19.430> volume<00:00:19.820> part<00:00:20.060> the

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:20.540 
front and the full volume part the

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.800 
front and the full volume part the
volume<00:00:20.810> doesn't<00:00:20.960> change<00:00:21.140> very<00:00:21.590> much<00:00:22.810> let's

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
volume doesn't change very much let's

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.450 
volume doesn't change very much let's
take<00:00:24.020> the<00:00:24.110> bottom<00:00:24.230> off<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:24.800> I'll<00:00:25.160> show<00:00:25.400> you

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
take the bottom off and I'll show you

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.849 
take the bottom off and I'll show you
how<00:00:25.640> it<00:00:25.730> works<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.270> how<00:00:26.360> we<00:00:26.450> can<00:00:26.600> fix<00:00:26.900> this

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.380 

it's<00:00:34.859> an<00:00:35.010> optical<00:00:35.160> volume<00:00:35.760> pedal<00:00:35.940> there's<00:00:36.300> an

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it's an optical volume pedal there's an

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.779 
it's an optical volume pedal there's an
LED<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.410> photo<00:00:37.620> detector<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.430> between

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:38.789 
LED and a photo detector and between

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.910 
LED and a photo detector and between
them<00:00:39.120> there's<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.690> shutter<00:00:39.930> which<00:00:40.260> moves

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
them there's a shutter which moves

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.290 
them there's a shutter which moves
backwards<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.430> forwards<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> motion

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
backwards and forwards with the motion

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
backwards and forwards with the motion
of<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> pedal<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.199> you<00:00:43.289> rock<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.620> pedal<00:00:43.890> you

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
of the pedal if you rock the pedal you

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
of the pedal if you rock the pedal you
can<00:00:44.039> see<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.370> moving<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:45.420> cutout<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.109> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
can see it moving the cutout in the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.590 
can see it moving the cutout in the
shutter<00:00:46.579> determines<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.820> response<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.479> the

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
shutter determines the response of the

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
shutter determines the response of the
pedal<00:00:50.239> undo<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.329> four<00:00:51.479> screws<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:51.930> top<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
pedal undo the four screws on top and

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.289 
pedal undo the four screws on top and
take<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> top<00:00:53.399> part<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> pedal<00:00:54.120> you

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:54.299 
take off the top part of the pedal you

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:57.969 
take off the top part of the pedal you
can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.229> the<00:00:55.409> underlying<00:00:56.159> rocking<00:00:56.640> mechanism

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
can see the underlying rocking mechanism

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.319 
can see the underlying rocking mechanism
if<00:00:58.979> you<00:00:59.100> look<00:00:59.339> underneath<00:00:59.640> there<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.119> see<00:01:00.299> a

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
if you look underneath there you see a

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.969 
if you look underneath there you see a
curved<00:01:00.600> piece<00:01:00.839> of<00:01:00.960> metal<00:01:01.199> sticking<00:01:01.379> down<00:01:01.710> into

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
curved piece of metal sticking down into

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.160 
curved piece of metal sticking down into
the<00:01:02.100> body<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> pedal<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.629> actually

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the body of the pedal that actually

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.529 
the body of the pedal that actually
moves<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> shutter<00:01:05.039> that<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.759> saw<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
moves the shutter that we saw on the

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.219 
moves the shutter that we saw on the
previous<00:01:06.720> clip<00:01:07.940> undo<00:01:08.940> the<00:01:09.060> hex<00:01:09.240> bolt<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.780> take

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
previous clip undo the hex bolt and take

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.180 
previous clip undo the hex bolt and take
off<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.619> rocker<00:01:10.800> on<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.039> top<00:01:12.800> don't<00:01:13.800> lose<00:01:14.039> the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
off the rocker on the top don't lose the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.010 
off the rocker on the top don't lose the
two<00:01:14.340> washers<00:01:14.580> let's<00:01:15.509> look<00:01:15.659> at<00:01:15.750> what<00:01:15.869> we've<00:01:15.990> got

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
two washers let's look at what we've got

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.330 
two washers let's look at what we've got
to<00:01:16.229> do<00:01:16.319> to<00:01:16.440> change<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.740> response<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.250> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to do to change the response of this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
to do to change the response of this
pedal<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.940> see<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.300> teardrop<00:01:18.600> cutout<00:01:19.259> in

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
pedal you see that teardrop cutout in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
pedal you see that teardrop cutout in
the<00:01:20.130> shutter<00:01:20.369> okay<00:01:21.360> that's<00:01:21.569> what<00:01:21.780> we<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:21.990> to

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the shutter okay that's what we have to

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.380 
the shutter okay that's what we have to
change<00:01:22.319> the<00:01:22.470> shape<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:22.890> at<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> moment<00:01:24.330> he

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
change the shape of at the moment he

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.240 
change the shape of at the moment he
uses<00:01:24.690> only<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.960> small<00:01:25.259> part<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> travel<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
uses only a small part of the travel and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.240 
uses only a small part of the travel and
there's<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.090> little<00:01:27.569> change

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
there's very very little change

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.529 
there's very very little change
particularly<00:01:29.250> at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> top<00:01:29.549> end<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.450> very

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
particularly at the top end it's very

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.260 
particularly at the top end it's very
wide<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.560> quickly<00:01:34.670> close<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.819> it<00:01:36.000> looks<00:01:36.180> like

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
wide very quickly close up it looks like

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.219 
wide very quickly close up it looks like
this<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:38.030> use<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.149> multi-tool<00:01:39.539> to<00:01:39.719> open<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
this I use the multi-tool to open up the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.109 
this I use the multi-tool to open up the
teardrop<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> shutter<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.820> could<00:01:41.969> also

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
teardrop in that shutter you could also

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.130 
teardrop in that shutter you could also
use<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> needle<00:01:42.689> file<00:01:44.479> here<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.659> opened<00:01:45.810> out

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
use a needle file here I've opened out

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289 
use a needle file here I've opened out
the<00:01:46.289> bottom<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> teardrop<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.119> use

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
the bottom of the teardrop just to use

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
the bottom of the teardrop just to use
more<00:01:48.509> travel<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.109> pedal<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:50.159> actual

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
more travel on the pedal the actual

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.770 
more travel on the pedal the actual
shape<00:01:50.729> doesn't<00:01:50.969> matter<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.420> stage

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
shape doesn't matter at this stage

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
shape doesn't matter at this stage
because<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.289> next<00:01:52.619> step<00:01:52.710> will<00:01:53.340> actually

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
because the next step will actually

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.380 
because the next step will actually
determine<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.119> response<00:01:54.299> curve<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:56.210> now<00:01:57.210> need

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
determine the response curve I now need

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.090 
determine the response curve I now need
a<00:01:57.450> small<00:01:57.780> piece<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.020> clear<00:01:58.350> plastic<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.039> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
a small piece of clear plastic to make a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
a small piece of clear plastic to make a
window<00:01:59.520> this<00:01:59.880> is<00:01:59.939> what<00:02:00.210> I'm<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.539> use<00:02:00.780> but

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
window this is what I'm going to use but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
window this is what I'm going to use but
anything<00:02:01.619> will<00:02:01.770> do<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.789> I<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:02.880> need<00:02:03.179> to

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
anything will do so I just need to

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.240 
anything will do so I just need to
superglue<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:04.049> window<00:02:04.409> over<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.859> opening

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
superglue that window over the opening

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
superglue that window over the opening
that<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.429> made<00:02:05.670> bigger<00:02:05.880> earlier<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.780> here's

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
that I made bigger earlier and here's

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.229 
that I made bigger earlier and here's
the<00:02:07.079> window<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:07.770> stuck<00:02:08.009> down<00:02:08.250> I've

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
the window that I've stuck down I've

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.099 
the window that I've stuck down I've
tried<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.539> make<00:02:09.690> sure<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> nothing

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:10.109 
tried to make sure that nothing

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.470 
tried to make sure that nothing
overhangs<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.880> it'll<00:02:12.090> get<00:02:12.209> in<00:02:12.299> the<00:02:12.390> way

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
overhangs because it'll get in the way

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.610 
overhangs because it'll get in the way
of<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.660> mechanism<00:02:14.120> okay<00:02:15.120> so<00:02:16.049> now<00:02:16.260> what<00:02:16.470> we're

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
of the mechanism okay so now what we're

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.380 
of the mechanism okay so now what we're
going<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:16.799> do<00:02:16.950> is<00:02:17.190> we're<00:02:17.340> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.489> paint<00:02:17.880> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
going to do is we're going to paint the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.020 
going to do is we're going to paint the
shape<00:02:18.720> of<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.049> new<00:02:19.290> response<00:02:19.799> that<00:02:20.640> we<00:02:20.790> want

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
shape of the new response that we want

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.420 
shape of the new response that we want
onto<00:02:21.359> this<00:02:21.690> clear<00:02:21.900> plastic<00:02:22.109> window<00:02:22.620> we're

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
onto this clear plastic window we're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.340 
onto this clear plastic window we're
going<00:02:23.579> to<00:02:23.640> use<00:02:23.760> very<00:02:23.850> opaque<00:02:24.570> black<00:02:24.959> paint

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
going to use very opaque black paint

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.199 
going to use very opaque black paint
because<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.489> an<00:02:26.579> optical<00:02:26.820> petal

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
because this is an optical petal

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.699 
because this is an optical petal
blocking<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.810> light<00:02:28.019> is<00:02:28.230> what<00:02:28.410> makes<00:02:28.620> the

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
blocking the light is what makes the

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.680 
blocking the light is what makes the
volume<00:02:28.980> pedal<00:02:29.130> work<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.420> we're<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.600> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
volume pedal work so we're going to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.390 
volume pedal work so we're going to
paint<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.019> window<00:02:31.560> I'm<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.069> paint<00:02:32.280> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
paint that window I'm gonna paint a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.759 
paint that window I'm gonna paint a
smooth<00:02:32.640> curve<00:02:32.910> using<00:02:33.810> as<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.049> say<00:02:34.290> some<00:02:34.560> very

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
smooth curve using as I say some very

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.740 
smooth curve using as I say some very
thick<00:02:35.100> opaque<00:02:35.340> black<00:02:35.940> paint<00:02:36.269> I'm<00:02:36.510> using

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
thick opaque black paint I'm using

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.460 
thick opaque black paint I'm using
modeling<00:02:37.319> enamel

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
modeling enamel

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.809 
modeling enamel
here's<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.590> response<00:02:40.800> that<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.130> painted<00:02:41.490> quite

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
here's the response that I painted quite

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
here's the response that I painted quite
a<00:02:41.850> linear<00:02:42.210> response<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.560> hold<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.800> up<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
a linear response you can hold it up to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.110 
a linear response you can hold it up to
the<00:02:44.010> window<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.400> see<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.819> paint<00:02:45.030> is

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
the window to see that the paint is

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.030 
the window to see that the paint is
really<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.450> peg<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:45.990> this<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:46.500> why<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.770> can't

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
really a peg and this is why you can't

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.280 
really a peg and this is why you can't
use<00:02:47.220> something<00:02:47.520> like<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.700> Sharpie<00:02:48.240> because<00:02:49.200> if

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
use something like a Sharpie because if

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.540 
use something like a Sharpie because if
you<00:02:49.380> hold<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.680> up<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.950> light<00:02:50.130> actually<00:02:50.340> you

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
you hold it up to the light actually you

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.480 
you hold it up to the light actually you
can<00:02:50.700> still<00:02:50.910> see<00:02:51.090> through<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:52.370> here's<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
can still see through it here's the

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.580 
can still see through it here's the
response<00:02:53.760> curve<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.420> painted<00:02:57.410> after<00:02:58.410> I

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
response curve that I painted after I

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.690 
response curve that I painted after I
tried<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.010> at<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.220> gig

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
tried it at a gig

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.490 
tried it at a gig
I<00:02:59.730> changed<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.570> response<00:03:00.959> curve<00:03:01.200> slightly

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
I changed the response curve slightly

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.100 
I changed the response curve slightly
this<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.220> second<00:03:02.580> attempt<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.900> more

then you can test the response of your

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.250 
then you can test the response of your
pedal<00:03:19.380> with<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.370> changes<00:03:20.760> that<00:03:20.910> you've<00:03:21.030> made

like also it's up to you whether you

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.500 
like also it's up to you whether you
want<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:29.130> pedal<00:03:29.280> to<00:03:29.430> be<00:03:29.640> silent<00:03:30.120> when<00:03:30.330> it's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
want the pedal to be silent when it's

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.630 
want the pedal to be silent when it's
right<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:30.900> or<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.709> you<00:03:31.860> want<00:03:32.100> a<00:03:32.220> some<00:03:32.430> sort<00:03:32.610> of

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640

right back or if you want a some sort of
minimum<00:03:32.970> volume<00:03:33.330> level<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:34.560> can<00:03:34.709> play<00:03:34.890> with

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
minimum volume level you can play with

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.410 
minimum volume level you can play with
different<00:03:35.130> profiles<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> just<00:03:36.090> depends<00:03:36.390> how

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
different profiles it just depends how

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.860 
different profiles it just depends how
far<00:03:36.840> back<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.080> you<00:03:38.070> extend<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.550> window<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
far back you you extend the window and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.040 
far back you you extend the window and
the<00:03:40.100> unpainted<00:03:41.100> area<00:03:41.690> so<00:03:42.690> you've<00:03:42.870> got

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
the unpainted area so you've got

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.199
