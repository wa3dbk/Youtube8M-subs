00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.220
 Question I hope you do not offend 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.170
 I would like you to end up with a myth 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.119
 you are world where you played against 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.869
 england and you were playing in 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.310
 england in that to the ball outside to 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.789
 purpose because I had to go back to 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.789
 England 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.259
 the end and politics 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.950
 it's not right to the ball outside to 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.260
 purpose because I had to go back to 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.020
 england that's what you think a lot 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.850
 people 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.570
 they are not right the circulation on purpose 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.560
 outside 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.050
 but nicolás lúcar I tell you I know him 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.310
 is being ironic at that point too 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.870
 he is not right 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.430
 but because when I have to finish 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.340
 with no stupid myth is not a myth 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.090
 good 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.860
 I can not think assured that there 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.830
 that's a question, it's like that because what 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.150
 I started I say to see many people believe 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.400
 that that party is not a thing there was 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.530
 many people because people here do not 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.340
 was you asking me good voice yo 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.340
 he moved you things from which nothing because 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.690
 it was really the guts for 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.920
 ask me look I think this but 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.510
 you would say to people I personally believe 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.250
 that you did not play in this game as 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.610
 you should have played for what it is 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.030
 assured I do not think you did not play in this 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.200
 party like you should have played 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.390
 microphone to see if they say something that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.070
 deserves a polemic one speaks very badly 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.200
 of journalism 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.909
 yellow journalism I think not 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.280
 have played not young or young additional 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.900
 and good already established is something that can 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.520
 pass can happen in soccer 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.710
 Maradona did not have bad games for 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.930
 supposed and criminal savings and good and 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.479

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.910
 [Music] 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:51.760

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.760
 receiving blows ten years later says 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 the mouth so that the jackal what is 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.110

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.080
 for possible england a hundred times 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.800
 more as a soccer player if he won a
