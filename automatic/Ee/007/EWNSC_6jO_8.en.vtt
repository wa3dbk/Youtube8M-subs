instead you're gonna do my dream MMO
where<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> talk<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.340> would<00:00:14.460> be<00:00:14.490> in<00:00:14.849> my

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
where I talk about what would be in my

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.390 
where I talk about what would be in my
dream<00:00:15.450> MMO<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.170> remember<00:00:16.590> it's<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.160> dream

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
dream MMO and remember it's just a dream

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.340 
dream MMO and remember it's just a dream
so<00:00:17.760> don't<00:00:17.940> pass<00:00:18.359> out<00:00:18.690> like<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.050> many<00:00:19.140> people

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
so don't pass out like so many people

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.900 
so don't pass out like so many people
have<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> tendency<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:20.160> do<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.699> been<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
have the tendency to do it's been a

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.460 
have the tendency to do it's been a
while<00:00:21.240> since<00:00:21.539> I've<00:00:21.689> done<00:00:21.810> one<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.109> but

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
while since I've done one of these but

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.529 
while since I've done one of these but
so<00:00:22.650> far<00:00:22.859> we've<00:00:23.070> talked<00:00:23.279> about<00:00:23.369> races<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.240> game

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
so far we've talked about races and game

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300 
so far we've talked about races and game
and<00:00:24.779> progression<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:25.619> now<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.099> good

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
and progression so I think now is a good

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.490 
and progression so I think now is a good
time<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.580> talk<00:00:26.820> about<00:00:26.849> combat<00:00:27.630> yes<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.289> bread

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
time to talk about combat yes the bread

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
time to talk about combat yes the bread
and<00:00:28.650> butter<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> pretty<00:00:29.250> much<00:00:29.310> any<00:00:29.609> MMO<00:00:29.910> as

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
and butter of pretty much any MMO as

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.880 
and butter of pretty much any MMO as
long<00:00:30.779> as<00:00:30.960> your<00:00:31.109> bread<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.380> butter<00:00:31.500> kicks

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
long as your bread and butter kicks

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
long as your bread and butter kicks
major<00:00:32.189> ass<00:00:32.430> now<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.450> would<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:33.690> with<00:00:33.960> how

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
major ass now you would think with how

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.900 
major ass now you would think with how
complicated<00:00:34.530> some<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.040> my<00:00:35.130> other<00:00:35.340> ideas<00:00:35.760> have

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
complicated some of my other ideas have

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
complicated some of my other ideas have
been<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.750> might<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> bit<00:00:37.350> weird

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
been that this one might get a bit weird

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.560 
been that this one might get a bit weird
but<00:00:38.129> actually<00:00:38.579> this<00:00:38.760> one's<00:00:38.969> pretty<00:00:39.329> simple

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
but actually this one's pretty simple

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
but actually this one's pretty simple
I've<00:00:39.989> always<00:00:40.230> been<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> fan<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.070> combat

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I've always been a fan of the combat

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520 
I've always been a fan of the combat
systems<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.149> dark<00:00:42.450> souls<00:00:42.780> games<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
systems in the dark souls games and the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
systems in the dark souls games and the
Batman<00:00:43.980> games<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.760> most<00:00:44.969> recently<00:00:45.329> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Batman games but most recently and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.569 
Batman games but most recently and
probably<00:00:46.079> most<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> all<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.829> have<00:00:47.160> enjoyed<00:00:47.430> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
probably most of all I have enjoyed the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.940 
probably most of all I have enjoyed the
combat<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.090> shadows<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.809> Mordor<00:00:49.200> honestly

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
combat of shadows of Mordor honestly

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.069 
combat of shadows of Mordor honestly
it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> game<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> come<00:00:50.760> back<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.210> specifically

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it's a game I come back to specifically

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
it's a game I come back to specifically
for<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.500> combat<00:00:52.890> basically<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> developer

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
for the combat basically if a developer

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
for the combat basically if a developer
could<00:00:54.449> get<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.780> type<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> combat<00:00:55.530> into<00:00:55.890> an

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
could get this type of combat into an

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
could get this type of combat into an
MMO<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.610> would<00:00:56.969> suck<00:00:57.180> their<00:00:57.329> metaphorical<00:00:57.840> with

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
MMO I would suck their metaphorical with

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.779 
MMO I would suck their metaphorical with
my<00:00:58.500> desire<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.920> have<00:00:59.010> brand-new<00:00:59.489> players

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
my desire to have brand-new players

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310 
my desire to have brand-new players
coming<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> game<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.600> immediately<00:01:01.170> be

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
coming to the game and immediately be

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.380 
coming to the game and immediately be
useful<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.829> higher<00:01:02.100> level<00:01:02.399> players<00:01:02.520> thereby

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
useful to higher level players thereby

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
useful to higher level players thereby
doing<00:01:03.660> away<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.019> level<00:01:04.470> barriers<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:05.250> type

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
doing away with level barriers this type

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.740 
doing away with level barriers this type
of<00:01:05.640> combat<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.150> one<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> ways<00:01:06.570> to

involves a level of skill you could be

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
involves a level of skill you could be
an<00:01:11.159> extremely<00:01:11.520> seasoned<00:01:12.270> player<00:01:12.570> but<00:01:12.900> not

an extremely seasoned player but not

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.510 
an extremely seasoned player but not
understand<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> combat<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.130> well<00:01:14.280> as<00:01:14.369> someone

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
understand the combat as well as someone

new<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.030> get<00:01:15.540> your<00:01:15.689> ass<00:01:15.900> kicked

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
new and get your ass kicked

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.260 
new and get your ass kicked
now<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> people<00:01:17.580> would<00:01:17.759> say<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
now a lot of people would say that this

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.850 
now a lot of people would say that this
might<00:01:18.450> be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.630> bit<00:01:18.960> easy<00:01:19.229> due<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> lot<00:01:19.830> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
might be a bit easy due to a lot of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.800 
might be a bit easy due to a lot of
people<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.159> spamming<00:01:20.670> parry<00:01:21.210> all<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.630> time

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
people just spamming parry all the time

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
people just spamming parry all the time
but<00:01:22.259> my<00:01:22.380> combat<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.830> also<00:01:22.979> involve

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
but my combat would also involve

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.280 
but my combat would also involve
fireballs<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> magic<00:01:24.330> skills<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:24.810> can't

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
fireballs and magic skills which can't

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.109 
fireballs and magic skills which can't
really<00:01:25.560> be<00:01:25.680> parried<00:01:26.070> also<00:01:26.549> having<00:01:26.850> skills

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
really be parried also having skills

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
really be parried also having skills
that<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> stun<00:01:27.810> people<00:01:28.170> who<00:01:28.290> are<00:01:28.380> trying<00:01:28.710> to

that can stun people who are trying to

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
that can stun people who are trying to
parry<00:01:29.100> helps<00:01:29.579> add<00:01:29.729> an<00:01:29.939> additional<00:01:30.299> layer

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
parry helps add an additional layer

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
one-on-one battles but even then I'd

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.240 
one-on-one battles but even then I'd
like<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.350> think<00:02:03.530> a<00:02:03.590> skilled<00:02:03.860> enough<00:02:04.010> player

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
like to think a skilled enough player

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.980 
like to think a skilled enough player
should<00:02:04.550> be<00:02:04.700> able<00:02:04.820> to<00:02:04.970> take<00:02:05.119> down<00:02:05.180> two<00:02:05.630> or<00:02:05.659> three

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
should be able to take down two or three

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.020 
should be able to take down two or three
lesser<00:02:06.259> players<00:02:06.500> now<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.280> PvP<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> would

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
lesser players now for PvP I would

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.370 
lesser players now for PvP I would
likely<00:02:08.240> have<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.600> do<00:02:08.720> away<00:02:08.869> with<00:02:09.020> cool

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
likely have to do away with cool

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.410 
likely have to do away with cool
finisher<00:02:09.890> moves<00:02:10.100> but<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.700> can<00:02:11.150> make<00:02:11.270> them<00:02:11.360> work

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
finisher moves but I can make them work

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.820 
finisher moves but I can make them work
in<00:02:11.630> some<00:02:11.780> other<00:02:11.840> way<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.319> would<00:02:12.440> really<00:02:12.620> need

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
in some other way it would really need

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.650 
in some other way it would really need
some<00:02:13.010> balancing<00:02:13.550> and<00:02:13.730> testing<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.180> course<00:02:14.420> but

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
some balancing and testing of course but

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.809 
some balancing and testing of course but
I<00:02:14.840> think<00:02:15.500> it<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.650> work<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.400> also<00:02:16.550> another

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
I think it can work this is also another

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.340 
I think it can work this is also another
way<00:02:17.030> for<00:02:17.090> defensive<00:02:17.660> skills<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.110> come<00:02:18.200> into

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
way for defensive skills to come into

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.930 
way for defensive skills to come into
play<00:02:18.560> the<00:02:18.920> higher<00:02:19.100> level<00:02:19.400> you<00:02:19.430> have<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.880> a

play the higher level you have in a

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.430 
play the higher level you have in a
certain<00:02:20.090> defense<00:02:20.569> skill<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.080> better<00:02:21.290> you

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
certain defense skill the better you

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.630 
certain defense skill the better you
could<00:02:21.530> be<00:02:21.680> at<00:02:21.770> defending<00:02:22.190> against<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.489> certain

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
could be at defending against a certain

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.550 
could be at defending against a certain
kind<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.030> attacks<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.720> don't<00:02:23.989> know<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.319> would

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
kind of attacks I don't know I would

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.229 
kind of attacks I don't know I would
also<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.950> stealth<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.580> work<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.970> same<00:02:26.180> way

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
also like stealth to work the same way

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.640 
also like stealth to work the same way
it<00:02:26.540> kind<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.780> does<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:26.959> shadows<00:02:27.320> of<00:02:27.410> Mordor

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
it kind of does the shadows of Mordor

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.290 
it kind of does the shadows of Mordor
simply<00:02:28.190> turning<00:02:28.459> invisible<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.030> kind<00:02:29.239> of

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
simply turning invisible is kind of

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.940 
simply turning invisible is kind of
silly<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.900> should<00:02:30.050> probably<00:02:30.260> just<00:02:30.560> become<00:02:30.920> a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
silly you should probably just become a

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.890 
silly you should probably just become a
bit<00:02:31.160> opaque<00:02:31.730> or<00:02:31.970> something<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:32.570> if<00:02:32.810> you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
bit opaque or something and if you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.720 
bit opaque or something and if you

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
should go into high grass or bushes then

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.040 
should go into high grass or bushes then
you<00:02:34.880> should<00:02:35.060> get<00:02:35.180> some<00:02:35.300> extra<00:02:35.570> invisibility

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
you should get some extra invisibility

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.259 
you should get some extra invisibility
frankly<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:36.950> think<00:02:37.040> this<00:02:37.340> is<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.610> most<00:02:37.760> fun<00:02:38.090> and

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
frankly I think this is the most fun and

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.240 
frankly I think this is the most fun and
most<00:02:38.480> engaging<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.290> most<00:02:39.470> skilled<00:02:39.769> combat
