00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
and to transform them just take these

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:35.360 
and to transform them just take these
panels<00:01:24.869> off<00:01:25.049> off<00:01:28.430> just<00:01:29.430> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:30.530> separate

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
and they're too tight joint I'll just go

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.490 
and they're too tight joint I'll just go
ahead<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:45.540> take<00:01:46.540> the<00:01:46.720> toes<00:01:46.930> out<00:01:48.330> and<00:01:49.500> then

separate<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.960> arms<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:59.700> rotate<00:02:01.080> these

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
separate the arms and then rotate these

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.419

wheels in unpick this piece and that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.290 
wheels in unpick this piece and that
allows<00:02:19.960> me<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> rotate<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.430> whole<00:02:21.610> hip

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.220 
allows me to rotate the whole hip
assembly<00:02:22.810> forward<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.270> can<00:02:28.480> separate<00:02:29.020> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
assembly forward and I can separate the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:40.080 
assembly forward and I can separate the
legs<00:02:30.959> rotate<00:02:31.959> them<00:02:32.410> 180<00:02:37.170> there<00:02:38.170> is<00:02:38.820> his<00:02:39.820> lower

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
legs rotate them 180 there is his lower

legs rotate them 180 there is his lower
half<00:02:40.390> transformed

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:56.080 

bring<00:02:47.570> this<00:02:48.260> down<00:02:53.200> take<00:02:54.200> these<00:02:54.380> backwards<00:02:55.090> and

bring this down take these backwards and

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.880 
bring this down take these backwards and
then<00:02:56.300> these<00:02:56.570> panels<00:02:57.490> can<00:02:58.490> just<00:02:58.790> fold<00:02:59.180> up

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.880 
way when you transform them into robot
mode<00:04:21.910> do<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.150> see<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> blue<00:04:22.600> legs<00:04:22.840> and<00:04:23.260> then

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
mode do you see the blue legs and then

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.520 
mode do you see the blue legs and then
the<00:04:24.040> inner<00:04:24.250> legs<00:04:24.970> are<00:04:25.240> red<00:04:25.660> for<00:04:26.050> truck<00:04:26.290> mode

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
the inner legs are red for truck mode

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:37.500 
the inner legs are red for truck mode
and<00:04:30.690> mostly<00:04:31.690> red<00:04:32.080> in<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.350> back<00:04:36.240> and<00:04:37.240> then

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
and mostly red in the back and then

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:48.570 
and mostly red in the back and then
silver<00:04:38.490> the<00:04:39.840> upper<00:04:40.840> arms<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.960> pretty<00:04:44.560> cool

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:55.869 

here<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:50.640> per<00:04:51.640> for

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.010 

and<00:04:57.580> since<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.699> solar<00:04:58.939> storm<00:04:59.330> grapple<00:04:59.809> has<00:04:59.990> a

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
and since the solar storm grapple has a

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.290 
and since the solar storm grapple has a
crane<00:05:01.539> I<00:05:03.219> thought<00:05:04.219> I<00:05:04.249> would<00:05:04.520> just<00:05:04.669> remove<00:05:05.059> that

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
crane I thought I would just remove that

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.079 
crane I thought I would just remove that
for<00:05:05.959> Optimus<00:05:06.439> Prime<00:05:06.740> since<00:05:07.550> he's<00:05:07.729> supposed<00:05:08.029> to

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:08.089 
for Optimus Prime since he's supposed to

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:13.540 
for Optimus Prime since he's supposed to
have<00:05:08.179> a<00:05:08.270> ladder<00:05:08.830> and<00:05:09.999> the<00:05:10.999> inferno<00:05:12.219> figure<00:05:13.219> has

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
have a ladder and the inferno figure has

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.959 
have a ladder and the inferno figure has
a<00:05:13.580> water<00:05:14.089> cannon<00:05:14.599> instead<00:05:14.869> and<00:05:15.409> so<00:05:16.279> I<00:05:16.309> thought

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:16.969 
a water cannon instead and so I thought

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:22.619 
a water cannon instead and so I thought
neither<00:05:17.209> would<00:05:17.719> do<00:05:17.929> me<00:05:18.080> good<00:05:18.319> for<00:05:19.159> his<00:05:19.490> pride

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:25.089 

so<00:05:23.629> I<00:05:23.659> just<00:05:23.929> thought<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.439> would<00:05:24.559> look<00:05:24.740> better

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099 
so I just thought it would look better

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:32.469 
so I just thought it would look better
if<00:05:25.610> I<00:05:25.789> just<00:05:25.819> remove<00:05:26.209> the<00:05:27.580> that<00:05:28.580> accessory<00:05:31.479> and

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
if I just remove the that accessory and

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.869 
if I just remove the that accessory and
since<00:05:33.080> it's<00:05:33.289> this<00:05:34.069> is<00:05:34.249> supposed<00:05:34.580> to<00:05:34.669> be<00:05:34.849> a

00:05:34.869 --> 00:05:34.879 
since it's this is supposed to be a

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:40.389 
since it's this is supposed to be a
classics<00:05:35.830> style<00:05:36.830> figure<00:05:38.469> here<00:05:39.469> he<00:05:39.679> is<00:05:39.860> with

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:40.399 
classics style figure here he is with

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.989 
classics style figure here he is with
the<00:05:40.819> classics<00:05:41.539> figure<00:05:42.490> so<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.519> much<00:05:43.789> bigger

00:05:45.989 --> 00:05:45.999 
the classics figure so a much bigger

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:54.429 
the classics figure so a much bigger
mold<00:05:47.050> altogether<00:05:48.159> be<00:05:49.159> for<00:05:49.399> two<00:05:52.599> and<00:05:53.599> since<00:05:54.289> I'm

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439 
mold altogether be for two and since I'm

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:59.679 
mold altogether be for two and since I'm

often must need to trim down until a

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.600

and someone commented in the forums of
his<00:06:26.330> beefiness<00:06:26.900> and<00:06:28.060> how<00:06:29.060> he<00:06:29.120> would<00:06:29.509> look

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
his beefiness and how he would look

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:34.959 
his beefiness and how he would look
great<00:06:30.759> as<00:06:31.759> maybe<00:06:32.120> a<00:06:32.270> bulkhead<00:06:32.719> custom<00:06:33.580> and<00:06:34.580> I

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
great as maybe a bulkhead custom and I

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.540 
great as maybe a bulkhead custom and I
can<00:06:35.150> see<00:06:35.360> that<00:06:35.979> there's<00:06:36.979> a<00:06:37.069> very<00:06:37.969> bulky<00:06:38.539> frame

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
can see that there's a very bulky frame

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.179 
can see that there's a very bulky frame
kind<00:06:40.550> of<00:06:40.669> squat<00:06:41.000> legs<00:06:41.590> it<00:06:42.590> can<00:06:42.770> definitely<00:06:42.889> be

00:06:43.179 --> 00:06:43.189 
kind of squat legs it can definitely be

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:49.809 
kind of squat legs it can definitely be
used<00:06:43.340> for<00:06:43.819> a<00:06:44.830> custom<00:06:46.090> bulkhead<00:06:47.090> even<00:06:47.449> has<00:06:48.819> back

00:06:49.809 --> 00:06:49.819 
used for a custom bulkhead even has back

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:54.760 
used for a custom bulkhead even has back
wing<00:06:50.240> it's<00:06:51.460> kind<00:06:52.460> of<00:06:52.520> like<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:53.300> wheels<00:06:53.770> just

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770 
wing it's kind of like the wheels just

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.480 
wing it's kind of like the wheels just
give<00:06:55.430> them<00:06:55.550> a<00:06:55.580> different<00:06:55.909> head<00:06:56.090> sculpt<00:06:57.340> and<00:06:58.340> I

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:58.490 
give them a different head sculpt and I

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.490 
give them a different head sculpt and I
think<00:06:58.699> that'll<00:06:58.969> work<00:06:59.000> I<00:06:59.479> don't<00:07:00.199> think<00:07:00.379> I'll<00:07:00.469> be

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:00.500 
think that'll work I don't think I'll be

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.640 
think that'll work I don't think I'll be
doing<00:07:00.830> that<00:07:00.919> custom<00:07:01.370> but<00:07:01.849> that<00:07:02.539> can<00:07:02.689> work<00:07:02.870> and

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:03.650 
doing that custom but that can work and

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:18.629 
doing that custom but that can work and
then<00:07:07.779> just<00:07:08.779> for<00:07:08.930> the<00:07:08.990> hell<00:07:09.199> of<00:07:09.229> it<00:07:12.550> Megatron
