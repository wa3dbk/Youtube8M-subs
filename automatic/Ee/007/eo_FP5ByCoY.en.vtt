holes<00:02:38.610> in<00:02:38.820> their<00:02:39.060> third<00:02:39.420> tweet<00:02:39.690> I<00:02:39.990> think

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
holes in their third tweet I think

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.600 
holes in their third tweet I think
whenever<00:02:40.590> they<00:02:40.770> come<00:02:40.950> up<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.160> a<00:02:41.220> new<00:02:41.370> lawyer

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
whenever they come up with a new lawyer

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.160 
whenever they come up with a new lawyer
joke<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.240> they<00:02:42.300> tweet<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
joke and they tweet about it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.660 
joke and they tweet about it
I<00:02:43.200> think<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.680> would<00:02:43.800> say<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.010> lot<00:02:44.220> about<00:02:44.430> that

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

I think that would say a lot about that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
the bottom I think if we just have a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.210 
the bottom I think if we just have a
constant<00:03:06.780> feed<00:03:06.990> of<00:03:07.140> lawyer<00:03:07.380> jokes<00:03:07.740> going<00:03:07.980> by

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
constant feed of lawyer jokes going by

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.990

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
that would be hilarious actually there's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.240 
that would be hilarious actually there's
one<00:03:12.030> more<00:03:12.240> page<00:03:13.250> we<00:03:14.250> could<00:03:14.430> do<00:03:14.520> a<00:03:14.550> video<00:03:16.250> you

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
