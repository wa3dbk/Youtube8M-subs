00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.320
 during the program we will see three participants competing to see if 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.929
 proceeds to the skills that attitude to study this junior and senior 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.449
 carcesa this profession 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.950
 will have to complete three challenges proposed by an extra 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.550
 has to assess its performance and in addition and is assigned a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.720
 rating winning or losing from one to three stars at the end of the challenges 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.490
 the participant who has the highest number of stars will be 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.490
 selected interested 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.580
 Hello, as you are, I know, I know that you are interested. 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.780
 Today we will see a profession that studies from a microorganism to being 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.990
 human his evolution and his past we are talking about biology if he wants to know a 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.160
 little more in this profession well let's see entity georges one of science 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.150
 that deals with the study of managers investigates their origins 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.530
 its structures its evolution and the function that 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.869
 in the environment is so big that you can contemplate arias like ecology 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.990
 cell biology solution botany mycology genetics 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.300
 among others because it deals with studying the organisms of its dimensions 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.840
 micron as the study of molecules up to teachers like 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.300
 inquire about complete communities of living beings a graduate in biology 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.860
 here a strong willingness to research and its field of action 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.540
 can be aimed at solving problems in productive sectors such as 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 agricultural the farmer the fishing the forest that will contribute and spread 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.840
 knowledge of biodiversity among other important activities already 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.189
 we know more about this profession now we have to know the participants 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.330
 on the right side of the lanes abc green color 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.950
 jiménez to ours 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 the open mind 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.180
 armenta knows 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.360
 In total there is a lot of blue colored wood 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.920
 that face the challenges the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 the ita carlo the greatest benefit out 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.910
 cold in this aspect the reds despite being like your competitor percent of 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.270
 wall street in the mood of doing things excited mentions the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.760
 need for more financing in addition to the difficult challenges to be met 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.239
 collect this data 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.940
 complicated but especially funny fun tortured for that 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.029
 we have a hand they know that there is a person who is not fed up and he is going to 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:31.939
 qualify 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.359
 on this occasion among the letters that this data is very well 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.210
 this contest already knows 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.130
 because the pri in her massú with five years working for channel 11 that 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.630
 program said together we have spent many adventures with him so we 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.929
 let's know more about 

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:47.379
 roberto red 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.470
 The best way to show the love of life is to know peace in all 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.530
 his expressions and what better than a biologist like roberto red for 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:58.420
 fall in love with the fascinating animal kingdom teve conductor in productions like 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.060
 they are logical in action and in search of said roberto keeps a strait 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.830
 link with them their line of study is the ecology of tarantulas 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.920
 which, by the way, are the only species of arachnids protected in 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.400
 our country stephenson frequent contributor in magazines and has 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640
 several scientific publications is also co-author of the book 

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:20.029
 today he is about to finish his master's degree in science and resources 

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:23.609
 On the other hand, the first part of the conference on the importance of 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.479
 poisonous species species very discriminate by humans but from 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.209
 great utility of our environment like this there are still many secrets that 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.779
 encloses nature would be interested discover them silver roberto 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:39.999
 Pujadas would now be interested in making use of steel 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.980
 very happy to be here with all of you 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.090
 and then well to the entity that tabaza the challenges haha ​​interesting debate 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.080
 fun and exciting and see what you think of hard test for you 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.369
 that what catches her the attention of the Cuban biology caresses her 

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:58.809
 a lot of attention the plants 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:02.159
 Expect it to be an area that gustavo chávez as a standard 

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:06.919
 because we can have a certainty of a little bit of everything from that 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:09.649
 we cover with respect to housing 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:14.079
 from the smallest to the largest atilio for example 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.940
 I really like the fact that I was very interested in the research 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.340
 it is to be expected 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.330
 molecular but I also like it a lot as he recognized 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.870
 the court for it 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.190
 and point 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.400
 halfway through this period 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.070
 that of the biology career 21 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.850
 awaits the outcome of navy 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.520
 among so many people 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.139
 These marine animals, which were the speakers at the conference, will include a 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.979
 hero of the one who 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.930
 that seeks to find something new art account of it 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.159
 from 3 in the morning 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.470
 many people do not realize 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.220
 I believe and I feel always felt that the speed is true but 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.150
 more than that it is a passion 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.110
 from then on, everything that comes to know learn gisela reto 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.539
 is going to be related to botany and good the challenge to consist 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:12.379
 enke is going to have to select 50 different leaves of obviously species 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.800
 different from a place 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.430
 Here what we are going to qualify is that this is a central 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.580
 how do you classify them and also a bit of the time when they are going to do it 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.389
 so it was this first challenge liters lucky to regain peace 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.290
 in the addams just start tripoli 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.589
 it was with bodies the time is running so now forward 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.189
 however there will be good luck to your challenger I think the civil complaint 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.930
 Since then he has been many times 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.830
 is that there is a passion 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.870
 argentina attitude and I think the first time estrada 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.960
 attitude 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.340
 10 and you also roberto thank you very much to kinect in the program really for 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.580
 be able to help and support the kids 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.900
 and then at 11 orient the tragically what is it that we want 

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:03.439
 the reserves of the south very happy and by surprise the boys banks are not going to 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:06.550
 be in doubt the week in the week and fish on Friday 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.340
 that we're going to see the others final grade because they avoid fractures 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.800
 proofs I am that one and this time that interested to present the lakes the 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.480
 day tomorrow 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.439
 do not miss the day tomorrow interested to introduce yourself 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:22.989
 this is something that we all expected the tezozómoc park the 

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:28.379
 sales strategy of 50 excellent Galician 27 fruit plants in the headquarters 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.159
 of the inces located on the axis of the majority 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.429
 the pgr exists a wide series of related indicators 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.689
 finish
