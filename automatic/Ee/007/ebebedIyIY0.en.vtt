in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.300> show<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> thought<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.079> be

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
in the show so I thought it would be

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.020 
in the show so I thought it would be
good<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.320> balance<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.039> load<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:03.000> I

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
good to balance the load with what I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.850 
good to balance the load with what I

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
I can taste it but it then becomes super

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.640 
I can taste it but it then becomes super
subdued<00:03:46.890> like<00:03:47.430> you're<00:03:47.579> getting<00:03:47.850> the<00:03:47.940> cinnamon

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
subdued like you're getting the cinnamon

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.650 
subdued like you're getting the cinnamon
but<00:03:49.650> not<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.070> heat<00:03:50.280> like<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:50.549> it's<00:03:51.329> not<00:03:51.450> heat

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
but not the heat like that it's not heat

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.849 
but not the heat like that it's not heat
is<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> like<00:03:52.049> the<00:03:52.170> spiciness<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.799> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
is it like the spiciness and the

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.740 
is it like the spiciness and the
cinnamon<00:03:53.160> spicy<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:54.030> apple<00:03:54.359> juice<00:03:54.480> really

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
cinnamon spicy the apple juice really

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.420 
cinnamon spicy the apple juice really
coats<00:03:55.140> your<00:03:55.260> tongue<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.709> kind<00:03:55.890> of<00:03:55.950> remember

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
coats your tongue and kind of remember

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.270 
coats your tongue and kind of remember
it<00:03:56.640> keeps<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.329> cinnamon<00:03:57.720> in<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:59.040> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
it keeps the cinnamon in the the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.590 
it keeps the cinnamon in the the
impressions<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.880> cinnamon<00:04:00.209> without<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
impressions of cinnamon without the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.000 
impressions of cinnamon without the
impact<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.230> cinnamon<00:04:01.590> if<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.799> makes<00:04:01.950> any

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
impact of cinnamon if that makes any

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.580 
impact of cinnamon if that makes any
sense

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590

it's<00:04:07.590> pretty<00:04:07.829> neat<00:04:08.040> not<00:04:08.940> as<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:10.190> don't<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.280> I'm

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
it's pretty neat not as I don't know I'm

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.289

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
not as hot or spicy as I predicted

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:20.440 
not as hot or spicy as I predicted
very<00:04:15.299> mild<00:04:15.709> no<00:04:16.709> alcohol<00:04:17.190> taste<00:04:18.799> flavorful<00:04:19.830> I
