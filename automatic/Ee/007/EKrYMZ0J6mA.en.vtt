has a lot shorter range in kog'maw so we

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.060

support<00:04:40.419> is<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.509> very<00:04:40.780> aggressive<00:04:41.169> support<00:04:41.800> and

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
support is a very aggressive support and

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.409 
support is a very aggressive support and
can<00:04:42.520> actually<00:04:42.639> snowball<00:04:43.150> but<00:04:43.330> the

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
can actually snowball but the

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.480 
can actually snowball but the
snowballing<00:04:43.780> is<00:04:43.930> based<00:04:44.110> off<00:04:44.289> of<00:04:44.349> lux<00:04:44.830> not

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
snowballing is based off of lux not

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.790 
snowballing is based off of lux not
often<00:04:45.729> for<00:04:46.030> ad<00:04:46.389> so<00:04:46.990> that<00:04:47.169> if<00:04:47.259> you<00:04:47.349> don't<00:04:47.680> get

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
often for ad so that if you don't get

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.469 
often for ad so that if you don't get
that<00:04:47.860> snow<00:04:48.250> long<00:04:48.430> initially<00:04:48.820> with<00:04:48.940> lux<00:04:49.210> you

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
that snow long initially with lux you

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.939 
that snow long initially with lux you
will<00:04:49.690> fall<00:04:49.990> behind<00:04:50.139> and<00:04:50.409> your<00:04:50.560> support<00:04:50.770> which

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
will fall behind and your support which

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:51.990 
will fall behind and your support which
is<00:04:51.039> why<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.190> don't<00:04:51.310> see<00:04:51.610> a<00:04:51.639> whole<00:04:51.849> lot

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
is why you don't see a whole lot

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.120 
is why you don't see a whole lot
especially<00:04:52.270> in<00:04:52.570> higher<00:04:52.720> level<00:04:53.020> gains<00:04:53.259> so<00:04:54.099> I

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
especially in higher level gains so I

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.589 
especially in higher level gains so I
was<00:04:54.460> ganking<00:04:54.820> about<00:04:55.000> in<00:04:55.150> order<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.389> try<00:04:55.570> and

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
was ganking about in order to try and

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.719 
was ganking about in order to try and
get<00:04:55.750> my<00:04:55.930> lane<00:04:56.199> ahead<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:57.070> that<00:04:57.099> they<00:04:57.370> can<00:04:57.550> just

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
get my lane ahead so that they can just

00:04:57.729 --> 00:04:59.879 
get my lane ahead so that they can just
destroy<00:04:58.659> them<00:04:58.840> which<00:04:59.289> they<00:04:59.349> eventually<00:04:59.620> do<00:04:59.860> I
