 weekend more in the calendar today 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.150
 It's Friday and I come to bring you three 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.980
 new so many curious facts number one 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.039
 I do, there is a disease that does not 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.260
 allows you to sleep nothing at all ever 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.240
 all these things many vacations in 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.279
 the same sentence can cause for two 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.289
 things if you have insomnia is going to go 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.759
 gradually testing until the 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.529
 point where you literally do not go to 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.090
 be able to sleep as a reason a little bit 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.430
 more scientific than your prp protein that 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.490
 green fish and that I do not know what it means 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.220
 but it's a mutation of said said 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.660
 protein and prevents you from sleeping 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.990
 way to see if you have this disease 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.100
 or is not the number 13 insomnia yes ok 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.710
 number 2 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.110
 you have hallucinations ok is fine yes and 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.940
 number 3 you have mental videos yes 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.710
 although this is probably you have this 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.630
 illness or is beginning to occur 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.490
 but that if it does not work but not the 12 of 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.350
 the night because I wake up myself a line 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.420
 charge reading interesting things in 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 internet or good your videos means 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.510
 that I can not sleep and that I'm going to give 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.820
 this sickness 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.260
 calmer the faculty is the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.570
 paranoid human beings like us 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.910
 we saw them late because the internet is 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.890
 very interesting in real life not but 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.960
 hey you have to be aware that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.660
 the crazy descents and for you 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.660
 questions if you can not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.640
 in the most logical answer really 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.980
 but you know that instead of seeing yourself sleeping 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.050
 you can simply fall into a coma by 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.670
 take pills very far I took 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:44.160

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.400
 Xavier is that in Tajikistan a place in 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.350
 asia I do not know women with my eyebrows are 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.350
 considered very attractive 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.410
 are women only women men 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.230
 do not get excited remove 6 wrinkles from the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 in front of 7 in this culture the girls 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.989
 female females are allowed to grow 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.750
 eyebrows and the more huge and united be 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.720
 better goal well a forest in his eyebrows 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.550
 that is considered beautiful and beautiful and of 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.790
 made the girls who do not annas eyebrows 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.920
 in the line with a weird chemical ones 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.150
 they are chemicals are urbanized plants with 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.290

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.030
 beautiful 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.140
 so it is curious to compare it with what is 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.910
 consider what is considered in america 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.460
 and with America I mean the continent 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.680
 not to the country by god good in this case 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.870
 the attractive complaint very attractive in 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.830
 no side really for us 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.730
 excite 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.830
 data number 3 you have hotmail account or 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.500
 of the other or of what is good because 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.500
 you know that in 1999 some hackers 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.450
 they discovered how to hack in all 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.140
 hotmail accounts 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.880
 now outlook you seem 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 in the year 99 the mail and I do not know penguin 3 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.310
 of 4 sexy arroba hotmail.com and in the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.040
 password section just put 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.900
 h and with that I'm going to give in to this 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.580
 account and any other in fact this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.950
 case it is called as a great 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.930
 catastrophe of the internet because then 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.620
 many safety data already met 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.850
 your personal information address are there 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.110
 obviously then that people 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.330
 want to put the mail in any of 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.000
 the programs but then he left me 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.580
 they fixed it but the hackers never 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.890
 Render is the youngsters are not cared for 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.200
 in 2001 we discovered that there was a 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.060
 different way of accused with those of 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 the people the point is that this case 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.100
 it was an epidemic in August 2001 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.930
 and it's fortunately they leave me 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.880
 they named solving it within how 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.280
 two three weeks which is too much 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.080
 time we too much chance to the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.040
 hackers put those accounts of everything 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.870
 world 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.340
 but good for the hacker is someday 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.880
 will achieve the world and we the 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.130
