00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:19.390
 we will apply the second to newton to 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.390
 this satellite then the second in newton 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:29.449
 tells us that the sum therefore sigma is 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:32.960
 for sum sum notation of 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.480
 forces outside the satellite is 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.850
 equal to the mass of the satellite which if 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.030
 in this case is noted small m 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.430
 so satellite mass times the vector 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.719
 acceleration we remind that it is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.219
 second to newtown can be is 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.989
 also stated with equal on this side dp 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.030
 on summer that is to say the derivative of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.070
 vector quantity we come but there we 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.590
 knows exactly the same thing 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.109
 so we notice it directly m times the 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.820
 vector acceleration then then the 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.890
 effort is the strength 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.690
 which acts on the satellite is the strength 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.119
 of gravitational attraction exerted 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.080
 by the planet on the satellite 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:15.349
 so here it is the force f condemns to the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.970
 tfg which is equal to the mass times 

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:19.670
 satellite acceleration 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 so this gravitational force its 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.069
 value we know its expression 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.920
 sorry we know it remains to be determined 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:30.380
 in relation to our purpose how does the 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.000
 mans vector then this force 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.039
 it's a force 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.450
 it is the force that the satellite undergoes 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.520
 so you should not go wrong when you 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.959
 ask to represent it is the strength 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.819
 that the satellite undergoes it must be done 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.950
 from the satellite 

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:46.099
 the direction of this force she is 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.869
 carried by the line that connects the two 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:50.000
 centers the center of the planet and the 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.489
 center of the satellite so we trace 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.050
 first a straight line that brings the two 

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:56.509
 centers this distance there in general 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.610
 it is noted by the statement here I them 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.500
 note small air so distance between 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.539
 center of the planet and the satellite 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.950
 then this force is a force 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.860
 attraction 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.890
 so she leaves the satellite she she 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.750
 is directed to oriented forgiveness instead 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.580
 to the planet 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.490
 and she is directed according to this right 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.010
 which connects the two centers so that's 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.560
 it's very important to see that this 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.510
 force she and she from the satellite 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.040
 1c we look at the system this is our 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.540
 satellite of which part of the satellite 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.610
 and she tells us it's the planet 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.550
 who gets it so this information is 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.220
 given by the vector force here force 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.980
 gravitational we could note 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 here fg so here this force there she is 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.230
 parallel to this vector there that we noted 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.850
 normal vector n so we will note it 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.970
 in this base the links to the satellites 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 in this in this den the tn we go 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.630
 note the strength 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.390
 fg so how does the note she's equal 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.489
 at barns and that sometimes these data in 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.820
 Forward 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:03.280
 sometimes makes you guess 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.290
 so that's granger granger it's a 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.670
 constant must not be confused with this 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650
 small I acquired a notation 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.970
 it's a constant invitationnal that 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.770
 is given also so it's a 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.300
 value that expressed in unity is 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.870
 international system 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.410
 so it's equal to this big g times the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.030
 mass of the planet that acts must be well 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.910
 that it has me that of the planet 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.070
 intervene somewhere times the mass 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.430
 of the satellite since it is him who undergoes 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.170
 / the distance between the two centers 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.470
 so the two centers we noted here 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.630
 in this exercise little air and or square 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.010
 So here you are ranked constant 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.959
 gravitational that governs the movement 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.970
 of the stars the mass of the ain the mass of 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.620
 the water / distance squared that connects 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.170
 the two centers and there we can not 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.670
 stop there since the force here the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.920
 second the newton is a relationship 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.269
 vector so we are obliged here to 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.549
 find him a vector to this force to 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.970
 this numerical value there then this is the 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.400
 vector 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.040
 here it is parallel to this vector there 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.900
 so we will add to the numerical value 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.790
 the big themes vector which is a 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.310
 unitary vector and that gives us just 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:11.620
 the meaning and orientation of this force 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.549
 so here big themes that is equal to 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.019
 the mass times the acceleration 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:19.390
 so here we see that the satellite having 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.450
 a different mass 2 0 we can 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.160
 simplify by the mass of the satellite and 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.650
 we arrive 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.960
 vector expression of the vector 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.910
 satellite acceleration that is worth 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.780
 granger constant gravitational 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:38.820
 big themes mass of the planet that 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.800
 acts / mÂ² and we do not forget here since 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.310
 it's a vector it's a must 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.350
 here to keep the player the antenna so 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:50.070
 there vector left vector right 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:53.220
 our equation is valid then 16.7 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.360
 this relationship is important because 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.760
 that she tells me that the vector 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.180
 acceleration of our satellite is 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.220
 worn and parallel is carried by the 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.480
 vector that we noted grant n 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.280
 it means that there is no 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.950
 satellite acceleration 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.910
 according to this vector the acquired and angel in 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.620
 sky 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.870
 if there is no access the acceleration of 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.750
 our satellite is just following the 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.640
 big vector ten we're going to have some 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.230
 consequences with respect to speed 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.740
 so I'm going to clear the board and then 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.740
 we will continue
