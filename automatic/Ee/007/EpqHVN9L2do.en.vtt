00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.590
 The essential parts of the Cona Coffee Maker are: 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:43.110
 Flask, Cup, Filter, Handle, Lighter and Foot. 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:01:02.270
 Let's see the assembly. 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.180
 It is important to choose the type of water well in order to achieve satisfactory results. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.260
 When it comes to opting for mineral water we have to focus, above all, on 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.320
 in which it is of WEAK MINERALIZATION so that it contains a low calcium content. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.870
 When we fill the flask we should pay attention to always leave a margin 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:30.290
 about 3 or 4 centimeters without filling. 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.590
 Another previous issue to take into account in the preparation of coffee 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.330
 It is your point of grinding. 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.120
 The optimum thickness will not be the same for an espresso coffee 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.870
 or an Italian coffee maker or for this coffee 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.110
 that we will prepare in a Cona Coffee Maker. 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 Thus, the optimum grinding in this case should not be too thin or too thick. 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.370
 First of all we will light the lighter of the coffee machine. 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.370
 The original lighter of the Cona Coffee Maker is an alcohol infuser. 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.150
 However, there are other alternatives in the market 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:37.790
 like some gas burners that are compatible with this type of coffee makers. 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.349
 Coffee preparation time will depend on different factors 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.870
 how can they be: the number of coffees that we are preparing 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.279
 or the type and power of the lighter that we are using. 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.900
 In any case we can estimate that the water will start to rise from the flask to 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.329
 the cup spent about 5 minutes. 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.430
 This occurs because increasing the temperature of the flask 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.370
 the vapor expands increasing its volume 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.189
 and exerting enough force on the filter 

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.969
 so that it allows him to filter into the glass and mix with the ground coffee. 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.919
 It is important to note that not all the water will go into the cup. 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.260
 When gurgling bubbles form in the cup, 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.049
 As we see in the images, we will know that the passage of water to the glass has 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.049
 concluded. 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:34.370
 At this point 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.680
 we can stir lightly the coffee of the glass 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.639
 to facilitate mixing. 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.099
 You will have to take special care not to hit the glass filter that is 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.889
 in the bottom of this container. 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:49.579
 Then we turn off the lighter using its glass lid. 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.590
 Immediately, the temperature begins to fall inside the flask 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.469
 causing the steam inside to contract. 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.469
 This generates a vacuum that causes the liquid in the cup 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:08.669
 filter back to the flask. 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:09.819
 We already have our coffee. 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.029
 A clean coffee without impurities. 

00:04:12.029 --> 00:04:14.440
 Made in containers exclusively made of glass. 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.060
 Without coming into contact with other materials, (metallic or plastic), 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.940
 that could contaminate its aroma or flavor. 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.980
 In addition, we have managed to make the infusion at the correct temperature, 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.050
 without reaching the boiling point in any case. 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.270
 Thus, we have managed to extract their oils from coffee 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.949
 and not produce any solid waste.
