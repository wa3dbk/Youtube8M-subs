00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.720
 the first thing we look at is 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.310
 updated render client which you are 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.470
 You can be purchased at appstore he 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.240
 sold separately from the first version then 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.890
 there is 1 will not support and chips 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.380
 which is in the second and actually this 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.940
 support for finley some others 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.400
 services you can have a ben here 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.710
 some other some of these 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.199
 paid services in connection with the grind bang and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.789
 and in google part of what google reader 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.460
 stopped working and had to 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.810
 developers sawing some new ways 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.540
 for survival 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.940
 but darker turned out quite well and 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.810
 this application crashed even after 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.149
 of your launch 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.770
 in the settings you can add a pledge 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.480
 not here oil some services for 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.840
 further sharing here 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.520
 instapaper package evernote and others 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.309
 popular services I think court main 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.590
 account can see how it looks 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.570
 All my subscriptions have a button on top 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.270
 profiles here in this kind of convenient you 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.710
 just see what everyone looks like 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.969
 unread by the way if you go into 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.170
 one of them is so convenient 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:08.780
 ryadovichi form 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.340
 text is displayed directly with photos 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.979
 everything is cached meaning you can 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.810
 read all the cases in the bottom 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.079
 menu you can fry the attack on anything 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.490
 can be marked as read can 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:21.350
 go to the next night 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 simple arrows or add to 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.829
 favorites as well as settings like us 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.340
 could see there is top right when 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.319
 reading 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.149
 the ability to customize the font is all very 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:31.069
 pretty in the general style of such 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.509
 solid offer made when 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.920
 viewing unread articles by Vlad 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.570
 there are several options below 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 yes you can view the settings 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.439
 rather, you can see the mapping 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.900
 absolutely all became including reason 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.259
 braced to or selected only that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.450
 say rss of course very famous and 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.830
 he was popular earlier stayed 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.140
 popular now therefore probably 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.990
 stay exactly on him he is simple 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.580
 beautiful folds worse money but in 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.950
 Principally, the developers tried so 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.619
 let's respect them for it is called 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.750
 the render application is second to what we are 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.780
 see this evernote client it 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 updated well we did not watch them we 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 didn't watch here your movie or so i 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.660
 I'll show it to you. Actually this is the first. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.360
 is an evernote update which 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.910
 so cool should say that 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.040
 besides the fact that it remains all such 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.049
 same functional more added 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.970
 news you can view it by the way 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.500
 very interesting item here is the usual 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.930
 news in applications if they are 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.430
 Any blog or about the company all affairs 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.260
 nobody reads this here 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.510
 some useful 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.830
 from the camera case as recommendations for 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.390
 erasing stress while studying 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.880
 open if you like the people in 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.709
 This is the way you can see sky articles 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.750
 can save the most important thing will turn out 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.700
 here it will be separately saved in general 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 these are the functions I really like from 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.109
 offtopic top is she not 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.739
 interfere but very helpful also 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.040
 shortcuts 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.540
 You can view them and give yours 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.100
 notes here are some widgets 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.070
 actually your notes can be 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.260
 view straight all you have 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.120
 there is a search of course you can in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.390
 settings let's see how it all 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.130
 looks also ban and cancel 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.829
 settings here you can choose the mode 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.269
 mappings it will be fragments that is 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.100
 will be here in this form 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.230
 or cards for me for some reason 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.420
 like the cards are the only one 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.250
 I noticed a minus that it's hard to get into 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.470
 because of the small screen is true kondrada i 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.730
 much used next you have a notebook and 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.500
 they are displayed here in this form 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.799
 notice everything from the main screen very 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.420
 neatly shimmers into one 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.000
 or another mapping of course 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.700
 There are labels and most likely that it is convenient 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.799
 appeared in this version this is the bottom 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.680
 block with quick notes can create 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.480
 A future photo note can be selected from 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.180
 album something immediately insert to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.359
 you can not take pictures 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.370
 create a reminder of some kind of list we 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.569
 the biggest window is of course create 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.340
 Here you can select a new note. 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.650
 notepad where it will be written and so 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.510
 Further, in general, the client turned out very 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.950
 cool at last it became both simple and 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.659
 functional at the same time it seems to me 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.950
 very very beautiful it is updated 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.129
 customer returned for 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.319
 and at the end of today's release just 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.120
 game soul debugger which is here 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.629
 I really liked this one 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.950
 game heir pack playnes which 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.170
 called pocket trains 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.590
 she became at first glance if so 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.449
 just watch the update as if with 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.460
 heaven came down the plane and became 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:25.009
 the trains are actually not so very 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.199
 a lot of graphics changed the essence of the game also 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.750
 slightly changed the main news is that the same 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.580
 stays as it would just translate 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.680
 questions the economic and these things 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.940
 time simulator in this ability to play 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.030
 it became much interesting let's watch 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.160
 what it looks like now I chose 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.080
 roses route every train you can 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.520
 create set defined separate 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.830
 the route that he will ride 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.500
 need to buy it if it has not yet 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.300
 I tried downloading it 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.550
 and actually chose to drive us to Paris 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.820
 and see loaded i don't train to paris 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.860
 and on the pus depot and here we see that our 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.389
 the train carries here such cars as 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.860
 see you can move the whole thing but 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.199
 notice that the graphics have become much more 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.570
 enjoyable right away from here 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.430
 You see that on this screen take off 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.470
 coins fly dollar it's all like 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.409
 before as here you see the state 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.940
 your account can view the map 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.159
 can see what time it is 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.530
 left to go where it is possible to deliver 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.440
 its faster and also you see under 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.090
 the name of the train is the fuel tank you 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.460
 see how much fuel is left of it 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.440
 trains and if your train does not have 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.300
 Fuel separate sides of these trains 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.570
 as you can see I did not equip them all 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.400
 naturally they will be exactly fast 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.380
 vyzhrit fuel here so I 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.360
 I am sending several trains to Paris 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.460
 as you can see landscapes are also different everywhere 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.930
 I really liked the graphics 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.690
 this is so distinctive that is she 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.509
 retained its pixel art 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.669
 but meanwhile about how cool even with 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.099
 dollars downloaded but would still become 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.610
 much more lively like that 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.870
 way we are now sending our train and 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.550
 when he hi we will get 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.990
 money for it naturally grows 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:04.340
 and so on in general for xy us is not easy 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.130
 usual some settings you can 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.900
 see and of course the settings 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.030
 directly application games or rather 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.740
 but also you can create here 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.720
 all sorts of trains but in order to 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.090
 create you don't find now just 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.770
 parts from the train what you get 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.510
 here are the boxes that need 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.340
 break strangely for the very 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.440
 green dollars it certainly does 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.780
 hurts but nonetheless you get 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.370
 whole parts from trains but as you can see 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.200
 I have only 4 bucks left now 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:33.680
 All boxes are broken now if you 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.120
 go to craft then to pars you will 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.950
 see what you have for example here have 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.550
 I have a big train now 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:39.740
 ready 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.280
 finished parts war asks we want 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:46.160
 make engine or fil 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.360
 to that is for fuel or or engine 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:50.450
 we want to make the engine in order 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:52.730
 to put to put the train in 

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:55.150
 some new on some new line 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.860
 now we choose for example 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:02.300
 what line do we choose well let's 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.770
 example, we do not put in london london 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.240
 general here we can put on 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.460
 some new line we can put 

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.240
 new belt which we actually only 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.680
 what friends created in general i started 

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.470
 play already on android so here u 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.120
 My progress is small, but be very 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.520
 neat when you play this 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.169
 the game run return this game why 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.810
 because 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:25.400
 very dangerous this thing she delays not 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.830
 childish and when you reach already 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.590
 level 10 then abandon the game will be 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.389
 really very very hard to eat 

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:36.080
 Of course, statistics is a bank where you are 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:37.550
 you can change everything well and everything
