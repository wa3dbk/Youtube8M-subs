00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.300
 and is 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:15.069
 and should the iss the veteran military elite basketball simulator come back 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:18.069

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:26.569
 the game counts this year with a Spanish player of the memphis grizzlies 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.509
 amazon as cake image 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.860
 who has also given his help by collaborating directly in some 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:35.859
 aspects of your life 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.089
 entering its possibilities 

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.289
 once again we have at our disposal all the teams and 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.160
 real energy players 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.460
 updated and with their statistics in full, although they are also 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 will allow modifying the templates to our liking 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.090
 women who suffer and according to the editor 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 fervent to its game modes we have a great variety 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.229
 from playing a quick game to participating in a full season 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.930
 from its beginnings to the final playoffs 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 thank you 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.960
 in addition there will also be a vote in the institution mode more means where 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.990
 We will direct any team, making all the efforts of 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.940
 hiring and signings going afterwards to play the matches or 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.940
 let them resolve automatically 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.979
 but you have to know 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.080
 in Miami where he's going to beat 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.080
 orders to factories 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.860
 to speak if this miguel serrano 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.670
 Regarding his guilt the title has a very intuitive control 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.240
 what allows us to enjoy the games from the first moment 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.830
 but unfortunately also presents some errors in the intelligence 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.979
 artificial of the players something that has been dragging for several 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 editions 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.969
 they also bet a lot more for the cali actions than for the foundation 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.589
 with news like that now we will have the so-called factor x which can 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:21.359
 turn one of our players a little bit into an unbeatable superstar 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:24.359
 for a limited time 

00:02:25.919 --> 00:02:28.270
 he was tortured in 2005 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.039
 as a button shows the high quality traffic 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.459
 being possible to instantly recognize the faces of the majority of players 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.249
 although nevertheless this new delivery 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:40.529
 it is only a slight improvement with those already seen in the previous 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:43.529
 so it did not become first at any time 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.469
 For its part, the sound section has very good effects 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.370
 but what we most emphasize above all is the dubbing of Castilian 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.840
 the voices of the commentators which despite not being at all 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.749
 synchronized with what happens in the field if they maintain a very acceptable 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:04.319
 quality 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.319
 it's a stable situation that did everything he could 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.349
 in conclusion that it is a very good basketball simulator that 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.529
 he fulfilled everything that could be expected 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:27.599
 Perez and on the contrary does not bring new developments to what was already something 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.129
 that can pass bill to someone in my family other titles that got 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.129
 beat him like the recent tournament 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.769

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.829
