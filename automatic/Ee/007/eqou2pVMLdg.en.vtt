 an olive turtle during the sand 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.019
 thanks to its sixth sense the female 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.050
 always come back to the place of his 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:10.050

 the job finished the new mom 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.450
 covers the sand hole with its 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.630
 back legs and goes back to the water is 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.630
 drawn 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.190
 he 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.190
 my 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.629
 matt the researcher who works at 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
 turtle conservation center 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.289
 marine inspect the beaches at the 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.649
 search for traces of pumps on the 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.649
 sand 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 during this time jeff at the office studying 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.060
 results of the analyzes carried out 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.670
 after their last outing at sea ​​we go 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.890
 see here we will check the data from 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 the hyer capture we did 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.000
 between 11h and 12h we did an hour of 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
 diving and not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.799
 for the poor I will take a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.860
 piece here these seven samples that 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.869
 we took yesterday all the 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.240
 samples are stored here before 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.729
 that we send them for analysis on 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:51.539
 keep them here by car well the numbers 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:53.340
 correspondents here now it does not 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.880
 remains more than send them everything is 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.159
 checked in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.270
 if we ever have a doubt just 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.470
 come see here on the field notebook 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.709
 these are the two samples collected 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.709
 yesterday 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.330
 matt continues to survey the beaches of 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.980
 fernando de noronha and discovers the 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.340
 traces of a turtle come to lay on the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.340
 sand 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.590
 he must find the nesting hole count 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.480
 from them 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.680
 and signal it by a pole to avoid 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.680
 to visitors to get closer 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.620
 no 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.230
 we 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.640
 or 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.360
 a new day starts in the 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.830
 fernando de noronha park 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.230
 while visitors benefit from 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.440
 waves of the beaches the team of matt and 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.060
 jeff argue on the beach go not 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.590
 that I was in college when 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.680
 I was studying biology but dream was 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.650
 to work with animals 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.440
 especially marine animals 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.850
 because in my childhood I lived 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.610
 here at fernando de noronha 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.260
 for six years I have been in contact with 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.260
 the sea with animals but 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:38.970
 tamar organization mainly for 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:43.419
 I am far from home since 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:47.800
 practically six years ends up becoming 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.540
 our family he creates a bond is this 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.830
 that we are building at Fernando de 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:58.630
 noronha where everything is yet from 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.070
 complicate life here is simpler and 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.610
 human relations must be 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:06.790
 sincere a real family get 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:10.000
 to build within the project is like 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.729
 that I see things here is very 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.070
 rewarding work here is the 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:19.600
 fulfillment of a dream everyone 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.630
 shows respect for the slaps for 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.460
 animals because the priority is 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.460
 respect and protection of the m 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:35.200
 the ideal would be to reconcile the 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.570
 growth comes one realizes that he 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.430
 is happening that lille is getting 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.830
 developed 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.820
 I have been here for just over four 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.080
 years ago and I have already realized 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.140
 those who have been here for longer 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.419
 that I can talk even better about 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.919
 development of the island we devote 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:59.040
 our life to the preservation of everything 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:59.040
 the ecosystem the whole environment 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:10.880
 and you have to go with the heart is 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.600
 unknowingly and like that we continue and we go 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.600
 see just contains 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.970
 a few weeks later incubation 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.190
 eggs ends young turtles 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:24.690
 come out of the sand to reach the sea 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.330
 she pushes with all the strength to 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.180
 get out of their sand prison they have to 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.590
 pay attention to the many predators 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.130
 deadly birds hovers over 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.130
 newborns 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.930
 1 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.889
 or 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.590
 good 

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.580
 2 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.259
 this new generation of turtles 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.449
 olive trees represents a hope for 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:15.770
 species 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:17.300
 they owe their survival to researchers 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.069
 and scientists who have done 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.370
 maritime national park fernando de 

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:24.050
 noronha a shrine 

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:28.189
 without them these bones would have died since 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:31.060
 long time to accomplish this miracle he has 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:31.060
 30 years of effort
