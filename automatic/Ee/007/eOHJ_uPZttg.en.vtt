little better shape we want to get an

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.870 
little better shape we want to get an
idea<00:00:20.420> of<00:00:20.510> how<00:00:20.690> this<00:00:20.869> thing<00:00:20.930> is<00:00:21.200> going<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.529> work

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
idea of how this thing is going to work

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.160 
idea of how this thing is going to work
before<00:00:22.880> we<00:00:22.910> really<00:00:23.270> get<00:00:23.390> out<00:00:23.540> into<00:00:23.810> the<00:00:23.930> warm

that<00:00:30.800> one-inch<00:00:31.130> hole<00:00:31.279> pretty<00:00:31.519> easily<00:00:31.730> let's

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:32.689 
that one-inch hole pretty easily let's

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.460 
that one-inch hole pretty easily let's
try<00:00:32.899> a<00:00:32.930> two-inch<00:00:33.320> hole<00:00:35.079> make<00:00:36.079> sure<00:00:36.260> you<00:00:36.350> hold

try a two-inch hole make sure you hold

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.439 
try a two-inch hole make sure you hold
on<00:00:36.649> to<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:36.890> drill<00:00:37.100> bit<00:00:37.309> I've<00:00:37.730> dropped<00:00:38.030> one<00:00:38.300> or

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the way I installed the anvil on top of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.130 
the way I installed the anvil on top of
the<00:01:00.059> log<00:01:01.039> was<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> forge<00:01:02.519> down<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.180> railroad

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
the log was to forge down a railroad

the log was to forge down a railroad
spike<00:01:04.320> like<00:01:04.710> this<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:06.140> into<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.439> narrow

spike like this one into a narrow
pointed<00:01:08.280> shape<00:01:08.549> that<00:01:08.850> fits<00:01:09.119> into<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> hole<00:01:10.290> in

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
pointed shape that fits into the hole in

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.789 
pointed shape that fits into the hole in
the<00:01:10.590> front<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> anvil<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.560> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.649> nice

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
the front are the anvil and it's a nice

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.660 
the front are the anvil and it's a nice
snug<00:01:14.130> fit<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.700> tapered<00:01:15.119> wedge<00:01:15.690> in<00:01:15.899> there

snug fit it's tapered wedge in there
easiest<00:01:17.670> way<00:01:17.759> for<00:01:17.789> me<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.149> do<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:23.930> hold<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
easiest way for me to do that hold the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:41.140 
easiest way for me to do that hold the
hinge<00:01:25.049> up<00:01:25.409> where<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> want<00:01:25.770> it
