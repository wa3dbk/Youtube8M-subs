i'm here right now testing to see if i
get<00:02:05.020> bothered<00:02:05.229> by<00:02:05.530> anybody<00:02:05.740> how<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> night

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
get bothered by anybody how the night

get bothered by anybody how the night
traffic<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.570> I'm<00:02:07.869> gonna<00:02:08.020> have<00:02:08.110> my<00:02:08.200> generator

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
traffic is I'm gonna have my generator

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.830 
traffic is I'm gonna have my generator
on<00:02:08.770> later<00:02:09.070> see<00:02:09.459> if<00:02:09.489> that<00:02:09.850> stirs<00:02:10.149> anything<00:02:10.660> up

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
on later see if that stirs anything up

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.690 
on later see if that stirs anything up
because<00:02:11.590> if<00:02:11.739> I'm<00:02:11.860> here<00:02:12.040> in<00:02:12.160> august<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.580> sep

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
because if I'm here in august or sep

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.920 
because if I'm here in august or sep
tember<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.120> generator<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.630> going<00:02:13.840> on

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
tember that generator is going on

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.680 
tember that generator is going on
because<00:02:14.140> it<00:02:14.380> is<00:02:14.500> hot<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.400> is<00:02:15.850> so<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.239> you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
because it is hot here it is so I you

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.920 
because it is hot here it is so I you
guys<00:02:16.780> never<00:02:16.959> been<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.260> arizona<00:02:17.320> and<00:02:18.209> i<00:02:19.209> think

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
guys never been to arizona and i think

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:20.820 
guys never been to arizona and i think
it's<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.200> good<00:02:20.260> idea<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.590> have<00:02:20.739> the

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
it's not a good idea to have the

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.590 
it's not a good idea to have the
generator<00:02:21.220> on<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.580> try<00:02:21.820> staying<00:02:22.120> in<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.390> van

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
generator on you try staying in a van

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.860 
generator on you try staying in a van
