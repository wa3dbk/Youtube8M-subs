00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.940
 finally in this new video in which 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.280
 we will deal with a subject that you have me 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.050
 really asked in so many 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.920
 we're going to see the best news 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.719
 introduced with ios 8.1 on all 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.350
 devices compatible with this 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.180
 firmware 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.210
 how many of you will know by now 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.519
 po of apple days released 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:26.099
 solely to ios developers 8.1 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.859
 beta 1 I immediately proceeded to 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.199
 install it on my iphone 6 and mine 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.570
 fifth generation ipod touch I owe you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.600
 to say that despite being a beta 1 I am 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.210
 he was really very satisfied 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.530
 I've been using it for 45 days now and vi 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 I must say that I have not yet found 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.750
 half and say half a bug 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.340
 for now it seems really perfect 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 I also noticed that they were 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.090
 fixed many bugs that are instead 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.899
 still present on the latest version 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 then publishes ios 8.0.2 but before 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.730
 go into the news and bugs the most 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.440
 important money you want to remember 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 that yesterday I uploaded a video in which 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.729
 explain how to install this new beta 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
 even for all those who do not 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.200
 have a developer account 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.939
 so completely free 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 find the video link down in 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.049
 however, description not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.280
 We lose time and we immediately enter into 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.280
 this new firmware 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:26.690
 well the first novelty that has not appeared 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.550
 strangely on the internet is a bug fix 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.620
 in fact its es 8.0.2 8.0.1 and 8.0 is 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.170
 present an annoying bug 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.870
 concerning notifications when 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.030
 there comes a notification banner some 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.119
 times when we drag it upwards 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.950
 to hide it to postpone it 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.979
 what happens is that the whole interface 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.080
 it freezes and we will be forced to press 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.910
 twice the home button to do so 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.920
 disappear of force, in other words, the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.890
 device fizzes this is one thing 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.899
 very annoying that I remember with ios 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.910
 8.0.2 happened very often and that instead 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.940
 as you can see it has been completely 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.530
 solved in ios 8.1 beta 1 this the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.360
 main reason that pushed me to 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.610
 install it because I guarantee you many 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.550
 of you will have noticed it practically 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.500
 anyone to s8 noted this bug of 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.110
 Notification banner which is really a lot 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.270
 annoying practically every other twice 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.040
 on four that you send back a banner 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.470
 this bug that hurts you happens 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.420
 all device interface vi 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.850
 I can therefore confirm that this bug is 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.989
 resolved in ios 8.1 beta 1 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.820
 moving on to the next news 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.730
 allow me a moment to go to the 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.500
 settings turn off this wifi 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.850
 because I have to show you something new that a 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.940
 what to do with the cellular data network 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.310
 in fact it took many years but 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.750
 at the end going on settings 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.519
 mobiles we will find this new string 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.580
 call voice data that finally 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:53.320
 allows you to choose whether to browse or 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.030
 call in lte in 3g or in 2g 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.190
 finally we will have this possibility 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.860
 many users complained for years 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.950
 that on iphone it was not possible to change 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.350
 from 3g and 2g from 4g to 2g etc. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.690
 finally canarias 8.1 was 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.850
 introduced this possibility remain 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.970
 always in the settings but this one 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.730
 time going into the general category e 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.700
 later in the keyboard category 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.100
 we will find this item at the bottom of the skill 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.170
 dictation once deactivated will do 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.540
 disappear the small icon of 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.430
 microphone on the keyboard dai 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.560
 iphone 4s up obviously once 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 activated as you can see once 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.680
 confirmed I take 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.719
 dictation skill here is the icon of the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.489
 microphone for voice writing is 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:39.859
 come back already as I'm on the springboard 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.319
 I show you another novelty that is the icon 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.349
 of ibooks has changed slightly 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.780
 compared to the one present on ios 8.0 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.409
 puntoit mistaken for interfacing with 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:54.109
 more with the safari bookmarks icon 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.390
 this year an irrelevant novelty is one 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.579
 novelty equally irrelevant of which I 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.489
 I didn't even realize it was that 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.430
 in the notification center the widget icons 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.209
 they are slightly larger than 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:11.120
 those of aversa 8.0.2 or lower here 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.000
 you have a comparison view on the phone 5 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.590
 I kept ios 8.0 and see that in 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.959
 effects the icons are a little bit more 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.269
 big on my iphone 6 pass instead 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.729
 a pretty nice news we have the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.770
 possibility to do what before 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.960
 we did going into privacy settings 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.940
 so from here we can manage all the 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.440
 permissions that all applications have 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.520
 links for example all 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.530
 applications that can access 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.780
 to the photo app we can now do 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.639
 the reverse indeed going down into the 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.960
 settings here where there are all 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.500
 app application settings 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.979
 store 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.690
 opening an application we can from there 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.250
 select which permissions to assign to it 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.110
 whether to allow it to update itself in 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.760
 background allow her to use the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.620
 cellular data connection also 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.760
 we will also have a relative link 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.800
 to notifications of that application 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.110
 this can be very convenient for 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 some cases eg photo grid here 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.590
 I can immediately choose whether to revoke it less 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.930
 permission the photo application 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.849
 etc. so I find this function 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.250
 pretty nice we know it's there 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.490
 to some it might be useful while 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:12.919
 passing to the last news but really 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.440
 great the photo roll is finally 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.139
 back on ios indeed many of you 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.180
 they will know what you did 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.490
 roll film well now is back is 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.260
 returned the roll of photos in beta 1 not 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.389
 everyone is able to use it to me 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.599
 it works perfectly and finally it is 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.270
 returned this historical function of ios 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.430
 I read on some sites that it was 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.650
 also removed the deleted album of 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.479
 recent you know that if we delete 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.979
 a photo in reality this will not go from 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.469
 no part will go into an album 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.940
 temporary a kind of basket and it will come 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.340
 actually removed from the device 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.380
 only after 3 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.940
 for days unless we cancel it 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.889
 a second time since that album 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.110
 particular good I read that precisely the 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.430
 his ex 8.1 this thing is gone that is 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.380
 everything back as before 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.870
 however on this function I continue to 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.850
 have the function recently deleted 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.889
 so we'll see in the next beta how 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:05.169
 everything will take place and pass instead 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:08.050
 a curiosity because it is not a feature is 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.210
 a kind of leak from this string that 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.370
 was found in a file of 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.550
 internal system settings different 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.250
 8.1 we find confirmation that the next ones 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.650
 ipad will have the hunt and of and the 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:23.139
 Technology apple pay this sailing is 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.580
 was discovered by fans in the south and precisely 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.610
 thanks to this it confirms that i 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.590
 new ipads will come with ios 8.1 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.820
 definitive on board that will have the touch 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.880
 heidi then the fingerprint reader 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:35.620
 digital and also that will support the 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.690
 apple pay technology present 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.380
 currently only on iphone 6 iphone 6 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.360
