thing<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.769> constantly<00:00:11.309> stuff<00:00:11.610> on<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:12.690> make<00:00:13.230> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
thing is constantly stuff on so make a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.930 
thing is constantly stuff on so make a
video<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:14.070> might<00:00:14.219> be<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.370> bit<00:00:14.519> easy<00:00:14.730> for<00:00:14.880> you

guys<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.120> understand<00:00:15.710> what<00:00:16.710> I'm<00:00:16.800> thinking<00:00:17.130> is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
guys to understand what I'm thinking is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.920 
guys to understand what I'm thinking is
maybe<00:00:17.369> swapping<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:17.910> unit<00:00:18.270> out<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.420> can<00:00:18.779> get

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
maybe swapping this unit out I can get

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.859 
maybe swapping this unit out I can get
one<00:00:19.109> second<00:00:19.560> hand<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.980> about<00:00:20.130> 30<00:00:20.400> odd<00:00:20.580> quid

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
one second hand for about 30 odd quid

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.939 
one second hand for about 30 odd quid
obviously<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.900> don't<00:00:22.050> want<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.289> go<00:00:22.380> for<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.769> now

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949

I<00:01:05.350> can<00:01:06.350> race<00:01:07.280> here<00:01:09.759> doesn't<00:01:10.759> change<00:01:11.000> anything

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:14.969 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.239 

speed<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.049> it<00:01:16.200> seems<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.469> be<00:01:16.590> stuck<00:01:16.859> on<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.039> one

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
speed so it seems to be stuck on a one

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.950 
speed so it seems to be stuck on a one
speed<00:01:17.659> obviously<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.749> to<00:01:18.810> lower<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.170> down

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.709 

I<00:01:23.390> can<00:01:24.390> turn<00:01:24.750> auto<00:01:26.450> obviously<00:01:27.450> it's<00:01:27.539> going<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
I can turn auto obviously it's going to

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:30.440 
I can turn auto obviously it's going to
set<00:01:27.959> for<00:01:28.200> 21<00:01:28.709> degrees<00:01:29.039> in<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.340> left<00:01:29.549> buddy<00:01:30.240> -

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
set for 21 degrees in the left buddy -

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.959 
set for 21 degrees in the left buddy -
on<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:30.659> right<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:32.280> seems<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.729> work

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
on the right that seems to work

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.469 
on the right that seems to work
it<00:01:33.329> does<00:01:33.899> go<00:01:34.140> hot<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.439> cold<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.189> I'm<00:01:36.000> crank<00:01:36.329> it

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it does go hot and cold so I'm crank it

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.260 
it does go hot and cold so I'm crank it
right<00:01:36.659> up<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.170> then<00:01:38.270> crank<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.509> there

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270

and<00:01:47.260> yep<00:01:47.680> that's<00:01:48.010> warm<00:01:48.630> spine<00:01:49.630> so<00:01:49.990> it's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
and yep that's warm spine so it's

00:01:50.110 --> 00:02:00.169 
and yep that's warm spine so it's
obviously<00:01:50.380> working<00:01:52.050> press<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.230> down<00:01:53.350> again

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.120 

same<00:02:00.780> thing<00:02:01.020> again<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.679> hear<00:02:01.829> me<00:02:02.009> it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
same thing again if you can hear me it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.459 
same thing again if you can hear me it's
a<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.429> wind<00:02:02.640> tunnel<00:02:03.109> that's<00:02:04.109> the<00:02:04.259> way<00:02:04.409> to

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
a bit of a wind tunnel that's the way to

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.830 
a bit of a wind tunnel that's the way to
get<00:02:04.649> rid<00:02:04.979> of<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.359> fit<00:02:07.670> yeah<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.060> turn<00:02:09.720> the

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
get rid of it fit yeah so you turn the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.880 
get rid of it fit yeah so you turn the
AC<00:02:09.959> off<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:11.340> makes<00:02:12.209> no<00:02:12.450> difference

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.080 

turn<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.040> also<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:18.660> no<00:02:18.930> difference<00:02:20.090> that

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
turn the also on and no difference that

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.650 
turn the also on and no difference that
works

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
works

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.799 
works
I<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:22.470> circulate
