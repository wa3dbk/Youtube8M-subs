00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.730
 and good 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.640
 9 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.799
 good as all number 10 would come what 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.930
 would be the dice something that many people already 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.119
 already forgotten and simply consists of 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.520
 the moment I entered that ration nothing 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.099
 more enter enter the lottery and 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.140
 bet is the maximum for the number one 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.609
 the number one the truth that he has an 80 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.260
 percent of credit possibility that 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.150
 it is the truth that many possibilities of 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.280
 that even this time I will 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.500
 try with two characters and good nothing 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.739
 the simply go to the store to what would be 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.140
 to dice and bet the maximum to number 1 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.820
 that usually plays almost always because nothing 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.180
 this is number 10 and we go with 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.180
 following 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.430
 as number 9 we would have already what would be 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.560
 have chaos with just 3 points of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.790
 chaos in state is already a bit complicated 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.040
 because this time already 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.980
 we will need cash because we will need 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.780
 have the power users that costs first 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.780
 6,000 of casquero we can find in 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.210
 existing and as a second we would need 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.040
 a main weapon which takes away a 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.750
 point of chaos with this would already be that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.820
 we would need 4 points of chaos but 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.580
 to be able to need 3 points of chaos already 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.080
 would be the next for the last one that 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 we would need for her to be able to reduce 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.790
 our requests to have chaos to 3 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.890
 it would simply be to buy the power pack 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.259
 that costs 4,000 of cash that we have 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.900
 same in existing and to buy this 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.310
 they simply give us a necklace that 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.899
 called la chaux night and well they give us 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 other advantages more but I 'm not going to 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.290
 put to talk a little bit of your advantage 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.149
 because it would waste a lot of time and they can 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.399
 simply give the power pack also you 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.530
 potions daily while not 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.570
 expire you are giving positions and good 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.820
 the possibility that causes you nike that is 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.490
 this goya is simply that it reduces you 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.500
 the point of chaos to one and with this already 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.450
 we would have simply need 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.230
 three points of chaos for sport 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.450
 markets 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.340
 and good ah to be able to have chaos 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.780
 round simply what would be missing would be 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.600
 put him in shock 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 put 3 points of chaos but it would not 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.040
 it's still necessary to share it with houses because 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.290
 be power pack they will send you 30 each 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.400
 day and then I just think that 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.990
 would have for each day and then nothing 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.940
 simply here it ends with the 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.940
 number 9 and we go with the next 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.349
 ah 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.060
 well the tip of the round is already one of 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.230
 the slightly simple ones just you 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.239
 I'll give an example to see when 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.129
 you can use it at the moment for example 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.099
 that wants to qualify an armor to a 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.720
 same color and they do not usually touch you in the 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.489
 color you want simply instead of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.340
 be spending five thousand and five thousand of 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.519
 gold what it would be would send you the same 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.709
 random die with I think there are 450 of that 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.360
 It costs the gold stand and you send it to 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.690
 your same name and at the time of 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:54.030
 receive it as a gift is run where 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.459
 I would have changed color now that this 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.739
 it's very simple to do and well I give it 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.930
 here as an example that changes color 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.079
 and then nothing is going with the next 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.079
 tic 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.400
 many times this sound has 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.400
 troubled 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.870
 as much will have happened already that that 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.849
 sound the truth that it gets a little 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.069
 annoyed when you are texting 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.200
 with some person and good simply 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.299
 in this tip I will teach the form of 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.629
 remove it forever previously for 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:38.010
 always and it is simply to go to 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:39.810
 volume control and we click on it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.879
 right this is for windows 7 good 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.950
 for windows xp is pretty much what 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.450
 same only that it has characteristics a 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.189
 a little bit different but they are not 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.900
 very different the truth and simply 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.540
 we would give him right click on the sound 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.609
 that and we simply give sound and 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.889
 where we see we look for the beat property 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.510
 predetermined and this time as 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.510
 we see is the sound of the bell 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.630
 and we can change either the 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.490
 sound but good still will be 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.050
 annoyed because of the sharp sound you want if 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.900
 you want you can put a sound that is 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.520
 less annoying or as you prefer but 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.860
 good to remove it we simply have 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.630
 that we go to the first option that would be 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.359
 at the top that practically 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.250
 says none we give that option and 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.160
 just after that we would give to 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.990
 apply and we would accept that it be applied and 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.980
 that way we would no longer have the 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.270
 beep sound 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.270
 every time we message 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.990
 well other tips that maybe one of 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:40.759
 the most used is simply that of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.699
 put the panoramic view this the truth 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.340
 which is very simple I already taught it 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.439
 in another video but it does practically a 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.729
 year but good for those who have not 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:51.469
 aware how to put the panoramic view 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.779
 I'm going to explain, we just have 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:56.210
 that go to the property of de ratio and 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:57.169
 give you open location to see the 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.539
 location where the 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:01.550
 excel application and we're just going 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.409
 to the section that says scripts and how 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.090
 we see there is a section that comes out 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.430
 persie system with I do not know how to 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.719
 pronounces but simply that if it is that 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.099
 it is not open with notebook what 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.139
 We open with a notebook and 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:14.750
 we just go to the party 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.629
 lower as low as possible and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.370
 we'll see in a site that puts 60 this 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.770
 means that they have in view of a 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.159
 60 degrees but good just you 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.750
 we change the view to 90 of 90 and it would be 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:29.930
 a little further 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.580
 then it would be 70 good the option that you 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.129
 you want, I just put it 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.990
 normally in 70 and the truth that I 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.060
 like to put a 70 and then nothing 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.849
 simply this was a simple example 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.420
 that many people already know this but 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.670
 good for those who 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.670
 they knew we were already with the next 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.360
 well this is a tips the truth that is 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.220
 very basic is simply press the 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.590
 key f 12 while we are in a 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.110
 heading and pressing the f 12 key we 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.030
 will show the profile of the good person 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.949
 this is simply out of curiosity 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.780
 if for example someone is using women 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.220
 here and you are the master and you want to know 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.310
 who is you can use this method 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.520
 simply to expel the room and already 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.520
 is
