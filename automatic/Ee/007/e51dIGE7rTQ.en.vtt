i'm talking about but right now I just
want<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.480> talk<00:00:39.780> about<00:00:39.809> how<00:00:40.110> Kill<00:00:40.680> Confirmed<00:00:40.710> is

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
want to talk about how Kill Confirmed is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.209 
want to talk about how Kill Confirmed is
probably<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.899> easiest<00:00:42.930> game<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.710> rank<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.010> in

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
probably the easiest game to rank up in

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.279 
probably the easiest game to rank up in
and<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> high<00:00:44.820> score<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.270> minute<00:00:45.480> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
and get a high score for a minute and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.600 
and get a high score for a minute and
all<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.590> sort<00:00:46.800> of<00:00:46.920> stuff<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.280> that's<00:00:47.399> just

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
all that sort of stuff and that's just

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.029 
all that sort of stuff and that's just
because<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.239> can<00:00:49.020> run<00:00:49.050> through<00:00:49.379> tags<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.950> get

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
because you can run through tags and get

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.819 
because you can run through tags and get
100<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.789> 100<00:00:51.719> score<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.110> each<00:00:52.260> tag<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.649> pick

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
100 the 100 score from each tag you pick

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.189 
100 the 100 score from each tag you pick
up<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:53.910> there<00:00:54.210> 100<00:00:54.629> points

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
up like you see right there 100 points

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.900 
up like you see right there 100 points
for<00:00:55.230> confirming<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.890> kill<00:00:56.070> they<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.820> even

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
for confirming the kill they don't even

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.279 
for confirming the kill they don't even
have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.360> tags<00:00:57.600> they<00:00:57.840> can<00:00:57.870> be<00:00:58.050> someone

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
have to be your tags they can be someone

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.599 
have to be your tags they can be someone
else's<00:00:58.500> tags<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.890> long<00:00:59.039> as<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.250> pick<00:00:59.370> them<00:00:59.520> up

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
else's tags as long as you pick them up

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.360 
else's tags as long as you pick them up
so<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.870> you're<00:01:01.079> picking<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.530> tags<00:01:01.800> getting

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so if you're picking up tags getting

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.469 
so if you're picking up tags getting
kills<00:01:03.170> calling<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.580> UAV<00:01:05.580> counter<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> be

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
kills calling in your UAV counter you be

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.929 
kills calling in your UAV counter you be

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
in blackboard getting assists from that

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.830 
in blackboard getting assists from that
it's<00:01:08.939> pretty<00:01:09.600> fast<00:01:09.930> rank<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.470> pretty<00:01:10.710> fast<00:01:11.840> to

keep your high score per minute it's
better<00:01:17.880> than<00:01:18.060> domination<00:01:18.720> only<00:01:19.140> because

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
better than domination only because

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.230 
better than domination only because

that's<00:01:35.850> why<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.000> recommend<00:01:36.450> using<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.869> support

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's why I recommend using the support

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.050 
that's why I recommend using the support
streaks<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> get<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.070> lot<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.310> points<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
streaks as you get a lot more points you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.149 
streaks as you get a lot more points you
make<00:01:39.810> out<00:01:39.960> faster<00:01:40.409> keep<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.710> higher<00:01:40.829> score<00:01:41.009> per

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
make out faster keep a higher score per

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.260 
make out faster keep a higher score per
minute<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.549> all<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.939> sort<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.210> stuff

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
minute so that all that sort of stuff

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
minute so that all that sort of stuff
but<00:01:43.200> um<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.920> I've<00:01:44.040> been<00:01:44.159> doing<00:01:44.340> recently<00:01:44.729> is

calling it like after though the first

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.390 
calling it like after though the first
season<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.530> trial<00:02:29.770> season<00:02:30.100> now<00:02:30.190> this<00:02:30.340> is

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
season was a trial season now this is

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400 
season was a trial season now this is
like<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.610> first<00:02:30.790> real<00:02:30.910> season<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.630> have<00:02:32.110> five

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
like the first real season I have five

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.170 
like the first real season I have five
losses<00:02:32.710> and<00:02:33.510> I<00:02:34.510> think<00:02:34.720> I'm<00:02:34.810> like<00:02:35.370> 17<00:02:36.370> wins<00:02:36.790> I

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
losses and I think I'm like 17 wins I

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.290 
losses and I think I'm like 17 wins I
could<00:02:37.330> be<00:02:37.420> wrong<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.280> for<00:02:39.280> those<00:02:39.460> losses<00:02:39.790> are

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
could be wrong but for those losses are

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.750 
could be wrong but for those losses are
to<00:02:40.810> host<00:02:41.110> dashboards<00:02:41.860> which<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.310> very

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
to host dashboards which is very

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.640 
to host dashboards which is very
annoying<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.720> get<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> loss<00:02:44.200> for<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.590> you

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
annoying and you get a loss for and you

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.040 
annoying and you get a loss for and you
lose<00:02:44.830> points<00:02:45.160> for<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:45.670> ladder<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.870> just

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
lose points for your ladder and it just

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.010 
lose points for your ladder and it just
dropped<00:02:47.260> your<00:02:47.410> rank<00:02:47.620> from<00:02:47.800> losing<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:49.020> you

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
dropped your rank from losing and you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.360 
dropped your rank from losing and you
know<00:02:50.140> that's<00:02:50.320> super-annoying<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:51.040> have<00:02:51.160> one

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
know that's super-annoying I have one

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.730 
know that's super-annoying I have one
legitimate<00:02:51.760> loss<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.170> should<00:02:53.440> be<00:02:53.530> ranked

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
legitimate loss so I should be ranked

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.300 
legitimate loss so I should be ranked
pretty<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:54.580> lot<00:02:54.790> higher<00:02:55.000> than<00:02:55.060> i<00:02:55.360> actually<00:02:55.510> am

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
pretty a lot higher than i actually am

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.000 
pretty a lot higher than i actually am
even<00:02:57.310> though<00:02:57.400> rank<00:02:57.910> and<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:59.470> league<00:02:59.740> pretty

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
even though rank and in league pretty

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.430 
even though rank and in league pretty
much<00:03:00.130> goes<00:03:00.430> by<00:03:00.640> whoever<00:03:01.510> plays<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:01.960> most<00:03:02.110> but

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
much goes by whoever plays the most but

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.980 
much goes by whoever plays the most but
you<00:03:02.530> do<00:03:02.680> have<00:03:02.830> to<00:03:02.890> win<00:03:03.220> still<00:03:03.610> but<00:03:03.870> when<00:03:04.870> you're

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
you do have to win still but when you're

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.020 
you do have to win still but when you're
constantly<00:03:05.170> getting<00:03:05.650> dashboard<00:03:06.250> on<00:03:06.490> just

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
constantly getting dashboard on just

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.370 
constantly getting dashboard on just
because<00:03:08.340> excuse<00:03:09.340> me<00:03:09.490> the<00:03:10.360> host<00:03:10.570> just<00:03:10.990> decides

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.780 
that he wants is Katie do you remain the
same<00:03:15.430> care<00:03:16.270> about<00:03:16.570> is<00:03:16.690> 1.5<00:03:17.290> Katie<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:18.670> know

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
same care about is 1.5 Katie you know

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.290 
same care about is 1.5 Katie you know
it's<00:03:18.940> kind<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.180> lame<00:03:19.390> but<00:03:20.670> you<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.910> host<00:03:22.090> gets

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
it's kind of lame but you the host gets

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.300 
it's kind of lame but you the host gets
a<00:03:22.420> lost<00:03:22.630> too<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.290> there's<00:03:23.470> really<00:03:23.560> no<00:03:23.830> point<00:03:24.040> to

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
a lost too so there's really no point to

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.040 
a lost too so there's really no point to
dashboarding<00:03:24.850> just<00:03:25.060> stay<00:03:25.240> in<00:03:25.420> take<00:03:25.870> your
