gig bag that pedal train sends along
that<00:00:28.529> adds<00:00:28.710> another<00:00:28.800> couple<00:00:29.310> inches<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.880> all

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
that adds another couple inches to all

those dimensions and the gig bank also

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.130 
those dimensions and the gig bank also
has<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.000> front<00:00:33.270> pocket<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.899> put<00:00:34.110> a

has this front pocket that you can put a
volume<00:00:34.559> pedal<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> obviously<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.520> can't

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
volume pedal and obviously you can't

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.750 
volume pedal and obviously you can't
really<00:00:36.059> stack<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.780> your<00:00:36.960> pedal<00:00:37.230> on<00:00:37.440> this

really stack of all your pedal on this
pedal<00:00:38.760> board<00:00:38.940> it's<00:00:39.090> mostly<00:00:39.450> designed<00:00:39.780> for

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
pedal board it's mostly designed for

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
pedal board it's mostly designed for
people<00:00:40.170> who<00:00:40.320> might<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.860> gig<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.640> they

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
people who might have a gig and they

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
people who might have a gig and they
need<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> grab-and-go<00:00:42.809> board<00:00:43.320> something<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
need a grab-and-go board something that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.040 
need a grab-and-go board something that
might<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.190> between<00:00:44.730> three<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> seven

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
might have between three to seven

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.920 
might have between three to seven
effects<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.190> fit<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.570> more<00:00:48.780> on

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
effects on it I fit a little bit more on

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
effects on it I fit a little bit more on
here<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.289> time<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> time<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.280> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
here from time to time but it's it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.100 
here from time to time but it's it
starts<00:00:50.879> getting<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.210> cumbersome<00:00:51.899> when

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
starts getting a little cumbersome when

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
starts getting a little cumbersome when
you're<00:00:52.260> trying<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> push<00:00:52.680> those<00:00:52.860> pedals<00:00:53.250> on

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
you're trying to push those pedals on

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.209 
you're trying to push those pedals on
something<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.649> mainly<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> reason<00:00:55.980> I

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
something like this mainly the reason I

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
something like this mainly the reason I
got<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> pedal<00:00:56.789> train<00:00:57.030> mini<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.539> because<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
got the pedal train mini was because it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.139 
got the pedal train mini was because it
sort<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.350> fits<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> requirements<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> most

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
sort of fits the requirements of most

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
sort of fits the requirements of most

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
airlines carry-on baggage restrictions

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.880 
airlines carry-on baggage restrictions
you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.719> kind<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.140> away<00:01:04.170> with<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.619> being

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
you can kind of get away with this being

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950 
you can kind of get away with this being
a<00:01:04.979> personal<00:01:05.460> item<00:01:05.610> even<00:01:05.909> though<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> personal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
a personal item even though the personal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.810 
a personal item even though the personal
item<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.290> technically<00:01:07.740> supposed<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.220> 17

inches<00:01:09.240> long<00:01:09.740> I've<00:01:10.740> never<00:01:10.979> had<00:01:11.189> an<00:01:11.340> airline

measure<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> thank<00:01:13.650> goodness<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.250> maybe

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
measure that thank goodness but maybe

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.620 
measure that thank goodness but maybe
we'll<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.570> days

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we'll get to that one of these days

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.649 
we'll get to that one of these days
hopefully<00:01:16.049> not<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:17.280> was<00:01:17.700> using<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.150> pedal<00:01:18.420> board

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
hopefully not I was using a pedal board

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.480 
hopefully not I was using a pedal board
that<00:01:18.960> was<00:01:19.170> maybe<00:01:19.380> about<00:01:19.530> five<00:01:19.799> times<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> size

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
that was maybe about five times the size

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.510 
that was maybe about five times the size
of<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> 27<00:01:22.049> inch<00:01:22.170> by<00:01:22.470> 22<00:01:23.130> inch<00:01:23.340> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of this is like a 27 inch by 22 inch and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
of this is like a 27 inch by 22 inch and
it<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.330> was<00:01:24.479> too<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.960> me<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.080> handle

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
it just was too much for me to handle

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.410 
it just was too much for me to handle
checking<00:01:25.950> that<00:01:26.130> item<00:01:26.850> along<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.270> my

checking that item along with my
suitcase<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:28.170> addition<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.920> guitars<00:01:29.280> was

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
suitcase in addition to the guitars was

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
suitcase in addition to the guitars was
just<00:01:29.759> costing<00:01:30.150> me<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.270> fortune<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.259> got<00:01:31.770> this

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979

here and it's been a really a real handy
tool<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:18.500> me<00:02:18.770> onstage<00:02:18.920> just<00:02:19.280> managing

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
tool for me onstage just managing

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.330

getting my pedals on and off
I<00:02:22.370> guess<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.180> it's<00:02:23.570> about<00:02:23.870> enough<00:02:24.200> pedals

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
I guess it's it's about enough pedals

them all separately and string them all

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.220 
them all separately and string them all
together<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.430> it's<00:02:28.610> so<00:02:28.970> convenient<00:02:29.420> when<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
together but it's so convenient when you

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.860
