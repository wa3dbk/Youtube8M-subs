that's<00:04:07.040> how<00:04:07.129> it<00:04:07.190> works<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:07.840> it's<00:04:08.840> not

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
that's how it works and it's not

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.930 
that's how it works and it's not
everything<00:04:09.440> but<00:04:09.470> it's<00:04:09.769> like<00:04:09.980> a<00:04:10.190> good<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.790> know

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
everything but it's like a good you know

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.940 
everything but it's like a good you know
amount<00:04:11.239> of<00:04:11.390> things<00:04:11.569> and<00:04:11.959> if<00:04:12.530> you<00:04:12.650> go<00:04:12.769> there

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
amount of things and if you go there

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.979 
amount of things and if you go there
it'll<00:04:13.129> say<00:04:13.400> like<00:04:13.579> 101<00:04:14.150> fail<00:04:14.359> and<00:04:14.599> I<00:04:14.629> think<00:04:14.870> it's

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
it'll say like 101 fail and I think it's

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.909 
I don't need that much art support so as
I<00:05:26.510> was<00:05:26.539> running<00:05:26.840> into<00:05:27.229> like<00:05:27.349> my<00:05:27.500> third<00:05:27.740> and

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
I was running into like my third and

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.850 
I was running into like my third and
fourth<00:05:28.190> mile<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:29.270> was<00:05:29.510> starting<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.260> like<00:05:30.500> get

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
fourth mile it was starting to like get

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.969 
fourth mile it was starting to like get
really<00:05:31.130> really<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.940> little<00:05:32.419> like<00:05:32.599> painful<00:05:33.199> for

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
really really a little like painful for

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.330 
really really a little like painful for
me<00:05:34.010> just<00:05:34.430> because<00:05:34.490> you<00:05:35.150> know<00:05:35.300> I'm<00:05:35.419> used<00:05:35.660> to

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
me just because you know I'm used to

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.860 
me just because you know I'm used to
like<00:05:37.340> I'm<00:05:37.520> not<00:05:37.639> used<00:05:37.880> to<00:05:37.970> that<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.479> I<00:05:38.810> don't

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
like I'm not used to that and I don't

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.779 
like I'm not used to that and I don't
think<00:05:39.199> I<00:05:39.289> really<00:05:39.590> you<00:05:39.770> know<00:05:39.800> need<00:05:40.310> that<00:05:40.520> and<00:05:40.760> I

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
think I really you know need that and I

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.170 
think I really you know need that and I
haven't<00:05:41.479> really<00:05:42.139> researched<00:05:42.380> with<00:05:42.830> pseudos

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
haven't really researched with pseudos

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.589 
haven't really researched with pseudos
quite<00:05:44.180> as<00:05:44.330> much<00:05:44.539> as<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:45.229> have<00:05:45.410> um<00:05:46.240> asics<00:05:47.240> but

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
quite as much as I have um asics but

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:51.459 
quite as much as I have um asics but
maybe<00:05:48.590> it's<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.610> case<00:05:50.300> where<00:05:50.599> they<00:05:50.810> have<00:05:51.020> a<00:05:51.050> shoe

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
maybe it's a case where they have a shoe

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:54.130 
maybe it's a case where they have a shoe
that<00:05:51.500> doesn't<00:05:52.130> have<00:05:52.280> that<00:05:52.490> kind<00:05:53.240> of<00:05:53.479> support

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.140 
that doesn't have that kind of support

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:57.670 
that doesn't have that kind of support
on<00:05:54.530> your<00:05:54.560> art<00:05:55.490> and<00:05:56.229> you<00:05:57.229> know<00:05:57.349> they<00:05:57.530> probably

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
on your art and you know they probably

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.440 
on your art and you know they probably
helped<00:05:58.010> like<00:05:58.099> a<00:05:58.130> ton<00:05:58.370> of<00:05:58.400> models<00:05:58.640> and<00:05:58.969> is<00:05:59.300> just

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
helped like a ton of models and is just

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.480 
helped like a ton of models and is just
like<00:05:59.659> that<00:06:00.169> model<00:06:00.620> is<00:06:00.680> probably<00:06:01.010> just<00:06:01.250> not<00:06:01.340> the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
like that model is probably just not the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.709 
like that model is probably just not the
one<00:06:01.610> for<00:06:01.789> me<00:06:01.849> so<00:06:03.070> I'm<00:06:04.070> honestly<00:06:04.820> like<00:06:05.090> I<00:06:05.300> really

00:06:05.709 --> 00:06:05.719 
one for me so I'm honestly like I really

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:07.300 
one for me so I'm honestly like I really
really<00:06:05.930> like<00:06:06.140> the<00:06:06.440> shoe<00:06:06.650> other<00:06:06.919> hand<00:06:07.159> mill

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.270 
really like the shoe other hand mill
park<00:06:07.610> so<00:06:08.510> I'm<00:06:08.960> going<00:06:09.020> to<00:06:09.260> try<00:06:09.409> to<00:06:09.440> probably

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 
park so I'm going to try to probably

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.940 
park so I'm going to try to probably
later<00:06:10.880> tonight<00:06:11.240> or<00:06:11.270> tomorrow<00:06:11.719> something<00:06:12.139> look

later tonight or tomorrow something look

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.350 
later tonight or tomorrow something look
around<00:06:13.070> and<00:06:13.370> see<00:06:13.580> if<00:06:13.610> I<00:06:13.820> can<00:06:14.000> find<00:06:14.120> something

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.420 
around and see if I can find something
without<00:06:14.570> that<00:06:14.900> arc<00:06:15.110> I'm<00:06:15.950> actually<00:06:16.130> going<00:06:16.340> to

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
without that arc I'm actually going to

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.339 
without that arc I'm actually going to
go<00:06:16.460> running<00:06:16.760> right<00:06:17.060> now<00:06:17.090> so<00:06:17.659> I'm<00:06:17.960> going<00:06:18.200> to<00:06:18.229> try

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
go running right now so I'm going to try
