00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
looking terrible now if we were to just

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.109 
looking terrible now if we were to just
use<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> Move<00:00:22.439> tool<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.830> move<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.670> selection

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
use the Move tool to move a selection

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.250 
use the Move tool to move a selection
let's<00:00:24.480> just<00:00:24.660> quickly<00:00:24.840> select<00:00:25.170> our<00:00:25.470> bird<00:00:25.710> here

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
okay you can see he's selected very

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.940 
okay you can see he's selected very
roughly<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> over<00:00:34.079> here<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.680> left

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
roughly if we go over here on the left

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.520 
roughly if we go over here on the left
and<00:00:35.190> use<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> Move<00:00:35.730> tool<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.140> see<00:00:37.350> we're

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
and use the Move tool you can see we're

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530 
and use the Move tool you can see we're
left<00:00:37.710> with<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:37.980> great<00:00:38.370> big<00:00:38.700> hole<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
left with this great big hole in the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.530 
left with this great big hole in the
middle<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> screen<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.530> nothing<00:00:40.950> blends

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
middle of the screen and nothing blends

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.270 
middle of the screen and nothing blends
correctly<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.100> it's<00:00:44.100> obvious<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:46.070> has<00:00:47.070> been

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
correctly and it's obvious that has been

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.910 
correctly and it's obvious that has been
moved<00:00:47.579> using<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.690> content<00:00:49.200> aware<00:00:49.379> move<00:00:49.620> tool

moved using the content aware move tool

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.060 
moved using the content aware move tool
is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:50.969> way<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.899> certain<00:00:52.320> situations

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is a way that in certain situations

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a way that in certain situations
you're<00:00:53.550> able<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.910> move<00:00:54.270> objects<00:00:55.260> around<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
you're able to move objects around or

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.200 
some different modes and there's an
adaptation<00:01:22.250> so<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.820> mode<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:25.409> moved

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
adaptation so the mode we want is moved

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.270 
adaptation so the mode we want is moved
because<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.509> want<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> move<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
because we want to move this to the

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.969 
because we want to move this to the
other<00:01:29.430> part<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> picture<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.780> the

other part of the picture and the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
other part of the picture and the
adaptation<00:01:31.979> we<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.579> applies<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> how

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
adaptation we want this applies to how

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.050 
adaptation we want this applies to how
much<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.799> edge<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.100> we've<00:01:35.610> drawn<00:01:36.030> here

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
much of the edge that we've drawn here

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.520 
much of the edge that we've drawn here
in<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:36.600> selection<00:01:37.549> will<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.700> taken<00:01:39.150> away<00:01:39.530> now

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
in our selection will be taken away now

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.490 
in our selection will be taken away now
if<00:01:40.770> we<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.009> very<00:01:41.460> loose<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:42.810> could<00:01:43.020> be<00:01:43.170> quite

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
if we use very loose it could be quite

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.010 
if we use very loose it could be quite
aggressive<00:01:44.090> there's<00:01:45.090> another<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.840> some

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
aggressive there's another and some

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.630 
aggressive there's another and some
other<00:01:46.140> options<00:01:46.320> here<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:46.920> very<00:01:47.189> strict

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
other options here there's very strict

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.460 
other options here there's very strict
which<00:01:48.180> will<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.479> less<00:01:48.750> aggressive<00:01:49.350> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
which will be less aggressive and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.670 
which will be less aggressive and
everything<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.250> between<00:01:50.930> just<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.110> start<00:01:52.409> with

everything in between just to start with

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.590 
everything in between just to start with
we<00:01:53.250> might<00:01:53.490> use<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.060> very<00:01:54.509> strict<00:01:55.079> option<00:01:55.740> and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
we might use the very strict option and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
we might use the very strict option and
it's<00:01:57.600> ready<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:57.960> go<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.770> we're<00:01:58.950> gonna<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.310> is

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
it's ready to go what we're gonna do is

over<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:19.280> Photoshop<00:02:20.280> will<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> bit

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
over here and Photoshop will have a bit

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.410 
over here and Photoshop will have a bit
of<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.970> think<00:02:22.430> as<00:02:23.430> it's<00:02:23.670> working<00:02:23.820> out<00:02:24.150> exactly

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
of a think as it's working out exactly

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.830 
of a think as it's working out exactly
where<00:02:24.960> everything<00:02:25.260> needs<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.710> go<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.840> just

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
where everything needs to go and just

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
where everything needs to go and just
like<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.560> got<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.740> great<00:02:29.040> result<00:02:29.250> first

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
like that we got a great result first

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.060 
like that we got a great result first
time<00:02:30.030> you<00:02:30.540> can<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.960> that<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:31.980> original

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
time you can see that the original

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.180 
time you can see that the original
picture<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.910> gone<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.660> blending<00:02:34.290> from<00:02:34.920> where

he was standing I'm just gonna zoom in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.900 
he was standing I'm just gonna zoom in
is<00:02:38.790> great<00:02:39.420> look<00:02:40.350> at<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:41.340> can't<00:02:41.610> tell

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
now let's have a look around the edge of

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.320 
now let's have a look around the edge of
our<00:02:47.700> selection<00:02:48.210> here<00:02:48.390> let's<00:02:48.600> just<00:02:48.810> zoom<00:02:48.870> in

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
our selection here let's just zoom in

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.400 
our selection here let's just zoom in
and<00:02:51.330> we'll<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.510> move<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.080> little<00:02:52.290> bit

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
and we'll just move up a little bit

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.360 
and we'll just move up a little bit
let's<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.770> at<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> top<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:55.500> what<00:02:56.010> we<00:02:56.160> want<00:02:56.310> to

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
let's look at the top so what we want to

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.449 
let's look at the top so what we want to
do<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.760> we're<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.030> going<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.360> deselect<00:02:57.750> this

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
do is we're just going to deselect this

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
now you can see that there's still a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.490 
now you can see that there's still a
little<00:03:02.490> bit<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:03.090> blending<00:03:03.630> issue<00:03:03.810> here<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.350> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
little bit of blending issue here on the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.740 
little bit of blending issue here on the
left<00:03:04.740> but<00:03:05.459> look<00:03:05.670> at<00:03:05.760> this<00:03:05.910> on<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> right<00:03:06.360> look

left but look at this on the right look

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.380 
left but look at this on the right look
how<00:03:06.900> smooth<00:03:07.230> that<00:03:07.440> is<00:03:07.620> okay<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:08.910> what<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.239> might

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
how smooth that is okay so what we might

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.610 
how smooth that is okay so what we might
need<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:11.340> get<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> selection<00:03:12.120> back

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
okay let's move him with one of these

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.690 
okay let's move him with one of these
different<00:03:22.470> options<00:03:22.590> here<00:03:22.980> instead<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.400> trying

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
different options here instead of trying

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.590 
different options here instead of trying
very<00:03:23.940> strict

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
very strict

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.380 
very strict
let's<00:03:25.290> try<00:03:25.650> very<00:03:26.280> loose<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.880> see<00:03:27.239> what

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
let's try very loose and see what

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.509 
let's try very loose and see what
happens<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.890> just<00:03:29.040> gonna<00:03:29.130> move<00:03:29.340> him

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
across okay and we'll put him about

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.220 
across okay and we'll put him about
there

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
there

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.449 
there
butter<00:03:37.040> shop<00:03:37.310> will<00:03:37.430> have<00:03:37.459> a<00:03:37.580> bit<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.849> a<00:03:37.940> think

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.240 

great<00:03:44.090> okay<00:03:44.599> so<00:03:45.049> you<00:03:45.140> can<00:03:45.469> see<00:03:45.500> immediately

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
great okay so you can see immediately

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.369 
great okay so you can see immediately
two<00:03:46.609> things<00:03:46.879> have<00:03:47.030> happened<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.840> first<00:03:48.109> thing

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
two things have happened the first thing

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.459 
two things have happened the first thing
is<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.920> he<00:03:49.430> well<00:03:49.969> he's<00:03:50.150> lost<00:03:50.329> his<00:03:50.540> feet<00:03:50.870> his

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:51.469 
is that he well he's lost his feet his

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:53.050 
is that he well he's lost his feet his
feet<00:03:51.709> have<00:03:51.829> disappeared<00:03:52.310> somewhere<00:03:52.579> and<00:03:52.939> the

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
feet have disappeared somewhere and the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.849 
feet have disappeared somewhere and the
second<00:03:53.450> thing<00:03:53.629> is<00:03:53.870> that<00:03:53.900> some<00:03:54.290> of<00:03:54.319> you<00:03:54.590> the

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
second thing is that some of you the

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.699 
second thing is that some of you the
original<00:03:55.370> picture<00:03:55.909> has<00:03:56.599> remained<00:03:57.019> over<00:03:57.409> here

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
original picture has remained over here

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.740 
original picture has remained over here
so<00:03:58.159> very<00:03:58.459> loose<00:03:58.700> was<00:03:58.909> probably<00:03:59.269> a<00:03:59.299> little<00:03:59.569> bit

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
so very loose was probably a little bit

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.289 
so very loose was probably a little bit
too<00:03:59.900> aggressive<00:03:59.989> that's<00:04:00.739> okay<00:04:01.159> we<00:04:01.849> don't<00:04:02.060> have

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
too aggressive that's okay we don't have

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.479 
too aggressive that's okay we don't have
to<00:04:02.420> undo<00:04:02.750> everything<00:04:03.049> at<00:04:03.319> this<00:04:03.439> stage<00:04:03.739> we're

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
to undo everything at this stage we're

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.490 
to undo everything at this stage we're
able<00:04:04.579> to<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:05.000> click<00:04:05.180> up<00:04:05.329> here<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:05.870> try<00:04:06.409> a

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
able to just click up here and try a

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.470 
able to just click up here and try a
different<00:04:06.620> setting<00:04:07.159> now<00:04:07.700> I've<00:04:07.879> chosen<00:04:08.090> medium

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
different setting now I've chosen medium

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.429 
different setting now I've chosen medium
from<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.049> list

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
from the list

feet area and this section over here and

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.360 
feet area and this section over here and
as<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.260> can<00:04:15.349> see<00:04:15.530> that's<00:04:15.650> a<00:04:15.769> lot<00:04:15.919> better<00:04:16.160> he's

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
as you can see that's a lot better he's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.129 
as you can see that's a lot better he's
still<00:04:16.639> missing<00:04:16.789> some<00:04:17.150> feet<00:04:17.419> so<00:04:17.930> in<00:04:18.049> this

visible to me I can't see any trace of
any<00:05:20.710> kind<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.129> blending<00:05:21.580> at<00:05:21.669> all

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
any kind of blending at all

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.540 
any kind of blending at all
let's<00:05:22.569> just<00:05:22.719> go<00:05:22.840> down<00:05:23.020> here<00:05:23.050> and<00:05:23.590> have<00:05:24.400> a<00:05:24.430> look

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
let's just go down here and have a look

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.520 
let's just go down here and have a look
at<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.729> feet<00:05:24.909> the<00:05:25.090> feet<00:05:25.330> are<00:05:25.539> perfect<00:05:25.719> in<00:05:26.169> fact

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
at the feet the feet are perfect in fact

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.529 
at the feet the feet are perfect in fact
all<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.979> ground<00:05:27.280> has<00:05:28.090> been<00:05:28.300> blended

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
all the ground has been blended

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.950 
all the ground has been blended
beautifully<00:05:29.080> around<00:05:29.889> here<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:31.090> has<00:05:31.360> captured

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
beautifully around here it has captured

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.770 
beautifully around here it has captured
a<00:05:32.319> little<00:05:32.620> bit<00:05:32.740> of<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:32.979> dirt<00:05:33.219> there<00:05:33.780> but

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
a little bit of the dirt there but

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.990 
a little bit of the dirt there but
actually<00:05:34.960> it<00:05:35.560> all<00:05:35.800> looks<00:05:35.979> very<00:05:36.069> smooth<00:05:36.759> and

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
actually it all looks very smooth and

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.330 
actually it all looks very smooth and
very<00:05:37.509> natural<00:05:38.110> and<00:05:38.289> overall<00:05:38.740> I<00:05:38.770> think<00:05:39.129> it<00:05:39.219> was

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
very natural and overall I think it was

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.779 
very natural and overall I think it was
a<00:05:39.370> very<00:05:39.639> good<00:05:39.879> result<00:05:40.800> we're<00:05:41.800> able<00:05:41.949> to<00:05:42.310> try<00:05:42.759> a

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
a very good result we're able to try a

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.459 
a very good result we're able to try a
different<00:05:43.090> setting<00:05:43.479> let's<00:05:43.689> try<00:05:43.930> very<00:05:44.199> loose

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
different setting let's try very loose

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.029 
different setting let's try very loose
and<00:05:45.750> let's<00:05:46.750> see<00:05:46.900> if<00:05:46.960> we<00:05:47.080> can<00:05:47.229> get<00:05:47.379> a<00:05:47.409> little<00:05:47.740> bit

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:48.039 
and let's see if we can get a little bit

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:51.809 
and let's see if we can get a little bit
better<00:05:48.279> of<00:05:49.120> a<00:05:49.449> result<00:05:49.750> here<00:05:50.080> so<00:05:50.819> Photoshop

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
better of a result here so Photoshop

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.379 
better of a result here so Photoshop
will<00:05:52.000> think<00:05:52.210> again<00:05:52.509> about<00:05:52.539> what<00:05:52.810> it's<00:05:53.080> doing

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
will think again about what it's doing

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.879 
will think again about what it's doing
and<00:05:55.389> we<00:05:55.539> really<00:05:55.930> want<00:05:56.080> to<00:05:56.110> focus<00:05:56.289> on<00:05:56.620> this<00:05:56.830> area

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
and we really want to focus on this area

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.550 
and we really want to focus on this area
here<00:05:57.550> near<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.849> legs<00:05:58.150> and<00:05:58.509> this<00:05:59.080> place<00:05:59.319> here

00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 
here near the legs and this place here

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:00.779 
here near the legs and this place here
where<00:05:59.680> he<00:05:59.830> was<00:05:59.949> standing<00:06:00.189> you<00:06:00.460> can<00:06:00.610> see

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:00.789 
where he was standing you can see
