00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
have loosened all these screws so we can

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.480 
have loosened all these screws so we can
lift<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.529> out<00:00:25.650> as<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> purpose<00:00:29.400> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
lift it out as is and the purpose of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.380

the<00:00:33.510> machine<00:00:33.840> how<00:00:34.350> dirty<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.610> get

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the machine how dirty it can get

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.860 
the machine how dirty it can get
but<00:00:36.870> because<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.160> owners<00:00:38.670> do<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.000> have<00:00:39.510> easy

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but because the owners do not have easy

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
but because the owners do not have easy
access<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> internal<00:00:41.460> parts<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:42.030> this

all<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:54.260> elements<00:00:55.260> they<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.219> clog<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
all these elements they can clog and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.139 
all these elements they can clog and
they<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.719> cause<00:00:57.989> leakage<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.739> water<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.460> then

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
they can cause leakage of water and then

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.650 
they can cause leakage of water and then
the<00:01:00.530> accumulation<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> calcium<00:01:02.660> deposits

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the accumulation of calcium deposits

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
the accumulation of calcium deposits
that<00:01:03.899> will<00:01:04.140> also<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.650> spilled<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.250> which<00:01:05.369> will

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that will also be spilled and which will

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.560 
that will also be spilled and which will
dry<00:01:05.790> out<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.270> white<00:01:07.110> powder<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:09.330> worst

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
dry out as white powder and the worst

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.760 
dry out as white powder and the worst
part<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> is<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:11.030> the<00:01:12.030> coffee<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.990> also

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
part of it is that the coffee is also

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.820 
part of it is that the coffee is also
liked<00:01:14.040> by<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.369> fungus<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.030> bacteria<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.530> when

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
liked by the fungus and bacteria so when

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.980 
liked by the fungus and bacteria so when
there<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.040> no<00:01:17.159> cleaning<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.540> internal

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
parts and the brew unit there will be a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.020 
parts and the brew unit there will be a
hazard<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.700> infections<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.689> buildup<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
hazard for infections and buildup of

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
hazard for infections and buildup of
fungus<00:01:27.030> now<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.140> brew<00:01:28.799> unit<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.610> will

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
fungus now in this brew unit as you will

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.499 
fungus now in this brew unit as you will
see<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.960> side<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.409> clean<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.310> when<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.240> turn

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
see the side is clean but when you turn

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
see the side is clean but when you turn
this<00:01:33.780> towards<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.560> brewing<00:01:35.369> section<00:01:35.900> then

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
this towards the brewing section then

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.499 
this towards the brewing section then
you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> see<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.770> bottom<00:01:41.520> portion<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.180> this

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
you can see the bottom portion of this

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.730 
you can see the bottom portion of this
that<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.770> drain<00:01:44.729> valve<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:46.290> drain<00:01:46.530> valve

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that has the drain valve the drain valve

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.580 
that has the drain valve the drain valve
is<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> most<00:01:47.430> filthy<00:01:47.990> part<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> brewing

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
is the most filthy part in the brewing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.889 
is the most filthy part in the brewing
unit<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.180> been<00:01:51.329> cleaned<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
unit because it has not been cleaned and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.749 
unit because it has not been cleaned and
there<00:01:52.380> has<00:01:52.530> been<00:01:52.560> some<00:01:52.950> leakage<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.579> have

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
there has been some leakage we have

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.080 
there has been some leakage we have
removed<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.979> outlet<00:01:56.509> teflon<00:01:57.509> tube<00:01:57.890> but

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
removed the the outlet teflon tube but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.859 
removed the the outlet teflon tube but
even<00:02:00.090> removing<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:02.060> drain<00:02:03.060> valve<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.630> not

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
even removing this drain valve is not

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.520 
even removing this drain valve is not
easy

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
easy

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069 
easy
if<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.700> maintenance<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.540> brew<00:02:06.840> group

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
if the maintenance of this brew group

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.219 
if the maintenance of this brew group
was<00:02:07.290> easy<00:02:07.530> then<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:07.920> would<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.220> wonderful<00:02:08.520> but

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
was easy then it would be wonderful but

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.180 
was easy then it would be wonderful but
unfortunately<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> very<00:02:10.770> complicated

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
unfortunately it is a very complicated

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.550 
unfortunately it is a very complicated
design

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
design

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.339 
design
it<00:02:12.890> needs<00:02:13.190> real<00:02:13.760> technical<00:02:14.239> expertise<00:02:15.050> and

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
it needs real technical expertise and

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.300 
it needs real technical expertise and
the<00:02:16.040> proper<00:02:16.400> tools<00:02:16.670> to<00:02:17.599> disassemble<00:02:18.500> for
