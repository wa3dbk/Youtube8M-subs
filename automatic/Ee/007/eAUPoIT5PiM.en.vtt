something<00:04:25.080> I<00:04:25.199> can<00:04:25.350> work<00:04:25.470> on<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.800> skill<00:04:26.130> with<00:04:26.250> a

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
something I can work on my skill with a

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:34.280 
something I can work on my skill with a
little<00:04:26.580> bit<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:29.190> same<00:04:29.400> time<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:34.110> game

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
little bit and the same time this game

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.750 
little bit and the same time this game
requires<00:04:34.440> a<00:04:34.680> lot<00:04:34.800> of<00:04:34.830> concentration<00:04:35.220> so

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
requires a lot of concentration so

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.760 
requires a lot of concentration so
probably<00:04:36.389> not<00:04:37.290> talking<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:37.889> much<00:04:37.919> as<00:04:38.160> I<00:04:38.250> should

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
probably not talking as much as I should

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.659 
probably not talking as much as I should

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
to do this for was pretty much simply to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.020 
to do this for was pretty much simply to
work<00:04:48.870> on<00:04:49.050> my<00:04:49.200> grandma<00:04:49.680> not<00:04:50.400> necessarily<00:04:50.910> my

work on my grandma not necessarily my

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.379 
work on my grandma not necessarily my

particular<00:04:57.690> need<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.260> be<00:04:58.650> better<00:04:58.949> at<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.190> but<00:04:59.580> I

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
particular need to be better at it but I

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.120 
particular need to be better at it but I
just<00:05:00.300> I<00:05:00.600> know<00:05:01.199> that<00:05:01.320> probably<00:05:01.410> frustrates<00:05:02.010> all

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
just I know that probably frustrates all

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.820 
just I know that probably frustrates all
my<00:05:02.220> friends<00:05:02.550> and<00:05:02.639> I<00:05:02.729> talked<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.210> mumble

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
my friends and I talked and I mumble

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.100 
my friends and I talked and I mumble
talk<00:05:04.830> way<00:05:05.100> too<00:05:05.130> fast<00:05:05.580> so<00:05:06.030> I<00:05:06.300> try<00:05:06.630> and<00:05:06.750> fix<00:05:06.900> that

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
talk way too fast so I try and fix that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.460 
talk way too fast so I try and fix that
and<00:05:07.169> I<00:05:07.680> think<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.979> good<00:05:08.010> way<00:05:08.160> to<00:05:08.310> do<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.789> to

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
and I think a good way to do that is to

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.080 
and I think a good way to do that is to
practice<00:05:10.470> your<00:05:10.800> speech<00:05:11.070> by<00:05:11.280> talking<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.850> na

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
practice your speech by talking to na

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.589 
practice your speech by talking to na
