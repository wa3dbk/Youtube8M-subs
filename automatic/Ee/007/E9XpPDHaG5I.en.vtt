the plies in the luan are affected by
the<00:02:00.509> water<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.229> then<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.909> luan<00:02:03.360> actually

the water and then the luan actually

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.219 
the water and then the luan actually
separates<00:02:05.280> internally<00:02:05.970> into<00:02:06.750> multiple

generally is okay in this example you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.070 
generally is okay in this example you
can<00:02:22.020> see<00:02:22.440> how<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.070> luan<00:02:23.520> has<00:02:23.900> separated<00:02:24.900> into

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
can see how the luan has separated into

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.970 
can see how the luan has separated into
