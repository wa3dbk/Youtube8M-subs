 gmbh and db losfee elisabeth kozlowski 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.520
 first, the parts of the jbbl moved 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.560
 with the teams of bayer leverkusen and 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.390
 in hamburg sharks are two teams 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.190

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 were able to complete the second position 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.220
 Nevertheless, on the way to Bamberg

 defender from paderborn tension 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.940
 So at the draw 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 the semifinals are coming up and one thing is clear 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.220
 it will be a final between the south 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.470
 and the north 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.110
 but what about in the NBBL one of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.850
 title candidate natural urspring zum 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.340
 Seventh time in the seventh year at the final 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 four doing four championships 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.989
 pay language is clear and the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.280
 defending champion from breitengüßbach has 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.820
 to have a say too 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.350
 still to meet in front of native scenery 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.010
 The two teams already in the semifinals 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.930
 on each other 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.930
 all eyes on the losv 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.160
 breitengüßbach original hagen and rsv 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.370
 about wehrmacht 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.910
 clear is the anticipation is great yes me 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.440
 believe that we are exciting in bamberg 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.410
 We see that we had a great time 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.700
 play in the preliminary rounds to a top 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.500
 funds of which certainly the best 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.349
 qualified teams which makes me very happy 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.000
 That is to choose nbbl with the location 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.920
 or ehrwalder location together mountain 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.220
 maybe proved a little foresight 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.850
 therefore have the jbbl team and the nbbl 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.510
 team from bamberg or breitengüßbach at 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.579
 top four ten would be ours 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.650
