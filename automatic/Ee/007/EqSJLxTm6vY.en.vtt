00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.910
 everything that has to do with a country already 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.610
 not in the process of development but also 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.560
 with sport at the first level of 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.470
 organization let's listen to it 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.009
 romario who was one of the protagonists 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.009
 of this conference 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:23.220
 we drag the problem make sure 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:27.580
 achieved 15 this moment of normality 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:31.479
 the programmers do not see or affect 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.910
 geographic risk of violence in 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.890
 all countries crucial to the world 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.340
 of violence in europe of the 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.979
 US violence in the operation to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.369
 definition and seriousness to all three 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.220
 problems he has practically practiced 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.100
 the airport and first airport simón 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.979
 and agro empowerment I've had the 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.369
 opportunity to play in other countries 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:02.080
 five and a half years in the Netherlands for the PCV 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.840
 and one and a half for the club and then for 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.739
 the valencia decorations either 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.810
 divided at this time no but I think 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:15.209
 that for those who like football 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.010
 is for me this is the team that better 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.370
 is to represent football 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.379
 obviously historical Brazilian figures 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.780
 a historical one is also the brazil of the 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.610
 70 that Holland can not reach if 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.989
 gets to be champion on Sunday 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.569
 winning all the matches of the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.640
 classification and all matches of the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:36.519
 world but that will be a subject to play in 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.360
 Another time, Pablo, we say goodbye. 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.360
 a little more out there 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.930
 you should not ask the octopus to 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.760
 he saw not the other Paul octopus because the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.160
 truth that for Brazil I think what 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.840
 let's hire for television 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.850
 public because the truth I accept 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.460
 absolutely everything and we could also 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.300
 fill out a problem ticket next to 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:01.900
 this octopus that really is gives me the 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.680
 feeling the figure out of football 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 extra football of this world cup 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.910
 to a hug
