00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.730
 today I will show how to make spring 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.040
 a rim of ribbons do it yourself for flowers 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.620
 and leaves we need tapes wide 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.440
 two and a half centimeters cut 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.120
 paper templates and cut them 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.120
 necessary parts for the rim 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.520
 prepare 60 pink 60 white 21 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.120
 green petal 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.490
 the edges of the details singe over the candle 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 flower petals do a little 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.960
 twisted holding them literally 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.020
 second above the candle we sing the edges 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.710
 green leaves fold them along 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.870
 in half face up inside and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.950
 holding the tweezers hold them in the middle 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.950
 a little over the candle 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.300
 when the petals are prepared let's do it 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.729
 wrapping them around the bezel I took the bezel 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.930
 half a centimeter wide and white tape 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.930
 one centimeter wide 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.660
 Now you can do the assembly of flowers 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.300
 each flower must consist of six 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.490
 petals for white flowers use 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.140
 white stamens and for pink flowers 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.140
 stamens pink 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.870
 also for the rim we will need a segment 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.400
 brocade tape size 0 8 centimeters 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.460
 ten centimeters 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.310
 mark each segment in the middle and to 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.390
 it add up edge segment inflict 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.650
 a drop of glue together joining the edges and 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.870
 fold the ribbon in half 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.550
 a slight shift in this way us 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.220
 It turns out these ears 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.250
 they need to be made in the amount of 19 pieces 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.400
 Now we are collecting a flower arrangement on 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.400
 the bezel 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.370
 at the end we glue the beads to the edges 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.970
 silver bruised all and glued 9 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.729
 beads 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.380
 I hope you enjoyed my master class
