00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
keys on one see how hanukkah without

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.920 
keys on one see how hanukkah without
bending<00:00:33.020> notes<00:00:33.940> you<00:00:34.940> can<00:00:35.150> bend<00:00:35.390> notes<00:00:35.629> with<00:00:35.809> it

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
bending notes you can bend notes with it

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.210 
bending notes you can bend notes with it
but<00:00:36.080> this<00:00:36.199> is<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.530> show<00:00:36.710> you<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.800> you<00:00:36.920> can<00:00:36.980> do

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
but this is to show you that you can do

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.119 
but this is to show you that you can do
it<00:00:37.309> without<00:00:37.540> so<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:38.660> trick<00:00:38.870> with<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:39.170> is<00:00:39.440> the

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
it without so the trick with this is the

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.340 
it without so the trick with this is the
use<00:00:40.309> of<00:00:40.340> one<00:00:40.699> particular<00:00:40.820> scale<00:00:41.420> which<00:00:41.900> is<00:00:42.110> the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
use of one particular scale which is the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.410 
use of one particular scale which is the
most<00:00:42.830> I<00:00:43.129> think<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.520> most<00:00:43.699> important<00:00:44.210> tool<00:00:44.390> for

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
most I think the most important tool for

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.210 
most I think the most important tool for
improvising<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:45.800> called<00:00:45.980> a<00:00:46.010> minor

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
improvising and it's called a minor

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.820 
improvising and it's called a minor
pentatonic<00:00:46.670> scale<00:00:47.239> so<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.229> minor<00:00:48.470> pentatonic

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
pentatonic scale so a minor pentatonic

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.910 
pentatonic scale so a minor pentatonic
it's<00:00:49.159> got<00:00:49.280> five<00:00:49.489> notes<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.620> I'll<00:00:51.620> show<00:00:51.890> you

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
it's got five notes and I'll show you

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.170 
it's got five notes and I'll show you
them<00:00:52.070> on<00:00:52.159> the<00:00:52.220> piano<00:00:52.430> then<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:52.670> can<00:00:52.820> see<00:00:53.000> they

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
them on the piano then you can see they

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.210 
them on the piano then you can see they
only<00:00:53.330> use<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.720> white<00:00:53.900> notes<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:54.769> can<00:00:54.979> see

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
only use the white notes so you can see

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.100 
only use the white notes so you can see
that<00:00:55.909> there's<00:00:56.059> no<00:00:56.180> bending<00:00:56.600> involved<00:00:56.989> because

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
that there's no bending involved because

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.140 
that there's no bending involved because
the<00:00:57.320> all<00:00:58.159> the<00:00:58.400> black<00:00:58.580> notes<00:00:58.610> if<00:00:59.030> you're

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.150 
the all the black notes if you're

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.020 
the all the black notes if you're
playing<00:00:59.269> a<00:00:59.390> sea<00:00:59.570> harmonica<00:01:00.080> are<00:01:00.260> bent<00:01:00.650> notes

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
playing a sea harmonica are bent notes

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.579 
playing a sea harmonica are bent notes
so<00:01:02.030> first<00:01:02.449> we're<00:01:02.600> going<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.750> do<00:01:02.900> is<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.049> D<00:01:03.290> minor

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
so first we're going to do is a D minor

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:15.620 
so first we're going to do is a D minor
pentatonic

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.510

here's<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.090> last<00:02:15.209> one<00:02:15.390> I'll<00:02:15.599> do<00:02:15.810> for<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:16.080> this

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
here's the last one I'll do for now this

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.610

is the B minor so we're playing in in B

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.160 
is the B minor so we're playing in in B
minor<00:02:19.860> on<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.310> seahawk<00:02:21.090> without<00:02:21.660> bending<00:02:21.900> notes

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
minor on a seahawk without bending notes

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.320 
minor on a seahawk without bending notes
I<00:02:22.500> know<00:02:23.100> it's<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.459> sound<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.790> bit<00:02:23.819> bonkers

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
I know it's going to sound a bit bonkers

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.660 
I know it's going to sound a bit bonkers
to<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:24.750> but<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.739> look<00:02:25.799> at<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.130> and<00:02:26.340> see<00:02:26.580> if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
to you but have a look at it and see if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.430 
to you but have a look at it and see if
you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.269> it<00:02:27.360> i<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:27.930> i<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.290> it's

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
you can do it i think it's i think it's

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.280 
you can do it i think it's i think it's
pretty<00:02:28.620> good<00:02:28.830> seems<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.940> work<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.019> scale

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
pretty good seems to work so the scale

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.890 
pretty good seems to work so the scale
is

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.060 

and<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.140> it's<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.410> real<00:02:40.620> bluesy<00:02:40.950> quality

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and here it's got a real bluesy quality

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:49.730 
and here it's got a real bluesy quality
anyway<00:02:47.870> I'm<00:02:48.870> not<00:02:49.020> bending<00:02:49.230> in<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.440> notes<00:02:49.650> at
