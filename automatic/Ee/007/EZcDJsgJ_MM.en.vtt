the<00:02:44.430> five<00:02:44.640> sets<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:44.940> doesn't<00:02:45.450> make<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.660> bad

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
the five sets to doesn't make you a bad

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.940 
the five sets to doesn't make you a bad
player<00:02:46.050> guys<00:02:46.290> there's<00:02:46.560> always<00:02:46.860> there's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
player guys there's always there's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.320 
player guys there's always there's
actually<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> benefit<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.790> really<00:02:48.210> low

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
actually a benefit for a really low

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.360 
actually a benefit for a really low
sensitivity<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:49.500> aim<00:02:49.680> assist<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.190> game

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
sensitivity the aim assist on this game

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.010 
sensitivity the aim assist on this game
works<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.270> better<00:02:51.330> with<00:02:51.840> lower

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
works a lot better with lower

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.960 
works a lot better with lower
sensitivities<00:02:52.620> because<00:02:52.890> obviously<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.550> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
sensitivities because obviously that the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.430 
sensitivities because obviously that the
rain<00:02:54.180> isn't<00:02:54.420> moving<00:02:54.600> about<00:02:54.900> as<00:02:55.080> much<00:02:55.230> it

assist you a lot better than if you had

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.100 
assist you a lot better than if you had

you have a high sensitivity you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.010 
you have a high sensitivity you
obviously<00:03:09.060> were<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.300> spin<00:03:09.540> around<00:03:09.630> quicker

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
obviously were to spin around quicker

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.170 
obviously were to spin around quicker
and<00:03:10.320> get<00:03:10.770> that<00:03:10.890> kill<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.730> again<00:03:12.000> there's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
and get that kill so again there's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.840 
and get that kill so again there's
