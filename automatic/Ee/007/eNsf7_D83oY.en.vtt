table<00:00:06.830> is<00:00:07.010> ready<00:00:07.580> now<00:00:07.880> here's<00:00:08.480> something<00:00:08.690> you

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
table is ready now here's something you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.540 
table is ready now here's something you
can<00:00:09.080> do<00:00:09.200> if<00:00:09.320> you're<00:00:09.470> out<00:00:09.620> and<00:00:09.800> about<00:00:10.010> and<00:00:10.309> you

can do if you're out and about and you

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:36.090 
can do if you're out and about and you
see<00:00:10.790> some<00:00:11.000> sugar<00:00:11.210> on<00:00:11.390> the<00:00:11.510> table<00:00:13.060> watch

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.889 

sweet

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.280 

okay<00:00:44.079> here's<00:00:44.470> the<00:00:44.680> secret<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.989> sugar

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
okay here's the secret to the sugar

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.119 
okay here's the secret to the sugar
vanish<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:48.250> sugar<00:00:48.760> actually<00:00:49.329> goes<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:50.829> the

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
vanish the sugar actually goes in the

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.390 
vanish the sugar actually goes in the
cup<00:00:51.370> so<00:00:52.059> how<00:00:52.210> do<00:00:52.270> we<00:00:52.329> get<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.600> in<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:52.809> cup<00:00:53.400> you

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
cup so how do we get it in the cup you

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.250 
cup so how do we get it in the cup you
take<00:00:54.730> one<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.210> packets<00:00:55.629> and<00:00:55.720> you<00:00:55.870> tear

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
take one of the packets and you tear

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.700 
take one of the packets and you tear
about<00:00:56.760> two-thirds<00:00:57.760> of<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.300> way<00:00:58.629> so<00:00:59.530> you've

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
about two-thirds of the way so you've

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.200 
about two-thirds of the way so you've
got<00:00:59.860> that<00:00:59.949> little<00:01:00.129> flap<00:01:00.519> remaining<00:01:01.000> on<00:01:01.120> the

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
got that little flap remaining on the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.259 
got that little flap remaining on the
top<00:01:01.420> you<00:01:02.110> open<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:02.920> packet<00:01:03.280> and<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.460> pour<00:01:04.150> it

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
top you open the packet and you pour it

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.859 
top you open the packet and you pour it
in<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:06.550> is<00:01:06.700> a<00:01:06.729> little<00:01:07.000> secret<00:01:07.390> you<00:01:07.600> do<00:01:07.750> it

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
in but it is a little secret you do it

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.990 
in but it is a little secret you do it
before<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.229> trick<00:01:08.440> starts<00:01:08.890> that's<00:01:09.580> right

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
before the trick starts that's right

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.840 
before the trick starts that's right
that<00:01:10.930> was<00:01:11.229> an<00:01:11.380> empty<00:01:11.680> pack<00:01:12.130> of<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.340> sugar<00:01:12.670> that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
that was an empty pack of the sugar that

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.210 
that was an empty pack of the sugar that
I<00:01:12.880> picked<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.540> now<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.530> course<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.860> do<00:01:15.009> this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
I picked up now of course you do this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.920 
I picked up now of course you do this
before<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.640> trick<00:01:15.850> start<00:01:16.119> so<00:01:16.450> maybe<00:01:16.720> when

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
before the trick start so maybe when

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.240 
before the trick start so maybe when
your<00:01:17.020> friend<00:01:17.229> goes<00:01:17.410> off<00:01:17.560> to<00:01:17.680> get<00:01:17.830> some<00:01:17.979> food<00:01:18.190> or

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
your friend goes off to get some food or

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.520 
your friend goes off to get some food or
you<00:01:18.490> sneekly<00:01:18.880> do<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.240> onto<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.539> table<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:20.080> get

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
you sneekly do it onto the table and get

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.380 
you sneekly do it onto the table and get
it<00:01:20.619> back<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:20.920> there<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.369> just<00:01:21.520> remember<00:01:22.149> which

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
it back in there and just remember which

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.320 
it back in there and just remember which
is<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:23.050> empty<00:01:23.680> packet<00:01:24.100> and<00:01:24.250> so<00:01:24.729> when<00:01:25.119> you<00:01:25.210> want

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
is the empty packet and so when you want

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.480 
is the empty packet and so when you want
to<00:01:25.360> do<00:01:25.450> your<00:01:25.630> trick<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.890> just<00:01:27.070> pick<00:01:27.220> one<00:01:27.369> up

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
to do your trick you just pick one up

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.719 
to do your trick you just pick one up
now<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.270> pinch<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.050> top<00:01:32.070> over<00:01:33.070> the<00:01:33.100> torn<00:01:33.430> bit

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
now I pinch the top over the torn bit

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.730 
now I pinch the top over the torn bit
and<00:01:33.910> then<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.090> tear<00:01:34.450> below<00:01:34.810> it<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.710> really

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
and then I tear below it and that really

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.680 
and then I tear below it and that really
looks<00:01:36.220> like<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.580> am<00:01:36.700> tearing<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> whole<00:01:37.330> top

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
looks like I am tearing the whole top

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.680 
looks like I am tearing the whole top
off<00:01:37.860> squeeze<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:39.100> up<00:01:39.280> discard<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.300> evidence

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
off squeeze it up discard the evidence

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.820 
off squeeze it up discard the evidence
hahaha

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
hahaha

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.620 
hahaha
and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:43.390> it's<00:01:43.780> all<00:01:44.080> acting<00:01:44.740> now<00:01:45.700> remember<00:01:46.600> I

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
and then it's all acting now remember I

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.350 
and then it's all acting now remember I
said<00:01:46.750> you<00:01:47.080> have<00:01:47.259> to<00:01:47.640> break<00:01:48.640> up<00:01:48.819> the<00:01:48.910> sugar<00:01:49.060> so

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:49.360 
said you have to break up the sugar so

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.330 
said you have to break up the sugar so
it's<00:01:49.539> not<00:01:49.630> clumped<00:01:50.110> that's<00:01:50.410> all<00:01:50.770> part<00:01:51.130> of

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
it's not clumped that's all part of

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.400 
it's not clumped that's all part of
convincing<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.300> that<00:01:52.840> that's<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.229> normal

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
convincing you that that's a normal

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.029
