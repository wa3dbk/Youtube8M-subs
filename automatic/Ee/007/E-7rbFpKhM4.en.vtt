00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:04.113
 Hello, everyone, welcome to Tech a Look. 

00:00:04.113 --> 00:00:07.667
 Yes, this time we will compare the full modularization of the computer power supply. 

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.335
 What is the difference between a semi-modular and a non-modular power supply? 

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.702
 Let's check it out! Go! 

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:16.684
 Hey, I am Kevin. 

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:17.665
 I am Yao Wei. 

00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:19.466
 Yes, long time no see 

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:20.059
 Why are you learning me? 

00:00:20.059 --> 00:00:21.765
 Have you been that long? 

00:00:21.765 --> 00:00:23.638
 Last time you were a Cosplay kid girl, didn't you? 

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:25.546
 The degree of inquiry is very high. 

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.208
 Is there? Because it was sexy at that time. 

00:00:27.208 --> 00:00:29.545
 But I think Kevin’s hair is even more amazing. 

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.232
 Is there a blonde? 

00:00:31.232 --> 00:00:33.237
 Everyone asked me where the blonde came from. 

00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:35.072
 Is stolen 

00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:37.584
 Ok, we have introduced it before Tech a Look. 

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.039
 A wide variety of computer power supply products 

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:40.688
 That's right 

00:00:40.688 --> 00:00:43.680
 Then if you hear a semi-modular or full modular power supply 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.539
 Or no modular power supply 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.453
 Are you a little confused? 

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:48.658
 I have been confused by you now. 

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:53.747
 Ok, then we have three different power supplies on the table today. 

00:00:53.747 --> 00:00:55.189
 Compare it with everyone 

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.268
 First let’s take a look at this one on my side. 

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:02.081
 This is a modular power supply 

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:07.067
 His wires are all fixed on this power supply. 

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:08.515
 a lot of wires 

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:12.024
 Then we look at the middle of this semi-modular 

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:13.850
 He is half modular and then it has 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.445
 The basic wire has been fixed 

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:19.183
 Let's take a look at this white one. 

00:01:19.183 --> 00:01:21.857
 White is a fully modular power supply 

00:01:21.857 --> 00:01:24.712
 We see that there is no line behind its wire. 

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:26.294
 Behind are modular designs啰

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:30.253
 The first thing we see is that there is no modular power supply. 

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:35.528
 We put it in our case 

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.301
 It’s usually like this. 

00:01:37.301 --> 00:01:40.413
 We saw that this wire is very messy. 

00:01:40.413 --> 00:01:43.149
 More difficult to organize your wire 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.842
 Because all the wires are fixed on our power supply. 

00:01:45.842 --> 00:01:47.500
 And this is not a modular power supply. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.317
 For manufacturers, its cost is relatively cheap. 

00:01:50.317 --> 00:01:51.345
 Lower contrast 

00:01:51.345 --> 00:01:55.589
 Then the power supply we use today is 500W. 

00:01:55.589 --> 00:02:00.420
 But if you are a very high wattage, it is about 1000W or more. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.431
 This wire will be more 

00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.592
 There will be more lines 

00:02:03.592 --> 00:02:07.180
 If you say that more storage devices may not use as many lines. 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.801
 That will be placed inside your case. 

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:11.707
 It’s hard to do it all. 

00:02:11.707 --> 00:02:14.312
 I have to find a way to hide it. 

00:02:14.312 --> 00:02:19.860
 Then we have to put this semi-modular power supply inside the case. 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.318
 It will cost a little higher than no module. 

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:25.535
 But it is better to organize the part of this wire 

00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.649
 Yes, we see this semi-modularization 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.562
 This manufacturer has already used what would have been used. 

00:02:29.562 --> 00:02:31.866
 If it is this 20+4PIN 

00:02:31.866 --> 00:02:33.730
 This CPU is powered 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.283
 There is also a PCIe that should be used on the display card. 

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:40.236
 This line was originally reserved. 

00:02:40.236 --> 00:02:42.228
 That's another half of this modular 

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.074
 Another line 

00:02:44.074 --> 00:02:45.448
 If you said that you used it later 

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:49.034
 Yes, you have to expand your device and install the display card before installing. 

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.949
 The line inside your case will not be so messy. 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.275
 If we say that today is a modular power supply. 

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.285
 Put it all in. 

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:00.030
 Wow all the lines are inside 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.656
 Can you see this space? 

00:03:02.656 --> 00:03:07.822
 Finally, we see that this is a fully modular power supply. 

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:08.828
 Good snow white 

00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:09.533
 Is a white 

00:03:09.533 --> 00:03:11.455
 We see that compared with the semi-modularization just now. 

00:03:11.455 --> 00:03:15.114
 All of its lines are modular in design 

00:03:15.114 --> 00:03:17.867
 Then we put this in the computer case now. 

00:03:17.867 --> 00:03:19.950
 But its cost is of course half-modular 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.869
 And no module is high 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:27.364
 But we see that you are installing the computer after loading it in. 

00:03:27.364 --> 00:03:28.532
 Will be more convenient 

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.528
 Because there are not many lines to hinder you. 

00:03:30.528 --> 00:03:32.352
 Can be installed in one piece 

00:03:32.352 --> 00:03:36.871
 I even saw this main 20+4PIN just now. It is also modular. 

00:03:36.871 --> 00:03:39.697
 So many times when we are installing the computer 

00:03:39.697 --> 00:03:43.293
 Sometimes this line is too long, sometimes too short to be received. 

00:03:43.293 --> 00:03:47.636
 We will have a more flexible choice when we choose the wire. 

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:50.215
 Or when we change the computer case, for example. 

00:03:50.215 --> 00:03:54.967
 Our power supply will not have to be replaced with a new one next time. 

00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:58.131
 Then sometimes we can change a new line. 

00:03:58.131 --> 00:04:01.717
 Buy longer or shorter to match your new computer 

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:04.014
 It will be more convenient to install. 

00:04:08.428 --> 00:04:10.558
 So when we choose the computer power supply 

00:04:10.558 --> 00:04:13.394
 In fact, this semi-modular full modularization is not modular. 

00:04:13.394 --> 00:04:16.308
 Basically it has nothing to do with its power quality. 

00:04:16.308 --> 00:04:20.568
 And if you have enough budget, add you personally and love it very neatly. 

00:04:20.568 --> 00:04:21.599
 Especially Kevin. 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.173
 So you can choose this fully modular 啰

00:04:24.173 --> 00:04:26.712
 If you say that you want to set up one computer, it’s a normal computer. 

00:04:26.712 --> 00:04:29.393
 Or does it affect the space of the computer case? 

00:04:29.393 --> 00:04:32.943
 A modular power supply is actually OK. 

00:04:32.943 --> 00:04:35.010
 For example, if you want to group one of these basic computers 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.396
 But if you want to upgrade later? 

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:39.899
 A semi-modular power supply is also a good choice啰

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:41.255
 Ok, this is the introduction above. 

00:04:41.255 --> 00:04:42.227
