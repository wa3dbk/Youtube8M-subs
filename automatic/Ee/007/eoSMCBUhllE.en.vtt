00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 the name of the Catholic physicist who speaks 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.230
 rafael de paula 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.719
 I want to be brief in talking about this cover 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.389
 ridiculous October magazine score 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 where they actually used jesus 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 Compare jesus with neymar christ 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.920
 ooo crucified and editor in chief of 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.869
 magazine scoreboard this morning he said on 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.910
 that there is no comparison 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 because the cross is an object of torture in the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.939
 time of the Roman Empire and such but we will 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 see if he really wanted to compare or 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.980
 not where did he get this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.450
 His brilliant idea of wanting to put 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 neymar crucified 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.040
 was it really gives the object of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 torture of the roman empire 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.829
 of course not right we are not backpack and 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.949
 for us Catholics the cross of Christ is a 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.260
 of the largest icons if it is not the largest 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.289
 because our salvation came by the cross 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.960
 came by the death of Christ on the cross 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.930
 came by resurrection Jesus resurrected 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.470
 Why is God, God and Lord, and is He all? 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.320
 powerful but naked our salvation came 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 of the cross of both Catholic and Christian Christians 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.710
 as evangelical Protestants , right? 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.880
 we are convinced of this and if our 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.390
 iron conviction if you do not believe 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.880
 That's why it's up to you not to believe 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.090
 okay everyone has their belief us 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.490
 we believe that what happens from where 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.700
 Did he take this brilliant photo? 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 here where he said that she did not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.899
 I wanted to compare with Jesus to begin with. 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.810
 at that time the crucifixion the condemned 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.070
 took only cross was crucified 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.939
 they raised the cross he died here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.329
 asphyxia and to speed up your fashion 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.990
 they broke the damned's knees 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:01.049
 there is today he dies faster 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.210
 Jesus was not sure how we know we 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.340
 Christians know that Jesus is their 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.670
 knees or any other was 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:13.260
 broken and how they killed jesus 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.690
 passing it by the other side 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.630
 were not pierced and from where he 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:23.250
 took this brilliant photo was there 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:24.390
 And who is that person is Christ? 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.060
 crucified 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.480
 here is jesus where they took the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.630
 face of jesus put a neymar face 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.489
 this is the same photo you can lose 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.100
 by the fashion of the wood here by the 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.700
 by the blood in the hands 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:48.030
 here the foot of jesus here is this part of 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.920
 foot can see that it is the same as the cover 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.640
 who works with photoshop with 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.980
 anyone is graphic program knows that 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.540
 This is how to do it in 12 time. 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.730
 Can you do this? 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 that is, they took the picture of neymar 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.489
 from here, my dear 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.519
 the editor in chief of the board is no more 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.010
 easy you have apologized and taken 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.760
 than trying to explain yourself 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.220
 was a big shot in the arm you and God 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.380
 we Catholics have to make noise 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:31.140
 Yes, because he happens to be Pope Leo 13, he already 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.290
 he said that the audacity of the wicked feeds 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.350
 of the omission of the good and why 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.049
 the bad guys often stand out 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.540
 because the good ones are silent 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.150
 It's time we opened the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.370
 Our mouths will continue to stay in this a 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.870
 Our faith will continue because we 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.329
 Do not say anything because from the moment 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.670
 Let's start talking. 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.890
 we started fighting for our rights 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.900
 people have more respect with us 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.640
 Christians, that is, we made a petition 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.569
 is on facebook's official page 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.220
 catholic among them the petition to 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.709
 that can be taken one step 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.639
 against the scoreboard and that they 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:18.349
 take off that ridiculous cover because my 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:20.480
 sky god if this cover really comes out 

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:23.060
 it will be 1 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.640
 It's a lost war for us Christians. 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.700
 because we are the majority 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.250
 We have to do something for our Christ. 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.860
 You saying that it's silly that I'm not 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.570
 very radical fundamentalist is because 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.430
 You do not truly love Jesus. 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.700
 Christ who loves 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.800
 Just to see this cover is disgusting then 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:47.900
 armed are there the petition is there and 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.600
 I ask you Christian Catholics and 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:53.330
 Protestant evangelicals to sign 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.550
 this petition so that the name of Christ 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:00.370
 not be a blog named because the 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:03.260
 from the moment we put the 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:07.130
 mouth on the trambone is not mouth on the trombone 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.730
 we really started to cry out against all 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.820
 desecration is that they do with the 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.650
 Christianity sure next time 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.840
 when someone creates a ridiculous cape 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.690
 You 'll think twice about this. 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.900
 I was very happy to be able to score . 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.480
 have made this cover and I ask the 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.190
 repair them by removing this doha 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.660
 and apologizing 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:34.970
 is to issue an apology note to the 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.450
 Christians for having made a cover as 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.550
 ridiculous of this mocking not of man 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.440
 because for us Christ is just 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:47.390
 a man is not just a savior he is 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:51.190
 our god is our god then not 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.190
 play with the faith of others
