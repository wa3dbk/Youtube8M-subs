to<00:02:36.340> come<00:02:36.489> down<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.870> reason<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.260> joined

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
to come down but the reason I joined

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.589 
to come down but the reason I joined
experts<00:02:39.010> is<00:02:39.250> because<00:02:39.610> I'm<00:02:39.819> really<00:02:40.150> into
