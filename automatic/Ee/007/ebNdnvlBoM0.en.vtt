relatively<00:03:21.549> quickly<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:22.000> your<00:03:22.030> brush<00:03:22.329> so<00:03:22.510> I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
relatively quickly on your brush so I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.910 
relatively quickly on your brush so I
always<00:03:22.660> recommend<00:03:22.750> cleaning<00:03:23.260> off<00:03:23.530> your<00:03:23.560> brush

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
always recommend cleaning off your brush

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.680 
always recommend cleaning off your brush
after<00:03:24.700> every<00:03:24.730> couple<00:03:25.060> minutes<00:03:25.299> of<00:03:25.390> painting

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
after every couple minutes of painting

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.180 
after every couple minutes of painting
because<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.079> does<00:03:26.230> gunk<00:03:26.560> up<00:03:26.769> your<00:03:27.010> brush

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
because it does gunk up your brush

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.559 
because it does gunk up your brush
eventually<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.760> build<00:03:28.000> up<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.329> it's<00:03:28.450> always

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
eventually and build up so it's always

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.930 
eventually and build up so it's always
good<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.810> up<00:03:29.079> to<00:03:29.519> wash<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:30.670> off<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:30.850> obviously
