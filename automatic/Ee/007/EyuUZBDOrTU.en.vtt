just the alcohol and the
alcohol<00:02:13.500> goes<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:14.070> a<00:02:14.100> vapor<00:02:14.430> through<00:02:15.000> a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
alcohol goes as a vapor through a

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.100 
alcohol goes as a vapor through a
botanical<00:02:16.860> basket<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.610> what<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.570> does<00:02:18.810> is

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
botanical basket and what that does is

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.270 
botanical basket and what that does is
it<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.980> captures<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.060> flavor<00:02:21.540> of<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.380> gin<00:02:22.680> but

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
it it captures the flavor of the gin but

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.340 
it it captures the flavor of the gin but
leaves<00:02:23.580> behind<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.150> lot<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.480> heavier<00:02:24.810> oils

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
leaves behind a lot of the heavier oils

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.980 
leaves behind a lot of the heavier oils
and<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.550> gives<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.820> as<00:02:26.970> much<00:02:27.180> smoother<00:02:27.720> gin

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
and so it gives you as much smoother gin

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.890 
and so it gives you as much smoother gin
that<00:02:28.860> is<00:02:29.250> less<00:02:29.610> harsh<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.330> back<00:02:30.480> ear<00:02:30.690> mouth

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
that is less harsh on the back ear mouth

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.170 
that is less harsh on the back ear mouth
so<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:32.070> have<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> lot<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.520> people<00:02:32.730> say<00:02:32.970> that

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
so we we have a lot of people say that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.970 
so we we have a lot of people say that
they<00:02:33.300> hate<00:02:33.480> gin<00:02:33.810> they<00:02:34.320> don't<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:34.650> gin<00:02:34.860> and

they hate gin they don't like gin and

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
they hate gin they don't like gin and
they<00:02:35.040> try<00:02:35.250> argue<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.610> they<00:02:35.670> said<00:02:35.850> we<00:02:35.940> were

until 2007 in America the reason why it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.650

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
believed to be psychotropic the FDA did

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.370 
believed to be psychotropic the FDA did
some<00:02:57.120> tests<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.570> found<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.140> chemical

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
some tests and found that this chemical

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.170 
some tests and found that this chemical
was<00:02:58.800> in<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.190> lot<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.400> spices<00:02:59.850> it<00:02:59.970> was<00:03:00.060> in

was in a lot of spices it was in
rosemary<00:03:00.690> thyme<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.520> so<00:03:02.520> they<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:03.030> had<00:03:03.180> to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
rosemary thyme and so they they had to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.570 
rosemary thyme and so they they had to
allow<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.660> to<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.900> legalized<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:05.250> went<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.520> a

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
allow it to be legalized we went with a

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.210 
allow it to be legalized we went with a
red<00:03:05.820> absinthe<00:03:06.300> because<00:03:06.690> mostly<00:03:07.650> absence<00:03:08.070> are

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
red absinthe because mostly absence are

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.660 
red absinthe because mostly absence are
green<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:09.470> but<00:03:10.470> there<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.830> didn't<00:03:11.100> see<00:03:11.130> that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
green and but there we didn't see that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.490 
green and but there we didn't see that
there<00:03:12.240> had<00:03:12.360> been<00:03:12.480> a<00:03:12.510> lot<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.750> red<00:03:12.900> absence<00:03:13.290> made

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.980 
no red absence being made in the United
States<00:03:17.610> so<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.390> wanted<00:03:18.630> something<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.930> a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
States so we wanted something just a

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.350 
States so we wanted something just a
little<00:03:19.020> bit<00:03:19.170> different<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.090> we<00:03:21.090> started

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
little bit different and we started

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.270 
little bit different and we started
playing<00:03:21.570> with<00:03:21.720> hibiscus<00:03:21.900> which<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:22.800> we

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
playing with hibiscus which is what we

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.610 
playing with hibiscus which is what we
used<00:03:23.490> to<00:03:23.700> color<00:03:23.970> our<00:03:24.150> absence<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.440> like

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
used to color our absence and we like

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.230 
used to color our absence and we like
the<00:03:25.740> taste<00:03:25.860> it<00:03:26.070> was<00:03:26.160> giving<00:03:26.430> us<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:26.670> we<00:03:26.790> went

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
the taste it was giving us so we went

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.570 
the taste it was giving us so we went
with<00:03:27.360> it

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
with it

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.070 
with it
vanilla<00:03:29.580> bean<00:03:29.700> vodka<00:03:30.090> our<00:03:30.300> simplest<00:03:30.690> spirit

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
vanilla bean vodka our simplest spirit

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.920 
vanilla bean vodka our simplest spirit
fortunately<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.180> one<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.240> the<00:03:33.300> most<00:03:33.480> popular

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
fortunately it's one of the most popular

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.750 
fortunately it's one of the most popular
because<00:03:34.410> it<00:03:34.709> is<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:34.950> simple<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.340> make<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.670> it

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
because it is so simple to make that it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000 
because it is so simple to make that it
is<00:03:35.910> an<00:03:36.150> infusion<00:03:36.570> of<00:03:36.750> whole<00:03:36.959> vanilla<00:03:37.200> beans<00:03:37.650> in

is an infusion of whole vanilla beans in
high-proof<00:03:39.000> ingrained<00:03:39.750> spirit<00:03:40.200> which<00:03:40.740> we

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
high-proof ingrained spirit which we

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.030 
high-proof ingrained spirit which we
then<00:03:41.130> filter<00:03:41.640> several<00:03:42.000> times<00:03:42.239> through

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
then filter several times through

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.949 
then filter several times through
activated<00:03:44.040> carbon<00:03:44.400> made<00:03:44.550> from<00:03:44.580> coconut<00:03:44.959> and

activated carbon made from coconut and

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.690 
activated carbon made from coconut and
then<00:03:46.410> we<00:03:46.560> filter<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:46.950> further<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.489> then<00:03:47.610> we

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
then we filter it further and then we

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.190 
then we filter it further and then we
have

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
have

extract so they remain clear or have

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.619 
extract so they remain clear or have
just<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.610> little<00:03:55.790> bit<00:03:55.879> of<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.030> tint<00:03:56.209> then<00:03:56.420> there's

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
just a little bit of a tint then there's
