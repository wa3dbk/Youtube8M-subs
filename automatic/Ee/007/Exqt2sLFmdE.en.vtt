00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the center feature I feel is probably

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.080 
the center feature I feel is probably
here<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.050> so<00:00:28.800> easy<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.000> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
from here but to be honest the blocks on

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.550 
from here but to be honest the blocks on
this<00:01:09.600> texture<00:01:09.840> pack<00:01:09.869> don't<00:01:10.170> look<00:01:10.320> what<00:01:10.439> they

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
this texture pack don't look what they

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.179 
this texture pack don't look what they
should<00:01:11.189> like<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.270> gold<00:01:12.540> that's<00:01:13.170> soul<00:01:13.470> sand<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

should like the gold that's soul sand so
that's<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> perfect<00:01:14.909> thing<00:01:15.509> like<00:01:16.490> they<00:01:17.490> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that's a perfect thing like they just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
that's a perfect thing like they just
