hi my name is Patricia and I'm going to

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.360 
hi my name is Patricia and I'm going to
show<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.140> how<00:00:07.379> to<00:00:07.440> fold<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.980> piece<00:00:08.130> of<00:00:08.189> paper

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
show you how to fold a piece of paper

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.709 
show you how to fold a piece of paper
into<00:00:09.030> tenths<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.830> what<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.099> need<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.059> piece

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
into tenths so what we need is a piece

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.709 
into tenths so what we need is a piece
of<00:00:12.870> paper<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.370> then<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> ruler<00:00:14.730> and<00:00:15.059> pencil<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
of paper and then a ruler and pencil to

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.880 
of paper and then a ruler and pencil to
make<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.990> precise<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.090> what<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> do<00:00:18.390> is<00:00:18.890> take

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
make it precise and what you do is take

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.859 
make it precise and what you do is take
the<00:00:20.010> piece<00:00:20.160> of<00:00:20.279> paper<00:00:20.570> fold<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.810> half

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
the piece of paper fold it in half

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.080 
the piece of paper fold it in half
lengthwise<00:00:22.470> match<00:00:23.279> up<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> corners<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:26.090> fold

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
lengthwise match up the corners and fold

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.509 
lengthwise match up the corners and fold
it<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.359> half<00:00:27.470> all<00:00:28.470> right<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:29.010> then<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.340> is

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
it in half all right and then this is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.279 
it in half all right and then this is
where<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.789> tricky<00:00:30.060> part<00:00:30.269> comes<00:00:30.300> in<00:00:30.720> because

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
where the tricky part comes in because

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.610 
where the tricky part comes in because
we<00:00:31.590> have<00:00:31.859> two<00:00:32.850> equal<00:00:33.480> sides<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.500> we

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
we have two equal sides now and what we

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.520 
we have two equal sides now and what we
need<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> split<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.579> into<00:00:35.730> five

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
need to do is split it into five

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.040 
need to do is split it into five
rectangles<00:00:37.530> um<00:00:38.180> in<00:00:39.180> order<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.570> do<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:39.899> you

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
rectangles um in order to do that you

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
rectangles um in order to do that you
can't<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:40.559> fold<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:40.980> in<00:00:41.070> half<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.370> actually

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
can't just fold it in half you actually

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.299 
can't just fold it in half you actually
have<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> measure<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.350> we<00:00:44.129> know<00:00:44.280> that

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
have to measure it out so we know that

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
have to measure it out so we know that
this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.760> an<00:00:45.000> eight-and-a-half<00:00:45.450> by<00:00:45.930> eleven

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
this is an eight-and-a-half by eleven

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.029 
this is an eight-and-a-half by eleven
piece<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.620> paper

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
piece of paper

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.290 
piece of paper
that's<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> used<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.640> 11<00:00:51.059> inches

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
that's what I used so this is 11 inches

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.840 
that's what I used so this is 11 inches
we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.170> divide<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> by<00:00:52.860> five<00:00:53.100> which

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
we have to divide that by five which

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.439 
we have to divide that by five which
equals<00:00:54.289> about<00:00:55.289> two<00:00:56.129> inches<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.090> little<00:00:57.329> bit

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
equals about two inches and a little bit

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
equals about two inches and a little bit
so<00:00:58.170> what<00:00:58.289> I'm<00:00:58.379> going<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.559> do<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.920> measure<00:00:59.190> two

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so what I'm going to do is measure two

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.920 
so what I'm going to do is measure two
inches<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.359> about<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.410> little<00:01:01.829> over<00:01:02.100> an<00:01:02.190> eighth

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
inches and about a little over an eighth

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.359 
inches and about a little over an eighth
with<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.080> folding<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.949> going<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.250> give

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
with your folding you're going to give

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
with your folding you're going to give
up<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.610> little<00:01:05.790> paper<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.299> there<00:01:06.510> so<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
up a little paper here and there so this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.070 
up a little paper here and there so this
is<00:01:07.619> about<00:01:07.860> two<00:01:08.520> inches<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:09.000> eighth<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.479> what

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
is about two inches in eighth and what

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.280 
is about two inches in eighth and what
we're<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.119> fold<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> in<00:01:12.360> half<00:01:12.420> now

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
we're going to do is fold it in half now

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.020 
we're going to do is fold it in half now
I'm<00:01:13.470> going<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.710> actually<00:01:14.040> do<00:01:14.189> an<00:01:14.310> accordion

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
fold here you could just fold it over

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.109 
fold here you could just fold it over
again<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:18.990> I'm<00:01:19.229> going<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> do<00:01:20.070> an<00:01:20.369> accordion
