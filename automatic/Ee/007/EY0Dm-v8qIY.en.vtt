00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
and now on to the tutorial I formatted

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.890 
and now on to the tutorial I formatted
and<00:00:22.769> printed<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.460> character<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.180> size<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
and printed my character to size and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.870 
and printed my character to size and
then<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> trimmed<00:00:25.560> off<00:00:25.740> sections<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.789> able

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
then I trimmed off sections to be able

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.970 
then I trimmed off sections to be able
to<00:00:27.119> trace<00:00:27.449> it<00:00:27.480> onto<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.140> surface<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.740> my

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to trace it onto the surface of my

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.070 
to trace it onto the surface of my
cookie<00:00:29.400> I'm<00:00:29.550> using<00:00:29.760> an<00:00:30.000> edible<00:00:30.269> marker<00:00:30.420> to

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
cookie I'm using an edible marker to

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:42.440 
cookie I'm using an edible marker to
transfer<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.769> design

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.870 

now<00:00:43.450> I'm<00:00:43.780> using<00:00:44.230> some<00:00:44.530> black<00:00:44.950> icing<00:00:45.670> to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
now I'm using some black icing to

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.720 
now I'm using some black icing to
outline<00:00:46.450> the<00:00:46.990> cookie<00:00:47.200> and<00:00:47.620> the<00:00:47.920> character<00:00:48.490> and

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
outline the cookie and the character and

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.850 
outline the cookie and the character and
then<00:00:49.420> I'm<00:00:49.540> going<00:00:49.810> to<00:00:49.900> be<00:00:50.020> letting<00:00:50.320> these<00:00:50.470> lines

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
then I'm going to be letting these lines

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.160 
then I'm going to be letting these lines
dry<00:00:51.310> so<00:00:51.670> that<00:00:51.700> I<00:00:51.850> can<00:00:52.090> come<00:00:52.300> in<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:52.450> fill<00:00:52.870> all

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
dry so that I can come in and fill all

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:49.460 
dry so that I can come in and fill all
those<00:00:53.530> sections

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.710 

running<00:01:50.280> off<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.760> some<00:01:50.790> glue<00:01:51.360> for<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
running off with some glue for the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.540 
running off with some glue for the
background<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> thought<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.710> made<00:01:52.980> the<00:01:53.190> yellow

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
background I thought it made the yellow

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.330 
background I thought it made the yellow
character<00:01:54.150> pop<00:01:54.480> and<00:01:54.870> so<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.590> filling<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.160> my

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
character pop and so I'm filling in my

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550 
character pop and so I'm filling in my
sections<00:01:56.910> one<00:01:57.180> at<00:01:57.300> a<00:01:57.330> time<00:01:57.690> to<00:01:58.020> ensure<00:01:58.200> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
sections one at a time to ensure that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.710 
sections one at a time to ensure that
the<00:01:58.710> icing<00:01:59.160> doesn't<00:01:59.550> spill<00:01:59.820> over<00:01:59.850> use<00:02:00.450> your

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
the icing doesn't spill over use your

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.590 
the icing doesn't spill over use your
needle<00:02:01.050> tool<00:02:01.260> to<00:02:01.560> spread<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.220> smooth<00:02:03.210> out<00:02:03.390> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
needle tool to spread and smooth out the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:43.120 
needle tool to spread and smooth out the
surface<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.440> icing

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.700

immediately flood and everything will
kind<00:03:31.850> of<00:03:31.910> meld<00:03:32.600> together<00:03:33.080> and<00:03:33.760> also<00:03:34.760> I'm

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
kind of meld together and also I'm

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.270 
kind of meld together and also I'm
adding<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.660> little<00:03:35.960> dot<00:03:36.200> of<00:03:36.440> white<00:03:36.800> in<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> eye

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
adding a little dot of white in the eye

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.480 
adding a little dot of white in the eye
in<00:03:37.970> the<00:03:38.600> wet<00:03:38.780> icing<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:39.560> that<00:03:39.710> it<00:03:39.830> sinks<00:03:40.160> in<00:03:40.340> and

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
in the wet icing so that it sinks in and

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.180 
in the wet icing so that it sinks in and
creates<00:03:40.820> that<00:03:40.970> little<00:03:41.260> reflection<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.980> it

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
creates that little reflection and it

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.800 
creates that little reflection and it
gives<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.610> character<00:03:44.090> a<00:03:44.120> little<00:03:44.180> bit<00:03:44.420> more

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
gives the character a little bit more

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.840 
gives the character a little bit more
life<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.380> makes<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:46.010> little<00:03:46.250> bit<00:03:46.490> more

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
life it makes it a little bit more

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.080 
life it makes it a little bit more
interesting<00:03:47.630> I<00:03:47.720> find<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.170> face<00:03:48.380> looks<00:03:48.740> less

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
interesting I find the face looks less

00:03:49.090 --> 00:04:21.720 
interesting I find the face looks less
