stayed away for a while but a lot of
these<00:02:12.209> figures<00:02:12.569> are<00:02:12.720> starting<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> look

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
these figures are starting to look

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.510 
these figures are starting to look
also<00:02:13.710> I'm<00:02:13.770> kind<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.190> getting<00:02:14.310> back<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.850> them
