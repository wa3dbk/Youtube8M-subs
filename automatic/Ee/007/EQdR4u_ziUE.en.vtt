a little bit about this car how you came
about<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.140> build<00:00:28.350> it<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:28.950> your<00:00:29.100> goals

about to build it and what your goals

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.790 
about to build it and what your goals
were<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.790> coming<00:00:30.510> up<00:00:30.600> with<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:31.020> sort<00:00:31.710> of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
were in coming up with this sort of

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.569 
were in coming up with this sort of
great<00:00:32.160> take<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.969> an<00:00:33.329> already<00:00:33.719> famous<00:00:34.340> GT<00:00:35.340> pride

great take on an already famous GT pride
well<00:00:36.210> I<00:00:36.240> was<00:00:36.360> originally<00:00:36.480> part<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.990> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
well I was originally part of the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.830 
well I was originally part of the
original<00:00:37.470> design<00:00:37.980> team<00:00:38.220> for<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> Ford<00:00:38.790> GT<00:00:38.840> and

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
original design team for the Ford GT and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.360 
original design team for the Ford GT and
I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.350> every<00:00:40.560> program<00:00:40.890> I've<00:00:41.010> been<00:00:41.040> on

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
I think with every program I've been on

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.770 
I think with every program I've been on
I<00:00:41.400> always<00:00:41.940> think<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.270> would<00:00:42.390> I<00:00:42.420> do<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
I always think what would I do to this

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.530 
I always think what would I do to this
car<00:00:42.840> if<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.200> owned<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.410> myself<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.420> that<00:00:45.420> would

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
car if I owned it myself and that would

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.970 
car if I owned it myself and that would
be<00:00:45.570> basically<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.410> cut<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.829> roof

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
be basically take it and cut the roof

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.310 
be basically take it and cut the roof
off<00:00:47.130> basically<00:00:47.910> what<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> wanted<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> do<00:00:48.989> was

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
off basically what I wanted to do was

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
off basically what I wanted to do was
leverage<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> relationships<00:00:50.880> that<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.120> have

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
leverage the relationships that we have

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.030 
leverage the relationships that we have
in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> aftermarket<00:00:51.810> find<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> coach<00:00:52.680> builder

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
in the aftermarket find a coach builder

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.620 
in the aftermarket find a coach builder
that<00:00:53.190> could<00:00:53.310> work<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:54.210> give<00:00:54.360> him<00:00:54.510> an

that could work with to give him an

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.970 
that could work with to give him an

you own a GT to have this done to your
car<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.740> basic<00:01:08.070> conversion<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.580> take<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
car the basic conversion to take the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.649 
car the basic conversion to take the
roof<00:01:09.030> off<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.770> thirty<00:01:10.770> thousand<00:01:11.250> dollars<00:01:11.659> so

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
roof off is thirty thousand dollars so

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.390 
roof off is thirty thousand dollars so
is<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.409> simple<00:01:13.440> as<00:01:13.770> its<00:01:13.920> cutting<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.190> top

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is it as simple as its cutting the top

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.130 
is it as simple as its cutting the top
off<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.030> what's<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> engineering<00:01:16.020> behind

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
off or what's the engineering behind

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.590 
off or what's the engineering behind
that<00:01:16.620> the<00:01:16.830> four<00:01:17.280> panel<00:01:17.670> top<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.180> you've<00:01:18.360> got

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
that the four panel top that you've got

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.340 
that the four panel top that you've got
on<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.710> car<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.760> basic<00:01:21.479> GT<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.110> stiff

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
on this car the basic GT is a very stiff

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.080 
on this car the basic GT is a very stiff
car<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.010> we<00:01:23.100> cut<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.430> central<00:01:23.820> part<00:01:24.030> of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
car so when we cut that central part of

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.340 
car so when we cut that central part of
the<00:01:24.150> roof<00:01:24.330> off<00:01:24.510> it<00:01:24.750> didn't<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> dramatic

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
the roof off it didn't have a dramatic

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.140 
the roof off it didn't have a dramatic
effect<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:26.130> stiffnesses<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.850> would<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
effect on stiffnesses it would with a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230 
effect on stiffnesses it would with a
normal<00:01:27.180> car<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.070> rough<00:01:29.310> panel<00:01:29.610> system<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.119> was

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
normal car the rough panel system it was

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.550 
normal car the rough panel system it was
important<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.690> us<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.080> something<00:01:31.350> that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
important for us to have something that

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.190 
important for us to have something that
was<00:01:31.650> usable<00:01:32.010> at<00:01:32.369> speed<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.150> lot<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> these<00:01:33.869> audit

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
was usable at speed a lot of these audit

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.780 
was usable at speed a lot of these audit
convertibles<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:34.830> can't<00:01:35.010> really<00:01:35.250> drive<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
convertibles you can't really drive to

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
their full potential with the roof up so

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.980 
their full potential with the roof up so
the<00:01:37.950> hard<00:01:38.130> panel<00:01:38.460> system<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:39.390> really<00:01:39.630> gives<00:01:39.810> us

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
the hard panel system it really gives us

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
the hard panel system it really gives us
a<00:01:40.080> lot<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> advantages<00:01:40.710> over<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.010> typical<00:01:41.400> soft

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
a lot of advantages over a typical soft

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.060 
a lot of advantages over a typical soft
top<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.510> also<00:01:42.659> wanted<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> top<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.619> store<00:01:43.860> in

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
top we also wanted the top to store in

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.320 
top we also wanted the top to store in
the<00:01:44.220> car<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.729> didn't<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> leave<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
the car so you didn't have to leave it
