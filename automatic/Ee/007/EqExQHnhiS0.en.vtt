00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:04.580 
there's a gap between what your network

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.070 
there's a gap between what your network
was<00:00:04.729> designed<00:00:05.090> to<00:00:05.240> deliver<00:00:05.479> and<00:00:05.810> what<00:00:05.990> it

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
actually will deliver when the big

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:08.770 
actually will deliver when the big
