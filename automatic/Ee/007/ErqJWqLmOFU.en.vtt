 destroyed this pair however its that 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.770
 these are not collected by any book of 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.140
 history because because the great ambition 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.360
 and the conquest without contribution to the good 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.360
 common have no value 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.650

 I will remind you of the story 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.360
 your truck the totally forgotten people 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.570

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.590
 aristÃ³teles cease 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.960
 to taste 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.879
 plato cicerÃ³n giant socrates of the 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.879
 history men of a marked character 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.270
 whose merits and tricks survived in 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.100
 their time and they will survive 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.280
 even for sample 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.280
 its history is our history 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.470
 I am the professor javier 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 welcome to western civilization 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.330
 the Greeks and the Romans 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.320
 happened to the center nothing only I have 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 one thing 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.480
 there is a lot for the delay 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.690
 Now I understand what it means 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.319
 the Greeks sculpted the cold marble 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.120
 Even little houses shout 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.670
 the Greeks pronounced great 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.409
 speeches and they also measured the heavens 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.469
 that told us the departure of the stars 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.959
 but you Romans of great heart do not 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.480
 will go back with authority to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.459
 set the gates I conquered jce 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.299

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.299

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.780
 how could he stand 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:42.030
 I guess because there was a young man 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.030
 under a lot of pressure 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.330

 the most intimate structure of our 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.580
 schools are more fundamental than 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.470
 stones or that beams and they remain 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.090
