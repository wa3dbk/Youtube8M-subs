00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.679 
then play around with the cuff a little
bit<00:02:38.799> here<00:02:39.069> just<00:02:39.939> to<00:02:40.030> demonstrate<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
bit here just to demonstrate the

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:42.180 
bit here just to demonstrate the
different<00:02:41.049> tones<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.950> you

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
different tones that you

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.360 
different tones that you
can<00:02:42.310> get<00:02:42.490> out<00:02:42.790> of<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.240> G<00:02:44.200> rig<00:02:44.500> as<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.040> called

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.960 

so<00:02:48.370> once<00:02:48.640> again<00:02:48.790> all<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:50.200> way<00:02:50.320> closed<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:51.100> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so once again all the way closed and you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
so once again all the way closed and you
know<00:02:52.090> that<00:02:52.270> it's<00:02:52.420> actually<00:02:52.750> pretty<00:02:52.900> cool<00:02:53.170> to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
know that it's actually pretty cool to

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:56.000 
know that it's actually pretty cool to
sing<00:02:53.620> through<00:02:53.860> too<00:02:54.190> so<00:02:54.490> I'll<00:02:54.640> do<00:02:54.790> a<00:02:54.820> little<00:02:55.090> bit

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.819 

all<00:03:57.010> right<00:03:57.629> so<00:03:58.629> now<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.780> open<00:03:59.079> it<00:03:59.319> all<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.530> way

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
all right so now I open it all the way

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.349 
all right so now I open it all the way
up<00:03:59.859> just<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.459> show<00:04:00.640> you<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.879> difference<00:04:01.239> you

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:01.359 
up just to show you the difference you

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.670 
up just to show you the difference you
can<00:04:01.510> get<00:04:01.689> and<00:04:03.120> do<00:04:04.120> kind<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.450> a<00:04:04.599> slim<00:04:05.079> Harpo<00:04:05.290> kind

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
of course with whatever settings work

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.370 
of course with whatever settings work
for<00:05:11.210> you<00:05:11.360> I'm<00:05:11.600> gonna<00:05:11.720> put<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.080> right<00:05:12.110> in<00:05:12.320> the
