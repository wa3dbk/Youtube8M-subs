with<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.510> I'm<00:00:25.080> gonna<00:00:25.199> talk<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:26.099> about<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
with that I'm gonna talk a bit about I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.950 
with that I'm gonna talk a bit about I
already<00:00:26.699> went<00:00:27.000> on<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.449> level<00:00:27.630> one

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
already went on to level one

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.460 
already went on to level one
unfortunately<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.099> sorry<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:29.929> we<00:00:30.929> need<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
unfortunately I'm sorry but we need to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.580 
unfortunately I'm sorry but we need to
actually<00:00:31.890> go<00:00:32.430> into<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.180> first<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.260> you'll

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
actually go into the first one you'll

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
actually go into the first one you'll
notice<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.890> it's<00:00:35.190> loading<00:00:35.550> is<00:00:35.750> lagging<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
notice that it's loading is lagging a

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.650 
notice that it's loading is lagging a
bit<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:38.040> reason<00:00:38.210> why<00:00:39.210> there's<00:00:39.570> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
bit and I think the reason why there's a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.990 
bit and I think the reason why there's a
lot<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> leg<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> lot<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
lot of leg is because there's a lot of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880 
lot of leg is because there's a lot of
players<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.570> see<00:00:42.719> when<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.260> update<00:00:43.649> came

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
players you see when the update came

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.389 
players you see when the update came
back<00:00:44.100> live<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.149> fine<00:00:45.450> now<00:00:46.379> it's<00:00:46.800> lagging<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
back live it was fine now it's lagging a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
back live it was fine now it's lagging a
bit<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.899> saying<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.260> think<00:00:49.289> it's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
bit and like I was saying I think it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.200 
bit and like I was saying I think it's
because<00:00:49.770> there's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> lot<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.399> pliers<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
because there's a lot of pliers and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.029 
because there's a lot of pliers and
whenever<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.870> players<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:52.410> log<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.829> at<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
whenever the players all log in at the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.350 
whenever the players all log in at the
same<00:00:53.190> time<00:00:53.539> it<00:00:54.539> likes<00:00:55.550> can<00:00:56.550> go<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.270> we

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
same time it likes can go on in here we

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150 
same time it likes can go on in here we

now you know that's essentially what

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.839

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.640 
happens with the dialogue there's no
dialogue<00:05:22.300> here<00:05:22.599> and<00:05:22.810> i'm<00:05:23.320> going<00:05:23.500> to<00:05:23.590> assume

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
dialogue here and i'm going to assume

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.529 
dialogue here and i'm going to assume
there's<00:05:23.979> no<00:05:24.130> dialogue<00:05:24.520> there<00:05:24.789> as<00:05:24.940> well<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.389> i'm

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
there's no dialogue there as well so i'm

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.589 
there's no dialogue there as well so i'm
going<00:05:25.720> to<00:05:25.810> move<00:05:25.960> on<00:05:26.199> with<00:05:26.580> the<00:05:27.580> next<00:05:27.610> one<00:05:28.090> in

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
going to move on with the next one in

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.990
