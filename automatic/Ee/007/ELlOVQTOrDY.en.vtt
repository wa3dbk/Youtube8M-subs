starless he wants to base trade but at
the<00:00:05.819> same<00:00:05.970> time<00:00:06.180> he's<00:00:06.330> getting<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the same time he's getting the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:07.940 
the same time he's getting the
mothership<00:00:06.990> in<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> main<00:00:07.350> here<00:00:07.560> we<00:00:07.649> which

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
mothership in the main here we which

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.860 
mothership in the main here we which
might<00:00:08.189> help<00:00:08.400> him<00:00:08.610> because<00:00:08.820> there's<00:00:09.660> too<00:00:09.780> many

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
might help him because there's too many

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.650 
might help him because there's too many
overseers<00:00:10.349> around<00:00:10.650> there<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> few<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.570> I

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
overseers around there is a few and I

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.060 
overseers around there is a few and I
guess<00:00:12.809> there's<00:00:13.019> investors<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.920> use

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
guess there's investors you have to use

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.440 
guess there's investors you have to use
fungo<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> think<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> base<00:00:15.089> trade<00:00:15.330> is

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
fungo but I think a base trade is

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.420 
fungo but I think a base trade is
probably<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.839> best<00:00:16.049> shot<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.830> he<00:00:16.980> has<00:00:17.190> to

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
probably the best shot that he has to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.019 
probably the best shot that he has to
win<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.699> game<00:00:18.380> j.don<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:20.100> really<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:20.939> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
win this game j.don really really at the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.580 
win this game j.don really really at the
moment<00:00:21.180> considering<00:00:21.960> his<00:00:22.109> round<00:00:22.320> of<00:00:22.410> 32

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
moment considering his round of 32

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.380 
moment considering his round of 32
considering<00:00:23.310> how<00:00:23.430> much<00:00:23.640> crack<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.000> seek<00:00:24.180> for

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
considering how much crack to seek for

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.560 
considering how much crack to seek for
the<00:00:24.480> mothership<00:00:24.720> against<00:00:25.289> them<00:00:29.210> just<00:00:30.210> before

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the mothership against them just before

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.209 
the mothership against them just before
he<00:00:30.630> was<00:00:30.750> gonna<00:00:30.900> finish<00:00:31.140> as<00:00:31.380> well<00:00:31.410> very<00:00:32.160> very

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
he was gonna finish as well very very

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
he was gonna finish as well very very
well<00:00:32.520> done<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:32.880> by<00:00:33.030> jaedong<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.719> he<00:00:33.840> will

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
well done here by jaedong and he will

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.680 
well done here by jaedong and he will
slowly<00:00:34.800> now<00:00:35.100> move<00:00:35.370> into<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.030> main<00:00:36.239> base<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
slowly now move into the main base the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.020 
slowly now move into the main base the
one<00:00:36.870> last<00:00:37.110> bastion<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> hope<00:00:37.860> really<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.610> for

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
one last bastion of hope really here for

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.490 
one last bastion of hope really here for
starters<00:00:39.210> he<00:00:39.570> needs<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.899> keep<00:00:40.050> everything

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.010 
moment no that's this could be his last
building<00:01:17.100> oh<00:01:17.250> my<00:01:17.430> god<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.479> he's<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.869> defend

building oh my god but he's gonna defend

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
building oh my god but he's gonna defend
it<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.439> his<00:01:19.530> life<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.920> he's<00:01:20.040> got<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> lot<00:01:20.460> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it with his life and he's got a lot of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.310 
it with his life and he's got a lot of
in-laws<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> lot<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.390> army<00:01:21.689> supply<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.020> he

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
in-laws and a lot of army supply to he

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
in-laws and a lot of army supply to he
stopped<00:01:22.590> solid<00:01:23.130> building<00:01:23.430> which<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.580> observer

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
stopped solid building which is observer

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.310 
stopped solid building which is observer
I<00:01:24.090> think<00:01:24.299> he<00:01:24.390> might<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:24.810> straight<00:01:25.049> for<00:01:25.290> it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
I think he might just go straight for it

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
I think he might just go straight for it
to<00:01:25.470> try<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.680> eliminate<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.250> know<00:01:26.310> it's

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
to try and eliminate you know it's

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.730 
to try and eliminate you know it's
happened<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.360> past<00:01:27.479> they<00:01:28.229> had<00:01:28.320> one<00:01:28.530> game

happened in the past they had one game

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530 
happened in the past they had one game
like<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> where<00:01:29.400> starter<00:01:29.790> sworn<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> was

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
like this where starter sworn it was

failed<00:01:32.369> last<00:01:32.579> build<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> only

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
failed last build is that the only
