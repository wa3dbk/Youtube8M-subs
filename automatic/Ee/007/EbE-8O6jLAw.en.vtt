00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.189
 hello friends now I bring you a song 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.959
 for guitar this song likes 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:08.610
 many people so we will learn it to 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:10.890
 to play in a simple way but 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.390
 also quite effective 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:16.180
 these are the chords that we're going to 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:19.050
 use my biggest 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.050
 without major 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.390
 sun sustained minor 7 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.980
 F sharp higher 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.730
 F sharp his four and held sharp 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.730
 minor 7 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.010
 and you will see that it is very simple now we go 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.570
 to see the sequence of the chords for 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.180
 that you are learning 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 let's start with the intro in this part 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:49.180
 we're just going to accentuate by moving from yes to me 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 and then once more of yes to me let's see 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.870
 how it is done 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.460
 and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 do not 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.940
 for the part of the voice we will use 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:21.240
 this sequence if my sun held lower 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:25.170
 7 f sharp once more if my sun 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.920
 sustained minor 7 and sustained f we are going to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920
 see how it is done 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.090
 or not 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.929
 simple truth now we go for the part 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.609
 of the choir here we are going to make a small 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.670
 variation so pay close attention 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:11.039
 let's move on from me and let's make a 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.310
 game after fa held his 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.980
 cuatas afa sustained to happen to re 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.090
 sharp lower seven sun sharp 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.640
 lower seven and we repeat again my the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.330
 game of fa held its four fa 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:31.730
 held after re held lower sun 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.730
 sustained minor and we ended up on me 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 but 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.110
 after this he makes a variation in the 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.840
 choir where you practically play 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.180
 the only thing is that we are going to omit the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.510
 Fa held up his four let's see how 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.510
 we do 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.310
 i 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.769
 do not 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.769
 i 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.519
 then a little bridge of me like that and 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.600
 we return to me to be able to return to the 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.140
 voice 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.140
 do not 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.330
 do not 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.180
 then the whole part of the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.000
 voice the choir and the choir variation for 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.700
 end up on a bridge that goes from my to sun 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.210
 sustained minor 7 and repeated by 2 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.210
 times 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.970
 Y 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.299
 and you repeat the choir twice and you're done 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.190
 you will have the dominated song remember 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:18.229
 practice it and practice it so that you 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.120
 you can go out perfectly here 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.310
 I leave the video so you can see how 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.320
 you touch completely if you have not 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.090
 subscribed do not forget to subscribe and we 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.090
 we'll see for the next see you later
