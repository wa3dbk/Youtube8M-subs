right here now the best thing to do is

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.300 
right here now the best thing to do is
before<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.220> drain<00:01:37.549> the<00:01:37.729> fluid<00:01:38.060> out

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
before you drain the fluid out

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.710 
before you drain the fluid out
take<00:01:40.310> your<00:01:40.460> three-inch<00:01:40.820> strut<00:01:41.119> or<00:01:41.329> three<00:01:41.570> inch

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
take your three-inch strut or three inch

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.560 
take your three-inch strut or three inch
drive<00:01:41.930> socket<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:45.790> break<00:01:46.790> your<00:01:46.970> fill<00:01:47.299> plug

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
drive socket and break your fill plug

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.200 
drive socket and break your fill plug
loose<00:01:48.079> make<00:01:49.009> sure<00:01:49.159> it's<00:01:49.369> not<00:01:49.490> seized<00:01:49.790> on<00:01:49.970> there

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
loose make sure it's not seized on there

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.389 
loose make sure it's not seized on there
and<00:01:51.200> if<00:01:51.290> it<00:01:51.409> is<00:01:51.439> seized<00:01:51.799> on<00:01:51.950> there<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:52.310> you

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
and if it is seized on there then you

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.730 
and if it is seized on there then you
obviously<00:01:53.149> don't<00:01:53.270> want<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.600> drain<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.710> fluid

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.270 
obviously don't want to drain the fluid
out<00:01:55.270> so<00:01:56.270> break<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:56.750> loose<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.290> then<00:01:57.890> going

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
out so break that loose and then going

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.029 
out so break that loose and then going
to<00:01:58.430> drain<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.000> fluid

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039
