00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
 I am strong and you do not 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.790
 and from that occasion talk about how 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.680
 you saw during a bowl nearby and sizes 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.780
 the gods 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.610
 let's be brief and concise if in 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.710
 the movie mexico if it happens in 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:23.720
 big screen under everything but I do not 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.300
 I would pay and I would not pay if the movie 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.210
 comes with voices other people have 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.949
 to be with the Mexican voice dub 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.400
 of goku has to be mario's 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.710
 chestnut of the original voices of 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.840
 dragon ball z not for anything in the world I'm going 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:44.440
 to download the movie on the internet with the 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.440
 voices of the Chinese put in the sky 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.940
 I will not give any spoilers for all 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.100
 those who are new with the words 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.110
 and they do not really know what spoilers are 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 today it comes from the English word is 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.420
 by him that means to spoil 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.399

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.259

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.759
 a series that has not come out or some 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.640
 movie that is still going to be released 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:12.070

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.680
