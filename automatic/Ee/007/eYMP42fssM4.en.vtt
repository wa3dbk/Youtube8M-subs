00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
it could potentially snap off and fall

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.830 
it could potentially snap off and fall
to<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.640> ground<00:00:45.670> and<00:00:46.180> crack<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:46.750> would

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
to the ground and crack and that would

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.660 
to the ground and crack and that would
be<00:00:46.930> the<00:00:47.050> end<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.230> that<00:00:47.410> so<00:00:48.010> I<00:00:48.040> want<00:00:48.309> to<00:00:48.340> make<00:00:48.489> a

little hammock thing that'll hold on now
last<00:00:51.160> year<00:00:51.430> what<00:00:51.550> I<00:00:51.580> did<00:00:51.790> is<00:00:51.940> I<00:00:52.089> took<00:00:52.150> burlap

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
last year what I did is I took burlap

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.820 
last year what I did is I took burlap
and<00:00:53.140> some<00:00:54.570> wire<00:00:55.570> and<00:00:55.960> I<00:00:56.140> weave<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.650> wire

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
and some wire and I weave the wire

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.170 
and some wire and I weave the wire
through<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.280> burlap<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:57.909> then<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.030> went

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
through the burlap and then I went

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.939 
through the burlap and then I went
across<00:00:58.510> an<00:00:58.780> attached<00:00:59.080> ship<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.620> year<00:00:59.920> I

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
across an attached ship this year I

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.439 
across an attached ship this year I
think<00:01:00.250> I<00:01:00.339> might<00:01:00.519> actually<00:01:00.549> sew<00:01:01.089> something

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
think I might actually sew something

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.060 
think I might actually sew something
like<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.750> little<00:01:01.960> hammock<00:01:02.320> using<00:01:02.650> burlap<00:01:02.920> but

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
like a little hammock using burlap but

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.820 
like a little hammock using burlap but
with<00:01:03.190> sewing<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.930> make<00:01:05.110> it<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.290> little<00:01:05.440> more

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
with sewing to make it a little more

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.289 
with sewing to make it a little more
sturdy<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.890> not<00:01:09.130> sure<00:01:09.310> but<00:01:09.940> just<00:01:10.119> want<00:01:10.240> to

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:10.299
