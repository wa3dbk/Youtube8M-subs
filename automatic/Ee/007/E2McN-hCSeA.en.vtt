00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
bought a television that didn't have a

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:59.990 
bought a television that didn't have a
tuner<00:02:59.370> built<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.700> one<00:02:59.850> of<00:02:59.910> those

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
tuner built in one of those

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.550 
tuner built in one of those
high-definition<00:03:00.660> displays<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.230> didn't

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
high-definition displays that didn't

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
high-definition displays that didn't
have<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> tuner<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.730> perfect<00:03:03.120> because

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
have a tuner this is perfect because

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.360 
have a tuner this is perfect because
it's<00:03:03.390> got<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.660> great<00:03:04.170> digital<00:03:04.739> tuner<00:03:05.160> built

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
it's got a great digital tuner built

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.740 
it's got a great digital tuner built
right<00:03:05.519> in<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.120> right<00:03:06.269> here<00:03:06.420> this<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.600> the

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
right in this one right here this is the

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.090 
right in this one right here this is the
VGA<00:03:07.080> version<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.800> only<00:03:08.010> difference

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
VGA version that's the only difference

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.930 
VGA version that's the only difference
between<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.670> two

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
between the two

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.440 
between the two
one<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.360> VGA<00:03:09.870> one<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.739> HDMI<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:12.090> a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
one is VGA one is HDMI so if you have a

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.830 
one is VGA one is HDMI so if you have a
system<00:03:13.260> with<00:03:14.190> only<00:03:14.400> VGA<00:03:14.910> this<00:03:15.300> is<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.720> be

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
system with only VGA this is going to be

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.479 
system with only VGA this is going to be
perfect<00:03:16.230> and<00:03:16.320> then<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.680> literally<00:03:17.010> one

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
perfect and then you have literally one

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.759 
perfect and then you have literally one
touch<00:03:17.940> access<00:03:18.200> between<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:19.500> if<00:03:19.620> you're

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
touch access between it so if you're

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.130 
touch access between it so if you're
watching<00:03:19.950> if<00:03:20.700> you're<00:03:20.850> watching<00:03:21.000> TV<00:03:21.360> with<00:03:21.930> this

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.650 
watching if you're watching TV with this
remote<00:03:22.470> control<00:03:22.829> right<00:03:23.400> here<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.850> can<00:03:24.000> very

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
remote control right here you can very

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.520 
remote control right here you can very
very<00:03:24.870> quickly<00:03:25.170> switch<00:03:25.620> between<00:03:25.920> TV<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.530> your
