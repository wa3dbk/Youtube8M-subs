00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.730
 very good to all welcome to the new 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.970
 character this time it's about leisure 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.769
 I sported not know what else so nothing this 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.869
 is the character here pretty much you 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.759
 you are seeing how it is 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.709
 then bring the skin and it is not yet 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.480
 nothing in Spanish unheard of war nor 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:19.699
 the descriptions or anything so this 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.560
 will be the first video the quick look 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.039
 so let's see the war cries 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.039
 well above 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.400
 there are times the first as he is drawing 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.789
 a smiley face, although quite 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.789
 evil 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.950
 to the battle cry 2 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.650
 the dance 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.400
 and laughter 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.660
 let's go to the spells I'm with 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.840
 necromancer who is helping me to do 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.180
 the video because we're a little good 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.800
 smart and we forgot about the 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.800
 secondary account so let's go to 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.410
 start with the q as you see 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.190
 you can only throw by clicking on 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.970
 about someone you see that is the other 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.280
 pretty damn thing this looks like this 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.230
 it looks like the star wars with the meter 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.230
 moving so they see something else like that 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.130
 if the enemy is moving is not a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.680
 completely skill that if I was going to 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.930
 give here you see how he is moving 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.810
 I like he threw and he is moving not 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.520
 he came to give so I do not know if you can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.899
 advance to dominion or something but the 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.549
 truth is that it is the enemy more or less 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.050
 it's a little smart you're going to see 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.880
 dodge it 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.380
 I do not know if it 's exactly the passive it 's like that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.740
 but when you throw a skill 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.480
 then you have a double attack and it 's a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.890
 marks with the additional year and has the 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:02.280
 double attack let's go to the w at the time here 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.890
 we have the brand of the passive and its brand 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.750
 that when he was good he hit him when 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.930
 has that mark I give myself a buff or 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.680
 speed I do not know if something else because I eat 

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:16.290
 I say it is not in Spanish the e that is 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.210
 basically the movement of the movement 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.530
 extra as good the way to escape that 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:25.160
 is going to have this character 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.160
 let's show another one another double and the r 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:33.200
 As you can see I can keep moving and 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.500
 that's how I repeat it is that it reminds me 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.700
 the one of the ship 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.440
 as you can see the error has a reach 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.760
 pretty smart but one thing that is 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.470
 a little bad inside what every time 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.540
 you can not redirect and say once 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.459
 that you have thrown for a place for that 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.190
 the test is going to be launched to press 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.250
 the war again if it does not work 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.560
 at least that I know so good 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.909
 on the one hand that's the bad thing here you are 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.840
 watching the auto attacks by the way 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.840
 I think I have not shown them 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.319
 very well 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.830
 working forgiveness 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.190
 who is watching again all the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.190
 skills 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.989
 and nothing that I say that character as the 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.790
 air is what most makes me doubt 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.970
 of the character since you can not 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.379
 redirect is a little yes it is true 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.010
 that you can move but the truth is 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:32.200
 that if the enemy moves 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.630
 can not be cut let's go to the record 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.240
 while using the r 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.900
 and already but you can science me populated 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.900
 you chase him 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.290
 everything is learning to handle the enemy 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.940
 also if you more or less know how to play 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.430
 against you and surely also make you 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.050
 some if it's what it's always about 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.600
 we go to the record as I said here 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.280
 you are watching this sounds a lot to me 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.010
 that moves the swords good the swords 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.690
 no pistols like that but I do not know what 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.390
 so if you know, tell me 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.220
 in the description and good the death that 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.050
 it's going to cost a bit for the life that 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.090
 I have a bush, it kills me 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.560
 so you 're welcome when you're 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.050
 practically new dead 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.960
 I'll record again 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.650
 good good yes yes I'm already recording 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.650
 Clings 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.310
 and well it 's a pretty death 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.310
 simple 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.900
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.219
 the look generated to the new character and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.219
 see you in the next video 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.919
 he has pulled the skin 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.020
 I have the clarity 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.890
 ah 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:17.350
 and go cloth and now I kill myself 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.350
 because if clarity 9 clairvoyant 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.099
 ah 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.190
 two 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.190
 there is no
