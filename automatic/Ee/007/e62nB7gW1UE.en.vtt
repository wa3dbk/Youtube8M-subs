00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:09.070
 and well, today we are going to make a 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.890
 very typical and traditional food in 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:16.220
 Andalusia as is the salmorejo 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:18.200
 a well-made salmorejo seems to me 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.010
 one of the best things we can 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.580
 eat all year except for the 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.300
 winter months 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.240
 we are going to add to the salmorejo a 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.180
 Cured ham garnish 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.360
 preferably Iberian and hard- boiled egg 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.850
 and the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:43.670
 They are the following 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:47.540
 350 grams of dense bread with lots of crumb 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.510
 two or three days a clove of garlic 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.070
 ten cubic centimeters of vinegar 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.239
 wine 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.239
 and olive oil 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.320
 15 kilos of red tomatoes 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.240
 Salt 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.950
 200 grams of cured ham 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.780
 and the eggs 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.229
 we put a saucepan with water on the fire and 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.020
 we cook the eggs for 30 25 minutes 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:24.250
 so that they get hard we cut the bread 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 in thin slices and then chop 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.350
 these slices 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.350
 chop the slices in this way 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.600
 and we add the pieces to the pot 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.990
 Once the bread is sliced, we peel the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.790
 tomatoes 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:48.580
 we chop them and add them 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.390
 we have already added the tomato and now 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.130
 add the garlic 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:57.780
 we cut it into pieces and add it 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.780
 now we add the vinegar 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.530
 we toss some olive oil 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.530
 we started grinding with the blender 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.990
 Hello 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.100
 add a small teaspoon of salt 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.380
 now we are adding olive oil 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.380
 little by little and we keep beating 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:30.560
 we have added about 400 milliliters of 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.349
 oil and 100 milliliters of water 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.810
 and here is the final result the 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.709
 salmorejo finished 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.340
 now let's prepare the garnish 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.090
 we split the slices of ham in 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:50.360
 tiny little pieces we wait for the eggs 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.840
 hard and we chop them also tiny 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.840
 do not 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.860
 in an individual bowl we have thrown the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.090
 gazpacho 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:09.090
 and the garnish of ham and hard-boiled egg 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.090
 and here we have it ready to eat 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.630
 and well then nothing more as always 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.550
 thank you for your attention 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.550
 and we wish a happy day
