00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
have a little bit of an issue with the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.459 
have a little bit of an issue with the
face<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:35.130> looks<00:00:35.399> squished<00:00:36.059> but<00:00:36.930> that's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
face as it looks squished but that's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
face as it looks squished but that's
kind<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.340> something<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.180> deal<00:00:39.360> with

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
kind of something you got to deal with

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.100 
kind of something you got to deal with
with<00:00:39.780> cyberverse<00:00:40.379> figures<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.040> general<00:00:41.430> I

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
with cyberverse figures in general I

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.619 
with cyberverse figures in general I
find<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.260> little<00:00:43.379> odd<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.649> even<00:00:44.430> though

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
find it a little odd that even though

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.010 
find it a little odd that even though
the<00:00:45.629> one<00:00:46.170> eye<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:47.129> blue<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> other<00:00:48.329> eye<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
the one eye is blue and the other eye is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.639 
the one eye is blue and the other eye is
blackish<00:00:49.980> blue<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:51.420> looks<00:00:51.449> okay<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> think<00:00:52.379> it's

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
blackish blue it looks okay I think it's

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.880 
blackish blue it looks okay I think it's
just<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.980> paint<00:00:53.190> problem<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.510> I'm<00:00:55.350> glad<00:00:55.710> it's

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
just a paint problem but I'm glad it's

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
just a paint problem but I'm glad it's
painted<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.370> all<00:00:56.809> when<00:00:57.809> we<00:00:58.020> all<00:00:58.140> know<00:00:58.289> that
