one<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:05.970> my<00:00:06.060> passions<00:00:06.299> in<00:00:06.750> life<00:00:06.779> is

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
one of my passions in life is

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.290 
one of my passions in life is
woodworking<00:00:07.740> I<00:00:07.890> think<00:00:08.460> probably<00:00:08.639> because<00:00:09.179> it

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
woodworking I think probably because it

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.000 
woodworking I think probably because it
fulfills<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.840> caveman<00:00:10.380> instinct<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.950> I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
fulfills that caveman instinct that I

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.520 
fulfills that caveman instinct that I
have<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.700> lot<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.330> men<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:13.230> provide

need that we have in the house but
there's<00:00:19.320> something<00:00:19.650> else<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.010> has<00:00:20.100> quickly

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.589 

gardening<00:00:27.039> and<00:00:27.220> probably<00:00:28.150> for<00:00:28.300> a<00:00:28.330> lot<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.510> the

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
gardening and probably for a lot of the

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.630 
gardening and probably for a lot of the
same<00:00:28.779> reasons<00:00:28.810> as<00:00:29.260> woodworking<00:00:29.800> it<00:00:29.920> feels

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
same reasons as woodworking it feels

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.980 
same reasons as woodworking it feels
good<00:00:30.849> to<00:00:30.970> be<00:00:31.000> able<00:00:31.270> to<00:00:31.330> put<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.509> dinner<00:00:31.750> on<00:00:31.900> the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
good to be able to put a dinner on the

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.420 
good to be able to put a dinner on the
table<00:00:32.140> where<00:00:32.439> most<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.800> your<00:00:32.920> ingredients

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
table where most of your ingredients

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.090 
table where most of your ingredients
came<00:00:33.579> from<00:00:33.760> here<00:00:34.030> the<00:00:34.750> backyard<00:00:35.170> but<00:00:35.530> like<00:00:35.829> for

came from here the backyard but like for

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100 
came from here the backyard but like for
many<00:00:36.220> people<00:00:36.550> our<00:00:36.760> space<00:00:37.390> for<00:00:37.600> growing<00:00:37.780> food

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
many people our space for growing food

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.830 
many people our space for growing food
is<00:00:38.379> limited<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:39.940> recently<00:00:40.300> I've<00:00:40.449> tried<00:00:40.720> to

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:40.840 
is limited so recently I've tried to

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.259 
is limited so recently I've tried to
look<00:00:40.989> for<00:00:41.050> ways<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.680> get<00:00:41.949> more<00:00:42.250> out<00:00:42.519> of<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
look for ways to get more out of the

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.970 
look for ways to get more out of the
space<00:00:43.510> that<00:00:43.540> we<00:00:43.780> do<00:00:43.930> have<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.379> I<00:00:44.440> figure<00:00:44.800> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
space that we do have and I figure a

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.950 
space that we do have and I figure a
vertical<00:00:45.879> herb<00:00:45.970> garden<00:00:46.390> would<00:00:46.480> be<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.629> good<00:00:46.839> way

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
vertical herb garden would be a good way

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.979 
vertical herb garden would be a good way
to<00:00:46.989> do<00:00:47.199> that<00:00:48.150> when<00:00:49.150> you<00:00:49.239> think<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:49.540> materials

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
to do that when you think of materials

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.020 
to do that when you think of materials
for<00:00:50.140> any<00:00:50.260> outdoor<00:00:50.470> project<00:00:51.070> probably<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
for any outdoor project probably the

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.400 
for any outdoor project probably the
first<00:00:52.210> thing<00:00:52.360> that<00:00:52.390> comes<00:00:52.660> to<00:00:52.720> mind<00:00:52.989> is<00:00:53.170> cedar

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
first thing that comes to mind is cedar

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.049 
first thing that comes to mind is cedar
and<00:00:53.620> why<00:00:53.980> not<00:00:54.190> it's<00:00:54.370> rot<00:00:54.579> resistant

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
and why not it's rot resistant

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.939 
and why not it's rot resistant
properties<00:00:55.210> are<00:00:55.540> well<00:00:55.660> known<00:00:55.839> with<00:00:56.559> that<00:00:56.710> said

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
properties are well known with that said

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.619 
properties are well known with that said
I've<00:00:57.129> chosen<00:00:57.369> some<00:00:57.640> scrap<00:00:57.879> pine<00:00:58.119> leftover

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
I've chosen some scrap pine leftover

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.630 
I've chosen some scrap pine leftover
from<00:00:58.809> previous<00:00:59.199> projects<00:00:59.739> I'll<00:01:00.190> cut<00:01:00.430> four

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
from previous projects I'll cut four

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.640 
from previous projects I'll cut four
pieces<00:01:00.879> with<00:01:01.150> a<00:01:01.180> 15<00:01:01.510> degree<00:01:01.629> angle<00:01:01.839> for<00:01:02.470> the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:02.650 
pieces with a 15 degree angle for the

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.430 
pieces with a 15 degree angle for the
legs<00:01:02.979> to<00:01:03.190> start<00:01:03.640> yes<00:01:04.180> untreated<00:01:04.989> wood<00:01:05.170> will

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
legs to start yes untreated wood will

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.880 
legs to start yes untreated wood will
decompose<00:01:06.159> over<00:01:06.760> time<00:01:07.060> even<00:01:07.780> cedar<00:01:08.200> however

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
decompose over time even cedar however

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.410

wooden planters built out of untreated

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.390 
wooden planters built out of untreated
wood<00:01:10.659> will<00:01:11.229> probably<00:01:11.740> last<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.189> lot<00:01:12.340> longer

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 
wood will probably last a lot longer

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.469 
wood will probably last a lot longer
than<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:13.030> think

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
than you think

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.450 
than you think
I'll<00:01:14.229> mark<00:01:14.500> out<00:01:14.650> every<00:01:14.890> nine<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.400> a<00:01:15.430> half

board across the bottom to mimic the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
board across the bottom to mimic the
ground<00:02:41.129> so<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.519> get<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.700> angle<00:02:41.819> right<00:02:45.530> cut

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530

some<00:02:46.739> leg<00:02:46.950> braces<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:48.000> miter<00:02:48.209> saw

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.950 

now<00:03:11.490> I<00:03:11.520> thought<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:11.910> would<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.210> nice<00:03:12.420> depending

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
now I thought it would be nice depending

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.300 
now I thought it would be nice depending
on<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.170> type<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.350> plants<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.800> we<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.190> at

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
on the type of plants that we have at

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.550 
on the type of plants that we have at
the<00:03:14.400> time<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.570> could<00:03:15.720> easily<00:03:15.960> move<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the time if we could easily move the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.830 
the time if we could easily move the
vertical<00:03:16.980> garden<00:03:17.310> around<00:03:17.790> or<00:03:18.060> back<00:03:18.180> patio

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
vertical garden around or back patio

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.870 
vertical garden around or back patio
so<00:03:19.290> I'll<00:03:19.470> build<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.740> frame<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.550> extra

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
so I'll build a frame out of this extra

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.390 
so I'll build a frame out of this extra
two<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.180> six<00:03:24.500> after<00:03:25.500> cutting<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.980> couple<00:03:26.250> pieces

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
two by six after cutting a couple pieces

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:41.960 
two by six after cutting a couple pieces
to<00:03:26.670> length<00:03:26.790> I'll<00:03:27.210> rip<00:03:27.690> them<00:03:27.840> in<00:03:27.960> half

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.399 

cut<00:03:42.970> some<00:03:43.120> half-lap<00:03:43.480> joints<00:03:43.510> on<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.049> bandsaw

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:44.409 
cut some half-lap joints on the bandsaw

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.350 
cut some half-lap joints on the bandsaw
on<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.830> project<00:03:45.400> like<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.580> I<00:03:46.000> don't<00:03:46.209> really

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
on a project like this I don't really

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.789 
on a project like this I don't really
feel<00:03:46.569> like<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.810> need<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.049> measure<00:03:47.200> these<00:03:47.440> joints

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
feel like I need to measure these joints

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:55.880 
feel like I need to measure these joints
I'll<00:03:48.190> just<00:03:48.370> eyeball<00:03:48.519> it

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.850 

as<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:58.390> said<00:03:58.599> I'm<00:03:58.720> not<00:03:58.870> using<00:03:59.019> any<00:03:59.290> glue<00:03:59.560> on<00:03:59.769> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
as I said I'm not using any glue on the

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.680 
as I said I'm not using any glue on the
planter<00:04:00.159> portion<00:04:00.459> of<00:04:00.519> this<00:04:00.640> build<00:04:00.879> I'll<00:04:01.360> use

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
planter portion of this build I'll use

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.030 
planter portion of this build I'll use
it<00:04:01.840> here<00:04:02.049> because<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.560> base<00:04:02.769> needs

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
it here because if the base needs

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.780 
it here because if the base needs
replacing

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
replacing

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:15.520 
replacing
I'll<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:04.180> replace<00:04:04.390> the<00:04:04.569> whole<00:04:04.690> thing

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.870 

I've<00:04:16.530> moved<00:04:16.799> everything<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.549> back<00:04:17.670> patio

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
I've moved everything to the back patio

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.330 
I've moved everything to the back patio
so<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.299> can<00:04:18.480> attach<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:19.019> bottom<00:04:19.290> frame<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.799> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
so I can attach the bottom frame and the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:32.150 
so I can attach the bottom frame and the
casters<00:04:29.870> these<00:04:30.870> are<00:04:31.050> three<00:04:31.290> inch<00:04:31.470> locking

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
casters these are three inch locking

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.280

obviously cedar or some other resistant
type<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.139> wood<00:04:55.349> would<00:04:55.500> prolong<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.949> life<00:04:56.099> of<00:04:56.250> a

type of wood would prolong the life of a
project<00:04:56.550> like<00:04:56.849> this<00:04:56.909> I<00:04:57.300> figure<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.900> cost<00:04:58.050> of

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
project like this I figure the cost of

00:04:58.319 --> 00:04:59.809 
project like this I figure the cost of
cedar<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.710> my<00:04:58.860> area<00:04:59.190> would<00:04:59.400> run<00:04:59.550> a<00:04:59.580> project

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
cedar in my area would run a project

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.450 
cedar in my area would run a project
like<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.150> right<00:05:00.599> around<00:05:00.720> $300<00:05:01.530> this<00:05:02.159> however

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
like this right around $300 this however

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.640 
like this right around $300 this however
