00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.300 
weight I forgot to look at the titanium
spork<00:01:33.270> but<00:01:34.189> these<00:01:35.189> things<00:01:35.490> are<00:01:35.640> almost<00:01:35.759> paper

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
spork but these things are almost paper

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.679 
spork but these things are almost paper
paperweight<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.580> mean<00:01:38.790> they're<00:01:39.470> really<00:01:40.470> really

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
paperweight I mean they're really really

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:50.690 
paperweight I mean they're really really
light<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> mean<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:46.259> barely<00:01:46.470> even<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.630> mean<00:01:49.700> very

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
light I mean you barely even I mean very

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.440 
light I mean you barely even I mean very
but<00:01:51.479> they're<00:01:51.630> pretty<00:01:51.840> strong<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.409> mean

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:06.100 

for<00:01:56.450> as<00:01:56.720> long<00:01:57.020> as<00:01:57.170> they<00:01:57.290> are

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:13.420

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
and I guess the ends have an m3 m4 m5

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.640 
and I guess the ends have an m3 m4 m5
