00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.070

 used in many of my videos 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.350
 it's not the second 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.050
 at just 34 dollars is what makes 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.420
 that each color comes from invited 50 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.360
 which is extremely affordable for 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.330
 dark poker quality and quantity 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.069

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.939
 interviews make up for ever be 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:33.649
 sell at $ 20 if I'm wrong so 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.899
 it's for people who have a small 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.170
 budget and who want to have colors 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.600
 very bright makes it very opaque and for those 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.340
 who would like to have inspirations 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 makeup to follow them on their page 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.049
 facebook are still in the process of 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.850
 share nor makeup that some 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.799
 artists are doing using their 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 cosmetics and her breast is really and 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.430
 this land and I did not see their form 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.049
 courageous daring 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.310
 so here I think it's all 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.659
 ten years ago it is welcome angers 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.249
 easy husband to have sponsored or 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.859
 but look side do not forget that you 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:07.740
 can follow me on facebook and on a 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:09.569
 approval is a sale of information 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.720
 will be as always in the bar of 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.720
 torsion 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 to start it's a make-up 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.950
 let's apply this plan there at the corner 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.950
 inside 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.090
 then using a flat brush and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.550
 years I apply this eyelid opa a 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.410
 yellow to half of the eyelid 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.010
 mobile to apply colors 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.900
 vibrant 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.160
 it is better to make the class 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.160
 rather than extending it 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.960
 I follow with the orange color that 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.440
 I apply on the center of my eyelid 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.480
 mobile 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.490
 I also take care to mix 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:04.260
 this color with the yellow to create 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:05.790
 a degraded effect if necessary returned with 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.570
 yellow to mix colors 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.570
 together 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.510
 now for the outside of my 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.890
 mobile eyelid I go with this red 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.480
 using the same techniques 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.480
 only with the other two colors 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:35.830
 I trace the location of my little to 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.590
 using a black pencil my goal is to 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.080
 create a kind of year formans and who 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.780
 comes connected malling the style up 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.540
 my thought is to trace my thought to 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.920
 pencil will give more details 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.750
 depth and a pact in the shade to 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.990
 black eyelids that managed apply 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.990
 then 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.830
 as promised I apply a shadow to 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.710
 matte black eyelids 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.340
 with a precise brush over 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.900
 the pencil line I just made 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.640
 this will aim to give a little 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.970
 more dimension in his make-ups 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.970
 colorful 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.660
 once the floods traced I come on 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.700
 melt using this shadow to 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.230
 purple eyelids of this group he that 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.180
 I also apply in the well itself 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.390
 find that I left between the red and 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.390
 black 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.300
 as you see I also use 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.380
 this eye shadow to degrade the 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.380
 hollow towards the exit 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:58.489
 if necessary come and touch others 

00:04:53.989 --> 00:05:00.679
 colors I use a soft brush 

00:04:58.489 --> 00:05:03.529
 to further degrade the color 

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:06.799
 violet vermont eyebrows small trick 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:08.719
 to prevent your color from rising too much 

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:10.399
 up when you degrade done 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.709
 pay attention to the angle of your brush 

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:15.529
 avoid that your brush and an angle 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:17.509
 downwards rather use upwards 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.579
 to keep the color focused where she 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:21.319
 is here for a more handsome grade and 

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:23.419
 I use not provoked color 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:25.839
 of my skin that I apply on the edge of 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.839
 bad 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:31.099
 I follow by drawing in malignant black 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.619
 lower and also malignant eyelashes 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:36.069
 of water this will give depth to 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:36.069
 my look 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.150
 to make sure that the ride is well into 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.040
 place I go with my little brush and 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.950
 my matte black eye shadow that 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.720
 I apply lighthouse of pencil subjects then 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.910
 I fund it all down in 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.710
 using one retains vialette more 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.710
 early by connecting everything up 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.530
 for aytré makeup to 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.760
 outside and give the impression that 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.100
 I have a lot more eyes the angel 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:13.120
 that they are actually I use this 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.120
 blue light shadow 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.540
 always be aware of the form 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:20.400
 that this gives your makeup no 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.280
 not pulling too much down but also 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.780
 to the top 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.730
 finally here is the last color that 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.590
 I use in this makeup games 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.850
 the apico outside corner and I pull them 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:35.780
 to the temples again I'm doing 

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:38.190
 be careful to mix well with the blue 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.530
 I finalize with a touch of joining 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:48.210
 at the bottom inner corner and one more than 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:50.340

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.570
 I just have to spend better black 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.950
 to create a small layer of mascara and 

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:57.950

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:11.639
 for the color of my days I am 

00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:11.639
 just the same rose from earlier 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.420
 to eliminate the top of the cheekbone 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:23.760
 I use this powder by mc I find 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.650

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:29.220
