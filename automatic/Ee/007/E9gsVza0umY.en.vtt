one<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> first<00:00:43.020> tests<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.040> we<00:00:44.190> do<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
one of the first tests that we do is to

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.260 
one of the first tests that we do is to
use<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.510> test<00:00:46.469> LCD<00:00:47.160> screen<00:00:47.489> about<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
use a test LCD screen about we know to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.569 
use a test LCD screen about we know to
be<00:00:48.629> working<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:50.039> make<00:00:50.190> sure<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.460> isn't

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be working just to make sure it isn't

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.479 
be working just to make sure it isn't
just<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.030> LCD<00:00:51.600> screen<00:00:51.660> now<00:00:52.530> using<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.219> which

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
just the LCD screen now using this which

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
just the LCD screen now using this which
is<00:00:53.640> one<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.910> our<00:00:54.059> own<00:00:54.329> screens<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.199> see

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
is one of our own screens you can see

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.830 
is one of our own screens you can see
quite<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.770> few<00:00:55.829> marks<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.610> from<00:00:56.820> being<00:00:57.629> well

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
quite a few marks on it from being well

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.270 
quite a few marks on it from being well
used<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.469> hope<00:00:58.710> we<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.949> see<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.699> time

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
used I hope we can see the time

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.350 
used I hope we can see the time
dangerous<00:01:02.280> around<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:05.060> but<00:01:06.060> yeah<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
dangerous around here but yeah that is

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.670 
dangerous around here but yeah that is
time<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.720> wouldn't<00:01:09.990> see<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.200> sort<00:01:10.619> of

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
time then I wouldn't see that sort of

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.810 
time then I wouldn't see that sort of
going<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:11.040> as<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.430> press<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> power<00:01:12.000> button<00:01:12.150> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
going on as I press the power button and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.240 
going on as I press the power button and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the way that it worked around here with

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.410 
the way that it worked around here with
no<00:01:38.700> test<00:01:39.329> we've<00:01:39.720> tested<00:01:40.340> this<00:01:41.340> component<00:01:42.270> here

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
no test we've tested this component here

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.260 
no test we've tested this component here
to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.810> sort<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.409> burnt<00:01:43.619> out<00:01:43.890> faulty<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:45.090> one

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
to be sort of burnt out faulty it's one

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.880 
to be sort of burnt out faulty it's one
of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.450> components<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.140> handles<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
of the components that handles the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
of the components that handles the
backlight<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.610> there's<00:01:48.149> no<00:01:48.240> continuity

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
backlight and there's no continuity

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.200 
backlight and there's no continuity
going<00:01:49.170> through<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.640> has<00:01:50.880> failed

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going through it so it also has failed

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.490 
going through it so it also has failed
