00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
looked online at a lot of pictures so I

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.680 
looked online at a lot of pictures so I
when<00:03:38.860> I<00:03:38.890> had<00:03:39.100> first<00:03:39.400> carved<00:03:39.910> it<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.120> made<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.510> a

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
when I had first carved it I made it a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.870 
when I had first carved it I made it a
little<00:03:40.720> boxy<00:03:41.560> looking<00:03:42.010> so<00:03:42.280> I<00:03:42.310> went<00:03:42.640> back<00:03:42.820> again

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
little boxy looking so I went back again

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.260 
little boxy looking so I went back again
and<00:03:43.390> carved<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.380> off<00:03:44.590> from<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.160> front<00:03:45.400> here<00:03:46.240> a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
and carved it off from the front here a

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.320 
and carved it off from the front here a
little<00:03:46.510> bit<00:03:46.750> more<00:03:47.580> where<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.670> windows<00:03:49.000> front

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
little bit more where the windows front

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.020 
little bit more where the windows front
windows<00:03:49.630> are<00:03:50.070> what<00:03:51.070> actually<00:03:51.460> narrows<00:03:51.850> out

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
windows are what actually narrows out

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:00.150

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
psychedelic colors but I didn't want to

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.500

designs were gonna be psychedelic and I

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:32.020 
designs were gonna be psychedelic and I
thought<00:05:29.930> it<00:05:30.080> would<00:05:30.140> blend<00:05:31.130> in<00:05:31.340> too<00:05:31.640> much<00:05:31.790> or

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
thought it would blend in too much or

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.120 
thought it would blend in too much or
clash<00:05:34.360> so<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.720> just<00:05:35.930> decided<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.710> go<00:05:36.920> to<00:05:36.980> the

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130
