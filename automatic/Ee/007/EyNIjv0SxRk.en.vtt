really quick reloads and when you add

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.170 
really quick reloads and when you add
speed<00:01:19.780> cola<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.290> double<00:01:20.619> tap<00:01:20.799> it<00:01:21.670> might<00:01:21.970> be

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
speed cola and double tap it might be

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.210 
speed cola and double tap it might be
considered<00:01:22.780> as<00:01:22.930> even<00:01:23.320> its<00:01:23.470> overpowered<00:01:24.100> I

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
considered as even its overpowered I

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890 
considered as even its overpowered I
would<00:01:24.430> say<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.820> don't<00:01:25.000> know<00:01:25.180> because<00:01:25.510> it's<00:01:25.689> very

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
would say I don't know because it's very

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.929 
would say I don't know because it's very
unusual<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.500> Treyarch<00:01:27.070> would<00:01:27.340> add<00:01:27.670> that

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
unusual that Treyarch would add that

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.140 
unusual that Treyarch would add that
much<00:01:28.210> ammo<00:01:28.630> in<00:01:28.780> in<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.260> world<00:01:29.500> weapon<00:01:29.890> but

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
much ammo in in the world weapon but

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.460 
much ammo in in the world weapon but
it's<00:01:31.150> cool<00:01:31.799> we<00:01:32.799> like<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.509> with<00:01:34.509> these<00:01:34.750> three

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
it's cool we like it so with these three

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.580 
it's cool we like it so with these three
new<00:01:35.799> weapons<00:01:36.490> there<00:01:36.700> are<00:01:36.880> 14<00:01:37.509> wall<00:01:37.930> weapons<00:01:38.380> in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
new weapons there are 14 wall weapons in

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.280 
new weapons there are 14 wall weapons in
the<00:01:38.710> total<00:01:39.130> including<00:01:39.610> bowie<00:01:40.000> knife<00:01:40.299> galvan

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
the total including bowie knife galvan

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.980 
the total including bowie knife galvan
necklace<00:01:41.650> and<00:01:41.860> semtex<00:01:42.159> grenades<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.060> some<00:01:43.840> of

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
necklace and semtex grenades and some of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.050 
necklace and semtex grenades and some of
these<00:01:44.140> weapons<00:01:44.380> were<00:01:44.740> really<00:01:45.159> hard<00:01:45.549> to<00:01:45.759> find

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
these weapons were really hard to find

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.330 
these weapons were really hard to find
because<00:01:46.240> for<00:01:46.689> example<00:01:46.810> bowie<00:01:47.350> knife<00:01:47.619> was<00:01:47.950> in

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
because for example bowie knife was in

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.560 
because for example bowie knife was in
the<00:01:48.880> elevator<00:01:49.119> shaft<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.110> that's<00:01:50.920> not<00:01:51.130> very

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
the elevator shaft and that's not very

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.810 
the elevator shaft and that's not very
visible<00:01:52.570> spot<00:01:52.960> so<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.229> have<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.619> be<00:01:53.829> in<00:01:54.130> this

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
visible spot so you have to be in this

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.630 
visible spot so you have to be in this
elevator<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:56.409> need<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.710> go<00:01:56.890> all<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.400> way

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
elevator and you need to go all the way

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.200 
elevator and you need to go all the way
up<00:01:57.939> in<00:01:58.299> order<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.659> buy<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.350> bowie<00:01:59.740> knife<00:02:00.040> and<00:02:00.340> if

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
up in order to buy a bowie knife and if

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.940 
up in order to buy a bowie knife and if
you<00:02:01.420> would<00:02:01.630> compare<00:02:01.869> bowie<00:02:02.350> knife<00:02:02.680> with

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
you would compare bowie knife with

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.980 
you would compare bowie knife with
governor<00:02:03.460> calls<00:02:03.700> on<00:02:03.880> this<00:02:04.060> map<00:02:04.270> i<00:02:04.509> don't<00:02:04.780> think

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
governor calls on this map i don't think

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.810 
governor calls on this map i don't think
it<00:02:05.170> really<00:02:05.409> does<00:02:05.710> make<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.280> much<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.579> a

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
it really does make that much of a

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.999 
it really does make that much of a
difference<00:02:07.270> because<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.869> know<00:02:08.009> governor

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
difference because I know governor

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.949 
difference because I know governor
clothes<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.399> stronger<00:02:09.909> and<00:02:10.119> can<00:02:10.479> kill<00:02:10.719> the

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
clothes is stronger and can kill the

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.979 
clothes is stronger and can kill the
zombies<00:02:11.349> but<00:02:11.650> as<00:02:12.519> for<00:02:12.999> the<00:02:13.269> special<00:02:13.749> round

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
zombies but as for the special round

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.510 
zombies but as for the special round
later<00:02:14.769> rounds<00:02:15.010> the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
later rounds the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.150 
later rounds the
pink<00:02:15.760> rollers<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.840> more<00:02:17.110> health<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:17.740> you

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
pink rollers have more health and you

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160 
pink rollers have more health and you
will<00:02:18.340> kill<00:02:18.580> them<00:02:18.760> either<00:02:18.970> with<00:02:19.270> two<00:02:19.510> hits<00:02:19.720> of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
will kill them either with two hits of

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.560 
will kill them either with two hits of
bowie<00:02:20.440> knife<00:02:20.770> or<00:02:21.130> two<00:02:21.430> hits<00:02:21.640> from<00:02:22.060> Galvan

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
bowie knife or two hits from Galvan

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.290 
bowie knife or two hits from Galvan
ackles<00:02:22.930> so<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.770> really<00:02:24.070> doesn't<00:02:24.370> not<00:02:25.030> make

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
ackles so it really doesn't not make

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.960 
ackles so it really doesn't not make
that<00:02:25.540> much<00:02:25.780> difference<00:02:25.840> but<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:27.190> course<00:02:27.760> we've

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
that much difference but of course we've

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150 
that much difference but of course we've
got<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.240> knuckle<00:02:28.750> so<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.140> punch<00:02:29.410> them<00:02:29.650> faster

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
got a knuckle so you punch them faster

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.150 
got a knuckle so you punch them faster
so<00:02:30.460> so<00:02:31.240> I<00:02:31.270> don't<00:02:31.630> know<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.380> really<00:02:32.620> up<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.040> you

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so so I don't know it's really up to you

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.390 
so so I don't know it's really up to you
guys<00:02:33.190> what<00:02:34.000> your<00:02:34.270> preferences<00:02:35.080> are<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.710> the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
guys what your preferences are and the

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.430 
guys what your preferences are and the
interesting<00:02:37.120> thing<00:02:37.150> is<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.780> all<00:02:38.200> these

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
interesting thing is that all these

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.950 
interesting thing is that all these
special<00:02:38.920> weapons<00:02:39.220> or<00:02:39.700> most<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.270> them<00:02:40.390> are<00:02:40.660> on

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
special weapons or most of them are on

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.080 
special weapons or most of them are on
the<00:02:40.990> roof<00:02:41.350> like<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.370> roof<00:02:42.550> there<00:02:42.850> are

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the roof like on the roof there are

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.850 
the roof like on the roof there are
claymores<00:02:43.780> there<00:02:44.200> are<00:02:44.440> syntax<00:02:45.040> grenades<00:02:45.520> and

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
claymores there are syntax grenades and

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.400 
claymores there are syntax grenades and
also<00:02:47.860> bowie<00:02:48.100> knife<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.060> shaft<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.840> for

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
also bowie knife in the shaft is for

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.560 
also bowie knife in the shaft is for
semtex<00:02:50.710> grenades<00:02:51.040> I<00:02:51.610> think<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.150> would<00:02:52.330> always

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
semtex grenades I think I would always

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.050 
semtex grenades I think I would always
buy<00:02:53.020> them<00:02:53.290> because<00:02:53.530> normal<00:02:54.400> grenades<00:02:54.790> can

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
buy them because normal grenades can

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.380 
buy them because normal grenades can
roll<00:02:55.600> down<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:57.190> roll<00:02:57.460> off<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.730> roof<00:02:58.090> and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
roll down and can roll off the roof and

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.480 
roll down and can roll off the roof and
the<00:02:58.660> miss<00:02:58.870> miss<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.530> zombies<00:02:59.890> so<00:03:00.130> I<00:03:00.160> would

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
the miss miss the zombies so I would

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.580 
the miss miss the zombies so I would
always<00:03:00.700> buy<00:03:01.060> some<00:03:01.390> taxes<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.140> last<00:03:02.350> wall

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
always buy some taxes and the last wall

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.550 
always buy some taxes and the last wall

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.059 

okay<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.810> next<00:03:12.020> thing<00:03:12.200> I<00:03:12.500> want<00:03:12.739> to<00:03:12.830> show<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.759 
okay the next thing I want to show you
guys<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.790> this<00:03:13.819> video<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.870> Box<00:03:15.140> locations

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
guys in this video are the Box locations

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.550 
guys in this video are the Box locations
so<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.790> first<00:03:17.060> box<00:03:17.300> location<00:03:17.930> is<00:03:18.080> right<00:03:18.379> to

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
so the first box location is right to

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640 
so the first box location is right to
the<00:03:18.709> m16<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.879> it's<00:03:20.300> upside<00:03:20.840> down<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.440> it's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
the m16 and it's upside down so it's

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.040 
the m16 and it's upside down so it's
really<00:03:21.890> hard<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.730> see<00:03:22.970> at<00:03:23.120> first<00:03:23.390> if<00:03:23.690> you<00:03:23.810> just

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
really hard to see at first if you just

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.839 
really hard to see at first if you just
pass<00:03:24.290> by<00:03:24.319> you<00:03:24.650> might<00:03:25.250> miss<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
pass by you might miss it

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.759 
pass by you might miss it
so<00:03:26.120> that<00:03:26.330> means<00:03:26.569> it's<00:03:26.900> on<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.260> ceiling<00:03:27.739> so

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
so that means it's on the ceiling so

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.309 
so that means it's on the ceiling so
just<00:03:28.310> look<00:03:28.489> up<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.209> will<00:03:29.420> be<00:03:29.630> able<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:30.140> hit

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
just look up and you will be able to hit

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.350 
just look up and you will be able to hit
it<00:03:30.349> the<00:03:30.920> second<00:03:31.310> location<00:03:31.459> where<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.150> books

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
it the second location where the books

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.540 
it the second location where the books
can<00:03:32.569> spawn<00:03:33.019> after<00:03:33.590> you<00:03:33.739> get<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.040> teddy<00:03:34.250> bear

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:34.550
