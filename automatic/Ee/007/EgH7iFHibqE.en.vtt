get my hands on one to really kind of

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
get my hands on one to really kind of
check<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.649> compare<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.430> some<00:00:35.700> of

the<00:00:35.850> other<00:00:36.059> pit<00:00:36.329> mats<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.660> I've<00:00:36.840> owned<00:00:37.110> in

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
the other pit mats that I've owned in

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560 
the other pit mats that I've owned in
the<00:00:37.380> past<00:00:37.649> now<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> purpose<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.030> pit<00:00:39.210> mat<00:00:39.390> is

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
the past now the purpose of a pit mat is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
the past now the purpose of a pit mat is
basically<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.260> have<00:00:40.500> a<00:00:40.890> good<00:00:41.850> working<00:00:42.210> surface

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
basically to have a good working surface

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.200 
basically to have a good working surface
when<00:00:43.140> you're<00:00:43.260> working<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.829> RC<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.550> so

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
when you're working on your RC and so

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.760 
when you're working on your RC and so
that<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.750> pretty<00:00:46.079> much<00:00:46.170> contain

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
that you can pretty much contain

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.330 
that you can pretty much contain
everything<00:00:47.340> by<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.750> surface<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.920> pit<00:00:50.160> mat

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
everything by the surface of the pit mat

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.910 
everything by the surface of the pit mat
this<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:50.820> being<00:00:51.059> kind<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.570> rubbery<00:00:52.350> texture

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
this one being kind of a rubbery texture

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.060 
this one being kind of a rubbery texture
and<00:00:53.250> also<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.930> know<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.649> said<00:00:55.860> keep

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
and also too you know like I said keep

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.020 
and also too you know like I said keep
everything<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.699> place

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
everything in one place

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.389 
everything in one place
so<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.989> here<00:00:58.199> we<00:00:58.350> do<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.949> proline

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
so right here we do have the proline

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.369 
so right here we do have the proline
version<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.059> thing<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.930> kind<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like a hard plastic on the top and if

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.749 
like a hard plastic on the top and if
you<00:01:40.560> combine<00:01:41.040> that<00:01:41.070> with<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.000> proline<00:01:43.759> car

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
you combine that with like a proline car

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.090 
you combine that with like a proline car
stand<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.360> moves<00:01:45.689> around<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:46.140> little<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
stand it moves around a little bit and I

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.490 
stand it moves around a little bit and I
didn't<00:01:47.729> quite<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.149> that<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.320> great

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
didn't quite like that so this was great

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
didn't quite like that so this was great
when<00:01:49.829> I'm<00:01:49.950> building<00:01:50.280> shocks<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.939> things<00:01:51.090> like

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.280 
when I'm building shocks and things like
that<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.750> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:51.990> contains<00:01:52.500> any<00:01:53.159> type<00:01:53.520> of

I if you guys haven't already checked
out<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.769> proline<00:02:34.560> video<00:02:35.560> they<00:02:35.739> did<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.069> was

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
out the proline video they did it was

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.350 
out the proline video they did it was
kind<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.430> like<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:37.030> still<00:02:37.510> frame<00:02:37.870> or<00:02:38.459> I<00:02:39.459> can't

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
kind of like a a still frame or I can't

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
kind of like a a still frame or I can't
think<00:02:40.540> of<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.690> name<00:02:41.080> of<00:02:41.110> it<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.500> where<00:02:42.220> they

think of the name of it but where they

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.770 
think of the name of it but where they
take<00:02:42.489> lots<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.910> photos<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.420> then<00:02:43.510> kind<00:02:43.720> of

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
take lots of photos and then kind of

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.620 
take lots of photos and then kind of
combine<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.380> into<00:02:44.800> like<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.040> video<00:02:45.549> which<00:02:46.480> was

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.090 
combine it into like a video which was
really<00:02:46.810> cool<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.410> they<00:02:47.470> kind<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.709> had<00:02:47.860> things

really cool and they kind of had things

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.490 
really cool and they kind of had things
entering<00:02:48.700> into<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.330> scene<00:02:49.569> and<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:50.319> know<00:02:50.440> you

as the size on this thing I'm trying to
get<00:03:35.079> this<00:03:35.200> thing<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.620> roll<00:03:36.340> out<00:03:36.549> it<00:03:36.790> still<00:03:37.030> kind

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
get this thing to roll out it still kind

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.569 
get this thing to roll out it still kind
of<00:03:37.359> has<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:39.660> initial<00:03:40.660> roll<00:03:41.160> to<00:03:42.160> it<00:03:42.190> there<00:03:42.459> we

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
of has the initial roll to it there we

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.539 
of has the initial roll to it there we
go<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.780> size<00:03:44.079> wise<00:03:44.109> this<00:03:44.680> thing<00:03:44.950> measures<00:03:45.340> out

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
go so size wise this thing measures out
