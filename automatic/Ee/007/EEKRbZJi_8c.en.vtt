00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 Hi, I 'm Mona Lisa. 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.230
 Have you had the opportunity to 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 experience a click here 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.760
 not yet rest easy because I 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.880
 I'll tell you all about this news 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.250
 that will leave you with mouth water and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.410
 Please take the time to clarify this. 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410
 it's a keith field it 's a prequel 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.760
 the pkk that follows a different concept 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.730
 because with a bite you taste a 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.719
 Perfect combination of dough filling and 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.870
 roof 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.420
 the idea of ​​revolutionizing the format and 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.940
 taste of the traditional ones that I stayed ex 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.540
 came from the couple william and priscila storino 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.449
 aguiar 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.989
 a couple in love with sweets and also 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.060
 for healthy cooking while taking the course 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.369
 net or any in new york to priscilla 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.270
 wondered why there is no field that 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:16.590
 small because you do not want it healthy with 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.539
 dough filling and topping harmoniously 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 distributed in a unique experience 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:26.050
 so the mayor was born the size of the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.009
 cake is really one of the differentials of 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.530
 brand 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.899
 they are only three and a half centimeters 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.179
 and the mass 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.280
 I was impressed by the texture of the 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.289
 mass and the best is to lead 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.640
 lighter ingredients 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.369
 you can be with 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:44.979
 tranquility that variety that only 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.800
 apply without offering the 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.039
 elegance is not a true banquet 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.530
 to the eyes while proving a freak 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:57.340
 we can gradually feel the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.970
 I like the ever very soft damp batter 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.899
 delicious filling that always surprises 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.479
 in each flavor that also in the cover 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.209
 I explained that they lead to their composition 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.580
 pieces of seasonal fruit 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:15.310
 sophisticated jams and Belgian chocolates 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.980
 besides natural ingredients and 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.379
 certificates such as sugar 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.920
 would have been much healthier than 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.860
 refined and sea salt and for those who love 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.709
 a candy but that's the fear of getting fat 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.920
 It's another secret, I explained. 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:36.310
 made of adding eggs and milk 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.150
 and all this without wasting album of the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.060
 foods 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.519
 as part of the careful process of 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.329
 production in the first million 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.840
 made a point of obtaining certification 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.510
 cache 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.030
 this means that the whole store is 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.670
 accompanied by a second Friday by a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.670
 supervisor of the Jewish kitchen as 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.579
 send the tradition is this person who called 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:14.959
 the oven and the stove and checks the 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:18.290
 food daily at the picket store 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.870
 the typical European sophistication with 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.659
 New York's modernity bringing the 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:26.450
 Best of each of these universes to 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.819
 eating a picket in the store the feeling is 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.670
 that you are in the streets of Paris or in 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.870
 villages in new york a real 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.870
 dining experience 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.849
 it is no wonder that the store is situated 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.799
 in the heart of the higienópolis neighborhood in 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:45.949
 avenue higienópolis near the mall 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.549
 with the most charming points of the capital 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.549
 paulista 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.840
 When you arrive at the store you will be received 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.890
 helpful and attentive staff 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.930
 to customers' palate 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.420
 you will come across many flavors 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.200
 of cupcakes and will be able to eat 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.180
 want to 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.889
 or you can also select 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.070
 some to take home 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:23.730
 I'm also very impressed with the 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.410
 delicacy of packaging beijing 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.960
 developed especially for 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.600
 all the little ones are intact in the 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.480
 inside the boxes during transport 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.820
 so when you come into their house they 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.770
 They're exactly the way you saw it. 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.320
 a store 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.510
 the design of the packaging even 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.850
 the use of bags but if it is 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:49.030
 necessary the store provides a 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.639
 100% recyclable solution 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.419
 good now you already know what a pique 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:55.389
 huh 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.640
 are more than 80 tastes more delicious 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.180
 The other one's all here in the store. 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:04.180
 waiting for you with mouth water, huh? 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.860

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.120
 meeting with my little one who 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.960
 favorite than the animation for the line with 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.740
