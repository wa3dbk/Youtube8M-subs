00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
holes up either side with the lug bolts

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.830 
holes up either side with the lug bolts
are<00:01:25.160> hold<00:01:25.340> them<00:01:25.550> in<00:01:25.670> these<00:01:25.940> are<00:01:26.180> removed<00:01:26.540> with

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
are hold them in these are removed with

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.140 
are hold them in these are removed with
an<00:01:26.960> allen<00:01:27.260> key<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.190> didn't<00:01:28.400> set<00:01:28.640> them<00:01:28.790> up<00:01:28.970> and

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
an allen key you didn't set them up and

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.180 
an allen key you didn't set them up and
down<00:01:29.330> to<00:01:29.570> suit<00:01:29.840> whichever<00:01:30.290> size<00:01:30.619> boot<00:01:30.979> your

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
down to suit whichever size boot your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.370 
down to suit whichever size boot your
head<00:01:31.340> at<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.940> moment<00:01:32.000> they're<00:01:32.450> preset<00:01:32.990> size

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
head at the moment they're preset size

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.130 
head at the moment they're preset size
nine<00:01:33.710> because<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.160> happens<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.490> be<00:01:34.520> my<00:01:34.760> size

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
nine because that happens to be my size

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.540 
nine because that happens to be my size
so<00:01:36.140> that's<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.440> simple<00:01:36.649> way<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:37.009> move<00:01:37.310> them

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
so that's a simple way to move them

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.280 
so that's a simple way to move them
about<00:01:38.380> that's<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.530> function<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:41.570> bindings<00:01:42.110> but

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
about that's a function the bindings but

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.460 
about that's a function the bindings but
all<00:01:42.440> snow<00:01:42.740> boots<00:01:43.070> vary<00:01:43.490> in<00:01:43.700> size<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:48.290> hill

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
all snow boots vary in size on the hill

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.080 
all snow boots vary in size on the hill
when<00:01:48.680> a<00:01:48.710> toe<00:01:48.950> plate<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.399> have<00:01:49.550> these<00:01:49.729> lugs

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
when a toe plate we have these lugs

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
when a toe plate we have these lugs
these<00:01:50.450> lugs<00:01:50.780> can<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.140> adjusted<00:01:51.649> with<00:01:51.680> one<00:01:51.979> or

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
these lugs can be adjusted with one or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.740 
these lugs can be adjusted with one or
two<00:01:52.130> turns<00:01:52.520> up<00:01:53.500> or<00:01:54.500> down<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.940> fine-tune<00:01:56.720> the

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
two turns up or down to fine-tune the

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.499 
two turns up or down to fine-tune the
bindings<00:01:57.410> to<00:01:57.530> suit<00:01:57.770> your<00:01:58.009> boots<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.240> a<00:01:59.300> very

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
bindings to suit your boots it's a very

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.050 
bindings to suit your boots it's a very
simple<00:01:59.750> procedure<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.979> best<00:02:01.340> done<00:02:01.580> probably

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
simple procedure is best done probably

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.790 
simple procedure is best done probably
on<00:02:02.149> the<00:02:02.240> kitchen<00:02:02.420> table<00:02:02.899> at<00:02:02.990> home<00:02:03.140> or<00:02:03.350> suggest

on the kitchen table at home or suggest

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.060 
on the kitchen table at home or suggest
rather<00:02:04.130> than<00:02:04.460> out<00:02:04.610> on<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:04.850> slopes<00:02:05.060> at<00:02:05.300> all<00:02:06.070> but

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
rather than out on the slopes at all but

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.560 
rather than out on the slopes at all but
it's<00:02:07.190> a<00:02:07.220> very<00:02:07.399> quick<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:07.910> simple<00:02:08.060> maneuver

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
it's a very quick and simple maneuver

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.270 
it's a very quick and simple maneuver
once<00:02:08.780> you've<00:02:08.959> done<00:02:09.140> this<00:02:09.380> your<00:02:09.590> preset<00:02:10.100> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
once you've done this your preset and
