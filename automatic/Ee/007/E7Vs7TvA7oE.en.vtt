00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.310
 of his days 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.310
 well back 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.720
 of his days 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.780
 dizziness 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.940
 two 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.050
 plus 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.029
 hello to all of all guys and girls of 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.280
 youtube I am my being me and I bring you a 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.310
 video in which I'm going to talk about the 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.960
 final we could tell you already end is 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.989
 true that it is not confirmed yet 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.629
 the semifinals the round but with the 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.750
 results that we already saw the 40 's going on 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.610
 against the barça and 41 out of pocket 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.910
 of the moon against madrid is almost 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.100
 sentenced that the bayern munich versus 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.750
 the bonus will be armed will be the final in 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.670
 Wembley of this 2013 champions 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.860
 let's talk in this video about the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.200
 what seems to us this final and also 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.540
 about those that can hold us but 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.790
 let's start at the beginning for me the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.810
 barcelona this year has lost the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.899
 category or we can say the post of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.000
 best team in the world and its relief has 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.860
 been the bayern of Munich has 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.830
 demonstrated playing against Barcelona and 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.450
 practically apalizando in his party and 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.659
 he has shown it throughout 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.729
 of your whole season conjugate that is 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.310
 as a coach that by the way the year 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.130
 that is coming will not continue what has changed 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.990
 by pep guardiola it's true that I've done 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 a dream season but I do not know why 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.979
 what have they changed for pep guardiola and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.310
 good conjugate that is as a coach 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.799
 they've got the league long before 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.689
 that ends with 20 points of 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.610
 difference with the second in your league that 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.200
 is now borussia dortmund is 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.049
 say that between the two teams the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.740
 final of the champions bowling and bayern there 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.799
 20 points of difference in the league 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.130
 German on the other hand we should say that 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.890
 this match can bring us big 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.500
 things and why then because Borussia 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.329
 dortmund when he looks like he has 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.730
 demonstrated with the team against 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.650
 madrid forgiveness that clearly exceeded 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.290
 in quality and all that because when you see 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.269
 eagerly you can can make a great 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.069
 match and you can defeat your rival 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.560
 as we saw in the party of the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:29.959
 semi - finals of the championship where 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.700
 for me I qualify the borussia dortmund 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.610
 as 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.060
 in football why then because as 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.620
 we can see later this summer 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.810
 many players will be sold to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.700
 other bigger clubs than the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.560
 borussia dortmund as for example the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.230
 mario götze that will go to the bayern of 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.470
 múnich the lewandowski this jugadorazo 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.260
 who scored 4 goals in the match that will be 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.640
 probably yielded to the there is sold to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 Munich bayern but not sure 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.780
 because pep guardiola not what there like that 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 that we do not know everything if it's going to be 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.510
 ceded or sold and finally hummels is 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.549
 true that some more but these are 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.859
 the main numbers that you could go 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.750
 clearly to Barcelona but well this 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.220
 we'll talk in another video what 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.799
 I wanted to tell you is that he has 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.109
 played some good talents that 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:19.909
 they have the bayern of Munich and I think 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.269
 This is what I'm going to take advantage of because 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.459
 many are going to escape their team 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:27.290
 as I said the principals and the 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.090
 Bayern Munich Bayern decides 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.090
 Munich and has surprised us all with 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.340
 its so good season where it seems to me 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.280
 who has only lost four games in 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.350
 everything that takes of season 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.660
 seems I'm not sure but what 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.370
 I'm still sure is that your goalie does not 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.940
 yesterday that by the way also wants it the 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 barcelona has conceded only 17 goal two 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.880
 goals forgiveness throughout the season 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.010
 How good if Borussia Dortmund wants 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.150
 make a great game and strive 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.489
 very much we can see a pretty duel 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.600
 curly to say it somehow 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.250
 where the two teams will have the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.580
 possession of the ball the three teams 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.110
 will attack there will be many opportunities 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.840
 but with the two defenses so good that 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.720
 they have these two German teams 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.760
 we can see few goals the truth but 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.620
 well do not expect a great end in 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.989
 wembley by the way I want to comment that 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.090
 wembley is a bit repetitive not so 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.370
 please those of the champions change 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.140
 the stadium where it happens in the next 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.479
 final because it's pretty repetitive 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
 we have been two years in a row and I 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.860
 It seems that three or four years ago 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.500
 it was also there so well this is what 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.729
 what is he had to talk about this final 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.120
 anticipated to say it in some way 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.790
 of the 2013 champions many 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.900
 Please, I would like very much for you 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:50.190
 put and subscribe if you are not yet 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.190
 and until the next guys
