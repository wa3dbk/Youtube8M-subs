00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.100
 beautiful Campania path that it 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.989
 last year he gave hard fought races 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.790

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.500

 to report the debut in the race of one 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.220
 four-stroke zip of 210 cubic centimeters 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.079
 the medium prepared by the ps team is 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.879
 been entrusted to francesco reale who 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.500
 starts from the eighth box, part la 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.189
 first run and Paduan keeps the first one 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.260
 position 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.820
 apple tree over the years the discharge and behind 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310
 they pilots fight a meter on the meter 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.140
 for a position, the train breaks down 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.490
 soon he leads with authority and 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.259
 melon does not appear able to 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.479
 bewilder him behind them instead 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.680
 hedgehog and coviello fight for 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.509
 the third step of the podium 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.400
 just a few laps and revival succeeds 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.259
 take margins consolidating the third 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.689
 piazza while coviello has to deal with it 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.189
 with the ominous 4-stroke real zip 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.229
 the bearer of the ps team induces 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.970
 to the error the number 14 that slips to the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.799
 hairpin and returning to the track must 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.479
 defend yourself also from giuliano gargiulo 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.100
 the checkered flag arrives and for 2 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.170
 year celebrates in monoruota preceding 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.700
 melons and rip off the start of race 2 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.439
 it is a photocopy of the previous one 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.479
 this time however melon does not let it escape 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.429
 patuano with the train of pilots a lot 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.319
 the first two are compact in the early stages 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.700
 they go on the run while coviello appears 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.619
 check the third place from 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.509
 ripoff attacks in the middle of the race arrives 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.069
 the change of pitch of the melon the number 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.229
 21 scores a series of turns e 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.090
 fast managing to overtake paduano i 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.030
 two fight hand-to-hand and travel 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.619
 for most of the race separated by cm 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.450
 meanwhile the struggle for the continues 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.399

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.270
 gargiulo royal group center offer a 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.920
 good show 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.690
 when it reaches the last lap melon in 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.700
 head but paduano does not give up the grip e 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.740
 hope the attack on the hairpin number 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 21 does not give up pulls a detached 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.560
 incredible at the last corner and passes 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.750
 even on an external trajectory 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.440
 going to win the sprint under the 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.569
 checkered flag 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.490
 in third place concludes coviello e 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.709

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.290
 sum of heats race 1 the scooter is 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.420
 sold well for the first three rounds then 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.670
 unfortunately I had to settle the 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.130
 second position in race 2 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 we pulled some crazy breaks 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.810
 also from the outside 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.980
 we had a great time and I won 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.530

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:58.549
 accident I didn't even know whether to come 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.439

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.379
 take part 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.379
 primapress 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.160
 in the matic scooter of the emilio regions 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.900
 d'andrea signs the pole position 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.120
 preceding the veteran in qualifying 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.220
 luciano formisano and marco imbastaro in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.080
 second row snap palomba rucci ea 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.240
 of nights participates as a wild card 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.490
 francesco reale looking for miles 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.050
 to develop the 4-stroke uncle turns off 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.880
 race 1 traffic light and is basted 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.320
 take the lead followed by formisano 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.700
 and andrea russi shoots well from the 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.040
 second row and sets off in pursuit 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.780
 of the leading trio already on the first lap 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 formisano tries to attack against 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.260
 basted at the hairpin 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.940
 but the number 42 resists the command the 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.710
 overtaking is postponed by only one lap 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.540
 formisano shoves himself with arrogance 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.280
 first corner and imposes the race to a 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.020
 unsustainable pace for others 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.390
 we arrive mid-race and six drivers 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.550
 contend the second position are 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:01.740
 palomba of the best royal bastard 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.630
 and today 's struggle is between these 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.040
 to say the least, the positions change 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.900
 practically at every curve 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.610
 in the brawl a slide of lights 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.840
 involves three other pilots and per 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.710
 security the flag is displayed 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.420
 red 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.460
 thus the race ends at the ninth of the 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.620
 thirteen laps planned with formisano that 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.209
 wins ahead of andrea and rucci at the start 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.130
 of race 2 instead the poleman d'andrea 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.780
 shoot well tailed by formisano 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.820
 bastier and of nights with the big group 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.710
 however very compact in the former 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.850
 jokes the number 88 seems to hold 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.250
 easily the command of the operations 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.900
 but there are four pilots they maintain 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.700
 his own madman among these we find 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.240
 once again a big formisano 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.500
 form 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.060
 some after a bit of brawl and some 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.950
 exchange of position leads to the command 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.750
 definitively on the fourth lap 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.820
 half to slide the first andrea 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.650
 curve starts again without problems but now has 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.930
 compromised his race thus leaving 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.850
 adinolfi imbastaro is a real contender 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.710
 the second and third step of the podium 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.570
 the leading positions are consolidated 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.640
 organize wins in single wheel in 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.620
 Enough is second while adinolfi wins 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.360
 the surreal sprint for sum of heats 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.160
 formisano makes the airola stage its own 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.380
 thanks to a nice double the second 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.930
 placed and tacked a real third 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.690
 pretty well 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:11.169
 this race dedicates it to my wife and to 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:11.169
 my children and the next 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.090
 no 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.090
 no
