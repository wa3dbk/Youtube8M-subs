a bunch of Zoe features I believe the

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.650 
a bunch of Zoe features I believe the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
live photo mode this normal mode but I

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.360 
live photo mode this normal mode but I
don't<00:04:14.900> think<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.110> has<00:04:15.260> Zoe<00:04:15.500> features<00:04:16.040> but<00:04:16.280> it

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
don't think it has Zoe features but it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.430 
don't think it has Zoe features but it
does<00:04:16.549> have<00:04:16.730> some<00:04:16.970> auto<00:04:17.630> capture<00:04:18.049> when<00:04:18.200> smile

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
does have some auto capture when smile

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.349 
does have some auto capture when smile
is<00:04:18.620> detected<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.310> bunch<00:04:19.850> of<00:04:19.940> features<00:04:20.210> will

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
is detected a bunch of features will

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.529 
is detected a bunch of features will
detail<00:04:20.720> them<00:04:20.960> in<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.590> later<00:04:21.770> video<00:04:22.010> right<00:04:22.310> now

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:22.539

the<00:04:23.539> light<00:04:23.690> is<00:04:23.750> too<00:04:24.080> much<00:04:24.260> for<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.530> camera

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
the light is too much for the camera

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.050 
the light is too much for the camera
to<00:04:24.900> handle<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.130> bunch<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.550> preloaded<00:04:26.970> apps

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.640 
believe is a 2000 milliamp hour battery
and<00:05:06.240> that's<00:05:06.360> right<00:05:06.540> it<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:06.930> a<00:05:07.110> two<00:05:07.169> thousand

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
and that's right it is a two thousand

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.790 
and that's right it is a two thousand
milliamp<00:05:07.860> hour<00:05:08.160> battery<00:05:09.110> which<00:05:10.110> is<00:05:10.140> nice<00:05:10.530> of

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
milliamp hour battery which is nice of

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.500 
milliamp hour battery which is nice of
HTC<00:05:11.220> because<00:05:11.430> we<00:05:11.520> haven't<00:05:11.700> seen<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.270> lot<00:05:12.480> of

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
HTC because we haven't seen a lot of

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.670 
HTC because we haven't seen a lot of
removable<00:05:12.960> batteries<00:05:13.440> in<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.620> couple<00:05:13.860> of<00:05:13.919> days

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
removable batteries in a couple of days

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.110 
removable batteries in a couple of days
so<00:05:16.680> I'm<00:05:16.740> going<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.950> try<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.430> quickly<00:05:17.700> load<00:05:17.940> up

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
so I'm going to try and quickly load up

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.940 
so I'm going to try and quickly load up
the<00:05:18.540> Internet<00:05:18.930> and<00:05:19.080> load<00:05:19.260> up<00:05:19.290> our<00:05:19.500> website<00:05:19.680> and

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
the Internet and load up our website and

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.219 
the Internet and load up our website and
see<00:05:20.070> what<00:05:20.100> it<00:05:20.280> looks<00:05:20.310> like<00:05:20.490> on<00:05:20.790> this<00:05:20.940> device<00:05:21.229> so

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
see what it looks like on this device so

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.159 
see what it looks like on this device so
we<00:05:22.320> are<00:05:22.380> now<00:05:22.500> connected<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.130> Wi-Fi<00:05:23.310> I

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
we are now connected to the Wi-Fi I

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.070 
we are now connected to the Wi-Fi I
accept<00:05:25.169> no<00:05:25.290> thanks<00:05:26.510> quickly<00:05:27.510> load<00:05:27.690> up<00:05:27.840> our

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
accept no thanks quickly load up our

website<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:29.960> see<00:05:30.960> what<00:05:31.140> that<00:05:31.260> looks<00:05:31.530> like

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.290 

so<00:05:39.889> loads<00:05:40.099> of<00:05:40.249> the<00:05:40.340> website<00:05:40.669> quite<00:05:40.939> quickly

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
so loads of the website quite quickly

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.480 
so loads of the website quite quickly
and<00:05:41.629> snappily<00:05:42.620> you<00:05:42.710> can<00:05:42.830> see<00:05:42.979> that<00:05:43.159> overall

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
and snappily you can see that overall

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.879 
and snappily you can see that overall
scrolling<00:05:43.939> is<00:05:44.120> pretty<00:05:44.449> smooth<00:05:44.689> it's<00:05:45.620> still

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
scrolling is pretty smooth it's still

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.209 
scrolling is pretty smooth it's still
loading<00:05:46.219> up<00:05:46.370> a<00:05:46.550> bunch<00:05:46.759> of<00:05:46.909> elements<00:05:47.830> it<00:05:48.830> did

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
loading up a bunch of elements it did

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:50.980 
loading up a bunch of elements it did
seem<00:05:49.430> to<00:05:49.460> lag<00:05:49.759> a<00:05:49.789> little<00:05:50.090> bit<00:05:50.270> over<00:05:50.509> there<00:05:50.689> I

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
seem to lag a little bit over there I

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.050 
seem to lag a little bit over there I
guess<00:05:51.740> it's<00:05:51.889> just<00:05:51.949> finalizing<00:05:52.460> loading<00:05:52.909> up

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
guess it's just finalizing loading up

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.379 
guess it's just finalizing loading up
the<00:05:53.300> site<00:05:53.539> and<00:05:53.779> once<00:05:53.930> it's<00:05:54.229> done<00:05:54.469> with<00:05:54.710> that

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
the site and once it's done with that

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.089 
the site and once it's done with that
which<00:05:56.389> looks<00:05:56.629> like<00:05:56.719> it's<00:05:56.960> done<00:05:57.169> now<00:05:57.379> it<00:05:57.830> should

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
which looks like it's done now it should

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:00.640 
which looks like it's done now it should
smooth<00:05:58.340> it<00:05:58.460> up<00:05:58.550> and<00:05:58.699> it<00:05:58.789> has<00:05:58.969> so<00:05:59.719> pretty<00:06:00.319> smooth

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
smooth it up and it has so pretty smooth

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.089 
smooth it up and it has so pretty smooth
in<00:06:00.830> terms<00:06:01.069> of<00:06:01.449> the<00:06:02.449> overall<00:06:02.629> usability<00:06:03.229> there

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
in terms of the overall usability there

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.920 
in terms of the overall usability there
you<00:06:04.189> saw<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.400> bit<00:06:04.639> of<00:06:04.729> lag<00:06:04.939> in<00:06:05.240> pinching<00:06:05.659> in<00:06:05.779> and

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
you saw a bit of lag in pinching in and

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.330 
you saw a bit of lag in pinching in and
pinching<00:06:06.229> out<00:06:07.120> could<00:06:08.120> be<00:06:08.499> the<00:06:09.499> fact<00:06:09.710> that<00:06:09.830> it's

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
pinching out could be the fact that it's

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.330 
pinching out could be the fact that it's
not<00:06:10.490> the<00:06:10.639> latest<00:06:10.789> version<00:06:11.360> of<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:12.770> Chrome

not the latest version of the Chrome

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.439 
stuff in the background and plus the
underclock<00:06:19.250> chipset<00:06:19.699> might<00:06:19.849> be<00:06:19.969> affecting<00:06:20.360> it

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
underclock chipset might be affecting it

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.649 
underclock chipset might be affecting it
but<00:06:20.599> scrolling<00:06:20.990> seems<00:06:21.199> to<00:06:21.319> be<00:06:21.439> really<00:06:21.650> smooth

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
but scrolling seems to be really smooth

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.420 
but scrolling seems to be really smooth

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
seems to be smooth pinching in and

seems to be smooth pinching in and
pinching<00:06:27.830> out<00:06:27.949> also<00:06:28.279> seems<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:28.580> be<00:06:28.699> smooth<00:06:28.909> on

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.089 
pinching out also seems to be smooth on

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.589 
pinching out also seems to be smooth on
this<00:06:29.300> so<00:06:30.169> pretty<00:06:30.620> recent<00:06:31.009> I'd<00:06:31.279> say<00:06:31.580> for<00:06:32.569> the
