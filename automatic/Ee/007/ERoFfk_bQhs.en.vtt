00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
specific installation process on these

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.350 
specific installation process on these
particular<00:01:49.860> shingles<00:01:50.520> let's<00:01:50.700> touch<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.210> that

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
particular shingles let's touch on that

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480 
particular shingles let's touch on that
other<00:01:51.540> components<00:01:52.170> well<00:01:52.920> we<00:01:53.130> talked<00:01:53.340> about

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
other components well we talked about

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.310 
other components well we talked about
the<00:01:53.670> ice<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.970> water<00:01:54.090> shield<00:01:54.210> here<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.200> went

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
the ice and water shield here we went

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.230 
the ice and water shield here we went
with<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.619> two<00:01:56.040> rows<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> ice<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.700> water<00:01:56.850> this

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with the two rows of ice and water this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.149 
with the two rows of ice and water this
particularly<00:01:57.659> rough<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.590> shingle<00:01:58.979> main

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
particularly rough well the shingle main

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
particularly rough well the shingle main
underlayment<00:01:59.670> it<00:02:00.329> looks<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> feels

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
underlayment it looks and feels

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.899 
underlayment it looks and feels
different<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.829> almost<00:02:02.070> feels<00:02:02.280> more<00:02:02.460> durable

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
different it almost feels more durable

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
different it almost feels more durable
it<00:02:03.180> is<00:02:03.240> it's<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.780> lot<00:02:03.930> more<00:02:04.110> durable<00:02:04.439> than<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it is it's a lot more durable than the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.399 
it is it's a lot more durable than the
ordinary<00:02:04.799> felt<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.430> actually<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.729> fiberglass

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
ordinary felt it's actually a fiberglass

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.050 
ordinary felt it's actually a fiberglass
composite<00:02:07.409> material<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.340> goes<00:02:08.489> down<00:02:08.729> it

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
composite material that goes down it

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.180 
composite material that goes down it
handles<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.780> higher<00:02:09.989> temperature<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.950> holds

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
handles a higher temperature so it holds

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.020 
handles a higher temperature so it holds
up<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.520> a<00:02:11.550> higher<00:02:11.700> temperature<00:02:12.180> and<00:02:12.300> cool

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
up to a higher temperature and cool

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.760 
up to a higher temperature and cool
temperatures<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.600> lays<00:02:13.780> flatter<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.680> when

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
temperatures and it lays flatter so when

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.080 
temperatures and it lays flatter so when
you<00:02:14.830> put<00:02:14.950> your<00:02:15.040> shingles<00:02:15.400> over<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.670> top<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:15.880> it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you put your shingles over the top of it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.790 
you put your shingles over the top of it
you<00:02:16.330> get<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.510> nice<00:02:16.660> smooth<00:02:17.050> installation<00:02:17.620> okay

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
you get a nice smooth installation okay

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.080 
you get a nice smooth installation okay
what<00:02:17.950> about<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.280> some<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.580> challenging

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
what about in some of the challenging

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.580 
what about in some of the challenging
areas<00:02:19.480> like<00:02:19.660> right<00:02:20.140> here<00:02:20.319> we<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.530> a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
areas like right here we get a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.830 
areas like right here we get a
first-hand<00:02:21.370> up-close<00:02:21.760> look<00:02:21.940> at<00:02:22.180> where<00:02:22.690> the

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
first-hand up-close look at where the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.050 
first-hand up-close look at where the
original<00:02:23.170> leak<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:23.770> yeah<00:02:24.340> I<00:02:24.370> talked<00:02:24.819> about

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
original leak was yeah I talked about

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.330 
original leak was yeah I talked about
the<00:02:25.209> step<00:02:25.480> flashing<00:02:25.630> the<00:02:26.410> step<00:02:26.650> flashing<00:02:26.830> was

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
the step flashing the step flashing was

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.190 
the step flashing the step flashing was
just<00:02:27.640> down<00:02:27.819> underneath<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.600> shingles<00:02:29.050> they

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
just down underneath the shingles they

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.199 
just down underneath the shingles they
didn't<00:02:29.410> have<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.770> go<00:02:29.920> over<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.670> top<00:02:30.850> of<00:02:30.880> each

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
didn't have it go over the top of each

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.640 
didn't have it go over the top of each
row<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.569> shingles<00:02:31.720> like<00:02:32.050> we're<00:02:32.200> doing<00:02:32.319> up<00:02:32.530> with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
row of shingles like we're doing up with

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.229 
row of shingles like we're doing up with
these<00:02:33.010> particular<00:02:33.220> ones<00:02:33.610> here<00:02:33.850> okay<00:02:34.180> so

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
anytime water got underneath there I was

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.040 
anytime water got underneath there I was
able<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.700> go<00:02:36.819> right<00:02:36.970> back<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> Hulk's<00:02:37.750> boy
