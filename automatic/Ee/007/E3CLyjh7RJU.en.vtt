tomatoes are set into books to get to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.420 
tomatoes are set into books to get to
about<00:01:00.809> three<00:01:01.170> inches<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:01.649> aren't<00:01:01.859> quite<00:01:02.100> 3

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
about three inches these aren't quite 3

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.340 
about three inches these aren't quite 3
inches<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.879> maybe<00:01:03.030> an<00:01:03.270> inch<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.049> half<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
inches and maybe an inch and a half to

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
inches and maybe an inch and a half to
two<00:01:04.530> inches<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:05.580> says<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:06.000> might

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
two inches and it also says they might

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.399 
two inches and it also says they might
get<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.450> 4<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.780> 6<00:01:06.960> ounces

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
get to 4 to 6 ounces

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
get to 4 to 6 ounces
I<00:01:07.530> think<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> little<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I think it's on a little bit of the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.100 
I think it's on a little bit of the
lower<00:01:09.180> side<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.869> size<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> weight<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> maybe

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
lower side for size and weight so maybe

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.469 
lower side for size and weight so maybe
they<00:01:13.229> get<00:01:13.350> 2<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> 3<00:01:13.890> inches<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.880> know<00:01:15.000> 3<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
they get 2 to 3 inches and you know 3 to

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.830 
they get 2 to 3 inches and you know 3 to
5<00:01:15.659> ounces<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:17.009> tomato<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.640> tasted<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.479> has<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
5 ounces the tomato I tasted it it has a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.469 
5 ounces the tomato I tasted it it has a
nice<00:01:19.080> tomato<00:01:19.530> taste<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> which<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.549> describe

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
nice tomato taste to it which I describe

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
nice tomato taste to it which I describe
as<00:01:21.740> it's<00:01:22.740> got<00:01:22.920> some<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> tomato<00:01:23.520> acidity<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
as it's got some of the tomato acidity a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.730 
as it's got some of the tomato acidity a
little<00:01:24.689> bit<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> tartness<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.380> some

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little bit of tartness and some

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.940 
little bit of tartness and some
sweetness<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> doesn't<00:01:26.580> taste<00:01:26.729> watery<00:01:27.150> I

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
sweetness it doesn't taste watery I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.319 
sweetness it doesn't taste watery I
really<00:01:28.950> enjoy<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.400> gonna<00:01:29.549> grow<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.970> next

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
really enjoy it I'm gonna grow this next

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.130 
really enjoy it I'm gonna grow this next
year<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> again<00:01:31.350> that's<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> looks<00:01:32.610> like

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
year and again that's what it looks like

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
year and again that's what it looks like
sliced<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.790> think<00:01:35.790> it's<00:01:35.909> gonna<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> good<00:01:36.329> for

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
sliced I think it's gonna be good for

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
sliced I think it's gonna be good for
canning<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:36.960> does<00:01:37.079> have<00:01:37.229> some<00:01:37.439> meatiness<00:01:37.740> to

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
canning it does have some meatiness to
