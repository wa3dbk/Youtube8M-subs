different<00:01:29.200> from<00:01:29.950> stock<00:01:30.250> cars<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.790> here<00:01:31.030> and

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
different from stock cars to here and

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.810 
different from stock cars to here and
the<00:01:31.330> way<00:01:31.480> you<00:01:31.540> drive<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:32.590> knowing<00:01:33.520> that<00:01:33.700> you

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
the way you drive it so knowing that you

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.520 
the way you drive it so knowing that you
hold<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.120> wide<00:01:34.240> open<00:01:34.270> around<00:01:34.840> here<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.320> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
hold it wide open around here and the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.020 
hold it wide open around here and the
first<00:01:35.860> time<00:01:36.040> I<00:01:36.070> went<00:01:36.280> out<00:01:36.400> here<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.670> went<00:01:36.850> out<00:01:36.940> in

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
first time I went out here I went out in

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.460 
first time I went out here I went out in
the<00:01:37.060> pace<00:01:37.240> car<00:01:37.270> somebody<00:01:37.690> trying<00:01:38.080> to<00:01:38.170> show<00:01:38.320> me

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the pace car somebody trying to show me

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.780 
the pace car somebody trying to show me
what<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.650> track<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:39.070> like<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.550> was<00:01:39.580> like

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
what the track was like and I was like

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.190 
what the track was like and I was like
there's<00:01:39.970> no<00:01:40.030> way<00:01:40.120> you<00:01:40.330> hold<00:01:40.510> it<00:01:40.630> wide<00:01:40.780> open<00:01:40.810> all

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
there's no way you hold it wide open all

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.270 
there's no way you hold it wide open all
the<00:01:41.260> way<00:01:41.350> around<00:01:41.620> here<00:01:41.770> because<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.010> corner

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
the way around here because the corner

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.400 
the way around here because the corner
it's<00:01:42.400> practically<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> 90<00:01:43.330> degree<00:01:43.540> turn<00:01:43.570> but

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
it's practically a 90 degree turn but

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's practically a 90 degree turn but
going<00:01:44.560> out<00:01:44.800> and<00:01:45.040> feeling<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.490> it's<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.670> lot

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
going out and feeling it it's a lot

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.160 
going out and feeling it it's a lot
different<00:01:46.030> once<00:01:46.390> you're<00:01:46.570> driving<00:01:46.990> the<00:01:47.140> car

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
different once you're driving the car

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.500 
different once you're driving the car
stick<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.920> track<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.580> lot<00:01:48.880> better<00:01:49.120> so<00:01:49.420> it

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
stick to the track a lot better so it

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.270 
stick to the track a lot better so it
wasn't<00:01:49.840> as<00:01:49.960> surprising<00:01:50.560> once<00:01:50.740> I<00:01:50.890> got<00:01:51.070> out

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
wasn't as surprising once I got out

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.680 
wasn't as surprising once I got out
there<00:01:51.430> it's<00:01:51.610> pretty<00:01:51.790> comfortable<00:01:52.150> with<00:01:52.480> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
there it's pretty comfortable with it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.230 
there it's pretty comfortable with it
but<00:01:53.230> just<00:01:53.710> get<00:01:54.310> on<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.520> track<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.910> along<00:01:55.120> the

straightaways are I mean it's all just

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.180 
straightaways are I mean it's all just
getting<00:01:56.980> adjusted<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.610> it<00:01:58.950> sometime<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.160> I

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190
