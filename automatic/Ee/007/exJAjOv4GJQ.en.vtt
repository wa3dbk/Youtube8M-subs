00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.629
 to make a simple but effective plan 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 Specialist needed to bind others 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.930
 that does not mean many parts 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.000
 used to the appropriate string 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:18.839
 now only 90 mm 0 90 to 1 2 mm 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.779
 you should hook then just single 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:24.810
 of course, hooks create a carabiner 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.119
 swirl so that lead is hung up and 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.730
 a whirl 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.409
 which then comes to the serve and how 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.390
 such an incident looks like or like that 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.420
 can be built very quickly wants 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.490
 I show now I cut first 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.040
 a piece of string can still calm down 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:52.290
 be a little bit longer 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:52.800
 The carbine will be the first to arrive shortly 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.810
 whirl 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.920
 so the little campact just hung up 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.920
 He does not have function 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.549
 But a carbine will not 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.350
 bad has the advantage that at 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.850
 turn up the assembly if it ever 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:28.240
 the third is the same then 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:34.729
 vortex of cut so that you start 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:38.780
 now I take here the hook just going 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:44.810
 first that the 20 cm comes and 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.069
 maeckes then I put a loop and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.799
 actually makes a typical one now 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:52.220
 only knot that hook me 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:02:00.979
 before that he did draufgezogen so I 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:02:03.130
 I firmly tie in and I firmly 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.130
 pull 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.459
 the advantage is that the less three 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.530
 is that the hook is free 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:19.159
 and he also has the fish very much 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.599
 well that's a first the same 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.730
 do now with the second bit 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:24.049
 Of course, that too can now happen 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.310
 many times longer accordingly 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:40.870
 is then up to you 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 maybe hook again 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.739
 soak it with that and now 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.659
 we already have a little natural history 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.829
 system now I'm just up here 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:07.000
 also from the same basic drive alone 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:07.000
 that does not happen 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.459
 but trimmed the hosts as short as possible 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.689
 cut off there no I only 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.659
 then you can catch, for example, too 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:40.689
 not the braided secondary school yes and 

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:48.760
 then that is already finished no 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:53.950
 great secrets easy to 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.269
 I keep a bottle since there may 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.250
 you then do the finished no 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:04.230
 and then take her on the water 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:07.230
 and for your use accordingly 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.230
 extract
