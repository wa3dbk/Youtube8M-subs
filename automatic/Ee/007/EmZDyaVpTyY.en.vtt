00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:12.590
 never dreamed in front of the luc movie 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.580
 besson the big blue who has never 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.410
 tried to hold back the longest 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.330
 possible his breathing in a 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.130
 bath or in a pool and well into 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.710
 guard is worth more for three 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.590
 minutes some 87 m which is worth 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.710
 to be the world champion apnea 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.130
 meeting with the director of jackman 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.289
 long marianne 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.180
 hello france live then you are 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.350
 become the first so French to 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.840
 become world champion apnea in 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.039
 depth without fins nor material it is 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.710
 important to clarify it was to 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:42.170
 kalamata in Greece so pure apnea to 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.370
 the strength of arms and legs where he 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.980
 stayed more than three minutes under 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.880
 water up to 87 m the elysée even 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.050
 happiness 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.930
 how did you find out 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.969
 this discipline then I got the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.920
 chance to travel a lot with my 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.170
 parents when I was very young and so 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.149
 I am from Touraine, so there 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.950
 not the sea next to towers but I 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.290
 had the chance to meet her every summer 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.719
 especially at the edge of the Mediterranean on 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.820
 all is the islands that account for 7.7 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.490
 sea ​​thanks to my parents 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.500
 and even though I have a past of two swimmers 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.780
 then high level basketball player after 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.490
 the mother always fascinated me a little and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.080
 draws and I started teens to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.760
 pass diving certificates 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.189
 bottle so this case forms with 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.320
 bottle and when I was at 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.970
 the university of poitiers has so being 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.369
 student I started to get closer 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.409
 also a diving club because 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.030
 after huge years of high basketball 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.369
 level I wanted a little back into 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.840
 the water and I knocked on the door of a 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:37.520
 club that had an apnea section I 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.530
 started to do some lengths that 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.820
 I liked it I liked it so much that I did not 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 made a subject of study since I was at 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 the faculty of sports science I 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.900
 was working on physiology 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.210
 of exercise and that's how I have 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.070
 discovered this discipline in the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.040
 practicing while working on it 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.570
 by working on his physiology and I 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.340
 went down to marseille to continue 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.600
 to work on to practice this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.119
 once at sea since it's still 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.860
 the essence of discipline and thread in 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.180
 needle I liked it so much that I 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.770
 started to train more seriously 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.540
 and to be selected in a team of 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.670
 France in 2005 for the first time 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.329
 you were your own guinea pig stopped 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.250
 exact of the dead 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.480
 so we saw that the New Zealander so 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.749
 the favorite of the event did a 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.129
 syncope so following ceyrat his ascent 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.299
 are you aware of 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.640
 dangers because you are constantly 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.100
 to push the boundaries 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 flirt with sedan I actually 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.040
 already it's an activity we do not 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.770
 practice never alone 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.420
 as you just mentioned on the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.350
 world championship the favorite did 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.300
 a syncope ie he did 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.860
 a loss of consciousness this loss of 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.790
 knowledge and not serious since the 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.660
 time were taken care of 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.780
 at once 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.100
 he did at 2.3 meters under the surface 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.660
 of water but there are apps that's of 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.459
 security that are present with us 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.320
 when we go down who are capable 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:46.600
 you go back up and maintain yourself the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.060
 surface in general in 90% of the cases one 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.459
 regains consciousness of ourselves even though 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.560
 never it does not happen we do 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.540
 just a small breath at the level 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.760
 nose that actually allows to put the 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.959
 ventilatory machine en route and that's 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.700
 for that they are actually 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.800
 minor accidents from the 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.390
 when I repeat you practice 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.820
 with a person who is able to 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 take care of yourself if you practice alone 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.000
 and that this accident is happening to you is a 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.190
 major consequences to 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.900
 maybe drowning so actually 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.220
 it's an activity that has risks 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.480
 but he when framed can 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.400
 to be practiced by everyone 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.800
 so we remember that since the creation 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.810
 so apnea competition there is 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.150
 have never had any deaths yet 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.190
 number unfortunately I'm going a little 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.220
 little counteracted counteract this 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.780
 affirmation in 2002 13 there was a 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.320
 first death after twenty years of 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.299
 competition an apneist who forced on 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.400
 cd health who was hurt very 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.200
 seriously in the lungs and 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.450
 who died of very pulmonary edema 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.640
 very severe but you have to know that in 20 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.560
 years of competition and we will say more than 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.840
 10000 dive there was no accident 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.290
 deadly except up to very 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.329
 recently 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.209
 unfortunately so I read and saw no 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.370
 a lot of interviews about you 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.660
 talk about incredible feeling when 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.799
 you are at the bottom of the water but nobody 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.780
 asked you the question 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.060
 what were his sensations is this 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.470
 that you can explain it to us then 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.180
 it's very complicated because it's 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.910
 something very internal that is 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.519
 lived inside the body when one 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:15.370
 is actually at the bottom of the water one 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.560
 could relate that a little bit to I 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.299
 do not know if we can we can do this 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.579
 image but back a little to the placenta 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.770
 kindergarten since the water an effect of 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.419
 capacity on the body that is very 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:27.280
 very very very important and very 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.870
 scoring so when I'm at 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.530
 bottom of the water what's more there is a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.240
 number of changes 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:32.169
 physiological that makes that one is 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.669
 very well when 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.949
 bottom of the water we want everything except 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.319
 breathe well on the contrary when one is 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.789
 very relaxed relaxed and well prepared 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.819
 when we are at the bottom of the water we are 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.900
 really good but I reassure you 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.129
 I always wanted to go back 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.319
 it's not like in the big blue is 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:49.509
 left with a siren or a dolphin 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.129
 no no I am a landlord first and foremost 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.659
 I go back to breathe 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.029
 thank you very much for accepting our 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.979
 invitation will of course follow you your 

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:58.599
 underwater adventures and then especially 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.349
 do not hesitate against you who we 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:00.999
 look 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.520
 react to France layla interviews 

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:07.529
 lifesite activate it and discover each 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.529
 day made video and what they had to 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:10.529
 make
