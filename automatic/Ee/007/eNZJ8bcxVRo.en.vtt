a lot of people think that networking is

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
networker you have to be good at

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.410 
networker you have to be good at
schmoozing<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.960> none<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.280> true<00:01:35.420> so

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
schmoozing and none of that is true so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.999 
schmoozing and none of that is true so
first<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.930> want<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.140> redefine<00:01:37.380> networking

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
first we want to redefine networking

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.279 
first we want to redefine networking
networking<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.939> creating<00:01:39.509> meaningful

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
networking is about creating meaningful

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.249 
networking is about creating meaningful
lasting<00:01:40.649> connections<00:01:41.399> one<00:01:42.180> person<00:01:42.960> at<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> time

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
lasting connections one person at a time

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.679 
lasting connections one person at a time
and<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.820> something<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.329> people<00:01:45.390> who

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and that is something that people who

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.120 
and that is something that people who
are<00:01:45.780> introverted<00:01:46.259> overwhelmed<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:46.950> under

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
are introverted overwhelmed and under

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.209 
are introverted overwhelmed and under
connected<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.610> great<00:01:48.000> at<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.590> don't

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:50.219 
connected are great at so they don't

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:51.980 
connected are great at so they don't
realize<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:51.000> their<00:01:51.180> traits<00:01:51.539> are<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> what

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
realize what their traits are and what

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.590 
realize what their traits are and what
they<00:01:52.110> consider<00:01:52.439> liabilities<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.600> strengths

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
they consider liabilities are strengths

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
they consider liabilities are strengths
so<00:01:54.750> we<00:01:54.899> redefine<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.740> people<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.250> then

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so we redefine that for people and then

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.090 
so we redefine that for people and then
they<00:01:57.200> rediscover<00:01:58.200> who<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.799> are<00:01:58.950> what

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
they rediscover who they are what

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.560 
they rediscover who they are what
they're<00:01:59.250> capable<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.880> people<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.420> all

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
they're capable of and people from all

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.990
