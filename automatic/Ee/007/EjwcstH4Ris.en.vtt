00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
comfortable when you slide into the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.600 
comfortable when you slide into the
sheets<00:01:33.960> at<00:01:34.200> night<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.619> why<00:01:35.130> have<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> decided

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
to put to throw rugs at the end of the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.190 
to put to throw rugs at the end of the
bed<00:01:37.680> again<00:01:38.220> it's<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.700> layering<00:01:39.200> texture

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
bed again it's that layering texture

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
bed again it's that layering texture
thing<00:01:40.440> I<00:01:40.679> think<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> visual<00:01:41.550> comfort<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
thing I think that visual comfort is

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.059 
thing I think that visual comfort is
really<00:01:42.690> important<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.319> you're<00:01:43.500> designing

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
really important when you're designing

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.419 
really important when you're designing
or<00:01:44.640> decorating<00:01:45.210> bedroom<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.800> it<00:01:47.100> is

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
or decorating bedroom so it's just it is

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.570 
or decorating bedroom so it's just it is
creating<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.090> haven<00:01:48.659> soft<00:01:49.380> taemin<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
creating a haven soft taemin and is

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.279

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
little bit of interest at the end of the
bed<00:01:57.690> yeah<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.319> I<00:01:58.409> think<00:01:58.470> that<00:01:58.830> if<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.369> haven't

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
bed yeah and I think that if you haven't

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
bed yeah and I think that if you haven't
got<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.789> great<00:02:00.000> deal<00:02:00.179> of<00:02:00.210> color<00:02:00.569> then<00:02:00.929> create<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
got a great deal of color then create it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
got a great deal of color then create it
with<00:02:01.440> texture<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.220> layering

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.559 

what<00:02:10.110> about<00:02:10.289> a<00:02:10.319> more<00:02:10.530> formal<00:02:11.069> look<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:12.150> create

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
what about a more formal look you create

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.600 
what about a more formal look you create
a<00:02:12.599> more<00:02:12.810> formal<00:02:13.230> look<00:02:13.319> not<00:02:13.590> even<00:02:13.860> necessarily

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
a more formal look not even necessarily

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.670 
a more formal look not even necessarily
by<00:02:14.909> being<00:02:15.150> dictated<00:02:15.510> by<00:02:15.750> color<00:02:16.049> but<00:02:16.470> it's<00:02:16.590> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
by being dictated by color but it's the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.680 
by being dictated by color but it's the
structure<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.340> pillows<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.540> our

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
structure of the pillows so in our

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.199 
structure of the pillows so in our
previous<00:02:18.959> beds<00:02:19.500> we've<00:02:19.799> had<00:02:20.040> quite<00:02:20.640> a<00:02:20.760> casual

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
previous beds we've had quite a casual

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.649 
previous beds we've had quite a casual
look<00:02:21.390> with<00:02:22.519> with<00:02:23.519> just<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.849> placement<00:02:24.330> of<00:02:24.540> the

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
look with with just the placement of the

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.800 
look with with just the placement of the
pillows<00:02:24.900> being<00:02:25.170> relaxed<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:26.610> formal<00:02:27.150> all

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
pillows being relaxed and not formal all

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.839 
pillows being relaxed and not formal all
it<00:02:28.079> is<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> matter<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.530> doing<00:02:28.829> is<00:02:29.099> placing<00:02:29.519> your

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
it is a matter of doing is placing your

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.610 
it is a matter of doing is placing your
pillows<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.329> a<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.569> more<00:02:30.720> with<00:02:31.349> a<00:02:31.379> little

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
pillows and a little more with a little

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.559 
pillows and a little more with a little
more<00:02:31.739> symmetry<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.970> also<00:02:33.120> create<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
more symmetry you can also create a

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.690 
more symmetry you can also create a
slightly<00:02:34.470> more<00:02:34.709> formal<00:02:34.769> look<00:02:35.250> by<00:02:35.459> just

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
slightly more formal look by just

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.970 
slightly more formal look by just
folding<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.269> quilt<00:02:36.690> down<00:02:36.930> differently<00:02:37.379> by

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
folding the quilt down differently by

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
folding the quilt down differently by
folding<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> sheets<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:38.940> differently<00:02:39.390> so

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
folding the sheets down differently so

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.180 
folding the sheets down differently so
there's<00:02:39.870> lots<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.290> things<00:02:40.349> that<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.739> can<00:02:40.980> do

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
there's lots of things that you can do

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
there's lots of things that you can do
just<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.670> keep<00:02:41.849> it<00:02:42.030> really<00:02:42.510> simple<00:02:42.660> but

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
just to keep it really simple but

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.900 
just to keep it really simple but
structure<00:02:44.010> it<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.160> little<00:02:44.280> bit<00:02:44.459> more<00:02:44.609> bikes

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
structure it a little bit more bikes

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.569
