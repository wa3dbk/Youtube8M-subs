00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
on the outside and they have to shoot

the<00:00:24.300> people<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.720> middle<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.310> it's<00:00:26.310> pretty

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
the people in the middle and it's pretty

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.250 
the people in the middle and it's pretty
much<00:00:26.730> simple<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.570> these<00:00:27.929> first<00:00:28.140> two

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
much simple as that now these first two

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.359 
much simple as that now these first two
rounds<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.529> pretty<00:00:28.679> bad<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:29.070> no<00:00:29.099> one

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
rounds are pretty bad because no one

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
understood what to do but the second two

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.749 
understood what to do but the second two
rounds<00:00:31.830> are<00:00:31.920> how<00:00:32.009> they<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.279> normally<00:00:32.640> play

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
this is that the I'm sorry the Warthog

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.110 
this is that the I'm sorry the Warthog
sometimes<00:00:54.600> gets<00:00:54.780> stuck<00:00:55.039> but<00:00:56.039> especially<00:00:56.760> if

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
sometimes gets stuck but especially if

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.240 
sometimes gets stuck but especially if
you<00:00:57.210> throw<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> plasma<00:00:57.840> grenades<00:00:58.109> at<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.440> but

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you throw a plasma grenades at them but

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.500 
you throw a plasma grenades at them but
that's<00:00:59.340> okay<00:00:59.699> because<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.120> rounds<00:01:00.359> don't

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that's okay because the rounds don't

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
that's okay because the rounds don't
last<00:01:00.629> super<00:01:01.019> super<00:01:01.289> long<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:02.129> might<00:01:02.340> add

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
last super super long so i might add

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
last super super long so i might add
more<00:01:02.699> rounds<00:01:02.940> in<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.090> future<00:01:03.359> but<00:01:04.140> um<00:01:04.440> this<00:01:04.739> is

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
more rounds in the future but um this is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.530 
more rounds in the future but um this is
how<00:01:05.040> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.610> a<00:01:05.640> really<00:01:05.940> bad<00:01:05.970> round<00:01:06.300> twos

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.400 
on red team of course I'm going to start
in<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.420> middle<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:43.730> it's<00:01:44.730> one<00:01:45.180> life

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
in the middle and it's one life

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.140 
in the middle and it's one life
elimination<00:01:46.410> so<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.700> spawn<00:01:47.940> with

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
elimination so you can spawn with

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.060 
elimination so you can spawn with
thruster<00:01:48.480> pack<00:01:48.660> hardlight<00:01:49.260> shield<00:01:49.260> or<00:01:49.710> regen

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
thruster pack hardlight shield or regen

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
thruster pack hardlight shield or regen
field<00:01:50.340> I'd<00:01:50.550> suggest<00:01:51.150> hard<00:01:51.390> light<00:01:51.570> or

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
field I'd suggest hard light or

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.890 
field I'd suggest hard light or
regeneration<00:01:52.380> field<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> cause<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.780> have

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
regeneration field so cause you can have

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.899 
regeneration field so cause you can have
to<00:01:54.990> stand<00:01:55.230> in<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
to stand in it

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.989 
to stand in it
kind<00:01:56.179> of<00:01:56.240> counteract<00:01:56.570> what<00:01:57.140> they're<00:01:57.799> doing<00:01:58.130> so

00:01:58.989 --> 00:01:58.999 
kind of counteract what they're doing so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.309 
kind of counteract what they're doing so
he<00:01:59.179> has<00:01:59.270> a<00:01:59.299> missile<00:01:59.719> there<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.020> I<00:02:00.049> managed<00:02:00.259> to

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:00.319 
he has a missile there and I managed to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.929 
he has a missile there and I managed to
get<00:02:00.469> out<00:02:00.590> of<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:00.770> way<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.219> then<00:02:01.369> jump<00:02:01.579> inside

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
get out of the way and then jump inside

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.230 
get out of the way and then jump inside
and<00:02:02.299> get<00:02:02.990> more<00:02:03.140> healthier<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:03.979> I'm<00:02:04.939> moving

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
and get more healthier and I'm moving

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.889 
and get more healthier and I'm moving

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
three of us that looks like so you're

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:18.100 
three of us that looks like so you're
gonna<00:02:17.000> see<00:02:17.209> right<00:02:17.330> there<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.540> Warthog<00:02:17.930> got

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
gonna see right there the Warthog got

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.270 
gonna see right there the Warthog got
stuck<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.709> they're<00:02:18.830> going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:18.980> create<00:02:19.220> a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
stuck and they're going to create a

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.890 
stuck and they're going to create a
pileup<00:02:19.580> sometimes<00:02:20.330> they<00:02:20.480> push<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:20.780> on

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
pileup sometimes they push it on

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.479 
pileup sometimes they push it on
sometimes<00:02:21.200> they<00:02:21.500> don't<00:02:21.620> you<00:02:21.890> saw<00:02:22.069> just<00:02:22.310> there

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
sometimes they don't you saw just there

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.009 
sometimes they don't you saw just there
in<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> back<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.209> paid<00:02:23.480> attention<00:02:23.569> see

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
in the back if you paid attention see

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.259 
in the back if you paid attention see
that<00:02:24.170> what's<00:02:24.319> stuck<00:02:24.530> um<00:02:25.000> warthogs<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.090> just

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
that what's stuck um warthogs and just

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.030 
that what's stuck um warthogs and just
sit<00:02:26.420> there<00:02:26.540> will<00:02:26.720> eventually<00:02:26.840> despawn<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
sit there will eventually despawn and

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.640 
sit there will eventually despawn and
respawn<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:28.940> it<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:29.959> doesn't<00:02:30.230> harm<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
respawn so it really doesn't harm the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.920 
respawn so it really doesn't harm the
game<00:02:30.920> type<00:02:31.190> when<00:02:31.879> I<00:02:31.910> was<00:02:32.090> making<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.450> map<00:02:32.690> I

spent a lot of time trying to fix it and

spent a lot of time trying to fix it and
it<00:02:36.200> didn't<00:02:36.680> work<00:02:36.709> out<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.670> play<00:02:38.329> stupid

into your the back of a warthog you

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.780 
into your the back of a warthog you
can't<00:03:11.780> drive<00:03:11.989> it<00:03:12.139> you<00:03:12.230> can<00:03:12.349> only<00:03:12.470> gun<00:03:12.709> and<00:03:12.950> like
