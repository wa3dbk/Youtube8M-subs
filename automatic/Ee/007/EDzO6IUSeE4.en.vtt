weapons from the from the PUA this one I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.570 
weapons from the from the PUA this one I
actually<00:01:25.080> thought<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.620> should<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.100> shader

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
actually thought this should be a shader

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.190 
actually thought this should be a shader
from<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:26.970> period<00:01:27.330> looks<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:27.930> really

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
from the period looks really really

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.860 
from the period looks really really
really<00:01:28.350> cool<00:01:28.729> then<00:01:29.729> s<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.479> gold<00:01:30.690> spray

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
really cool then s is the gold spray

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.380 
really cool then s is the gold spray
this<00:01:31.050> is<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.290> one<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.500> get<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.390> from

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the iron banner this is what it looks

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
the iron banner this is what it looks
like<00:01:40.979> really<00:01:41.610> really<00:01:41.760> cool<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.900> have<00:01:43.020> the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
shader also giving you that white and

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410 
shader also giving you that white and
black<00:01:46.770> look<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.310> still<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
black look I still like the way the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.880 
black look I still like the way the
proxy<00:01:48.900> looks<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.170> little<00:01:49.260> bit<00:01:49.440> better<00:01:49.560> but<00:01:49.740> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
proxy looks a little bit better but this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.820 
proxy looks a little bit better but this
is<00:01:49.950> more<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.580> white<00:01:50.940> on<00:01:51.270> black<00:01:51.720> play<00:01:52.080> looks

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
is more of a white on black play looks

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.950 
is more of a white on black play looks
really<00:01:53.370> really<00:01:53.640> cool<00:01:54.270> with<00:01:54.540> these<00:01:54.720> little

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
really really cool with these little

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.510 
really really cool with these little
bubbles<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.500> side<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.280> got<00:01:56.430> the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
bubbles on the side then we got the

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
bubbles on the side then we got the
revenant<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.390> all-black<00:01:57.780> shader

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
revenant which is the all-black shader

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.039 
revenant which is the all-black shader
this<00:01:58.500> gives<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.830> black<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.369> teal<00:02:00.180> camouflage

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
this gives you black and teal camouflage

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.810 
this gives you black and teal camouflage
colors<00:02:01.409> changing<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.830> helmet<00:02:02.130> completely

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
colors changing the helmet completely

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
colors changing the helmet completely
black<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.420> making<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.530> then<00:02:04.799> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
black and making it like this then this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.680 
black and making it like this then this
is<00:02:05.010> Frostfire<00:02:05.610> one<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:05.970> favorite<00:02:06.330> shaders

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
is Frostfire one of my favorite shaders

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.779 
is Frostfire one of my favorite shaders
and<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.860> gives<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.219> blue<00:02:08.459> red

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and this one gives you the blue red

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.479 
and this one gives you the blue red
helmet<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.359> you<00:02:10.079> also<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.679> wish<00:02:11.069> these<00:02:11.219> little

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
helmet and you also I wish these little

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.820 
helmet and you also I wish these little
side<00:02:11.909> bubbles<00:02:12.329> right<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.659> would<00:02:12.779> also<00:02:12.840> be

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
side bubbles right here would also be

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
side bubbles right here would also be
I<00:02:13.890> think<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.310> would<00:02:14.400> upset<00:02:14.790> offset<00:02:15.570> it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
I think that would upset offset it

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.600 
I think that would upset offset it
really<00:02:15.930> really<00:02:16.200> well<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:17.070> that's<00:02:17.280> what<00:02:17.460> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
really really well but that's what that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.080 
really really well but that's what that
looks<00:02:17.790> like

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
looks like

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.970 
looks like
then<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.020> globe<00:02:19.410> which<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.740> the<00:02:19.860> one

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
then we have the globe which is the one

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.090 
then we have the globe which is the one
you<00:02:20.070> get<00:02:20.190> from<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:21.110> crotas<00:02:22.110> end<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:22.980> you

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
you get from the crotas end and as you

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.130 
you get from the crotas end and as you
guys<00:02:23.250> see<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.460> am<00:02:23.760> glowing<00:02:24.060> I'm<00:02:24.480> blowing<00:02:25.020> and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
something those little balls should go

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.500 
something those little balls should go
up<00:02:30.990> as<00:02:31.170> well<00:02:31.350> then<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:33.240> Queen's
