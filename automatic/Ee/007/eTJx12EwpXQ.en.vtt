00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
differences when the air hits the

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.030 
differences when the air hits the
spoiler<00:03:26.420> pressure<00:03:26.959> builds<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.530> causing<00:03:27.980> a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
spoiler pressure builds up causing a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.890 
spoiler pressure builds up causing a
decrease<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.489> lift<00:03:28.880> the<00:03:29.120> flow<00:03:29.660> has<00:03:29.750> been

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
decrease in lift the flow has been

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.810 
decrease in lift the flow has been
deflected<00:03:30.440> upward<00:03:30.830> which<00:03:31.040> increases<00:03:31.550> drag

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
deflected upward which increases drag

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.420 
deflected upward which increases drag
however<00:03:32.630> the<00:03:33.230> advantage<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.800> less<00:03:33.980> lift<00:03:34.250> is

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
however the advantage of less lift is

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.460 
however the advantage of less lift is
greater<00:03:34.730> than<00:03:34.940> a<00:03:35.030> disadvantage<00:03:35.690> of<00:03:35.840> more<00:03:36.080> drag

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
greater than a disadvantage of more drag

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.410 
greater than a disadvantage of more drag
so<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> spoiler<00:03:37.489> will<00:03:37.670> improve<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.209> car's

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
so the spoiler will improve the car's

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.870 
so the spoiler will improve the car's
performance<00:03:38.680> instead<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.800> using<00:03:39.950> spoilers<00:03:40.580> we

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
performance instead of using spoilers we

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.790 
performance instead of using spoilers we
can<00:03:41.030> use<00:03:41.150> an<00:03:41.270> airfoil<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:41.989> decreases<00:03:42.410> lift

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
can use an airfoil that decreases lift

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.280 
can use an airfoil that decreases lift
without<00:03:43.160> increasing<00:03:43.850> drag<00:03:44.150> air<00:03:44.660> flows<00:03:45.110> around

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
without increasing drag air flows around

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.440 
without increasing drag air flows around
the<00:03:45.590> car<00:03:45.800> but<00:03:46.280> this<00:03:46.430> time<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:46.880> localized

pressure<00:03:47.780> difference<00:03:48.230> at<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.530> airfoil

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
pressure difference at the airfoil

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.220 
pressure difference at the airfoil
creates<00:03:49.250> a<00:03:49.850> Down<00:03:50.060> force<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.690> doesn't<00:03:50.930> block

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
creates a Down force that doesn't block

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.500 
creates a Down force that doesn't block
the<00:03:51.440> air<00:03:51.560> flow<00:03:51.830> like<00:03:52.070> this<00:03:52.160> spoiler<00:03:52.610> lift<00:03:53.360> is

the air flow like this spoiler lift is

the air flow like this spoiler lift is
