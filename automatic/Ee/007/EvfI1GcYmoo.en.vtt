00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:23.510
 and she is that the post was jonathan 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.510
 launching on the men and women in 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:32.910
 situations that I currently see in the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:37.800
 actuality singing with the woman is this 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:50.059
 power all that she has today the modern 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:50.059
 she has the woman could not choose 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.010
 to work 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.130
 so check it out today as men 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.479
 vehicles will be that men of the 21st century 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
 He is a little afraid of the woman. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:18.060
 modern as weak 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.920
 hence the people about how the opinion of the 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.280
 in line with this matter what they 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.290
 think about the bag man and modern 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.900
 Is the man afraid of the woman? 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.400
 and he does not know how to 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 to relate 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.510
 What does she want as she is then maybe from here? 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.660
 by little I will give my opinion on 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 this subject wins the following I think 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:03:16.560
 how I got to be afraid but I see the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 man work better 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.590
 inferior is the fear of the 21st century man is 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.020
 only a war for me is this is fear of 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.310
 woman become ever more caring to 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.390
 and he is what is really happening 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.350
 that of mass mega space in society 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:43.200
 and man's peerless collar then the 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.620
 I almost did not go out or understand 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.739
 the woman had more the scenario is being 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:55.380
 larger than I do not know space in a way 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.630
 incredible face the woman the ina of the whole 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.590
 money is in the battle can speak 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:03.570
 It's not because it's because tomorrow is what 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.670
 will define your style this is not only the 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.920
 clothes style is what you know you 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:12.750
 talk your way so 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.290
 good afternoon guys, my name is peter 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.450
 hakim tell you a little bit here 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.250
 about the woman and a man of the 21st century 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.530
 the woman more and more she seeks her 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.350
 place in society leaving only 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.479
 be the hostess and she starts 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.050
 contribute financially to its 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.660
 home 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.820
 then begins to take the authorities away from 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.990
 men they had since the times 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.780
 ancient 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.910
 some men do not like it have 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.880
 that macho thinking but I think 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.360
 all must have the same right in the 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.360
 relationship 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.889
 but a feeling they remain the same 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.020
 want a happy home with the older husband 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.949
 to gain more from her and her 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.599
 children 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.539
 only that men prefer more women 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.349
 young people and a little social 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.030
 bottom 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:04.710
 so the older and better 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:07.259
 successful woman but this is for 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:10.020
 realize this dream only the time to 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:11.849
 change customs to allow 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.860
 men and women without finding 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:16.110
 again 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.990
 Hi. My name is Frank. 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:25.560
 I'm 20 years old in 2011 compared to 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.300
 much much more liberal is more 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.909
 independent 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.020
 formerly the right to vote for 

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.479
 example 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.029
 today if an advance in what concerns 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:41.430
 equal to equal rights 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:43.409
 men and women, but one can still see 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.779
 difference in issues such as opportunity 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:47.430
 professional and economic beyond 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:50.610
 participation in politics as well 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.139
 few women have if they are participate 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.469
 clear policy that we have today 

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.469
 dilma 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:24.389
 finally the social role of women culture 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:28.020
 eg human paper ply 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.940
 inferiority of the Arab woman she has 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:34.440
 a life practice completely 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:40.020
 different from the very western woman 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.940
 very restricted to their rights to their 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:48.419
 to dispose of but often simply 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:49.889
 and there are still many cases of 

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:54.030
 domestic violence as well. 

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:56.400
 despite the law Maria of the cliff is in Brazil 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.350
 to see what has been preventing equality 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.890
 of gender is a certain cultural barrier 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:04.710
 that it exists, it is true that 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.560
 there are prejudices but women who 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.590
 The expected day after day is believe and 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.790
 I hope this progress continues 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.790
 gender equality 

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:23.860
 No, mother. I 'm not going to wash the dishes. It 's a 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:23.860
 woman 

00:07:25.159 --> 00:07:30.319
 Hey, people, people, know how to be a woman. 

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.870
 also know how to respect the space of each 

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:36.319
 woman's functions are for society 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.509
 your opinion and this is it we will respect 

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:39.889
 my other know how to each occupy your 

00:07:38.509 --> 00:07:42.500
 role in society 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:44.870
 I will say that I respect with much love 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:47.330
 the bishopric of heart that everybody 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:51.349
 I was going to leave until the next material hugs 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:54.770
 women are mission, not me, we want 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:57.750
 they even with this said reason 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:04.809
 and the pressure than men more than 6 

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:04.809
