meters now taking a look at it more

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.299 
meters now taking a look at it more
closely<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.160> very<00:00:29.490> compact<00:00:30.800> unit<00:00:31.800> so

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
closely it is a very compact unit so

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.930 
closely it is a very compact unit so
that<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.820> now<00:00:32.940> store<00:00:33.270> on<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> shelf<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.760> we<00:00:35.760> can

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
that will now store on a shelf or we can

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.959 
that will now store on a shelf or we can

setting stopper for you to put in the
desired<00:01:05.369> setting<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.000> then<00:01:06.420> we<00:01:06.570> have<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
desired setting and then we have the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.740 
desired setting and then we have the
shutter<00:01:07.530> control<00:01:08.010> leaver<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.670> so<00:01:09.150> simply<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
shutter control leaver here so simply to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
shutter control leaver here so simply to
operate<00:01:10.229> when<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.830> want<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> start<00:01:11.790> spreading

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
operate when you want to start spreading

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.359 
operate when you want to start spreading
pull<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.869> lever<00:01:13.080> back<00:01:13.350> drop<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> over<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
pull the lever back drop it over the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.520 
pull the lever back drop it over the
stopper<00:01:14.880> there<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:15.780> literally<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.409> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
stopper there and then literally it's a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.130 
stopper there and then literally it's a
flip<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.670> shut<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.060> flow<00:01:18.270> off<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.930> once

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
flip up to shut the flow off so once

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.190 
flip up to shut the flow off so once
again<00:01:19.640> open<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.790> lock<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> behind<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.810> stopper

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
again open it lock it behind the stopper

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.070 
again open it lock it behind the stopper
there<00:01:22.439> that<00:01:23.369> shuts<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.850> off<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> right

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
there that shuts it off to the right

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.310 
there that shuts it off to the right
hand<00:01:25.409> side<00:01:25.680> we<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:27.060> crank<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.810> this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
hand side we have the crank and this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.219 
hand side we have the crank and this
operates<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.460> spinning<00:01:30.090> disc<00:01:30.360> this

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
operates the spinning disc this

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.260 
operates the spinning disc this
basically<00:01:31.860> replaces<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> wheels<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
basically replaces the wheels on a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.410 
basically replaces the wheels on a
wheeled<00:01:33.540> spreader<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:36.119> hopper

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
wheeled spreader so that as the hopper

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.200 
wheeled spreader so that as the hopper
is<00:01:36.570> opened<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.470> product<00:01:37.890> drops<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.549> onto

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
is opened the product drops through onto

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.990 
is opened the product drops through onto
the<00:01:39.329> spinning<00:01:39.600> disc<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:41.070> broadcast<00:01:41.759> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the spinning disc and is broadcast in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
the spinning disc and is broadcast in
front<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> operator<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.680> what<00:01:43.860> we'll<00:01:44.009> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
front of the operator so what we'll do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.340 
front of the operator so what we'll do
now<00:01:44.189> will<00:01:44.610> take<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> little<00:01:45.060> look<00:01:45.329> inside<00:01:45.899> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
now will take a little look inside and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.350 
now will take a little look inside and
have<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> look<00:01:46.920> at<00:01:47.070> what's<00:01:47.280> going<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
have a look at what's going on in the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.749 
have a look at what's going on in the
middle<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.509> hopper<00:01:51.840> opens<00:01:52.759> you

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
middle here so as the hopper opens you

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.660 
middle here so as the hopper opens you
can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.689> port<00:01:55.020> opens<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.950> if

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
can see there that the port opens and if

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
can see there that the port opens and if
I<00:01:56.759> just<00:01:56.939> leave<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.149> in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> set<00:01:57.960> position

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
I just leave that in the set position

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.819 
I just leave that in the set position
and<00:01:58.710> I<00:01:59.130> operate<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.700> crank<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.810> see<00:02:01.110> that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
and I operate the crank you can see that

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
and I operate the crank you can see that
little<00:02:02.070> agitator<00:02:02.640> moves<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.270> keeps

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
little agitator moves and keeps

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.319 
little agitator moves and keeps
everything<00:02:03.810> flowing<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.880> we'll<00:02:06.000> do<00:02:06.149> now

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
everything flowing so what we'll do now

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
everything flowing so what we'll do now
is<00:02:06.360> just<00:02:06.689> give<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.079> little<00:02:07.380> demonstration

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is just give you a little demonstration

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.150 
is just give you a little demonstration
of<00:02:08.369> how<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.610> use<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> idea<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.890> you're

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
of how to use this so the idea is you're

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.650 
of how to use this so the idea is you're
on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:11.520> lawn<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
on the lawn and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980 
on the lawn and
you<00:02:12.780> start<00:02:13.140> off<00:02:13.380> with<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.220> handle<00:02:14.610> crankin<00:02:15.210> so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
