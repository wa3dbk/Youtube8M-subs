00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.350
 good behavior on the road 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.809
 feeling of security is normal my 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 shock absorbers are new but as 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.500
 Know your past level of wear 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.690
 several years since its installation is 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.670
 need to be alert to reactions 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.190
 of the vehicle for example on wet ground 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 or when braking according to their behavior 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:27.020
 we will detect a possible wear of the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.020
 shock absorbers let me explain it 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.890
 and the shock absorbers play a role 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.660
 essential in behavior in 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.310
 vehicle road are those that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.040
 ensure that the wheels are always 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.170
 stuck to the ground in braking curves 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.160
 bad roads can 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.160
 check it in this scheme 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.920
 unlike other pieces like 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.660
 tires or brake pads do not 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.190
 There is no witness to wear that 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.500
 can notify us of the state of the 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.809
 shock absorbers in those conditions is 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.670
 difficult to know its level of wear at 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.140
 increase kilometers wear and tear 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.629
 the shock absorbers is affecting the 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.830
 behavior of the vehicle so I 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.229
 I would like to draw your attention to 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.729
 certain indications if at the time 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.670
 of braking your vehicle tends to 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.020
 lean forward if you feel that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.110
 It's hard to master the vehicle in 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.700
 wet roads or even if you observe 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.369
 that the tires have a 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.840
 deformation in the tread as 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:24.310
 well all these signs are the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.200
 confirmation of wear in the 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.960
 shock absorbers 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.070
 Here is another example that serves as a warning 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.590
 it's simple but clear some shock absorbers 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.570
 worn to 50 increase from a 5 to a 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.390
 10% your braking distance online 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.840
 straight and up to 20% your distance from 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.549
 braking in a curve therefore if you perceive 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.069
 one of these behavioral changes 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.990
 the vehicle passes to visit him 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.360
 we will attend throughout the day 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.659
 uninterrupted with or without appointment 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.659
 previous 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.110
 Since 2009 the ITV has reinforced the 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.150
 control over the shock absorbers the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.320
 controllers verify the quality of the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.830
 corrosion fixation wear of 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.990
 together and even the tightness of the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.210
 shock absorbers 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:21.100
 it is recommended to replace them from 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.080
 the 80,000 km and review them every 20 thousand 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.280
 respecting this frequency of control 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.760
 decreases the probability that you have 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.040
 to visit the workshop 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.709
 visit whenever you want a center you give me 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.590
 with or without appointment and for any 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.620
 another question I asked I'm your 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.620
 provision
