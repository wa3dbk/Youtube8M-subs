our emotions intensify we're coming into

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.740 
our emotions intensify we're coming into
a<00:00:26.550> day<00:00:27.000> or<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.859> great<00:00:28.859> intensity<00:00:29.580> yeah<00:00:30.300> yet

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
a day or two of great intensity yeah yet

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.200 
a day or two of great intensity yeah yet
we<00:00:31.410> start<00:00:31.769> today<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.279> moon<00:00:32.430> in<00:00:32.579> Libra<00:00:33.030> an

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
we start today with the moon in Libra an

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.049 
we start today with the moon in Libra an
air<00:00:33.630> sign<00:00:34.050> which<00:00:34.350> wants<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:35.010> be<00:00:35.160> rational<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
air sign which wants to be rational and

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.240 
air sign which wants to be rational and
reasonable<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.559> look<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.010> things

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
reasonable and look at things

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.819 
reasonable and look at things
objectively<00:00:39.110> but<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.469> it's<00:00:40.680> going

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
objectively but I don't think it's going

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.440 
objectively but I don't think it's going
to<00:00:40.890> happen<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.700> planet<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> has

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
to happen because the planet that has

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
to happen because the planet that has
the<00:00:42.690> most<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.410> do<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.710> how<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:43.890> look<00:00:44.250> at

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
the most to do with how we look at

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.110 
the most to do with how we look at
things<00:00:44.550> Marie<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.840> skewed<00:00:46.710> into<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.370> squishy

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
things Marie is skewed into a squishy

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.200 
things Marie is skewed into a squishy
angle<00:00:48.750> with<00:00:49.260> fuzzy<00:00:49.680> Neptune<00:00:50.309> meaning<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.000> we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
angle with fuzzy Neptune meaning that we

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
angle with fuzzy Neptune meaning that we
can<00:00:51.390> say<00:00:51.629> things<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.170> profound<00:00:52.860> confidence

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
can say things with profound confidence

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.670 
can say things with profound confidence
today<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> be<00:00:54.270> completely<00:00:54.840> wrong<00:00:55.260> yeah<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
today and be completely wrong yeah I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.209 
today and be completely wrong yeah I
think<00:00:56.180> that's<00:00:57.180> exactly<00:00:57.559> no<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.949> you're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
think that's exactly no I think you're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.410 
think that's exactly no I think you're
actually<00:00:59.399> correct<00:00:59.910> even<00:01:00.120> if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.390> think

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
actually correct even if you think

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.689 
actually correct even if you think
you're<00:01:00.750> wrong<00:01:00.930> which<00:01:01.469> means<00:01:01.980> well<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.430> thought

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
you're wrong which means well I thought

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
you're wrong which means well I thought
I<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.969> right<00:01:03.149> when<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.359> said<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.870> but<00:01:04.019> after

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
I was right when I said it but after

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.840 
I was right when I said it but after
what<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.100> exactly<00:01:05.400> what<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
what I and this is exactly what this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.700 
what I and this is exactly what this
aspect<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.720> when<00:01:06.930> mercury<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.680> planet

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
aspect is about when mercury the planet

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.899 
aspect is about when mercury the planet
of<00:01:08.130> rationality<00:01:09.080> especially<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
of rationality especially in in in in

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.230 
of rationality especially in in in in
Leo<00:01:12.450> where<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.860> puts<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.400> says<00:01:14.640> things<00:01:14.939> right

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
Leo where it puts it says things right

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.510 
Leo where it puts it says things right
out<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.890> puts<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
out the way it is it puts it on the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.910 
out the way it is it puts it on the
surface<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> when<00:01:18.630> when<00:01:18.930> mercury<00:01:19.200> lines<00:01:19.680> up

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
surface and when when mercury lines up

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.770 
surface and when when mercury lines up
with<00:01:20.100> Neptune<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.630> like

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
with Neptune like this it's like

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.719 
with Neptune like this it's like
whatever<00:01:22.110> we<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.009> going<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.430> isn't

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
whatever we think is going on isn't

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
whatever we think is going on isn't
what's<00:01:24.060> going<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> whatever<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.200> say

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
what's going on and whatever we say

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
what's going on and whatever we say
isn't<00:01:25.799> quite<00:01:26.040> true<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.580> things<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.270> way

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
isn't quite true and things have a way

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.690 
isn't quite true and things have a way
of<00:01:27.509> turning<00:01:27.869> into<00:01:28.170> something<00:01:28.920> different<00:01:29.520> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
of turning into something different and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.749 
of turning into something different and
I'm<00:01:30.240> confused<00:01:31.009> well<00:01:32.009> I<00:01:32.040> think<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I'm confused well I think one of the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.370 
I'm confused well I think one of the
ways<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> most<00:01:33.570> out<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:34.020> day<00:01:34.200> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
ways to get the most out of a day like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950 
ways to get the most out of a day like
today<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> appreciate<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.600> artistic<00:01:36.600> side

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
today is to appreciate the artistic side
