if<00:03:50.020> you'll<00:03:50.350> have<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:50.770> take<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.130> case<00:03:51.370> off<00:03:51.610> most

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
if you'll have to take the case off most

likely<00:03:52.480> we<00:03:53.230> didn't<00:03:53.470> have<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.620> chance<00:03:53.860> to<00:03:54.040> test

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
likely we didn't have a chance to test

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.640 
likely we didn't have a chance to test
it<00:03:54.700> since<00:03:54.940> we<00:03:55.090> don't<00:03:55.209> have<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.480> doc<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:56.620> the

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
it since we don't have a doc for the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.580 
plugging in the micro USB for the charge
was<00:04:20.620> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:21.549> snug<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.419> think<00:04:22.810> on<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.320> top

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590

was a little snug I think on the top
part<00:04:23.980> but<00:04:24.490> so<00:04:25.180> be<00:04:25.330> careful<00:04:25.840> at<00:04:26.290> sometimes<00:04:26.830> it

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
part but so be careful at sometimes it

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.969 
part but so be careful at sometimes it
might<00:04:27.160> pop<00:04:27.400> out<00:04:28.020> but<00:04:29.020> for<00:04:29.320> the<00:04:29.380> most<00:04:29.590> part<00:04:29.680> it

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
might pop out but for the most part it

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:33.240 
might pop out but for the most part it
fit<00:04:30.190> nice<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:31.270> case<00:04:31.780> itself<00:04:32.229> feels<00:04:32.919> good

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250
