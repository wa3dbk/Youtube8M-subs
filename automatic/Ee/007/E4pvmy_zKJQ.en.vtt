00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.660 
kettle boiling but it's very important
because<00:02:28.239> now<00:02:28.900> we<00:02:28.959> need<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.230> put<00:02:29.680> in<00:02:30.099> some<00:02:30.280> hot

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
because now we need to put in some hot

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.490 
because now we need to put in some hot
water<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:31.870> bring<00:02:32.049> up<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.200> temperature

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
water so you bring up the temperature

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.650 
water so you bring up the temperature
because<00:02:32.920> at<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.069> moment<00:02:33.099> this<00:02:33.580> is<00:02:33.760> 30<00:02:34.120> points

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
because at the moment this is 30 points

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.910 
because at the moment this is 30 points
of<00:02:35.280> cold<00:02:36.280> water<00:02:36.870> you<00:02:37.870> see<00:02:38.049> it's<00:02:38.200> fairly<00:02:38.650> full

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
of cold water you see it's fairly full

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.610 
of cold water you see it's fairly full
up<00:02:39.299> it's<00:02:40.299> got<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> nice<00:02:40.629> beer<00:02:40.989> looking<00:02:41.349> color

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
up it's got a nice beer looking color

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.240 
up it's got a nice beer looking color
which<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.099> nice<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:43.170> place<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.200> deep<00:02:44.470> from<00:02:44.709> that

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
which is nice and place a deep from that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.990 
which is nice and place a deep from that
we're<00:02:45.370> going<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.519> bring<00:02:45.670> up<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.790> temperature

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
we're going to bring up the temperature

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
we're going to bring up the temperature
to<00:02:46.150> about<00:02:46.269> 20<00:02:46.630> degrees<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.170> so<00:02:47.680> then<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.099> can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
to about 20 degrees and so then it can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.550 
to about 20 degrees and so then it can
start<00:02:48.459> fermenting<00:02:48.610> properly<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.290> even

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
start fermenting properly but it even

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.500 
start fermenting properly but it even
looks<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.920> big<00:02:51.400> beer<00:02:51.700> right<00:02:52.000> now<00:02:52.030> doesn't
