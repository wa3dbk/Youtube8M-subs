00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
putting down his command center so both

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.340

here<00:02:25.620> they're<00:02:26.490> both<00:02:26.670> putting<00:02:26.970> up<00:02:27.150> their

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
here they're both putting up their

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.680 
here they're both putting up their
expansions<00:02:27.990> and<00:02:28.200> it's<00:02:29.390> kind<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.450> interesting

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
expansions and it's kind of interesting

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120 
expansions and it's kind of interesting
because<00:02:30.960> I<00:02:31.350> don't<00:02:31.530> think<00:02:31.590> either<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:32.010> them

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
because I don't think either of them

out so they're both working towards a
macro<00:02:37.770> build<00:02:38.040> here<00:02:38.250> this<00:02:38.610> could<00:02:38.760> be<00:02:38.880> very

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
macro build here this could be very

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.660 
macro build here this could be very
interesting<00:02:39.180> outcome<00:02:40.070> very<00:02:41.070> interested<00:02:41.640> to

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.780 
14 Nexus you don't see that very often I
think<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.740> just<00:02:46.890> because<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.280> map<00:02:47.460> is<00:02:47.490> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
think it's just because this map is so

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.060 
think it's just because this map is so
large<00:02:48.060> he<00:02:48.390> felt<00:02:48.840> safer<00:02:49.260> going<00:02:49.410> for<00:02:49.710> it<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.890> this

kind of a two racks pushers some kind I

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
too big I've been a disadvantage they're

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.480 
too big I've been a disadvantage they're
losing<00:04:09.630> those<00:04:09.870> minerals<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.770> here<00:04:11.190> comes<00:04:11.370> the

reason he is just absolutely crazy at
macro<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:50.250> was<00:04:50.460> exactly<00:04:50.939> how<00:04:51.150> many<00:04:51.210> probes<00:04:51.599> to

get exactly when a transfer them he

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.149 
get exactly when a transfer them he
knows<00:04:54.300> exactly<00:04:54.689> when<00:04:55.199> to<00:04:55.229> take<00:04:55.469> his<00:04:55.620> bases<00:04:56.039> and

00:04:56.149 --> 00:04:56.159 
knows exactly when to take his bases and

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.399 
knows exactly when to take his bases and
everything<00:04:56.520> like<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.729> just<00:04:57.509> maximize<00:04:58.199> his

00:04:58.399 --> 00:04:58.409 
everything like that just maximize his

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.559 
everything like that just maximize his

capacity to make units cybernetics core
is<00:05:03.750> spinning<00:05:04.259> that<00:05:04.500> means<00:05:04.740> there<00:05:05.069> is<00:05:05.189> going<00:05:05.370> to

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
is spinning that means there is going to

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.059 
is spinning that means there is going to
be<00:05:05.520> some<00:05:05.789> jagan<00:05:06.120> range<00:05:06.389> up<00:05:06.599> soon<00:05:07.069> robotics

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:08.069 
be some jagan range up soon robotics

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.129 
be some jagan range up soon robotics
facility<00:05:08.189> coming<00:05:08.729> up<00:05:08.849> so<00:05:09.779> i<00:05:09.810> think<00:05:09.900> we're

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
facility coming up so i think we're

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.529 
facility coming up so i think we're
going<00:05:10.229> to<00:05:10.319> see<00:05:10.349> some<00:05:10.699> River<00:05:11.699> harassment<00:05:12.360> very

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
going to see some River harassment very

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.540 
going to see some River harassment very
very<00:05:12.719> soon<00:05:12.960> here<00:05:13.409> comes<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.680> second<00:05:14.009> factory<00:05:14.370> so

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
very soon here comes a second factory so

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.580 
very soon here comes a second factory so
I<00:05:14.580> think<00:05:14.669> Watson<00:05:15.360> is<00:05:15.689> thinking<00:05:15.990> about<00:05:16.050> doing<00:05:16.319> a

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
I think Watson is thinking about doing a

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.939 
I think Watson is thinking about doing a
two<00:05:16.949> fact<00:05:17.159> push<00:05:17.400> of<00:05:17.580> some<00:05:17.729> kind<00:05:17.939> I<00:05:18.860> think<00:05:19.860> he's

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
two fact push of some kind I think he's

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.769 
two fact push of some kind I think he's
gonna<00:05:20.099> take<00:05:20.490> all<00:05:20.729> his<00:05:20.939> marines<00:05:21.300> out<00:05:21.449> as<00:05:21.599> well

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
gonna take all his marines out as well

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.480 
gonna take all his marines out as well
these<00:05:22.259> brains<00:05:22.529> but<00:05:22.710> might<00:05:23.129> be<00:05:23.250> in<00:05:23.340> trouble

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
these brains but might be in trouble

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.659 
these brains but might be in trouble
because<00:05:23.849> best<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.509> think<00:05:24.990> best<00:05:25.229> has<00:05:25.529> his<00:05:25.919> jus

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
because best I think best has his jus

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.589 
because best I think best has his jus
goon<00:05:26.849> range<00:05:27.979> already<00:05:28.979> done<00:05:29.430> so<00:05:29.969> if<00:05:30.120> best<00:05:30.360> moves

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
goon range already done so if best moves

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:32.329 
goon range already done so if best moves
in<00:05:30.779> right<00:05:30.930> now<00:05:31.050> you<00:05:31.110> might<00:05:31.379> be<00:05:31.469> able<00:05:31.529> to<00:05:31.680> snipe

00:05:32.329 --> 00:05:32.339 
in right now you might be able to snipe

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:34.999 
in right now you might be able to snipe
quite<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.849> few<00:05:33.180> Marines<00:05:33.509> here<00:05:34.469> comes<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.770> tank

00:05:34.999 --> 00:05:35.009 
quite a few Marines here comes a tank

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:37.100 
quite a few Marines here comes a tank
though<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.400> think<00:05:35.909> once<00:05:36.150> best<00:05:36.449> sees<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:36.810> tank

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
though I think once best sees that tank

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.309 
though I think once best sees that tank
he's<00:05:37.409> going<00:05:37.650> to<00:05:38.419> fall<00:05:39.419> back<00:05:39.599> to<00:05:39.750> his<00:05:39.839> base

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:42.319 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:45.730 

range<00:05:43.319> is<00:05:43.469> going<00:05:43.620> to<00:05:43.680> help<00:05:43.800> him<00:05:43.919> a<00:05:44.009> lot<00:05:44.159> though

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
range is going to help him a lot though

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.879 
range is going to help him a lot though
despite<00:05:46.740> those<00:05:47.900> marines<00:05:48.900> and<00:05:49.199> keep<00:05:49.409> the<00:05:49.710> range

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
despite those marines and keep the range

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.309 
despite those marines and keep the range
from<00:05:50.129> tackling<00:05:50.750> anything<00:05:51.750> else<00:05:51.930> he<00:05:52.080> might<00:05:52.199> be

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
from tackling anything else he might be

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.300 
from tackling anything else he might be
thinking<00:05:52.349> about<00:05:52.529> doing<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:52.889> think<00:05:52.949> he's<00:05:53.159> going

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
thinking about doing I think he's going

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.980 
thinking about doing I think he's going
to<00:05:53.400> try<00:05:53.550> to<00:05:53.580> do<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:53.819> dark<00:05:54.089> templar<00:05:54.539> drop<00:05:54.779> here

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
to try to do a dark templar drop here

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.719 
to try to do a dark templar drop here
