00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.260
 U 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.930
 U 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:30.310
 Why do I have to take a subject in mathematics 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:34.420
 How much achievement is required in the subject to meet the entrance requirements 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.860
 I'll think about this one. 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:41.710
 I do not know. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:44.260
 The profession is obviously hiding the mathematical problems from the ability to memorialize 2 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:49.360
 The ability to solve and answer 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:53.620
 It is a subject that requires step-by-step thinking and creativity. Suddenly , 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.879
 There is to be cooked through continuous learning, rather than giving the body out of the way 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:03.030
 That 's why we need Mathematics 2 as a tool for such learning . 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.030
 So what do you do to be good at math? 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.800
 Unlike savings sseuk is not shy with other subjects of the zone the unique learning structure 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.390
 You have 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:19.620
 It's a spiral learning structure. It's a painting. 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.510
 As it goes up, it goes up and goes up to grade. 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.610
 Each grade corresponds to each grade, easy grading by grade, step by step 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.560
 I 'll be able to step on it. 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:35.670
 However, these helical structures can go fairly steady. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.990
 On the other hand, there is one disadvantage : 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.020
 Even if it is difficult to go over to the stage, 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.750
 I tried to force the next step of the stethoscope . 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:55.110
 Old ms is a domestic product that complements the disadvantages of x kujo 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:02:01.430
 If you study mathematics by area and learn horizontally across a young woman, 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.430
 It has the advantage of being able to arrange for a short period of time 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:14.400
 Ode Mat is a three-keyword storytelling creative in 2009 revised curriculum 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 Troubleshooting Steam reflects all three keywords . 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:25.860
 Old Man 's Story telling is a fun story of living 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:30.959
 The surrounding phenomena or things or concepts which areas of mathematics textbooks in conjunction with 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:35.489
 It can lead to interest and interest in mathematics in terms of being connected 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.480
 Old ms is simply a math problem or a verbose explanation 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.620
 It's not. 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.580
 To find and solve mathematical principles contained in problem situations 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.700
 Do it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:50.160
 This is creative problem solving. 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:55.319
 We are providing all kinds of compulsory math problems with creative thinking in connection with the unit. 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.980
 How can the textbook concept be associated with a language- based pair? 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.060
 Because I have thought that I can receive the map, 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:07.530
 It will be done in a natural way. 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.000
 It can be a bit difficult to say that this is a fusion of various areas 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.230
 I can see it as a form. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.220
 In addition to Holden Messe , the science and technology engineering arts etc. 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.450
 Opportunity for accreditation thinking by meeting fusion mathematical problems 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.340
 provide 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.230
 It is a natural learning flow that maintains the linkage of contents . 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.920
 Can improve 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:35.010
 Learning to focus on here, you can increase your troubleshooting opera 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:40.019
 I'm ready and we would come to this type of Seven types of factory factory 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:44.160
 The concepts you have studied ahead of you are more diverse and then 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.109
 Solve problems by asking questions and expressing numbers or changing expressions 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.239
 I can get a lot of sense . 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:52.709
 Because it is easy to find the clogged part in the instruction river of the consent, it is efficient supplement 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.799
 Learning is possible 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:04:01.019
 These are the horizontal learning effects of each area. 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:05.250
 You can organize concepts from elementary math to central harvest in a short period of time. 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:09.209
 You can improve your self-directed learning ability by utilizing internet lectures 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:13.500
 A five-minute teacher who specializes in each area will be with you. 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.409
 So if you do not know what you are studying, 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 It's easy enough and fun if you study together 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:24.539
 It can be seen once from elementary school to 9th grade middle school. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.530
 It is the old ms demi that you can study so that you can 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:31.320
 There is 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:36.000
 Now , if you can not do math right now, 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:40.459
 Through the art of golddening, we can make the weaker part stronger and stronger. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.889
 The part will be able to complement a little more strongly 

00:04:40.459 --> 00:04:44.889
 Middle school low price to look at the best
