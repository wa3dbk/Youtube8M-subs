update to be coming out alright so the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.740 
update to be coming out alright so the
first<00:01:47.490> thing<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.909> think<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.240> going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.479> come<00:01:48.630> out

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
first thing I think is going to come out

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560 
first thing I think is going to come out
I<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.439> could<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.820> some<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.360> add

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
I think we could have some kind of add

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.060 
I think we could have some kind of add
on<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.979> current<00:01:53.700> air<00:01:53.820> defense<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:55.409> usual

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
on to current air defense and as usual

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.859 
on to current air defense and as usual
I'm<00:01:56.310> pretty<00:01:56.579> sure<00:01:56.880> this<00:01:57.119> update<00:01:57.509> is<00:01:57.540> going<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
I'm pretty sure this update is going to

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.580 
I'm pretty sure this update is going to
be<00:01:57.990> targeted<00:01:58.320> mostly<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.820> Townsville<00:02:00.420> 10<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
be targeted mostly for Townsville 10 so

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
be targeted mostly for Townsville 10 so
I<00:02:01.619> do<00:02:01.890> expect<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.729> either<00:02:02.909> air<00:02:03.420> defense

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
I do expect that either air defense

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
I do expect that either air defense
tower<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:04.530> upgraded<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.009> level<00:02:05.460> nine<00:02:05.490> on

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
tower will be upgraded to level nine on

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
tower will be upgraded to level nine on
or<00:02:06.689> we'll<00:02:06.960> see<00:02:07.229> some<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.740> of<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.920> tweak<00:02:08.369> to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
or we'll see some kind of a tweak to

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.809 
or we'll see some kind of a tweak to
exist<00:02:09.360> in<00:02:09.479> love

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
exist in love

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.360 
exist in love
in<00:02:10.030> what<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.420> mean<00:02:10.479> by<00:02:10.749> that<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.890> we<00:02:12.040> know<00:02:12.189> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
in what I mean by that so we know the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.489 
in what I mean by that so we know the
archer<00:02:12.790> top<00:02:12.999> we're<00:02:13.150> level<00:02:13.420> 13<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:13.959> adjusted

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:14.499 
archer top we're level 13 was adjusted

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.069 
archer top we're level 13 was adjusted
and<00:02:14.920> we're<00:02:15.129> any<00:02:15.340> other<00:02:15.549> tower<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:15.939> suppose<00:02:16.329> and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
and we're any other tower I suppose and

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.110 
and we're any other tower I suppose and
it's<00:02:17.290> shooting<00:02:17.590> now<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> lot<00:02:18.069> faster<00:02:18.340> it<00:02:18.819> does

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
it's shooting now a lot faster it does

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.849 
it's shooting now a lot faster it does
little<00:02:19.450> bit<00:02:19.629> less<00:02:19.810> damage<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.499> it<00:02:20.680> shoots

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:20.859 
little bit less damage but it shoots

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.550 
little bit less damage but it shoots
twice<00:02:21.249> as<00:02:21.639> fast<00:02:21.909> so<00:02:22.599> with<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:22.959> current<00:02:23.200> lava

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
twice as fast so with the current lava

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.559 
twice as fast so with the current lava
l'union<00:02:24.010> attacks<00:02:24.370> they're<00:02:24.790> absolutely

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
l'union attacks they're absolutely

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.740 
l'union attacks they're absolutely
brutal<00:02:25.959> even<00:02:26.650> Tom<00:02:26.859> Colt<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:27.400> quite<00:02:28.060> off<00:02:28.209> quite

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
brutal even Tom Colt and quite off quite

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.020 
brutal even Tom Colt and quite off quite
often<00:02:28.930> cannot<00:02:29.439> defend<00:02:29.889> against<00:02:30.489> like<00:02:30.730> three

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
often cannot defend against like three

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.289 
often cannot defend against like three
llamas<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.629> balloons<00:02:32.109> and<00:02:32.409> max<00:02:33.400> hero<00:02:33.819> so<00:02:34.120> with

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
llamas and balloons and max hero so with

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.149 
llamas and balloons and max hero so with
that<00:02:34.389> being<00:02:34.569> said<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:35.109> think<00:02:35.409> they're<00:02:35.919> a<00:02:35.950> little

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
that being said I think they're a little

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:38.399 
that being said I think they're a little

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:43.919 
talking about out of my butt and

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.170 
talking about out of my butt and
spreading<00:02:44.919> rumors<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.489> what<00:02:45.790> I<00:02:45.819> really<00:02:46.150> think

spreading rumors and what I really think

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.780 
spreading rumors and what I really think
about<00:02:46.599> is<00:02:46.840> so<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.560> think<00:02:47.829> that<00:02:48.099> we're<00:02:48.370> gonna<00:02:48.489> see

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
about is so I think that we're gonna see

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.360 
about is so I think that we're gonna see
either<00:02:49.000> air<00:02:49.359> defense<00:02:49.719> level<00:02:49.989> 9<00:02:50.500> or<00:02:50.829> we<00:02:51.189> will

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
either air defense level 9 or we will

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.149 
either air defense level 9 or we will
see<00:02:51.669> this<00:02:51.879> level<00:02:52.329> 8<00:02:52.540> tweet<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.829> it's<00:02:53.889> gonna

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
see this level 8 tweet that it's gonna

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:57.569 
see this level 8 tweet that it's gonna
be<00:02:54.340> shooting<00:02:54.699> maybe<00:02:54.969> not<00:02:55.239> as<00:02:55.419> strong<00:02:56.379> but<00:02:56.739> he

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
be shooting maybe not as strong but he

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.610 
be shooting maybe not as strong but he
will<00:02:57.909> be<00:02:58.030> shooting<00:02:58.359> a<00:02:58.480> lot<00:02:58.810> faster<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.379> the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
will be shooting a lot faster and the

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.670 
will be shooting a lot faster and the
reason<00:02:59.889> why<00:03:00.040> because<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.669> far<00:03:01.109> lava<00:03:02.109> lunians

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
reason why because so far lava lunians

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.030 
reason why because so far lava lunians
or<00:03:02.949> a<00:03:03.010> love<00:03:03.549> of<00:03:03.579> hounds<00:03:04.090> have<00:03:04.480> those<00:03:05.379> mini<00:03:05.739> pops

and with that being said current air

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.009 
and with that being said current air
defense<00:03:09.040> cannot<00:03:09.669> kill<00:03:10.060> them<00:03:10.180> fast<00:03:10.359> enough<00:03:10.599> the

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
defense cannot kill them fast enough the

Expos arity fans even waste hours or
inferno<00:03:14.859> towers<00:03:15.099> once<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.669> drop<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:16.000> freeze

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
inferno towers once you drop the freeze

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.649 
inferno towers once you drop the freeze
their<00:03:17.139> history<00:03:17.620> so<00:03:18.519> number<00:03:18.909> two<00:03:18.939> what<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.389> think

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
their history so number two what I think

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.439 
their history so number two what I think
is<00:03:19.750> gonna<00:03:19.900> come<00:03:20.139> out<00:03:20.290> yes<00:03:21.069> so<00:03:21.340> here<00:03:21.639> we<00:03:21.790> go<00:03:21.819> this

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:22.449 
is gonna come out yes so here we go this

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:24.990 
is gonna come out yes so here we go this
is<00:03:22.689> probably<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.519> closest<00:03:24.519> call<00:03:24.729> that<00:03:24.970> I

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
is probably the closest call that I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.170 
is probably the closest call that I
would<00:03:25.299> ever<00:03:25.479> bet<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.109> because<00:03:26.769> i<00:03:27.040> think<00:03:27.819> that

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
would ever bet on because i think that

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.189 
would ever bet on because i think that
with<00:03:29.019> every<00:03:29.680> other<00:03:29.919> defense<00:03:30.579> tower<00:03:31.239> upgraded

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
with every other defense tower upgraded

with every other defense tower upgraded

let's talk about troops we know now we
have

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
have

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.379

max troops of barbarians archers and
Giants<00:04:25.389> level<00:04:25.720> 7<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.350> that<00:04:26.530> leaves<00:04:26.740> us<00:04:26.980> with

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
Giants level 7 so that leaves us with

the<00:05:31.750> rest<00:05:31.930> of<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.139> features<00:05:32.470> I<00:05:32.680> don't<00:05:33.280> think

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
the rest of the features I don't think

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.460 
the rest of the features I don't think
this<00:05:33.760> is<00:05:33.940> gonna<00:05:34.030> be<00:05:34.210> the<00:05:34.330> major<00:05:34.539> update<00:05:35.110> the

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
this is gonna be the major update the

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460
