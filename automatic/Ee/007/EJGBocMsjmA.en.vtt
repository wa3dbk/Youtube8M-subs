00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:54.800 
ones we used to make in the previous
video<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.440> fold<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:41.950> reversely<00:02:42.069> like<00:02:42.760> this

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.900 

with<00:02:55.350> some<00:02:55.590> glue<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.100> center<00:02:56.550> of<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> roll

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
with some glue at the center of the roll

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.400 
with some glue at the center of the roll
and<00:02:57.209> hold<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.840> like<00:02:58.020> that

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.590 

then<00:03:03.980> put<00:03:04.220> some<00:03:04.250> glue<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.910> the<00:03:04.970> piece<00:03:05.240> of<00:03:05.390> roll

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
then put some glue on the piece of roll

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.580 
then put some glue on the piece of roll
and<00:03:05.810> hold<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.320> other<00:03:06.410> piece<00:03:06.740> in<00:03:06.920> place

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.350 

after<00:03:14.590> that<00:03:14.830> stick<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.550> scope<00:03:15.819> between<00:03:16.239> the

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
after that stick the scope between the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.870 
after that stick the scope between the
rolls<00:03:16.540> like<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:20.130> but<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.280> problem<00:03:21.610> is<00:03:21.730> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
rolls like this but the problem is the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.670 
rolls like this but the problem is the
scope<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.360> whenever<00:03:22.750> you<00:03:22.959> want<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.319> shoot<00:03:23.500> a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
scope is whenever you want to shoot a

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.390 
scope is whenever you want to shoot a
rubber<00:03:23.860> band

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
rubber band

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.699 
rubber band
the<00:03:24.610> strobe<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.090> going<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.360> work<00:03:25.540> its<00:03:25.720> way<00:03:25.989> so

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
the strobe is going to work its way so

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.380 
the strobe is going to work its way so
you<00:03:26.800> will<00:03:26.920> need<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.130> take<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.550> out<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:30.390> that's

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
you will need to take it out and that's

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.559 
you will need to take it out and that's
