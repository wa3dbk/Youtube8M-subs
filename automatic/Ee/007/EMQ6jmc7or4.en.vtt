with the 2013 Chevy Traverse is almost

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.100 
with the 2013 Chevy Traverse is almost
up<00:00:11.100> but<00:00:11.309> before<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.209> take<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.480> car<00:00:12.690> away<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
up but before they take the car away I

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.980 
up but before they take the car away I
wanted<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.559> do<00:00:13.709> this<00:00:13.860> quick<00:00:14.010> video<00:00:14.930> about<00:00:15.930> a

wanted to do this quick video about a

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.210 
wanted to do this quick video about a
feature<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.619> might<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
feature that I think might be a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.519 
feature that I think might be a
deal-breaker<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> lot<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> parents<00:00:18.840> with

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
deal-breaker for a lot of parents with

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.579 
deal-breaker for a lot of parents with
multiple<00:00:20.130> kids<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.660> feature<00:00:21.960> seems<00:00:22.349> to

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
multiple kids and this feature seems to

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.439 
multiple kids and this feature seems to
be<00:00:22.710> very<00:00:23.039> popular<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:23.759> with<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> crossover

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
kind of wanted to point it out to the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.409 
kind of wanted to point it out to the
car<00:00:28.710> manufacturers<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.699> I<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.359> know

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
car manufacturers because I don't know

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:31.730 
car manufacturers because I don't know
why<00:00:30.539> they're<00:00:30.720> doing<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.619> them<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
why they're doing it and I want them to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.670 
why they're doing it and I want them to
change<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.400> here's<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:33.060> it<00:00:33.090> is<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:34.260> top

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
change it so here's what it is the top

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.580 
change it so here's what it is the top
tether<00:00:35.160> anchor<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> third<00:00:36.390> row<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:37.050> lot<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
tether anchor on the third row a lot of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.229 
tether anchor on the third row a lot of
crossover<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.190> not<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> Traverse<00:00:38.940> but

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
crossover is not just the Traverse but

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
crossover is not just the Traverse but
I'm<00:00:39.390> using<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.050> example<00:00:40.280> have<00:00:41.280> one

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
I'm using this as an example have one

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.310 
I'm using this as an example have one
top<00:00:41.969> tether<00:00:42.239> anchor<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> center

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
top tether anchor and it's in the center

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.500 
top tether anchor and it's in the center
of<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> third<00:00:43.829> row<00:00:44.039> and<00:00:44.070> that's<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.850> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of the third row and that's it that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.860 
of the third row and that's it that
means<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.109> can<00:00:46.289> only<00:00:46.879> secure<00:00:47.879> one

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
means you can only secure one

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.009 
means you can only secure one
convertible<00:00:49.469> car<00:00:49.680> seat<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.489> third<00:00:50.699> row

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
convertible car seat in that third row

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.009 
convertible car seat in that third row
so<00:00:52.019> I<00:00:52.320> don't<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.859> I<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.430> if<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.510> okay<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.870> me

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
so I don't know I I if it's okay with me

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.599 
so I don't know I I if it's okay with me
because<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.440> have<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> convertible<00:00:56.190> car<00:00:56.370> seat

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
because I have a convertible car seat

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:59.270 
because I have a convertible car seat
and<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.420> booster<00:00:57.899> car<00:00:58.140> seat<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> don't<00:00:59.160> need

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
and a booster car seat so I don't need

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
and a booster car seat so I don't need
to<00:00:59.370> secure<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.879> booster<00:01:00.179> with<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.329> top<00:01:00.539> tether

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
to secure the booster with a top tether

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.329 
to secure the booster with a top tether
but<00:01:01.019> you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.440> what<00:01:01.530> it's<00:01:01.620> actually<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.160> okay

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
but you know what it's actually not okay

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.299 
but you know what it's actually not okay
with<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.480> did<00:01:04.379> ask<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.800> expert<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
with me because I did ask an expert and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
with me because I did ask an expert and
she<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.640> say<00:01:05.940> that<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.510> could<00:01:06.560> top<00:01:07.560> tether

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
she did say that I could top tether

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.550 
she did say that I could top tether
across<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.790> an<00:01:08.910> angle<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.080> don't<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
across at an angle but I don't think I

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.190 
across at an angle but I don't think I
trust<00:01:10.620> that<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.730> not<00:01:12.120> I<00:01:12.300> want<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.780> top<00:01:12.990> tether

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
trust that I'm not I want the top tether

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.530 
trust that I'm not I want the top tether
behind<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.830> car<00:01:14.070> seat<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.880> exactly<00:01:15.390> how

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
behind the car seat so it's exactly how

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
behind the car seat so it's exactly how
it<00:01:15.660> should<00:01:15.690> be<00:01:16.140> installed<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.890> don't<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.370> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
it should be installed I don't think I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.550 
it should be installed I don't think I
should<00:01:17.490> cross<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.270> over<00:01:18.360> even<00:01:19.140> though<00:01:19.230> it<00:01:19.380> says

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
should cross it over even though it says

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080 
should cross it over even though it says
it's<00:01:19.590> okay<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:20.040> say<00:01:20.190> it's<00:01:20.340> okay<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:21.030> not

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
it's okay they say it's okay I'm not

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.360 
it's okay they say it's okay I'm not
sure<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.690> do<00:01:21.810> that<00:01:21.960> so<00:01:22.260> what<00:01:23.160> I<00:01:23.310> would
