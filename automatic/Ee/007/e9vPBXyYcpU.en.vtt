00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:11.349
 bensdorf 100 is in someone's mirror 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:19.279
 Some say they are the most beautiful 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:21.289
 Hello, hello, I welcome you all 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:25.579
 heartily to my top 100 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:28.669
 favorite games ever make it the first one 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.019
 Great top 100 list I try 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.149
 ever create 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.630
 and I also found that it 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.950
 a damn difficult task is in 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.080
 this video is not yet 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.450
 so I want to go to you first of all have 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.420
 to say that and also a bit 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.160
 Insight as I enter the whole 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.170
 I tackled because I think that's 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.230
 but listen to it very exciting 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.180
 Of course you have to be clear 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.490
 say that so list is always total 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.380
 Subjectively everyone is different 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.850
 favorite games and even if the one 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.810
 or others now he thinks the divides 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 opinion with me 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:03.320
 there will always be games on this 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.699
 list he finds himself says boah 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.159
 I think so maybe even totally 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.969
 stupid or I would be completely different 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.200
 classified 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.799
 that does not fit in with the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.109
 opinion and I must say well now 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.719
 that behind me have the process too 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.829
 I know what is placed where 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:21.770
 maybe my list too 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.369
 some provocative is partly some 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.049
 they really play very high 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.039
 viewed are perhaps found 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.619
 not on my list 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.079
 there may be one for that 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.719
 Relatively bad card game relative 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.630
 far above or where I understand too 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.020
 can that be surprised then people but 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.520
 it is just my list and is there too 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.609
 a few things to note 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.689
 Above all, it is subjective then I have 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.999
 I'm more or less on it 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.679
 which games I also all limited 

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.520
 that's not how it really is 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.529
 what you see here 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.929
 but most of all, I played it 

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:01.240
 also a lot of games and where I am too 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.680
 really think that 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.970
 I want to play the ones over and over again 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.350
 I also want to own games 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.240
 are partly very similar and there 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.619
 I need only one of and 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.209
 others will fly out even if they are 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.470
 maybe very good if i am 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.780
 Personally, I would always say that 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.880
 then this is in my top 100 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.560
 the other one may already be flying out 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.319
 and that's how it can happen 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.000
 very very good games then have to go 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.250
 and also to me I am someone who is 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.440
 just not set to a genre strong 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.450
 but I play very complex 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.760
 I play games for hours but also 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.380
 very simple game to take good fast 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.690
 I can play with a few players 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.400
 many people at once large group 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.200
 I am also with adolescents and 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.330
 that is why there is something of all here 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.130
 which, of course, then a lot 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.049
 mixed and slightly different list results 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.580
 as if from the four players now 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.870
 create a simple list what are 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.640
 that's the best strategy games 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.280
 really a very own and thereby 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.510
 also something else but I'll tell you 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.620
 nothing of that is going to happen now 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 take a little bit of tension 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.970
 little by little I'm getting new parts 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.620
 the top-100 publish 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.230
 and then we can do it in the end 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.269
 watch and argue what's in it now 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 and why what is where then maybe 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.109
 every single part over it too 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.739
 discuss small at first as I 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.510
 have made 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.299
 I've done it the whole way I have 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.920
 I first thermit word where I 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.750
 All my players have also registered 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.150
 after evaluation and so on I have me 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.829
 times list printed with all mine 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.930
 reflect on it and have first considered 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:24.489
 which one of them even comes into it 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.260
 closer selection and have the times one 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.930
 pushed extra area because I tried 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.180
 only times on 100 100 games 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.230
 to come and the movie not at all 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.340
 easily I have times really 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.560
 I've just been through your list 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.239
 this must necessarily be there 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.040
 Be sure to be there for everyone 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.579
 case and although the game for me and 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.590
 then I am somewhere over 150 150 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.010
 come out and then that is 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.810
 Challenge first 50 times 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.940
 really really good games 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.150
 rauszuschmeissen from the top 100 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.139
 and that's kind of difficult that is 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.489
 Of course , a bit too 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.750
 emotional thing that you have the feeling 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.370
 that maybe a bit better 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.930
 this is even more common 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.040
 that perhaps the fun factor a 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.139
 a little bit higher, that was fine with me 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.459
 I really have a really hard time 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.739
 over and over again 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.030
 think 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.739
 if it is really a candidate for it 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.510
 close and you have to imagine that 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.489
 that you actually have so many players 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.199
 and really plays so well that finds 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.880
 You can not even say this 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:21.430
 100 is I have to arrange the only but 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.990
 There are really 150 pieces we say 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.150
 Everyone deserves to go in there too 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.380
 come that is so difficult good though 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.520
 not that despite I did that 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.770
 I keep on doing that bit by bit 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.720
 reduced to a hundred in the extra 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.280
 has list and then the party came in dax 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.199
 Is that what I'm doing now? 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.460
 that then called the lists 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.919
 again really considered 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.560
 Okay, let's start with the top 10 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.199
 to the very top place one to 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.840
 ten and look who comes into question 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:48.610
 if there's a little bit like here where 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.050
 you feel this in any case 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.280
 they must be forgiven 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.660
 These are also the denser board go 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.750
 are probably relatively high 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.669
 scored where I just know 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.750
 For a good reason, they are always with me 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.039
 already been top 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.210
 and I tried that first 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.010
 assign a bit because I have that 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.990
 made again with the last one because 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.280
 that's the easiest thing to say 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.300
 they are rather further back and this 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.039
 he is at the very front 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.810
 and then I always have it 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.060
 gradually made i know exactly 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.010
 thought okay now would have to feel 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.990
 actually that would come that would be the 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.419
 closer selection that and then have 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.789
 I then always so again 15 20 pieces where 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:23.409
 I think right after the first one 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.240
 ten would have to come so then you have to 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.560
 reduce back to 10 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 and then you have to be in a sequence too 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.860
 understand that comes after that I may 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 then you always watched this game 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.070
 really better than that or below 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.270
 I really have to swap it 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.039
 now better than the duo must be the 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.930
 always exchange each one individually 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.280
 I have to move it up again 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.409
 or not from the fun factor really 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.960
 individually always swapped to each other 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:46.120
 then really make a final list 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.270
 that was my process and that is 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.880
 a lot of work and I think that is 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.169
 also a thing gives the whole one 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.289
 week and then dive again 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.330
 Maybe not complete but 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.610
 You can always go back and forth 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.530
 It also makes it so difficult 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.729
 always a list of course too 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.190
 this time was created the 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.139
 you should also know where you are 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.780
 Yes, probably next year again 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.860
 a very big other list has made 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.690
 because maybe you get a game over 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.470
 plays perhaps he can be or 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.150
 also new games appeared 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.580
 are on this list are also some 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.110
 play this game quite up to date 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.880
 can mean now that I just 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.470
 I'm in a hurry and I play well 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.030
 but it can also be averted 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:27.010
 that just good games this year 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.720
 have appeared 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.700
 that if we look then I am too 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:33.980
 very curious what it looks like when I am 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.540
 the whole games have presented whether 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.550
 I then I represent this opinion 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.580
 I would be happy and hope that we 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.630
 also discuss a bit about it 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.820
 how the whole is indeed now under here 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:49.700
 Ever start what you are basically 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:51.620
 so many expectations and have her so 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.760
 what would possibly matter if you are so 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.520
 a list does you even do 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.450
 basically have to do that 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.800
 concept and then at the next 

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.000
 we come to the games themselves 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.280
 I also like to discuss and then I am 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.660
 ready to explain again why me 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.580
 exactly what took and also on 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.410
 to enter individual questions from you and 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.760
 that's it for today I'm glad 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:09.740
 me when it really starts to go up 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.950
 I wish you all the best 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.950
 bye for now
