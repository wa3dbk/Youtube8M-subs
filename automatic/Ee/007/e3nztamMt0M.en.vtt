00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
really impressed me with it is the fact

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.360 
really impressed me with it is the fact
that<00:05:20.849> all<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.330> hardware's<00:05:21.720> dlc<00:05:22.260> coated<00:05:22.650> the

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
that all the hardware's dlc coated the

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.440 
that all the hardware's dlc coated the
small<00:05:23.669> screws<00:05:24.860> pivot<00:05:25.860> everything<00:05:26.460> is<00:05:27.030> dlc

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
small screws pivot everything is dlc

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.230 
small screws pivot everything is dlc
coated<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.460> that's<00:05:29.460> an<00:05:29.610> expensive<00:05:30.030> process

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
coated and that's an expensive process

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.690 
coated and that's an expensive process
it's<00:05:30.660> not<00:05:30.780> cheap<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.260> know<00:05:31.560> Sarah<00:05:32.310> coating

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
it's not cheap you know Sarah coating

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.159 
it's not cheap you know Sarah coating
would<00:05:32.849> have<00:05:32.940> been<00:05:33.030> a<00:05:33.060> much<00:05:33.150> cheaper<00:05:33.300> way<00:05:33.870> to<00:05:33.900> go

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
would have been a much cheaper way to go

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.330 
would have been a much cheaper way to go
but<00:05:35.330> the<00:05:36.330> dlc<00:05:36.870> coating<00:05:37.260> is<00:05:37.380> extremely<00:05:38.099> tough

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340
