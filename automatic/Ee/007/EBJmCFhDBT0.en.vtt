together<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.480> your<00:00:15.960> opinion<00:00:16.049> what<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.560> sort<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
together in your opinion what is sort of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.650 
together in your opinion what is sort of
going<00:00:17.490> on<00:00:17.760> in<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.000> team<00:00:18.119> liquid<00:00:18.240> house<00:00:18.449> right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
going on in the team liquid house right

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.349 
going on in the team liquid house right
now<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:19.160> just<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.279> we<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.580> we<00:00:21.240> obviously

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
now I just think we have we obviously

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.380 
now I just think we have we obviously
have<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.660> language<00:00:22.020> barrier<00:00:22.170> and<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.369> guess<00:00:23.939> we

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
have the language barrier and I guess we

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.450 
have the language barrier and I guess we
do<00:00:24.630> things<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.199> little<00:00:25.380> bit<00:00:25.680> differently<00:00:26.130> here

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
do things a little bit differently here

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009 
do things a little bit differently here
than<00:00:26.490> in<00:00:26.699> Korea<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.000> some<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> like<00:00:27.930> our

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
than in Korea so some of like our

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.679 
than in Korea so some of like our
practices<00:00:28.470> are<00:00:28.680> not<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> same<00:00:30.090> as<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.449> Korea

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
practices are not the same as in Korea

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.209 
practices are not the same as in Korea
and<00:00:30.960> obviously<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.560> come<00:00:31.710> from<00:00:31.859> like<00:00:32.009> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
and obviously if you come from like a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.799 
and obviously if you come from like a
really<00:00:32.550> successful<00:00:32.790> Korean<00:00:33.300> team<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.600> Jin

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
really successful Korean team like Jin

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.889 
really successful Korean team like Jin
air<00:00:33.989> or<00:00:34.320> SKT<00:00:35.239> you're<00:00:36.239> going<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.420> just<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
air or SKT you're going to just see

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.170 
air or SKT you're going to just see
things<00:00:37.020> differently<00:00:37.410> but<00:00:37.790> we<00:00:38.790> really<00:00:39.059> just

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
things differently but we really just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.700 
things differently but we really just
have<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.450> try<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.260> buy<00:00:40.440> into<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
have to try to like all buy into the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.049 
have to try to like all buy into the
same<00:00:40.890> thing<00:00:41.160> nothing's<00:00:41.520> gonna<00:00:41.640> work<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:42.000> we

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
same thing nothing's gonna work if we

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.420 
same thing nothing's gonna work if we
don't<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.480> put<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> same<00:00:43.920> goal<00:00:44.190> if<00:00:44.340> we

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
don't all put in the same goal if we

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.950 
don't all put in the same goal if we
don't<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.940> same<00:00:45.149> similar<00:00:45.510> goal<00:00:45.719> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
don't all have the same similar goal so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.810 
don't all have the same similar goal so
I<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.680> think<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.950> just<00:00:47.100> comes<00:00:47.280> down<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.640> time

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
I just think it just comes down to time

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
I just think it just comes down to time
and<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.090> just<00:00:48.239> need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.510> start<00:00:48.809> seeing<00:00:49.170> eye<00:00:49.260> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
and we just need to start seeing eye to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.229 
and we just need to start seeing eye to
eye<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.500> stuff<00:00:49.890> well<00:00:50.789> seeing<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.059> game

eye on stuff well seeing this game

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.369

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
gravity what does it mean to play

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.420 
gravity what does it mean to play
against<00:01:03.930> teams<00:01:04.140> very<00:01:04.710> close<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.280> in<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
against teams very close to you in the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.539 
against teams very close to you in the
standings<00:01:05.880> are<00:01:06.000> those<00:01:06.090> games<00:01:06.299> worth<00:01:06.510> more

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
standings are those games worth more

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.350 
standings are those games worth more
personally<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> don't<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> games<00:01:09.180> are

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
personally I don't think the games are

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960 
personally I don't think the games are
worth<00:01:09.510> anymore<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.710> because<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.729> early

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
worth anymore just because this is early

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
worth anymore just because this is early
