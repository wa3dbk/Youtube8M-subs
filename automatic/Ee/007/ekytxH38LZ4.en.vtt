theory for zombies and black ops 2
ranking<00:00:07.459> system<00:00:07.970> so<00:00:09.099> you<00:00:10.099> got<00:00:10.250> it's<00:00:10.400> really

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
ranking system so you got it's really

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.549 
ranking system so you got it's really
confusing<00:00:10.969> but<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:11.420> think<00:00:11.719> I<00:00:11.809> finally<00:00:11.839> found<00:00:12.410> my

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559 
confusing but I think I finally found my

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.879 
confusing but I think I finally found my
way<00:00:12.799> to<00:00:12.830> it<00:00:13.219> so<00:00:13.849> first<00:00:14.780> things<00:00:14.990> first<00:00:15.110> we're

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
way to it so first things first we're

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.140 
way to it so first things first we're
going<00:00:15.980> to<00:00:16.070> talk<00:00:16.189> about<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.550> first<00:00:16.789> rank<00:00:16.939> which

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:17.150 
going to talk about the first rank which

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.759 
going to talk about the first rank which
is<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.420> bones<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:19.070> bones<00:00:19.100> is<00:00:19.789> really<00:00:20.300> really

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
is the bones the bones is really really

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.349 
is the bones the bones is really really
simple<00:00:21.769> you<00:00:22.070> just<00:00:22.189> started<00:00:22.670> your<00:00:22.820> zombie<00:00:23.150> game

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
simple you just started your zombie game

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.630 
simple you just started your zombie game
you<00:00:23.599> have<00:00:23.840> to<00:00:23.869> beat<00:00:24.199> it<00:00:24.349> you<00:00:25.160> probably<00:00:25.400> would

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
you have to beat it you probably would

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.689 
you have to beat it you probably would
have<00:00:25.730> like<00:00:25.910> seven<00:00:26.330> kills<00:00:26.570> maybe<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:28.310> zero

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
have like seven kills maybe and zero

have like seven kills maybe and zero
death<00:00:28.939> you<00:00:29.480> would<00:00:29.599> still<00:00:29.869> have<00:00:29.929> that<00:00:30.230> bone

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
death you would still have that bone

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.040 
death you would still have that bone
once<00:00:31.189> you<00:00:31.340> reach<00:00:31.519> 500<00:00:32.240> kills<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.750> will<00:00:32.900> earn

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050
