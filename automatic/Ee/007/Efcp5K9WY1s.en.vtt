the<00:00:04.240> parkway<00:00:04.570> itself<00:00:04.960> is<00:00:05.169> curvilinear<00:00:05.799> in

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
the parkway itself is curvilinear in

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.860 
the parkway itself is curvilinear in
virtually<00:00:06.730> every<00:00:07.029> direction<00:00:07.299> there's<00:00:07.720> really

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
virtually every direction there's really

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.440 
virtually every direction there's really
no<00:00:08.080> straight<00:00:08.380> lines<00:00:09.030> there's<00:00:10.030> a<00:00:10.090> number<00:00:10.330> of

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
no straight lines there's a number of

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.419 
no straight lines there's a number of
tunnels<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.019> bridges<00:00:11.200> and<00:00:11.650> the<00:00:12.219> road

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
tunnels and bridges and the road

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:15.539 
tunnels and bridges and the road
meanders<00:00:13.240> through<00:00:13.629> those<00:00:14.110> you<00:00:14.980> can<00:00:15.129> imagine

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
meanders through those you can imagine

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.710 
meanders through those you can imagine
with<00:00:15.669> the<00:00:15.700> number<00:00:15.969> of<00:00:16.030> people<00:00:16.210> that<00:00:16.450> work<00:00:16.600> on

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:16.720 
with the number of people that work on

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.320 
with the number of people that work on
the<00:00:16.900> parkway<00:00:17.199> contemporaneously<00:00:17.980> that<00:00:18.910> great

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
the parkway contemporaneously that great

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.779 
the parkway contemporaneously that great
Stakes<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.050> traditional<00:00:20.680> way<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.920> layout

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:21.789 
Stakes and the traditional way of layout

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.300 
Stakes and the traditional way of layout
are<00:00:22.060> pretty<00:00:22.930> much<00:00:23.140> archaic<00:00:23.920> in<00:00:24.130> that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
are pretty much archaic in that

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.660 
are pretty much archaic in that
environment<00:00:24.849> so<00:00:25.119> we<00:00:25.480> were<00:00:25.599> looking<00:00:25.750> for<00:00:26.140> a

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
environment so we were looking for a

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.339 
environment so we were looking for a
system<00:00:27.670> that<00:00:27.939> was<00:00:28.390> really<00:00:28.750> total<00:00:29.080> machine

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
system that was really total machine

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.680 
system that was really total machine
control<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:31.000> could<00:00:31.179> take<00:00:31.359> us<00:00:31.539> through<00:00:32.020> that

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
control that could take us through that

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.450 
control that could take us through that
construction<00:00:34.690> activity<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.440> give<00:00:36.160> us<00:00:36.310> the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
construction activity and give us the

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.730 
construction activity and give us the
flexibility<00:00:37.090> when<00:00:37.660> we<00:00:37.810> started<00:00:38.200> to<00:00:38.380> look<00:00:38.590> at

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740 
flexibility when we started to look at

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.280 
flexibility when we started to look at
like<00:00:39.130> one<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:39.790> the<00:00:39.850> technologies<00:00:40.450> that<00:00:40.480> we<00:00:41.110> had

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
like one of the technologies that we had

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.150 
like one of the technologies that we had
a<00:00:41.320> keen<00:00:41.620> interest<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:42.250> was<00:00:43.060> smart<00:00:43.930> net<00:00:44.110> and<00:00:44.350> the

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
a keen interest in was smart net and the

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.120 
a keen interest in was smart net and the
GPS<00:00:45.550> controls<00:00:46.060> on<00:00:46.540> a<00:00:46.930> more<00:00:47.200> global<00:00:47.380> basis<00:00:47.980> and

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
GPS controls on a more global basis and

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.670 
GPS controls on a more global basis and
allowing<00:00:48.910> us<00:00:49.090> to<00:00:49.570> coordinate<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:50.230> with<00:00:50.440> all

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
allowing us to coordinate that with all

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.320 
allowing us to coordinate that with all
of<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.920> substrates<00:00:51.430> that<00:00:51.640> were<00:00:51.760> on<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.120> job

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
of the substrates that were on the job

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.350 
of the substrates that were on the job
and<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.740> kneel<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:54.640> final<00:00:55.000> result

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
and to really kneel the final result

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.670 
and to really kneel the final result
that<00:00:55.540> was<00:00:55.690> as<00:00:55.870> close<00:00:55.900> to<00:00:56.170> design

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
that was as close to design

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.480 
that was as close to design
cross-sections<00:00:57.460> as<00:00:57.760> one<00:00:58.480> can<00:00:58.690> imagine<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.280> one

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
cross-sections as one can imagine so one

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.450 
cross-sections as one can imagine so one
of<00:01:00.520> the<00:01:00.670> one<00:01:01.030> of<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.210> newest<00:01:02.460> innovations

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
of the one of the newest innovations

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.030 
of the one of the newest innovations
that<00:01:03.730> we've<00:01:03.910> been<00:01:04.059> really<00:01:04.989> intrigued<00:01:05.560> with<00:01:05.710> is

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
that we've been really intrigued with is

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.880 
that we've been really intrigued with is
the<00:01:06.580> new<00:01:06.730> MS<00:01:07.030> 15<00:01:07.480> it<00:01:07.900> allows<00:01:08.260> us<00:01:08.530> to

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the new MS 15 it allows us to

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.550 
the new MS 15 it allows us to
continuously<00:01:09.580> check<00:01:09.880> grades<00:01:10.230> refine<00:01:11.230> it<00:01:11.410> on

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
continuously check grades refine it on

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.890 
continuously check grades refine it on
an<00:01:11.680> ongoing<00:01:11.830> basis<00:01:12.490> in<00:01:12.670> real-time<00:01:13.000> that

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
an ongoing basis in real-time that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.450 
an ongoing basis in real-time that
integrated<00:01:14.590> with<00:01:14.740> in

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
integrated with in

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060 
integrated with in
machine<00:01:15.820> control<00:01:16.560> operation<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.680> telematics

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
machine control operation the telematics

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.210 
machine control operation the telematics
and<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:18.580> on<00:01:18.760> allows<00:01:19.750> us<00:01:20.080> to<00:01:20.530> really<00:01:20.770> reduce<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
and so on allows us to really reduce the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.180 
and so on allows us to really reduce the
crews<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.330> are<00:01:22.479> placing<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.530> various

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
and use and we can get into tolerances

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.990 
and use and we can get into tolerances
of<00:01:35.710> one<00:01:36.009> millimeter<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.580> two<00:01:36.820> millimeters
