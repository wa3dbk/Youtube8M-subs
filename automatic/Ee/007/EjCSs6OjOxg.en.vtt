 we are talking about an attack on 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.890

 with the Bible in your hands you're already 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.899
 prepared pen too everything right 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.270
 We are going to move forward a little more now. 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.689
 in that chapter 7 that we have studied 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.200
 first block daniel daniel chapter 7 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.630
 is the well-four 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.200
 animals and what most caught the eye of 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.240
 prophet was the fourth beast and the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 amazing because it will be calling 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.340
 his attention 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 Do you remember that this animal had 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 amazing represents the Roman Empire 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.530
 because well the Roman empire he actually 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.400
 has two phases the first phase is the phase 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.299
 rightly imperial pagan and the second 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:44.040
 phase is the Christian phase the first phase or 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:50.909
 whether rome is pagan goes from 168 before 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:54.030
 Christ until 476 after Christ and soon 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.869
 after the year with the 76 is that the phase begins 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.670
 Christian papal Rome comes after 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.280
 but let's now focus on the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.619
 when rome was paying rome 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.670
 imperial because the fourth animal 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.830
 represents exactly the Roman Empire 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.680
 daniel said i want to know the truth 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.900
 about the fourth animal because the bible of 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.709
 I see what this animal would do let's 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.340
 go along 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:23.519
 daniel 7 verse 21 here begins a list 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.400
 of aggressions a list of persecutions 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:28.680
 a list of phrases that show 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.319
 exactly what this fourth animal or 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.790
 be it the Roman Empire would observe 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.010
 daniel 7 21 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:41.129
 I looked and behold, this horn was 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.329
 war against the saints and prevailed 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.689
 against them 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.669
 Then you can think pastore if it was okay. 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.120
 for you to understand better, we are going 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:53.639
 to daniel chapter seven verses 7 and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.069
 verse 8 back to reading a little 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:57.299
 is daniel seven verses 7 and eight verse 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.879
 like this 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.169
 After that I kept looking at the 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.569
 night visions 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:05.579
 and behold the fourth terrible beast, and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.099
 amazing about strong mood 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.169
 which had great iron teeth he 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.480
 devoured stage in pieces of slate 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:14.159
 feet kissed him was different from all 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.599
 animals that appeared before him and 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.359
 had ten horns 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:21.090
 you get 10 x now I see verse 18 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:24.060
 As I watch the horn pull out the 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.549
 verse 18 while watching the horns 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.909
 behold, there came up another small 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:33.329
 on which the first three were 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:35.250
 and behold, in this horn there were 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.299
 eyes like a man's mouth a spoke 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.519
 with insolence 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.919
 this is amazing imagine an animal 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.049
 terrible with 10 horns and the middle of 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.079
 shift appears another horn would be the 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.340
 horn number 11 points small room 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.650
 small point in the bible but later 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.870
 grows and grows . 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.199
 be small and the sacred bible says 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.329
 in this horn were eyes and mouth as of 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.799
 man a mouth that spoke great 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.659
 with insolence 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.419
 You do not find this all very strange. 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.419
 Very impressive 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:09.959
 you saw the lion's fine represented 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:11.310
 libya on persian ur-6 the leopard 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.620
 greece but now the terrible animal 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.000
 represents rome and the two horns now 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.989
 looks like another horn 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.419
 the horn number 11 it rises and it has 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.130
 eyes and mouth when he goes up the bible 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.130
 says he destroys three of the 10 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.759
 three of the ten are destroyed by the tip 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:34.250
 small point that is without horns is this 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.629
 that has power to destroy others and that 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.349
 grows and imposes itself and is arrogant and speaks 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:45.530
 with insolence is exactly this small 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.150
 this small tip that appears here is 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.699
 just what is here on the back 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.330
 21 look at new verse 21 and I came back 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.650
 for you 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:00.139
 daniel seven verses 21 says so I 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.830
 He looked and this horn waged war against 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:07.520
 the saints and prevailed against them 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.349
 Ah, I understand that that team 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.330
 that comes in the middle of the ten 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.039
 have eyes and mouth is to make a war 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.180
 against the saints 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:20.090
 that's right but the war would meet 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.949
 against the saints who are the saints would be 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.979
 Saint Anthony are Benedict 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:28.039
 What would that be? 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:30.050
 What are you to understand? 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.169
 for the apocalypse 14 verses 12 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:36.229
 abrasion family quickly with me 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.300
 here is the apocalypse 14 verses 12 who 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.639
 are the saints pointing small ia 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.000
 make a war says it here 14 12 look good 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:46.639
 here and here is the perseverance of the 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.759
 saints of the saints who keep the 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.090
 god's commandments and faith in jesus 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:51.770
 understood 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.419
 see that the saints are the one who keeps 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.690
 the commandments of God and have faith in 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:58.430
 jesus and there in daniel 7 21 says pointing 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.180
 and to wage war against the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.009
 saints 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.930
 that is small points to make a war 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.620
 against the people of God who keep the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.969
 God's commandments have faith in Jesus 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.389
 This is what is written here is this 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:13.370
 even pointing small small tip that 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:15.650
 out of the middle of the two horns of that 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:17.870
 terrible animal and amazing that tip 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.969
 small would do exactly a war 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:21.889
 against the saints and the bible says 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:23.620
 and it seems that wins the war looks like 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.819
 I won the battle 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:30.409
 Did you understand that the saints who 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.680
 keep the commandments what commandments 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.810
 the 10 the ten commandments are god's law 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.560
 or the law of Moses says there of God of 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.300
 moisés 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.460
 of course the ten commandments are the mother 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.500
 God's 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.360
 many people say yes to Adventists 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.919
 they keep the law of Moses is not 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.870
 we do not keep the law of 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.030
 moses we keep the law of god 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.030
 ten commandments written by the finger of 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.520
 God and the bible says it points small 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.949
 that comes out from the middle of that one of those two 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.780
 horns of the terrible and dreadful animal 

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:59.710
 this leader was going to wage war on 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.030
 saints 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.400
 so I want to ask you a question 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.650
 a very important question 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.539
 you agree with the ten commandments 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.400
 Do you accept the Ten Commandments? 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:11.020
 agrees with the Bible that the 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.520
 Christians must obey the ten 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.849
 commandments 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.889
 if you agree to the Ten Commandments 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:19.960
 raise your hand with vivid uprisings 

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:20.830
 you agree then you will raise your hand 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.320

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.620
 and you agree to the Ten Commandments 

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:30.340
 only if you raised your hand and agree 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:32.650

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.509

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:37.630

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.419
 Does not like you, you know why. 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.099
 because the Bible says that he would do 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.840
 war against the one who keeps the 

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:47.020
 commandments that accept the commandments 

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.120
 of god and if the enemy does not like you 

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.009
 you're opening side because in fact of 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.159
 Jesus loves you 

00:07:51.009 --> 00:07:56.380
 This is the great news, Jesus loves you. 

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:58.479
 the enemy can take away the love of 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:00.490
 God is greater and he loves you and you are 

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:04.870

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:07.090
 ten commandments here first point is the 

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.710

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.570
 What else would you do? 

00:08:09.669 --> 00:08:15.880

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.960
 then he said the fourth animal will be the 

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.960
 fourth king on earth
