00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
that anyone can provide that environment

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.830 
that anyone can provide that environment
for<00:01:15.100> someone<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:16.060> know<00:01:16.150> people<00:01:16.510> asked<00:01:16.750> him

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
for someone you know people asked him

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.380 
for someone you know people asked him
when<00:01:16.930> I<00:01:16.990> was<00:01:17.080> younger<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.650> lot<00:01:17.920> if<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.520> could

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
when I was younger a lot if you could

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.900 
when I was younger a lot if you could
magically<00:01:19.600> one<00:01:20.170> day<00:01:20.350> just<00:01:20.590> have<00:01:20.710> legs<00:01:21.010> we

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:21.910 
magically one day just have legs we

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.300 
magically one day just have legs we
could<00:01:22.090> do<00:01:22.180> it<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:23.440> I<00:01:23.740> really<00:01:24.160> thought

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
could do it and so I really thought

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.430 
could do it and so I really thought
about<00:01:24.370> it<00:01:24.610> like<00:01:24.760> I<00:01:24.910> actually<00:01:25.120> thought<00:01:25.510> what

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
about it like I actually thought what

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.490 
about it like I actually thought what
would<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.650> actually<00:01:26.920> do<00:01:27.250> you<00:01:27.760> know<00:01:27.820> and<00:01:28.500> every

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
would I actually do you know and every

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.320 
would I actually do you know and every
time<00:01:29.710> I<00:01:29.740> just<00:01:30.160> kept<00:01:30.370> coming<00:01:30.580> back<00:01:30.820> to<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.120> same

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
time I just kept coming back to the same

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.400 
time I just kept coming back to the same
answer<00:01:31.540> which<00:01:31.930> was<00:01:32.230> no<00:01:33.150> because<00:01:34.150> my<00:01:34.990> whole

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
answer which was no because my whole

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.800 
answer which was no because my whole
identity<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.250> my<00:01:36.370> entire<00:01:36.760> purpose<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.600> life

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
identity and my entire purpose in life

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.010 
identity and my entire purpose in life
is<00:01:39.150> dependent<00:01:40.150> upon<00:01:40.210> the<00:01:40.390> fact<00:01:40.660> that<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.840> don't

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
is dependent upon the fact that I don't

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.220 
is dependent upon the fact that I don't
have<00:01:41.170> legs<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:41.740> that's<00:01:42.490> why<00:01:42.910> I<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.870> always

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:44.230 
have legs so that's why I just always

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.480 
have legs so that's why I just always
knew<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.590> was<00:01:44.770> meant<00:01:44.950> to<00:01:45.040> be<00:01:45.160> born

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
knew I was meant to be born

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.190 
knew I was meant to be born
like<00:01:45.579> that<00:01:45.759> to<00:01:46.150> do<00:01:46.299> what<00:01:46.540> I'm<00:01:46.659> supposed<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:47.079> do

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
like that to do what I'm supposed to do

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.420 
like that to do what I'm supposed to do
in<00:01:47.350> life<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:49.090> for<00:01:49.930> me<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:51.189> was<00:01:51.399> just

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
in life and so for me that was just

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.090 
in life and so for me that was just
never<00:01:51.820> even<00:01:52.329> the<00:01:52.450> thing<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.899> mean<00:01:53.020> that's<00:01:53.259> how<00:01:54.070> I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
never even the thing I mean that's how I

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.529 
never even the thing I mean that's how I
can<00:01:54.939> affect<00:01:55.479> change<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:58.390> not

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
can affect change and because it's not

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.870 
can affect change and because it's not
about<00:01:58.750> me<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.200> about<00:01:59.590> what<00:02:00.189> what<00:02:00.610> can<00:02:00.759> be

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
about me it's about what what can be

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.399 
about me it's about what what can be
done<00:02:01.060> through<00:02:01.299> me<00:02:01.509> if<00:02:01.750> you're<00:02:02.049> doing<00:02:02.200> what<00:02:02.320> you
