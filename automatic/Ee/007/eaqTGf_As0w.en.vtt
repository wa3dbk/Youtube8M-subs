 taken a lot of versions I do not know if 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.370
 is to get more money or people from 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.290
 capcom has no idea that another street 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.129

 fighter white and his hands already barely 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.090
 well you understand me I do not understand what is the 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.859
 grace of capo not discarding street 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 fighter is not enough to put a point 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.180
 of difference even if 2 ok is 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.390
 different the 4 and 7 4 I do not know 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.579

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.750
 I honestly do not know what the reason or 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.069
 the reason to get this type of street 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.069
 fighter but they are not taking it out 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.010
 they are taking it out every time but that 4 o 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.530
 is this effect 4 but with a 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.579
 subtitle nothing more different but I 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.959
 I want to know what you think the 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.609
