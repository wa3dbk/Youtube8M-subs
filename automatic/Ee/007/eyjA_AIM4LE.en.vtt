even having these cards in the box is

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740 
even having these cards in the box is
almost<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.310> waste<00:02:51.489> because<00:02:51.879> the<00:02:52.359> beautiful

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
almost a waste because the beautiful

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.449 
almost a waste because the beautiful
thing<00:02:52.870> about<00:02:52.900> these<00:02:53.230> cards<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:54.069> know<00:02:54.160> are<00:02:54.340> the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
faces and so I almost wished that I had

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.819 
faces and so I almost wished that I had
purchased<00:02:57.879> maybe<00:02:58.390> an<00:02:58.510> uncut<00:02:58.840> sheet<00:02:59.109> you<00:02:59.739> know

that<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:00.220> could<00:03:00.459> have<00:03:00.609> looked<00:03:01.150> at<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.599> maybe

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
that I could have looked at and maybe

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.220 
that I could have looked at and maybe
had<00:03:02.680> framed<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.310> put<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.609> wall<00:03:03.760> because

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230

really to have these cards in the box is

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.970 
really to have these cards in the box is
a<00:03:07.269> waste<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:08.140> cards<00:03:08.500> are<00:03:08.590> just<00:03:08.620> really

beautiful<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.430> look<00:03:09.549> at<00:03:09.760> that<00:03:10.359> being<00:03:10.660> said<00:03:11.079> I

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
beautiful to look at that being said I

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:13.380 
beautiful to look at that being said I
don't<00:03:11.980> know<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.549> I<00:03:12.730> would<00:03:12.879> recommend

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
don't know that I would recommend

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.660 
don't know that I would recommend
playing<00:03:14.200> with<00:03:14.410> these<00:03:14.530> cards<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.489> and

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
playing with these cards you know and

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.150 
playing with these cards you know and
you<00:03:15.849> pass<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.150> deck<00:03:16.450> around<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.709> often<00:03:17.889> your

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
you pass a deck around so often your

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.190 
you pass a deck around so often your
friends<00:03:18.519> well<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.389> know<00:03:19.480> shuffle<00:03:19.959> and

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
friends well you know shuffle and

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.110 
friends well you know shuffle and
they'll<00:03:20.410> bend<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.220> warp<00:03:21.340> your<00:03:21.549> cards<00:03:21.819> because

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
they'll bend and warp your cards because

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.839 
they'll bend and warp your cards because
they<00:03:22.239> don't<00:03:22.389> know<00:03:22.450> how<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.569> shuffle<00:03:22.810> well<00:03:23.819> so<00:03:24.819> I

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
they don't know how to shuffle well so I

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.610 
they don't know how to shuffle well so I
wouldn't<00:03:25.120> even<00:03:25.239> use<00:03:25.450> them<00:03:25.569> for<00:03:25.599> playing<00:03:25.989> with

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
wouldn't even use them for playing with

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.470 
wouldn't even use them for playing with
her<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.459> reason<00:03:27.489> alone<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:28.239> and

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
her just for that reason alone that and

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.659 
her just for that reason alone that and
the<00:03:28.569> fact<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.870> they<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.769> was<00:03:30.220> not<00:03:30.400> a<00:03:30.430> cheap

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
the fact that they that was not a cheap

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.610 
the fact that they that was not a cheap
deck<00:03:30.849> to<00:03:30.970> purchase<00:03:31.359> I<00:03:31.540> also<00:03:32.169> wouldn't<00:03:32.440> really

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
deck to purchase I also wouldn't really

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.800 
deck to purchase I also wouldn't really
use<00:03:32.709> this<00:03:32.919> deck<00:03:33.130> for<00:03:33.340> magic<00:03:33.669> or<00:03:33.940> anything

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
use this deck for magic or anything

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.599 
use this deck for magic or anything
where<00:03:35.230> people<00:03:35.260> would<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:35.919> to<00:03:36.099> readily

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
where people would have to readily

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.629 
where people would have to readily
identify<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.510> cards<00:03:37.870> quickly<00:03:38.430> some<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.549> these

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
identify the cards quickly some of these

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.309 
identify the cards quickly some of these
cars<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.630> can't<00:03:41.489> tell<00:03:42.489> right<00:03:42.760> away<00:03:43.319> what

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
cars you just can't tell right away what

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:47.370 
cars you just can't tell right away what
the<00:03:44.530> Pippin<00:03:44.859> number<00:03:45.069> are<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.630> would<00:03:47.139> just<00:03:47.169> be

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
the Pippin number are so I would just be

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.199
