00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.859
Crepes are delicious thin pancakes with
crispy edges, and a soft moist center.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:17.529
Stuffed with savory or sweet filling,
these easy to make french pastries are

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.890
perfect for an appetizer, main course,
or dessert.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.980
While you don't need special equipment
to make crepes, a large frying pan and

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.490
non-stick spatula will work fine.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.050
Having a crepe pan certainly has
it's benefits.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.190
Either way, we'll show you how to
make crepes in a snap.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.100
Step One:
Make the batter.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.940
Although crepes look a lot like
pancakes, they get their slim,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.320
graceful appearance from a
much thinner batter.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.040
Whisk together egg and milk.
Then, add the flour to make a thin batter.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.980
Make sure the batter is silky smooth,
with no lumps.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.180
Step Two:
Heat the pan.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.470
Heat the pan over medium heat.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.880
Add a little butter or oil if
you're not using a non-stick pan.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.000
Step Three:
Pour the batter.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.500
Pour or ladle batter into the pan.
Move the pan from the heat,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.510
and swirl it around in a circle,
so the batter distributes evenly

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.750
throughout the bottom of the pan
in as this a layer as possible.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.000
Return the pan to the burner,
and cook for about a minute,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.030
watching it closely not to
get too crispy.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.650
Step Four:
Flip the crepe.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.000
When the batter is no longer shiny,
it's time to turn over the crepe,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.730
to cook the other side.
Loosen the edges with a nonstick spatula,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.179
and insert it gently beneath the crepe.

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:35.369
Lift the crepe straight up, and flip.
Catching its fall with the pan,

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.479
in one smooth motion.
It may take some practice to perfect,

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.069
but it's sure to impress your
friends and family.

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.600
After about 30 more seconds in the pan,
turn the crepe out onto a plate.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.450
Place a plate of crepes in a warm,
200 degree oven while you make more.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.640
Step Five:
Stuff the crepes.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.720
When you're ready to stuff your
crepes, the sky's the limit.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.000
Go savory with ingredients like
cooked eggs, herbs, and cheeses.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.330
Or meat or mushroom mixtures.
Add smoked salmon and sour cream.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.000
Sweeten the deal by spooning on
sweetened ricotta cheese,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.320
chocolate nut spread, or preserves.
For colorful fruit wraps,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.030
pack the crepe with fresh fruit.
For a classic french finish,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.030
top with a splash of lemon juice,
and a sprinkle of sugar.

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.349
Anyway you serve them up,

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.150
crepes are delicious, elegant, and easy
to make for any occasion:

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.750
Breakfast, dinner, snack, or dessert!
