it's a juggling act and you've got to
have<00:01:30.170> options<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.069> think<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.209> buy<00:01:33.539> a

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
have options and I think if you buy a

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.690 
have options and I think if you buy a
defensive<00:01:34.170> midfield<00:01:34.590> player<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.429> doesn't

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
defensive midfield player that doesn't

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.669 
defensive midfield player that doesn't
mean<00:01:35.969> to<00:01:35.999> say<00:01:36.149> that<00:01:36.810> line<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.289> okay

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679 
mean to say that line is right okay

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:39.349 
mean to say that line is right okay
Benji<00:01:38.039> it<00:01:38.130> might<00:01:38.310> be<00:01:38.459> on<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.639> bench<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.939> begin

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.519 
Benji it might be on the bench to begin
with<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.600> you've<00:01:39.840> signing<00:01:40.229> someone

at<00:04:00.599> a<00:04:00.629> chat<00:04:00.900> about<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.169> game<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.579> it<00:04:02.819> was

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
at a chat about a game and it was it was

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.039 
at a chat about a game and it was it was
in<00:04:03.120> that<00:04:03.269> time<00:04:03.569> where<00:04:04.099> he<00:04:05.099> was<00:04:05.280> sort<00:04:05.579> of<00:04:05.639> I

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
in that time where he was sort of I

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.270 
in that time where he was sort of I
think<00:04:07.049> Roy<00:04:07.199> odd<00:04:07.349> she<00:04:07.500> was<00:04:07.620> thinking<00:04:08.069> about

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
think Roy odd she was thinking about

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.420 
think Roy odd she was thinking about
playing<00:04:08.579> him<00:04:08.819> a<00:04:09.060> bit<00:04:09.510> deeper<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.310> think<00:04:11.310> he'd

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
playing him a bit deeper I think he'd

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.539 
playing him a bit deeper I think he'd
played<00:04:11.669> there<00:04:11.909> a<00:04:12.180> couple<00:04:12.540> of<00:04:12.690> times<00:04:12.959> for

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
played there a couple of times for

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.189 
played there a couple of times for
Arsenal<00:04:14.549> but<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:15.209> advanced<00:04:15.659> position<00:04:16.049> was

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
Arsenal but the advanced position was

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.469

more<00:04:16.440> where<00:04:16.709> he<00:04:16.739> played<00:04:17.130> and<00:04:17.909> then<00:04:18.150> he<00:04:18.239> played

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
more where he played and then he played

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.270 
more where he played and then he played
on<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.750> left<00:04:18.930> side<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.530> right<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.190> and

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
on the left side and the right in it and

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
opposition in it for England because of

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.480 
opposition in it for England because of
the<00:04:48.270> qualifying<00:04:48.780> so<00:04:49.410> it's<00:04:49.890> not<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.160> true

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
the qualifying so it's not a true

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.850 
the qualifying so it's not a true
reflection<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:51.180> how<00:04:52.140> he's<00:04:52.320> going<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.560> end<00:04:52.650> up

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
reflection of how he's going to end up

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.430 
reflection of how he's going to end up
because<00:04:53.250> I<00:04:53.280> think<00:04:53.580> against<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:54.600> top<00:04:54.810> teams<00:04:55.140> an

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
because I think against the top teams an

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.530 
because I think against the top teams an
international<00:04:56.340> level<00:04:56.460> he's<00:04:57.150> going<00:04:57.300> to<00:04:57.390> come

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
international level he's going to come

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.540 
international level he's going to come
across<00:04:57.840> some<00:04:58.140> different<00:04:58.500> problems<00:04:58.920> and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
across some different problems and

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.880 
across some different problems and
whether<00:04:59.790> that<00:04:59.910> he<00:05:00.330> can<00:05:00.510> solve<00:05:00.810> them<00:05:01.050> I<00:05:01.230> still

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
whether that he can solve them I still

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.190 
whether that he can solve them I still
don't<00:05:01.920> know<00:05:02.220> but<00:05:02.550> I'm<00:05:02.700> you<00:05:02.970> know<00:05:03.000> he<00:05:03.450> looks
