 photographs 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.020
 juicy and saturated very often to me 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:34.019
 subscribers ask a question how to achieve 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.000
 beautiful juicy shades in the photo and 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.610
 that's why I recorded this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.890
 video lesson well then let's get started 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.610
 I will work with this one photo 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:48.579
 you can take any of your own and try 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.930
 already this processing on her first 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.620
 we all need you 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.440
 convert a photo from rgb mode to 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 lab mode for this we go 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.899
 Images here select the item mode 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.380
 so we are interested here lab mode 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.680
 we choose it so we have a photo 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.570
 transferred to the new mode now 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.770
 duplicate layer click combination 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.119
 control jay 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.340
 on the keyboard and then go to paragraph 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:26.740
 image correction choose here 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:31.060
 item curves here we have in this item 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.710
 there are three channels brightness and channel and channel 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.799
 b 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.330
 first go to channel a and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.750
 dragging a curve like this 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:44.640
 way about 3 squares shift 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:48.880
 its bottom and 3 shift squares and and 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:57.270
 top this way too 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.270
 do in channel b so the same thing here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.420
 as you can see the saturation of our picture 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.960
 already increased 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.160
 Do not worry if the photo looks 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.780
 oversaturated later on and all this 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.650
 fix and just go to the channel 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.860
 brightness and adjust contrast here 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.720
 Well, at your request, that is, as you 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.930
 I like it more like this 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.640
 leave a little curve arch 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.920
 s 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.910
 click ok here and we have with you 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.950
 these settings are saved to a new layer 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.820
 as a result, we get just such a perry 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.300
 rich photo to get rid 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.580
 from unnecessary saturation is enough for us 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:49.700
 just lower the transparency of this layer 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:53.060
 I usually put values ​​around 50 or 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.890
 40 percent depending on the picture 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.890
 these values may differ for you 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.080
 try experimenting and when you have 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.410
 will be the result of arranging leave 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.769
 the values ​​you need and so here we are 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.110
 It turned out here and here after you see 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.530
 the colors in the photo have become much more 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.209
 juicy and rich and the snapshot looks 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.880
 much more attractive 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.280
 Well Well here is a simple way to help 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.470
 you strengthen the color on any of his 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.049
 photos as you can see there is nothing 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.720
 complicated and everything is done literally for 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.610
 few minutes oh well that 's all 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.739
 Thank you all very much for your attention 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.739
