truck is a eunuch all to tell me I see
these<00:00:21.420> regularly<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.310> rescue<00:00:23.310> vehicles

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
these regularly on rescue vehicles

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640 
these regularly on rescue vehicles
especially<00:00:24.029> ones<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.660> are<00:00:24.779> used<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.260> urban

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
especially ones that are used in urban

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.980 
especially ones that are used in urban
areas<00:00:26.070> it's<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.849> European<00:00:27.000> design<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.930> you

areas it's a European design and you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.349 
areas it's a European design and you
will<00:00:28.109> find<00:00:28.380> most<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.859> these<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.640> Europe<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.240> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
will find most of these in Europe on the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.669 
will find most of these in Europe on the
big<00:00:30.510> heavy<00:00:30.720> vehicles<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.349> fact<00:00:31.560> they're

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
big heavy vehicles in fact they're

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.190 
big heavy vehicles in fact they're
required<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.309> most<00:00:32.520> urban<00:00:32.759> areas<00:00:32.989> but<00:00:33.989> there

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
required in most urban areas but there

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.380 
required in most urban areas but there
is<00:00:34.320> nothing<00:00:35.010> like<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> stopping<00:00:35.910> power<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.300> a

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
is nothing like the stopping power of a

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.470 
is nothing like the stopping power of a
Telmo<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.500> actually<00:00:37.860> uses<00:00:38.480> electromagnetism

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
Telmo it actually uses electromagnetism

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.690 
Telmo it actually uses electromagnetism
to<00:00:39.840> slow<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.379> vehicle<00:00:40.559> down<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.399> creates

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
to slow the vehicle down and creates

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.040 
to slow the vehicle down and creates
quite<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.270> heat<00:00:42.450> which<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.809> what<00:00:42.960> the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
quite a bit of heat which is what the

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.380 
quite a bit of heat which is what the
cooling<00:00:43.379> vanes<00:00:43.620> are<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.940> sits<00:00:45.270> in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
cooling vanes are all about it sits in

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.360 
cooling vanes are all about it sits in
the<00:00:45.480> middle<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> drive<00:00:46.200> shaft<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:47.070> front

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the middle of the drive shaft the front

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.100 
the middle of the drive shaft the front
drive<00:00:47.579> shaft<00:00:47.610> goes<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> transmission<00:00:48.870> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
drive shaft goes to the transmission and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.990 
drive shaft goes to the transmission and
the<00:00:49.200> rear<00:00:49.559> drive<00:00:49.980> shaft<00:00:50.280> goes<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> rear

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the rear drive shaft goes to the rear

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.910 
the rear drive shaft goes to the rear
and<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> direct<00:00:52.379> link<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and so you have a direct link to the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
and so you have a direct link to the
rear<00:00:53.129> wheels<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> loaded<00:00:54.570> wheels

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
rear wheels which are the loaded wheels

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.920 
rear wheels which are the loaded wheels
on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.140> truck<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.890> this<00:00:56.489> section<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.660> going

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
on the truck in this section I'm going

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
on the truck in this section I'm going
to<00:00:58.109> discuss<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.770> zillya<00:00:59.160> braking<00:01:00.109> we<00:01:01.109> will

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
to discuss like zillya braking we will

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.680 
to discuss like zillya braking we will
give<00:01:01.379> an<00:01:01.469> overview<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.070> Telmo<00:01:02.539> we<00:01:03.539> will

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
give an overview of the Telmo we will

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
give an overview of the Telmo we will
give<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.899> overview<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.700> exhaust<00:01:05.700> brake

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
give an overview of the exhaust brake

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.109 
give an overview of the exhaust brake
system<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.290> we<00:01:07.439> will<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.760> show<00:01:08.760> how<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
system and we will also show how to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.810 
system and we will also show how to
install<00:01:09.510> trailer<00:01:09.990> brake<00:01:10.290> system<00:01:11.130> onto<00:01:11.369> your

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
install trailer brake system onto your

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.940 
install trailer brake system onto your
Powerstroke<00:01:12.330> diesel<00:01:12.360> truck<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.799> can

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
Powerstroke diesel truck so that you can

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.980 
Powerstroke diesel truck so that you can
effectively<00:01:14.340> stop<00:01:14.729> your<00:01:14.909> trailer<00:01:15.180> now

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
effectively stop your trailer now

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
effectively stop your trailer now
obviously<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.560> everybody<00:01:16.920> needs<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> tell<00:01:17.610> me

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
obviously not everybody needs to tell me

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.640 
obviously not everybody needs to tell me
and<00:01:17.880> it's<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.299> one<00:01:18.479> downfall<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> Talman

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and it's the one downfall to the Talman

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.710 
and it's the one downfall to the Talman
is<00:01:19.740> it's<00:01:19.890> terribly<00:01:20.250> expensive<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
is it's terribly expensive and the

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.480 
is it's terribly expensive and the
installation<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.409> difficult<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.369> an

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
installation is difficult so it's an

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
installation is difficult so it's an
expensive<00:01:23.700> install<00:01:24.600> on<00:01:25.140> commercial<00:01:26.040> vehicles

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
expensive install on commercial vehicles

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.999 
expensive install on commercial vehicles
and<00:01:26.689> public<00:01:27.689> service<00:01:28.020> vehicles<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.890> know

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
and public service vehicles you know

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.080 
and public service vehicles you know
that's<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.400> thing<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.700> spending<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's one thing I'm spending the

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.149 
that's one thing I'm spending the
taxpayers<00:01:30.630> money<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:31.170> it's<00:01:31.290> no<00:01:31.470> big<00:01:31.710> deal<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
taxpayers money so it's no big deal you

brake<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.019> if<00:04:01.229> you've<00:04:01.379> ever<00:04:01.530> heard<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.829> truck

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:02.009 
brake and if you've ever heard a truck

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:04.399 
brake and if you've ever heard a truck
gunner<00:04:02.310> owning<00:04:02.609> a<00:04:02.699> buck<00:04:02.939> but<00:04:03.389> you<00:04:04.109> know<00:04:04.199> that's

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
gunner owning a buck but you know that's

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.020 
gunner owning a buck but you know that's
that's<00:04:04.650> actually<00:04:04.919> a<00:04:05.159> Jake<00:04:05.579> where<00:04:05.790> it<00:04:05.849> makes

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
that's actually a Jake where it makes

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.959 
that's actually a Jake where it makes
that<00:04:06.150> real<00:04:06.449> loud<00:04:06.750> noise<00:04:07.229> and<00:04:07.919> in<00:04:08.459> essence<00:04:08.879> what

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
that real loud noise and in essence what

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.689 
that real loud noise and in essence what
a<00:04:09.359> exhaust<00:04:10.169> brake<00:04:10.469> does<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:11.310> uses<00:04:11.669> a

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
a exhaust brake does it uses a

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.899 
a exhaust brake does it uses a
controller<00:04:12.049> but<00:04:13.049> what<00:04:13.199> it<00:04:13.319> does<00:04:13.639> resume<00:04:14.639> in<00:04:14.789> on

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
controller but what it does resume in on

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.029 
controller but what it does resume in on
that<00:04:15.090> just<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.389> little<00:04:15.419> bit<00:04:15.629> for<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.109> in

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
that just a little bit for you in

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.240 
that just a little bit for you in
essence<00:04:17.459> what<00:04:17.639> an<00:04:17.729> exhaust<00:04:18.150> brake<00:04:18.299> does<00:04:18.810> is

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
essence what an exhaust brake does is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.529 
essence what an exhaust brake does is
this<00:04:20.250> would<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.549> your<00:04:20.669> exhaust<00:04:21.029> coming<00:04:21.329> in

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
this would be your exhaust coming in

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.969 
this would be your exhaust coming in
here<00:04:21.779> and<00:04:21.870> exhaust<00:04:22.199> going<00:04:22.440> up<00:04:22.620> through<00:04:22.830> your

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
here and exhaust going up through your

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.120 
here and exhaust going up through your
down<00:04:23.190> tube<00:04:23.430> here<00:04:23.789> it<00:04:24.150> just<00:04:24.389> closes

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
down tube here it just closes

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.430 
down tube here it just closes
coming<00:04:26.670> out<00:04:26.790> as<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.420> ride<00:04:27.780> against<00:04:28.320> the

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
coming out as you ride against the

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.470 
coming out as you ride against the
engine<00:04:28.830> it<00:04:29.010> will<00:04:29.130> actually<00:04:29.340> choke<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.090> engine

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
engine it will actually choke the engine

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.260 
engine it will actually choke the engine
down<00:04:31.130> and<00:04:32.130> it<00:04:32.310> you<00:04:32.460> know<00:04:32.490> it's<00:04:32.700> controlled<00:04:33.150> by

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
down and it you know it's controlled by

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.820 
down and it you know it's controlled by
how<00:04:33.570> hard<00:04:33.840> you're<00:04:34.020> pressing<00:04:34.170> on<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> brake

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
how hard you're pressing on the brake

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.950 
how hard you're pressing on the brake
pedal<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.220> whatnot<00:04:35.550> and<00:04:35.760> then<00:04:36.420> you<00:04:36.720> know<00:04:36.810> once

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
pedal and whatnot and then you know once

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.180 
pedal and whatnot and then you know once
you<00:04:37.050> got<00:04:37.200> up<00:04:37.290> off<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.560> brake<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.950> will<00:04:38.040> open

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
you got up off the brake it will open

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:39.560 
you got up off the brake it will open
back<00:04:38.520> up<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:38.940> off<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.330> go

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
back up and off you go

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.020 
back up and off you go
but<00:04:40.260> this<00:04:40.710> is<00:04:40.860> basically<00:04:41.340> just<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.790> old

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
but this is basically just the old

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.530 
but this is basically just the old
banana<00:04:42.450> to<00:04:42.630> tailpipe<00:04:43.170> trick<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:45.060> this

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
banana to tailpipe trick the this

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.330 
banana to tailpipe trick the this
particular<00:04:45.720> one<00:04:46.080> is<00:04:46.140> a<00:04:46.200> PD<00:04:46.530> engine<00:04:46.860> brake<00:04:47.070> VD

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
particular one is a PD engine brake VD

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.150 
particular one is a PD engine brake VD
performance<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.060> it<00:04:48.480> uses<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.890> module<00:04:49.890> here

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
performance and it uses a module here

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.040 
performance and it uses a module here
that<00:04:50.340> hooks<00:04:50.580> into<00:04:50.820> your<00:04:51.150> obviously<00:04:51.930> your

brake<00:04:58.470> is<00:04:58.650> a<00:04:58.950> pretty<00:04:59.310> good<00:04:59.520> setup<00:04:59.790> I<00:05:00.030> don't

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
brake is a pretty good setup I don't

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.450 
brake is a pretty good setup I don't
like<00:05:00.630> them<00:05:00.870> with<00:05:01.470> automatic<00:05:01.860> transmissions

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
like them with automatic transmissions

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.160 
like them with automatic transmissions
I've<00:05:02.700> seen<00:05:03.030> automatic<00:05:03.450> transmissions<00:05:03.990> come

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
I've seen automatic transmissions come

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.650 
I've seen automatic transmissions come
unraveled<00:05:04.320> using<00:05:05.220> these<00:05:05.310> things<00:05:05.660> because

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
unraveled using these things because

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.030 
unraveled using these things because
you're<00:05:06.810> using<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:07.200> whole<00:05:07.290> you're<00:05:07.650> basically

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
you're using the whole you're basically

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.650 
you're using the whole you're basically
locking<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.550> converter<00:05:08.880> and<00:05:08.970> have<00:05:09.180> a<00:05:09.240> solid

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
locking the converter and have a solid

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.240 
locking the converter and have a solid
like<00:05:10.080> the<00:05:10.200> clutches<00:05:10.620> out<00:05:10.800> on<00:05:10.950> a<00:05:10.980> stick-shift

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
like the clutches out on a stick-shift

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.280 
like the clutches out on a stick-shift
truck<00:05:11.730> on<00:05:12.090> a<00:05:12.150> stick<00:05:12.420> shift<00:05:12.600> truck<00:05:12.900> and<00:05:13.050> exhaust

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.260 
truck on a stick shift truck and exhaust
brake<00:05:13.500> is<00:05:13.680> a<00:05:13.950> wonderful<00:05:14.460> thing<00:05:14.670> with<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.850> 6-feet

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
brake is a wonderful thing with a 6-feet

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.810 
brake is a wonderful thing with a 6-feet
or<00:05:15.420> 5-speed<00:05:15.930> exhaust<00:05:16.620> brake<00:05:16.830> works<00:05:17.070> fantastic

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
or 5-speed exhaust brake works fantastic

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.790 
or 5-speed exhaust brake works fantastic
but<00:05:17.970> I<00:05:18.030> don't<00:05:18.240> recommend<00:05:18.570> using<00:05:18.870> an<00:05:19.200> exhaust

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
but I don't recommend using an exhaust

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.770 
but I don't recommend using an exhaust
brake<00:05:20.040> with<00:05:20.280> an<00:05:20.370> automatic<00:05:20.640> transmission<00:05:21.420> it

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
brake with an automatic transmission it

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.630 
brake with an automatic transmission it
puts<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.140> lot<00:05:22.230> of<00:05:22.290> extra<00:05:22.680> heat<00:05:22.920> and<00:05:23.100> stress<00:05:23.400> on

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
puts a lot of extra heat and stress on

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.300 
puts a lot of extra heat and stress on
the<00:05:23.880> automatic<00:05:24.180> transmission<00:05:25.040> the<00:05:26.040> exhaust

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
the automatic transmission the exhaust

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.770 
the automatic transmission the exhaust
brake<00:05:26.490> is<00:05:26.700> considerably<00:05:27.240> cheaper<00:05:27.450> than<00:05:27.690> at

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
brake is considerably cheaper than at
