00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.040
 Hello friends here he is back, »he said 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.320
 and yes he really sees the Robeco coach himself if Köhler show 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:11.559
 What should that ask him why he is for our country 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:12.829
 very easily 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.689
 by the increased requests lately 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:18.699
 Last but not least is also by the store 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.179
 Schwarzenegger 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.189
 13 10 15 Notch I hate you called 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.449
 then I will 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.699
 make a quasi-special video 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.439
 and with it I also init who has stomach new whole did not me 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.820
 disturbed but as I said "I announce request makes it now 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.160
 and that's when I was here in the cloakroom Arena was 2 keys 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.020
 not found 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.490
 Year in a final holds you should find everything 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.610
 um and me have been written many percent Huber had been written I come to Manet 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:50.789
 Weida and 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.019
 where are the two keys and now I still officially make everything myself 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.019
 Show me where I forgot the two missing keys then 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.360
 Let's start, because it starts 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.170
 around 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 since I played everything through the whole year 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.500
 If I have to vomit then the rooms can not do any more just bands like that 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.850
 normal 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.719
 to walk around here again all the way first 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 up there 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.500
 thereby 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.860
 and here where I got this one 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.110
 huge robo block pushed up 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 Kannemann says because buying this CAD says Jochen pulled the truth 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.400
 you have to go through 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.720
 and yes here came three slaves with three boxes of Aabar 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.430
 In the eye of the truth, a fourth box appears here 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 and in this is key number 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.080
 So be key number 8 because there is new key 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.990
 Hiding here in the Wehener 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.250
 and if you stop 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 so it sounds a bit stupid but in the big key room right 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.039
 begins instead of the middle 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.339
 then you almost got my client to find all the keys 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.900
 so I did it right then but there are also people who 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.669
 I should not have seen then 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.669
 wrong done without knowing it is also 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.459
 actually no trained Haldern just too stupid run 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.689
 And as I said by the increased requests were the remaining 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.819
 are broken 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.219
 Marchesi just showed this video again and 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.329
 is not a problem says Sliwka minutes and then Hennis degrees 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.329
 Just stick to my playlist frame and well 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.539
 around 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.639
 what should that be known now 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.699
 Lünen and of course in the middle room 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.709
 At that time, if I remember correctly, I have room in a big key room 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.889
 their Okazaki nowhere bedspread's hole around you can go through 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.829
 climb 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.829
 and since it's Ammermann's key it's right the first door on the left 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:08.669
 turn around if he continues 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.669
 and stay up there 

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.799
 there are breaks 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.139
 because then you also conclusions number two 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.259
 or decisions number 9 in the latter 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.879
 but depending on which Marein police picked up 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.459
 fail again 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 and now I've got all the new keys 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.499
 and can open the last lead 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.729
 provides 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:44.269
 black angel I hope I could help you and everyone else too 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.669
 around 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:50.369
 As I said in my way Lell is that he finds it easy on no one 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:54.539
 the other videos I think is so Video 75 76 7 70 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.779
 Aareal Stock would have to stop by this 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:02.399
 the upper wheels make and as pillars get it first mostly axis
