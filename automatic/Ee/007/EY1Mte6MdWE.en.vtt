inch LCD LED backlit monitor with a one
millisecond<00:00:21.720> refresh<00:00:21.960> rate<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.740> has<00:00:22.920> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
millisecond refresh rate this has a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400 
millisecond refresh rate this has a
seven<00:00:23.250> millisecond<00:00:24.180> refresh<00:00:24.990> rates<00:00:25.230> but

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
seven millisecond refresh rates but

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
seven millisecond refresh rates but
they're<00:00:25.590> both<00:00:25.800> 60<00:00:26.400> Hertz<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.970> both<00:00:27.090> going

I<00:00:30.359> thought<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.590> lenovo<00:00:32.130> looked<00:00:33.059> crisper<00:00:34.020> in

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I thought the lenovo looked crisper in

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
I thought the lenovo looked crisper in
the<00:00:34.800> store<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:35.130> looked<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> lot<00:00:35.460> brighter<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the store it looked a lot brighter the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.639 
the store it looked a lot brighter the
only<00:00:36.300> thing<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.809> reflective<00:00:37.320> but<00:00:37.530> like

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
only thing is it was reflective but like

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.580 
only thing is it was reflective but like
all<00:00:37.860> daily<00:00:38.850> Elliot<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.870> LED<00:00:40.140> monitors<00:00:40.500> I

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
all daily Elliot all the LED monitors I

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.780 
all daily Elliot all the LED monitors I
saw<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.950> were<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.280> reflective<00:00:41.700> but

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
saw there were really reflective but

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.889 
saw there were really reflective but
they<00:00:41.910> were<00:00:41.969> brighter<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
they were brighter so that was a

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.420 
they were brighter so that was a
difference<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.710> issues<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.340> as

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
difference this is the issues is not as

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
difference this is the issues is not as
reflective<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.719> didn't<00:00:46.410> look<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.590> bright

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
reflective but it didn't look as bright

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.740 
reflective but it didn't look as bright
to<00:00:46.920> me<00:00:47.010> but<00:00:47.250> I'll<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> look<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.629> them

sticks<00:02:42.940> out<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.540> get<00:02:43.660> a<00:02:43.690> size<00:02:43.900> comparison<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
sticks out you get a size comparison to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.790 
sticks out you get a size comparison to
the<00:02:45.580> Aces<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:49.569> know<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.959> once<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.440> sticks<00:02:50.620> out

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
the Aces you know it once it sticks out

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.199 
the Aces you know it once it sticks out
a<00:02:50.860> little<00:02:51.130> bit<00:02:51.370> more<00:02:51.550> than<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
a little bit more than this in the

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.900 
a little bit more than this in the
circle<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.660> little<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:53.049> wider<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.590> oh<00:02:54.160> no

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
circle a little bit wider so oh no

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.610 
circle a little bit wider so oh no
better<00:02:55.330> than<00:02:55.510> that's<00:02:55.690> hitting<00:02:56.019> your<00:02:56.110> your

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
better than that's hitting your your

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.070 
better than that's hitting your your
keyboard<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.269> don't<00:02:58.630> think<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.930> sit

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
keyboard but I don't think you can sit

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.170 
keyboard but I don't think you can sit
back<00:02:59.110> close<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.590> monitor<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.190> actually<00:03:01.060> goes

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
back close and monitor and actually goes

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.720 
back close and monitor and actually goes
under<00:03:01.480> here<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:02.049> you<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.319> little<00:03:02.580> changes<00:03:03.580> on

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
under here if you have little changes on

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.729 
under here if you have little changes on
your<00:03:03.760> keyboard<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.299> let<00:03:04.510> your<00:03:04.630> keyboard<00:03:04.930> up

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.740 

so<00:03:08.739> here<00:03:08.920> it<00:03:09.010> is<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.310> like<00:03:09.459> it<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:10.060> big

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
so here it is I like it it's big

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.410 
so here it is I like it it's big
I<00:03:10.780> didn't<00:03:11.590> say<00:03:13.080> 23<00:03:14.080> question<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.860> should<00:03:14.890> see

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
I didn't say 23 question you should see

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.490 
I didn't say 23 question you should see
you<00:03:16.420> should<00:03:16.480> notice<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.989> difference<00:03:17.290> in

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
you should notice the difference in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.530 
you should notice the difference in
screen<00:03:18.130> real<00:03:18.400> estate<00:03:20.820> increase<00:03:21.820> house<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.329> is

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
screen real estate increase house it is

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.340 
screen real estate increase house it is
it's<00:03:22.810> glossy<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:24.040> see<00:03:24.220> reflection<00:03:24.790> but<00:03:25.420> let

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
it's glossy you see reflection but let

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.530 
it's glossy you see reflection but let
me<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.920> just<00:03:27.160> I'll<00:03:27.430> hold<00:03:27.549> it<00:03:27.670> here<00:03:27.910> but<00:03:28.209> I'll

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
me and I just I'll hold it here but I'll

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.349 
me and I just I'll hold it here but I'll
do<00:03:28.690> more<00:03:29.160> videos<00:03:30.160> so<00:03:30.430> you<00:03:30.519> can<00:03:30.609> see<00:03:30.760> more<00:03:30.940> size

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
do more videos so you can see more size

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:34.110 
do more videos so you can see more size
difference<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.160> 21.5<00:03:33.160> versus<00:03:33.880> the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
difference this is a 21.5 versus the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.960 
difference this is a 21.5 versus the
crazy<00:03:34.840> point<00:03:35.079> stick<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.820> one<00:03:36.820> thing

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
crazy point stick so it's it one thing

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.250 
crazy point stick so it's it one thing
to<00:03:37.060> keep<00:03:37.150> in<00:03:37.239> mind<00:03:37.480> is<00:03:37.630> this<00:03:37.780> doesn't<00:03:38.079> have

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
to keep in mind is this doesn't have

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.050 
to keep in mind is this doesn't have
like<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:38.920> edges<00:03:39.250> on<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.549> screen<00:03:39.760> improve

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
like the edges on this screen improve

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.810 
like the edges on this screen improve
all<00:03:40.329> the<00:03:40.600> edges<00:03:41.079> on<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.650> issues<00:03:42.040> are<00:03:42.280> bigger

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
all the edges on the issues are bigger

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.460 
all the edges on the issues are bigger
and<00:03:43.090> I've<00:03:43.269> pressed<00:03:43.450> some<00:03:43.720> plates<00:03:43.959> hurts<00:03:44.320> as

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
and I've pressed some plates hurts as

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.720 
and I've pressed some plates hurts as
the<00:03:44.560> plates<00:03:44.799> but<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.340> edges<00:03:45.549> are<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.700> little

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
the plates but the edges are a little

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.780 
the plates but the edges are a little
bossy<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.900> Asus<00:03:47.200> monitor<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.829> hasn't

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
bossy on the Asus monitor I hasn't

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.860 
bossy on the Asus monitor I hasn't
really<00:03:48.940> bothering<00:03:49.209> all<00:03:49.420> haven't<00:03:49.720> really

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
really bothering all haven't really

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.080 
really bothering all haven't really
notice<00:03:50.109> it<00:03:50.260> alright<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.370> I'm<00:03:51.549> comparing<00:03:51.850> them

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
notice it alright so I'm comparing them

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.810 
notice it alright so I'm comparing them
side<00:03:52.120> by<00:03:52.329> side<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.680> for<00:03:53.859> my<00:03:54.100> eye<00:03:54.130> this

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
side by side and just for my eye this

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.289 
side by side and just for my eye this
the<00:03:55.680> Lenovo<00:03:56.680> it's<00:03:56.980> bigger<00:03:57.280> but<00:03:58.150> they're

00:03:58.289 --> 00:03:58.299 
the Lenovo it's bigger but they're

00:03:58.299 --> 00:03:59.940 
the Lenovo it's bigger but they're
within<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.600> same<00:03:58.750> project<00:03:58.900> just<00:03:59.290> $10<00:03:59.680> more<00:03:59.709> on

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
within the same project just $10 more on

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.470 
within the same project just $10 more on
the<00:04:00.069> loom<00:04:00.220> and<00:04:00.430> this<00:04:00.609> actually<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.120> looks<00:04:01.390> a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
the loom and this actually it looks a

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.569 
the loom and this actually it looks a
lot<00:04:01.630> nicer<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.079> is<00:04:02.140> reflective<00:04:02.739> but<00:04:03.459> the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
lot nicer it is reflective but the

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.640 
lot nicer it is reflective but the
colors<00:04:03.940> are<00:04:04.150> much<00:04:04.450> more<00:04:04.810> vivid<00:04:05.109> and<00:04:05.350> brighter

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
colors are much more vivid and brighter

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.220 
colors are much more vivid and brighter
the<00:04:06.430> only<00:04:06.579> downside<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.000> it<00:04:07.269> doesn't<00:04:07.600> have<00:04:07.810> the

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
the only downside is it doesn't have the

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.620 
the only downside is it doesn't have the
1.5<00:04:08.739> watt<00:04:08.920> speakers<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.910> ACE<00:04:10.030> responder<00:04:10.450> has

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
1.5 watt speakers the ACE responder has

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.740 
1.5 watt speakers the ACE responder has
and<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:10.989> ACS<00:04:11.290> has<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.530> one<00:04:11.880> millisecond<00:04:12.880> color

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
and the ACS has a one millisecond color

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.500 
and the ACS has a one millisecond color
refresh<00:04:14.590> rate<00:04:14.829> but<00:04:15.579> they're<00:04:15.730> both<00:04:15.850> 60<00:04:16.299> Hertz

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
refresh rate but they're both 60 Hertz

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
refresh rate but they're both 60 Hertz
so<00:04:16.690> they<00:04:16.810> were<00:04:16.930> both<00:04:17.079> going<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.289> play<00:04:17.410> your

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
so they were both going to play your

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.080 
so they were both going to play your
games<00:04:17.709> they<00:04:17.889> both<00:04:18.039> can<00:04:18.190> capture<00:04:18.400> games<00:04:18.669> at<00:04:18.820> 60

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
games they both can capture games at 60

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.360 
games they both can capture games at 60
frames<00:04:19.180> per<00:04:19.359> second<00:04:19.870> does<00:04:20.470> the<00:04:20.620> color<00:04:20.829> change

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
frames per second does the color change

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.220 
frames per second does the color change
quicker<00:04:21.639> on<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
quicker on the

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.740 
quicker on the
they<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.830> on<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:22.980> lenovo<00:04:23.220> s<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:24.060> lenovo<00:04:24.450> is<00:04:24.600> at

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
they do on the lenovo s the lenovo is at

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.010 
they do on the lenovo s the lenovo is at
seven<00:04:25.310> millisecond<00:04:26.310> color<00:04:26.700> refresh<00:04:27.060> rate<00:04:27.300> so

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
seven millisecond color refresh rate so

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.740 
seven millisecond color refresh rate so
um<00:04:28.440> I<00:04:29.130> like<00:04:29.430> little<00:04:29.640> Domo<00:04:29.910> better<00:04:30.120> especially

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
um I like little Domo better especially

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.380 
um I like little Domo better especially
the<00:04:30.840> solar<00:04:31.050> $10<00:04:31.440> more<00:04:31.680> because<00:04:32.310> at<00:04:32.940> first<00:04:33.180> I

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
the solar $10 more because at first I

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.720
