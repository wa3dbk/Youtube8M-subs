the index finger but I'm hitting with

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.610 
the index finger but I'm hitting with
the<00:03:14.519> little<00:03:15.090> finger<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.690> fourth<00:03:15.989> fret<00:03:16.349> next

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
the little finger the fourth fret next

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.500 
the little finger the fourth fret next
to<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.920> top<00:03:17.099> string<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.730> then<00:03:17.909> I'm<00:03:18.030> hitting

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
to the top string and then I'm hitting

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:45.710 
to the top string and then I'm hitting
the<00:03:18.690> fifth<00:03:19.500> fret<00:03:20.280> next<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.090> top<00:03:21.269> string<00:03:44.720> so

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
the fifth fret next to the top string so

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.050 
the fifth fret next to the top string so
you<00:03:45.810> can<00:03:45.930> experiment<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.980> find<00:03:47.970> it

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
you can experiment with that I find it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.250 
you can experiment with that I find it
just<00:03:48.120> kind<00:03:48.359> of<00:03:48.390> easier<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:48.989> it's<00:03:49.170> actually

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
just kind of easier to do it's actually

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.680 
just kind of easier to do it's actually
a<00:03:49.470> hard<00:03:50.040> reach<00:03:50.310> I<00:03:50.640> should<00:03:51.150> practice<00:03:51.329> this

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
a hard reach I should practice this

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.630 
a hard reach I should practice this
other<00:03:51.900> way<00:03:52.049> because<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:53.340> probably

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
other way because it's it's probably

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.059 
other way because it's it's probably
easier<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.180> do<00:03:54.329> in<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.170> end<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.890> probably

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
easier to do in the end and I probably

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.380 
easier to do in the end and I probably
will<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.340> just<00:03:56.609> kind<00:03:56.790> of<00:03:56.819> discovered<00:03:57.269> that

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
will I just kind of discovered that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.569 
will I just kind of discovered that
right<00:03:57.569> now<00:03:57.799> just<00:03:58.799> got<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.040> thinking<00:03:59.310> about<00:03:59.400> it

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
right now just got to thinking about it

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.630 
right now just got to thinking about it
so<00:04:00.150> I'd<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.420> to<00:04:00.480> teach<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.739> world<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:02.519> sing

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
so I'd like to teach the world to sing

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:11.180 
so I'd like to teach the world to sing
in<00:04:02.970> perfect<00:04:08.359> now<00:04:09.359> here<00:04:09.569> I'm<00:04:09.690> doing<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.190> C

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
in perfect now here I'm doing the C

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.670 
in perfect now here I'm doing the C
which<00:04:11.669> is<00:04:11.819> the<00:04:12.000> third<00:04:12.359> finger<00:04:12.660> on<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.049> third

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
which is the third finger on the third

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.229 
which is the third finger on the third
fret<00:04:14.150> bottom<00:04:15.150> string<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.470> index<00:04:16.829> finger

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
fret bottom string and the index finger

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.469 
fret bottom string and the index finger
right<00:04:18.239> over<00:04:18.599> here<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:20.310> suspended<00:04:21.209> and<00:04:21.389> I'm

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
right over here the suspended and I'm

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:32.140 
right over here the suspended and I'm
going<00:04:21.720> to<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.870> fifth

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.540 

Oh<00:04:32.800> Stan<00:04:33.800> now<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:35.000> leave<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.389> one<00:04:35.600> here<00:04:35.630> and<00:04:36.550> as

Oh Stan now I leave this one here and as

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.129 
Oh Stan now I leave this one here and as
I'm<00:04:37.790> doing<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:38.000> suspend<00:04:38.389> it<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:38.600> when<00:04:38.750> I<00:04:38.780> jump

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
I'm doing to suspend it and when I jump

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.439 
I'm doing to suspend it and when I jump
I've<00:04:39.680> already<00:04:40.130> got<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.310> fulcrum<00:04:40.850> to<00:04:41.060> do<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.300> with

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
I've already got a fulcrum to do it with

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.330 
I've already got a fulcrum to do it with
so<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.720> don't<00:04:41.930> have<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.110> really<00:04:42.260> go<00:04:42.650> very<00:04:43.160> far

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
so I don't have to really go very far

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:51.280 
so I don't have to really go very far
and<00:04:45.070> then<00:04:46.070> I<00:04:46.160> grew<00:04:46.490> up<00:04:46.580> here<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.750> is<00:04:50.930> called<00:04:51.169> a

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290
