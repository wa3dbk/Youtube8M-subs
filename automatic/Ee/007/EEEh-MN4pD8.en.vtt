00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.060 
buzzes to lever the pole cinema don't
quite<00:00:49.200> sure<00:00:49.350> how<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> works<00:00:49.710> I'm<00:00:49.860> not<00:00:49.950> gonna

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
quite sure how it works I'm not gonna

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.229 
quite sure how it works I'm not gonna
take<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.280> apart<00:00:50.550> there's<00:00:50.730> another<00:00:50.910> hard<00:00:51.180> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
take it apart there's another hard to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.069 
take it apart there's another hard to
put<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.510> together<00:00:52.699> anyway<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.539> another

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
put back together anyway it has another

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.349 
put back together anyway it has another
river<00:00:55.260> automatically<00:00:55.860> reversing<00:00:57.079> things<00:00:58.079> for

00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 
river automatically reversing things for

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.260 
river automatically reversing things for
ribbon<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:02.699> that's<00:01:03.270> always<00:01:03.390> good<00:01:04.970> right<00:01:05.970> here

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
ribbon so that's always good right here

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.420 
ribbon so that's always good right here
we<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.900> tab<00:01:07.110> setting<00:01:07.470> it's<00:01:07.979> up<00:01:08.189> for

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
we have the tab setting it's up for

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.030 
we have the tab setting it's up for
clear<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.670> down<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.090> set<00:01:09.680> we're<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.799> you

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
clear and down for set we're here you

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.760 
clear and down for set we're here you
can<00:01:11.159> sort<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.700> guess<00:01:11.880> Jim<00:01:13.790> okay<00:01:15.770> okay

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
can sort of see it I guess Jim okay okay

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
can sort of see it I guess Jim okay okay
so<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:17.630> that's<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:18.720> common

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
so to see it right here that's a common

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:33.850 
so to see it right here that's a common

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.020 

okay<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:34.920> gonna<00:01:35.070> put<00:01:35.190> the<00:01:35.250> cover<00:01:35.400> back<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.760> put

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
okay I'm gonna put the cover back on put
some<00:01:36.060> paper<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.500> I'll<00:01:38.100> show<00:01:38.370> how<00:01:38.580> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
some paper in it and I'll show how it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.150 
some paper in it and I'll show how it
works<00:01:40.310> it's<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> very<00:01:41.550> quick<00:01:41.790> keyboard<00:01:42.150> the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
works it's a very quick keyboard the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.850 
works it's a very quick keyboard the
person<00:01:44.160> it's<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.330> light<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:46.260> it's<00:01:46.530> basically

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
person it's so light that it's basically

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.500 
person it's so light that it's basically
not<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.550> doesn't<00:01:47.820> even<00:01:47.880> it's<00:01:48.090> not<00:01:48.150> even<00:01:48.270> as

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
not it doesn't even it's not even as

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.780 
not it doesn't even it's not even as
heavy<00:01:48.720> as<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:52.979> heavy<00:01:53.190> at<00:01:53.340> all<00:01:53.460> really

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
heavy as it's not heavy at all really

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.830 
heavy as it's not heavy at all really
like<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.780> lighter<00:01:55.020> than<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:56.840> they

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
like it's lighter than that of the they

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.500 
like it's lighter than that of the they
just<00:01:58.050> don't<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.680> crash<00:01:59.130> like<00:01:59.760> that<00:01:59.970> see<00:02:00.270> I

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
just don't like a crash like that see I

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.690 
just don't like a crash like that see I
just<00:02:01.290> pushed<00:02:01.650> it<00:02:01.770> down<00:02:01.800> like<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.220> even<00:02:02.310> fold

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
just pushed it down like not even fold

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.430 
just pushed it down like not even fold
up<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:04.250> carry<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:06.200> hear<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> motor

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
up so just this carry can hear the motor

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:37.120 
up so just this carry can hear the motor
going<00:02:20.180> wasn't<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.239> black<00:02:21.390> ribbon<00:02:22.100> ribbon

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.160 

sometimes<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.489> put<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.820> enter<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:40.049> will

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
sometimes when you put it enter it will

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.449 
sometimes when you put it enter it will
actually<00:02:40.320> go<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.920> end<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.190> then<00:02:41.340> they'll

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
actually go to the end and then they'll

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.470 
actually go to the end and then they'll
just<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:41.850> bitch<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.019> hang<00:02:43.320> there

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.690

those little cog wheels that booze it

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.770 
those little cog wheels that booze it
come<00:02:55.940> with<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.090> piston<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.450> guess<00:02:56.629> I<00:02:56.720> don't

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
come with the piston I guess I don't

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.059 
come with the piston I guess I don't
know<00:02:56.900> quite<00:02:57.170> sure<00:02:57.319> how<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.530> works
