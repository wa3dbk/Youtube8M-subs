about six and a half feet of cable which
is<00:03:16.780> quite<00:03:17.290> a<00:03:17.319> bit<00:03:17.560> should<00:03:17.889> be<00:03:18.040> just<00:03:18.340> enough<00:03:18.579> to

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
is quite a bit should be just enough to

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.420 
is quite a bit should be just enough to
route<00:03:19.450> everything<00:03:19.930> wherever<00:03:20.889> you<00:03:21.040> wish<00:03:21.190> to

are<00:05:28.780> interested<00:05:29.289> we<00:05:29.470> performed<00:05:30.009> the<00:05:30.130> speaker

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
are interested we performed the speaker

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.850 
are interested we performed the speaker
test<00:05:30.820> using<00:05:31.180> true<00:05:31.449> RTA<00:05:31.840> software<00:05:32.440> and<00:05:32.650> these

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
test using true RTA software and these

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.010 
test using true RTA software and these
are<00:05:33.039> the<00:05:33.130> results<00:05:33.280> that<00:05:33.610> we<00:05:34.090> got<00:05:34.240> I<00:05:34.509> want<00:05:34.930> to

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
are the results that we got I want to

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.480 
are the results that we got I want to
first<00:05:35.169> mention<00:05:35.440> that<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:36.130> test<00:05:36.430> was

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
first mention that this test was

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.610 
first mention that this test was
conducted<00:05:37.120> in<00:05:37.330> a<00:05:37.840> natural<00:05:38.259> office

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
conducted in a natural office

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.670 
conducted in a natural office
environment<00:05:39.159> so<00:05:39.460> it<00:05:40.000> wasn't<00:05:40.389> in<00:05:40.509> a<00:05:41.199> soundproof

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
environment so it wasn't in a soundproof

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.860 
environment so it wasn't in a soundproof
room<00:05:42.009> which<00:05:42.580> means<00:05:42.820> these<00:05:43.270> results<00:05:43.720> may<00:05:43.840> not

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
room which means these results may not

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.920 
room which means these results may not
be<00:05:44.680> perfectly<00:05:45.190> accurate<00:05:45.280> and<00:05:45.820> one<00:05:46.599> more<00:05:46.750> thing

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
be perfectly accurate and one more thing

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.339 
be perfectly accurate and one more thing
is<00:05:47.199> that<00:05:47.970> for<00:05:48.970> a<00:05:49.030> perfect<00:05:49.449> speaker<00:05:49.750> test<00:05:49.990> the

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
is that for a perfect speaker test the

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.249 
is that for a perfect speaker test the
test<00:05:50.620> line<00:05:50.800> right<00:05:51.009> here<00:05:51.220> should<00:05:51.669> follow<00:05:51.820> a

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
test line right here should follow a

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.790 
test line right here should follow a
perfectly<00:05:53.259> flat<00:05:54.000> line<00:05:55.139> but<00:05:56.139> since<00:05:56.500> that<00:05:56.650> is

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
perfectly flat line but since that is

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.920 
perfectly flat line but since that is
impossible<00:05:57.159> to<00:05:57.460> achieve<00:05:57.729> we're<00:05:58.630> going<00:05:58.750> to<00:05:58.810> go

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
impossible to achieve we're going to go

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.100 
impossible to achieve we're going to go
ahead<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.530> look<00:06:00.159> at<00:06:00.370> what<00:06:00.729> this<00:06:01.270> speaker

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:02.110 
ahead and look at what this speaker

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.209 
ahead and look at what this speaker
system<00:06:02.530> has<00:06:02.680> to<00:06:02.830> offer

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
system has to offer

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.360 
system has to offer
let's<00:06:03.880> go<00:06:04.349> interpret<00:06:05.349> in<00:06:05.469> this<00:06:05.620> section<00:06:05.860> first

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
let's go interpret in this section first

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.490 
let's go interpret in this section first
so<00:06:06.729> between<00:06:07.240> twenty<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:07.599> thirty<00:06:07.780> Hertz<00:06:08.229> you

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
so between twenty and thirty Hertz you

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.800 
so between twenty and thirty Hertz you
can<00:06:08.770> a<00:06:08.800> bit<00:06:08.979> a<00:06:09.039> bit<00:06:09.430> more<00:06:09.789> of<00:06:10.060> a<00:06:10.150> dip<00:06:10.389> here<00:06:10.659> which

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
can a bit a bit more of a dip here which

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.230 
can a bit a bit more of a dip here which
means<00:06:11.110> the<00:06:11.289> base<00:06:11.440> is<00:06:11.680> quieter<00:06:12.280> than<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:12.789> should

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
means the base is quieter than it should

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.740 
means the base is quieter than it should
be

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
be

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.589 
be
however<00:06:14.620> these<00:06:15.250> speakers<00:06:15.940> are<00:06:16.120> not<00:06:16.300> meant<00:06:16.509> to

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
however these speakers are not meant to

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:18.330 
however these speakers are not meant to
perform<00:06:16.990> within<00:06:17.169> that<00:06:17.380> range<00:06:17.650> but<00:06:17.949> between

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:18.340 
perform within that range but between

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.580 
perform within that range but between
thirty<00:06:19.060> Hertz<00:06:19.330> and<00:06:20.009> 20,000<00:06:21.009> Hertz

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
thirty Hertz and 20,000 Hertz

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.730 
thirty Hertz and 20,000 Hertz
and<00:06:22.710> in<00:06:22.980> the<00:06:23.430> 30<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:23.940> 40<00:06:24.390> Hertz<00:06:24.900> range<00:06:25.230> you

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
and in the 30 and 40 Hertz range you

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.010 
and in the 30 and 40 Hertz range you
still<00:06:25.980> get<00:06:26.220> a<00:06:26.250> bit<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.700> a<00:06:26.760> dip<00:06:27.090> which<00:06:27.600> means<00:06:27.870> it

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
still get a bit of a dip which means it

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.560 
still get a bit of a dip which means it
is<00:06:28.050> still<00:06:28.500> quieter<00:06:29.040> however<00:06:29.700> most<00:06:30.330> of<00:06:30.510> the

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
is still quieter however most of the

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.020 
is still quieter however most of the
tests<00:06:30.960> did<00:06:31.260> perform<00:06:31.920> reasonably<00:06:32.730> well

here at 60 decibels where the flat line
is<00:06:47.610> at<00:06:47.730> 50<00:06:48.060> and<00:06:48.240> that<00:06:48.810> just<00:06:49.020> means<00:06:49.200> it<00:06:49.530> sounds
