them on your ship and when you press the
bottom<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:20.640> uses<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.270> energy<00:01:21.509> but<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
bottom it uses a lot of energy but it

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.440 
bottom it uses a lot of energy but it
pushes<00:01:22.680> away<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.280> ships<00:01:23.580> they've<00:01:24.210> not<00:01:24.420> yet

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.260 
I guess it does say there is release
date<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.189> looked<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.790> shops<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> we

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
can't find him anywhere and then we

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.160

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
binding tit oh and it comes up with this

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.300 
binding tit oh and it comes up with this
why<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.439> mean<00:01:58.439> k<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.680> have<00:01:58.860> been<00:01:58.950> messing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
why is this mean k to have been messing

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.160 
why is this mean k to have been messing
around<00:01:59.399> with<00:01:59.759> it<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.090> it's<00:02:00.750> got<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.140> the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
around with it and it's got all the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.459 
around with it and it's got all the
items<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.189> game<00:02:02.329> maybe<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.600> are<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
items in the game maybe they are the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
items in the game maybe they are the
pulse<00:02:04.680> weapons<00:02:05.490> are<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:05.820> katie<00:02:06.119> is

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
pulse weapons are in this katie is

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.229 
pulse weapons are in this katie is
realized<00:02:07.079> it's<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> fuel<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.459> says<00:02:08.910> if

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
realized it's like a fuel right says if

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.059 
realized it's like a fuel right says if
you<00:02:09.390> look<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.739> read<00:02:10.950> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you look at it right can you read you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.460 
you look at it right can you read you
hours<00:02:11.340> as<00:02:11.520> i<00:02:11.700> look<00:02:11.910> through<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.330> yeah<00:02:13.110> okay

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
hours as i look through this yeah okay

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.790 
hours as i look through this yeah okay
so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.490 
so
it<00:02:13.890> says<00:02:14.390> you<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.540> different<00:02:15.720> materials<00:02:16.350> and

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it says you get different materials and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.050 
it says you get different materials and
you<00:02:16.620> combine<00:02:16.800> different<00:02:17.070> materials<00:02:17.250> until

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
you combine different materials until

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.090 
you combine different materials until
I've<00:02:18.330> got<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.570> moment<00:02:18.630> is<00:02:19.200> called<00:02:19.410> man<00:02:19.680> doula

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
I've got the moment is called man doula

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.000 
I've got the moment is called man doula

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
project one of the final products that I

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.790 
project one of the final products that I
made<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:40.050> called<00:02:41.000> hair<00:02:42.000> bus<00:02:42.300> gas<00:02:42.930> up<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.500> don't

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
made is called hair bus gas up I don't

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.280 
made is called hair bus gas up I don't
even<00:02:43.920> know<00:02:44.160> its<00:02:44.490> mass<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:44.970> heavy<00:02:45.540> so<00:02:46.080> it's

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
even know its mass is heavy so it's

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.260 
even know its mass is heavy so it's
going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.560> wait<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> lot<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.580> spitting<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.240> a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
going to wait a lot it's spitting is a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.920 
going to wait a lot it's spitting is a
base<00:02:48.510> spin<00:02:49.130> thermal<00:02:50.130> is<00:02:50.310> gas<00:02:50.700> so<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.060> uses<00:02:51.330> gas

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
base spin thermal is gas so it uses gas

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.750 
base spin thermal is gas so it uses gas
for<00:02:52.320> whatever<00:02:52.710> we<00:02:53.070> don't<00:02:53.280> know<00:02:53.400> what<00:02:53.610> it's

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
for whatever we don't know what it's

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.060 
for whatever we don't know what it's
useful<00:02:54.120> yet<00:02:54.300> but<00:02:54.510> whatever<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.050> is<00:02:55.110> it's<00:02:55.710> a<00:02:55.860> gas

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
useful yet but whatever it is it's a gas

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.460 
useful yet but whatever it is it's a gas
and<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.760> conductivity<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.690> super<00:02:57.990> conductive

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
and the conductivity is super conductive

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
and the conductivity is super conductive
I've<00:02:58.680> got<00:02:58.860> some<00:02:59.070> other<00:02:59.220> ones<00:02:59.520> with<00:02:59.910> conductive

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I've got some other ones with conductive

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.020 
I've got some other ones with conductive
conductivity<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.530> insulator<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
conductivity is insulator and the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.330 
conductivity is insulator and the
thermals<00:03:03.540> actually<00:03:03.930> plasma<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:04.860> I<00:03:04.890> assume

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
thermals actually plasma so I assume

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.730 
thermals actually plasma so I assume
that<00:03:05.550> for<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.790> plasma<00:03:06.240> gun<00:03:06.450> like<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> energy

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
that for the plasma gun like the energy

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.130 
that for the plasma gun like the energy
for<00:03:08.010> it<00:03:08.040> but<00:03:08.580> I'm<00:03:08.640> not<00:03:08.790> sure<00:03:08.820> yet<00:03:09.300> might<00:03:09.930> saying

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
for it but I'm not sure yet might saying

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.840 
for it but I'm not sure yet might saying

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
what what should be happening is did you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.830 
what what should be happening is did you
say<00:03:32.850> it's<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.390> custom<00:03:34.670> block<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:36.060> is<00:03:36.570> it

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
say it's like a custom block or is it

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.050 
say it's like a custom block or is it
what<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.200> creative<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.040> guess<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.730> i'm

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
what is it creative I guess so i'm

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.670 
what is it creative I guess so i'm
assuming<00:03:39.510> it's<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.290> custom<00:03:40.680> block<00:03:41.120> yeah<00:03:42.120> i

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
assuming it's a custom block yeah i

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.080 
assuming it's a custom block yeah i
don't<00:03:43.680> see<00:03:43.920> why<00:03:44.070> it<00:03:44.130> wouldn't<00:03:44.430> be<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.670> custom

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
don't see why it wouldn't be a custom

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.990 
don't see why it wouldn't be a custom
block<00:03:45.330> I<00:03:46.610> don't<00:03:47.610> know<00:03:48.440> fuck<00:03:49.440> ok<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.459> I'm<00:03:50.760> at<00:03:50.880> the

block I don't know fuck ok so I'm at the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.740 
block I don't know fuck ok so I'm at the
shop<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:53.280> gonna<00:03:53.489> pause<00:03:53.820> here<00:03:54.390> ah<00:03:55.280> right
