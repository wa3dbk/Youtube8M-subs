this is a suburban 23 hole and this is
the<00:00:14.910> more<00:00:15.150> 11<00:00:15.810> hole<00:00:15.960> now<00:00:18.410> somebody<00:00:19.410> help<00:00:19.650> me

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
the more 11 hole now somebody help me

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.710 
the more 11 hole now somebody help me
this<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.690> is<00:00:21.870> being<00:00:22.110> made<00:00:22.440> by<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:24.270> kajillions

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this one is being made by the kajillions

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.130 
this one is being made by the kajillions
and<00:00:25.200> imported<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.190> United<00:00:26.640> States<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and imported to the United States and it

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.569 
and imported to the United States and it
doesn't<00:00:28.650> work<00:00:28.949> like<00:00:29.390> it's<00:00:30.390> supposed<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
doesn't work like it's supposed to

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.000 
doesn't work like it's supposed to
why<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.940> earth<00:00:33.300> would<00:00:33.359> they<00:00:33.960> continue<00:00:34.199> to<00:00:34.770> make

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
why on earth would they continue to make

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.340 
why on earth would they continue to make
these<00:00:35.250> forever<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.239> ever<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.630> ever<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.079> it

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
these forever and ever and ever and it

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.950 
these forever and ever and ever and it
goes<00:00:37.500> back<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.980> somebody<00:00:38.430> made<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.720> way

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
goes back to somebody made it this way

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.470 
goes back to somebody made it this way
here<00:00:40.560> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.739> States<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.250> went<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.670> overseas

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
here in the States it went to overseas

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.530 
here in the States it went to overseas
wherever<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.010> they<00:00:44.399> decided<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:44.970> duplicate

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
wherever and they decided to duplicate

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.319 
wherever and they decided to duplicate
it<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.590> when<00:00:46.800> they<00:00:46.920> did<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:48.000> didn't

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it and when they did they didn't

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
it and when they did they didn't
duplicate<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.809> exactly<00:00:49.200> probably<00:00:49.710> because

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
duplicate it exactly probably because

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.770 
duplicate it exactly probably because
they<00:00:50.070> went<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.370> metric<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:51.000> u.s.<00:00:51.300> I'm<00:00:51.600> not

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
they went from metric to u.s. I'm not

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.720 
they went from metric to u.s. I'm not
sure<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> any<00:00:52.800> case<00:00:53.040> let<00:00:53.430> me<00:00:53.460> show<00:00:53.640> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
sure but in any case let me show you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.780 
sure but in any case let me show you
what<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.880> mean<00:00:54.030> by<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:55.219> yes<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> put<00:00:56.760> a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
what I mean by that yes you can put a

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.400 
what I mean by that yes you can put a
bolt<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:59.870> how<00:01:00.870> do<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.020> bolt<00:01:01.230> them

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
bolt in it but how do you bolt them

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.789 
bolt in it but how do you bolt them
together<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:03.270> clearance<00:01:03.750> holes<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.680> are

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
together the clearance holes that are

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
together the clearance holes that are
not<00:01:04.979> threaded<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.759> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.210> buy<00:01:06.360> don't<00:01:06.509> know

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
not threaded and you can buy don't know

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.580 
not threaded and you can buy don't know
if<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.899> see<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.290> Glenn<00:01:07.530> but<00:01:09.470> some<00:01:10.470> of

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
if you can see that Glenn but some of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.870 
if you can see that Glenn but some of
these<00:01:10.650> are<00:01:10.710> threaded<00:01:11.250> some<00:01:11.430> are<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.610> that's

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
these are threaded some are not that's

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 
these are threaded some are not that's
the<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.180> supposed<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:13.940> but<00:01:14.940> there's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
the way it's supposed to be but there's

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.880 
the way it's supposed to be but there's
no<00:01:15.270> clearance<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.500> go<00:01:16.619> through<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
no clearance for it to go through the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.130 
no clearance for it to go through the
hole

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
hole

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.840 
hole
so<00:01:18.800> we're<00:01:19.010> it's<00:01:19.130> threaded<00:01:19.610> works<00:01:20.300> great<00:01:21.850> but

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
so we're it's threaded works great but

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.550 
so we're it's threaded works great but
it's<00:01:23.060> supposed<00:01:23.420> to<00:01:23.600> go<00:01:23.810> through<00:01:24.020> a<00:01:24.110> clearance

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
it's supposed to go through a clearance

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.710 
it's supposed to go through a clearance
hole<00:01:24.740> and<00:01:25.040> into<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.310> threaded<00:01:25.730> hole<00:01:25.760> it<00:01:26.180> doesn't

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
hole and into a threaded hole it doesn't

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.300 
hole and into a threaded hole it doesn't
do<00:01:26.930> it<00:01:28.600> why<00:01:29.600> on<00:01:29.900> earth<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:30.410> mean<00:01:30.920> if<00:01:31.160> you're

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
do it why on earth I mean if you're

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:32.800 
do it why on earth I mean if you're
going<00:01:31.430> to<00:01:31.520> try<00:01:31.730> to<00:01:31.790> bolt<00:01:32.060> these<00:01:32.210> together<00:01:32.390> Nats

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
going to try to bolt these together Nats

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.080 
going to try to bolt these together Nats
I<00:01:32.990> assume<00:01:33.290> that's<00:01:33.440> why<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:34.490> holes<00:01:34.730> are<00:01:34.970> in

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
I assume that's why the the holes are in

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.370 
I assume that's why the the holes are in
there<00:01:35.240> and<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:35.480> why<00:01:35.660> the<00:01:35.720> threads<00:01:36.110> are<00:01:36.260> in

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
there and that's why the threads are in

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.900 
there and that's why the threads are in
there<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.710> mean<00:01:37.160> you<00:01:37.190> could<00:01:37.280> boil<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.730> to<00:01:37.880> a

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
there I mean you could boil it to a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.280 
there I mean you could boil it to a
machine<00:01:38.210> I<00:01:38.360> guess<00:01:38.570> but<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:38.900> wouldn't<00:01:39.170> use<00:01:39.260> a

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
machine I guess but you wouldn't use a

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.160 
machine I guess but you wouldn't use a
threaded<00:01:39.740> holes<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.220> use<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.490> clearance<00:01:40.880> hole

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.420 

this<00:01:45.170> one<00:01:45.760> we<00:01:46.760> have<00:01:47.470> clearance<00:01:48.470> in<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.920> so<00:01:49.280> the

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
this one we have clearance in it so the

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.520 
this one we have clearance in it so the
bolt<00:01:49.700> will<00:01:49.910> go<00:01:50.060> through<00:01:50.390> and<00:01:50.660> it'll<00:01:51.110> thread

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
bolt will go through and it'll thread

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.370 
bolt will go through and it'll thread
into<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:53.300> threaded<00:01:53.600> holes<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.990> as<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.200> could

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
into the threaded holes it as you could

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.490 
into the threaded holes it as you could
see<00:01:54.560> they're<00:01:54.710> different<00:01:54.830> size<00:01:55.160> holes<00:01:56.500> this

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
see they're different size holes this

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
see they're different size holes this
works<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.979> can<00:01:58.160> bolt<00:01:58.370> it<00:01:58.490> together<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.090> way

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
works you can bolt it together this way

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.690 
works you can bolt it together this way
or<00:01:59.990> you<00:02:00.290> can<00:02:00.440> bolt<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.800> together<00:02:00.950> standing<00:02:01.550> up

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
or you can bolt it together standing up

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.930 
or you can bolt it together standing up
or<00:02:02.180> lots<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.510> different<00:02:02.780> ways<00:02:03.400> makes<00:02:04.400> no<00:02:04.610> sense

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
or lots of different ways makes no sense

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.800 
or lots of different ways makes no sense
I'm<00:02:05.290> mystified<00:02:06.850> why<00:02:07.850> this<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.300> even<00:02:08.600> being

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
I'm mystified why this is even being

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.510 
I'm mystified why this is even being
made<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.740> why<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:10.399> being<00:02:10.760> made<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:11.180> way

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
made and why is it being made that way

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.350 
made and why is it being made that way

if<00:02:20.810> you<00:02:20.959> look<00:02:21.140> at<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.380> guy<00:02:21.620> and<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:21.860> think<00:02:21.920> can

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
if you look at this guy and I think can

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.800 
if you look at this guy and I think can
you<00:02:22.610> get<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> shot<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.120> that<00:02:23.150> glint<00:02:23.480> inside

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.509 
you get a shot of that glint inside
there<00:02:26.320> there's<00:02:27.320> a<00:02:27.380> bolt<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> comes<00:02:28.100> in<00:02:28.310> from

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
there there's a bolt that comes in from

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.310 
there there's a bolt that comes in from
this<00:02:28.730> side<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.269> when<00:02:29.690> it<00:02:29.810> comes<00:02:29.989> in<00:02:30.110> from<00:02:30.290> the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
this side and when it comes in from the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.680 
this side and when it comes in from the
top<00:02:30.440> and<00:02:30.860> drops<00:02:31.100> in<00:02:31.370> and<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.000> actually<00:02:32.209> bolt

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
top and drops in and you actually bolt

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.270 
top and drops in and you actually bolt
it<00:02:32.810> together<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.260> make<00:02:33.530> an<00:02:33.650> angle<00:02:33.920> plate<00:02:34.100> out

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
it together and make an angle plate out

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.199 
it together and make an angle plate out
of<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.519> isn't<00:02:34.640> it<00:02:34.790> cool

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
of it isn't it cool

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.590 
of it isn't it cool
I<00:02:35.239> mean<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.720> works<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.610> you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.330> bolt<00:02:38.540> it

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
I mean it works and you can bolt it

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.420 
I mean it works and you can bolt it
together<00:02:38.930> in<00:02:39.470> a<00:02:39.680> different<00:02:40.100> than<00:02:40.220> many

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
together in a different than many

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.009 
together in a different than many
different<00:02:40.820> configurations<00:02:40.940> whether<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:41.900> do

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
different configurations whether you do

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.220 
different configurations whether you do

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
it this way this way this way so it goes
