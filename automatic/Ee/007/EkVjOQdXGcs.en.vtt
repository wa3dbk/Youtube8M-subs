hey<00:00:00.630> I'm<00:00:00.930> primitive<00:00:01.350> Tim<00:00:01.560> and<00:00:01.829> today<00:00:01.890> we're

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
hey I'm primitive Tim and today we're

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.800 
hey I'm primitive Tim and today we're
gonna<00:00:02.370> learn<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.820> thatch<00:00:03.179> it<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.480> frame

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
gonna learn how to thatch it a frame

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:11.120 
gonna learn how to thatch it a frame
using<00:00:04.440> Sabal<00:00:05.040> palm<00:00:05.279> front<00:00:09.769> these<00:00:10.769> palm<00:00:11.040> trees

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
using Sabal palm front these palm trees

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.890 
using Sabal palm front these palm trees
right<00:00:11.460> back<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:12.000> these<00:00:12.360> are<00:00:12.540> pretty<00:00:12.690> much

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
right back here these are pretty much

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.259 
right back here these are pretty much
ideal<00:00:13.380> palm<00:00:13.650> trees<00:00:13.920> they're<00:00:14.309> very<00:00:14.490> robust<00:00:14.969> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
ideal palm trees they're very robust and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.900 
ideal palm trees they're very robust and
they're<00:00:15.570> fairly<00:00:15.780> short<00:00:16.289> so<00:00:16.529> palm<00:00:17.460> fronds<00:00:17.730> are

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
they're fairly short so palm fronds are

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.730 
they're fairly short so palm fronds are
easy<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.180> get<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> so<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.260> way<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> cut

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
easy to get to and so the way I cut

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.880 
easy to get to and so the way I cut
these<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.510> use<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.750> smaller<00:00:22.140> knife<00:00:22.470> rather

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
these is I use a smaller knife rather

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.099 
these is I use a smaller knife rather
than<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.189> machete<00:00:23.580> cuz<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.750> get<00:00:24.900> into

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
than a machete cuz you can get into

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.259 
than a machete cuz you can get into
small<00:00:25.410> spaces<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> lot<00:00:26.070> easier<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.180> I'll

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
small spaces a lot easier and so I'll

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.960 
small spaces a lot easier and so I'll
take<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> palm<00:00:27.810> branch<00:00:28.080> that<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.670> I

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
take the palm branch that I want and I

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
take the palm branch that I want and I
like<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.269> cut<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.570> each<00:00:30.779> side<00:00:31.080> so<00:00:31.710> I'll<00:00:32.399> slice

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
like to cut on each side so I'll slice

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.350 
like to cut on each side so I'll slice
in<00:00:32.969> diagonally<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.930> on<00:00:34.829> each<00:00:34.980> side<00:00:35.280> like<00:00:36.180> this

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
in diagonally on on each side like this

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.500 
in diagonally on on each side like this
and<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.079> I'll<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.380> one<00:00:37.520> top<00:00:38.520> right<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
and then I'll do one top right on the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.610 
and then I'll do one top right on the
underside<00:00:39.989> where<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.800> made<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:42.620> and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
underside where I made this to that and

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440 
underside where I made this to that and
then<00:00:43.890> you'll<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.489> I'll<00:00:44.789> just<00:00:44.969> went<00:00:45.270> down<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
then you'll see I'll just went down a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.660 
then you'll see I'll just went down a
little<00:00:45.629> bit<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:46.050> press<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.129> it'll

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
little bit just press down and it'll

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.510 
little bit just press down and it'll
break<00:00:48.059> off<00:00:48.300> completely<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:50.190> would<00:00:50.340> have

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
break off completely and that would have

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.389 
break off completely and that would have
my<00:00:51.210> palm<00:00:51.480> frond<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> for

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
my palm frond and I can use this for

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.939 
my palm frond and I can use this for
thatching<00:00:54.170> now<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.469> have<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.739> gather

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
thatching now we just have to gather

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.760 
thatching now we just have to gather
about<00:00:56.309> 500<00:00:56.969> more<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.239> those<00:00:57.360> all<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.440> now

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
about 500 more of those all right so now

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.439 
about 500 more of those all right so now
we're<00:00:59.070> going<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.370> actually<00:00:59.760> attach<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.210> front

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we're going to actually attach the front

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.270 
we're going to actually attach the front
to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.050> frame<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.280> way<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.579> works<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
to the frame and the way this works is

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.070 
to the frame and the way this works is
right<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.670> front<00:01:05.880> we've<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.049> a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
right up here on the front we've got a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.179 
right up here on the front we've got a
few<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:09.780> these<00:01:09.990> uh<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.500> these<00:01:10.650> little<00:01:10.830> parts

these bring them up over here and with
this<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> branch<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> Frog<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.710> want

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this with the branch of the Frog I want

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.380 
this with the branch of the Frog I want
to<00:01:26.340> make<00:01:26.430> sure<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:26.970> under<00:01:27.180> some

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to make sure that that's under some

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.880 
to make sure that that's under some
tension<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.530> stick<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.829> up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
tension so I'm going to stick it up

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.450 
tension so I'm going to stick it up
under<00:01:29.130> there<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.720> tie<00:01:31.049> it

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
under there so that when I tie it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.870 
under there so that when I tie it
actually

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.640 

so<00:01:37.780> that<00:01:37.960> when<00:01:38.080> I<00:01:38.110> tie<00:01:38.439> it<00:01:40.380> there's<00:01:41.380> gonna<00:01:41.439> be

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
so that when I tie it there's gonna be

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.260 
so that when I tie it there's gonna be
some<00:01:41.830> tension<00:01:42.159> on<00:01:42.250> there<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:42.670> we're<00:01:43.210> gonna

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
some tension on there and we're gonna

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.940 
some tension on there and we're gonna
have<00:01:43.479> things<00:01:43.689> full<00:01:43.869> held<00:01:44.170> together<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:44.890> I'm

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
have things full held together so I'm

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.100 
have things full held together so I'm
going<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.130> take<00:01:45.250> these<00:01:45.400> two<00:01:45.580> pieces<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:47.020> them

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
going to take these two pieces put them

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.680 
going to take these two pieces put them
under<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.710> bar<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.610> then<00:01:55.090> once<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.360> flip<00:01:55.509> them

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
under this bar and then once I flip them

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.820 
under this bar and then once I flip them
over<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.170> bring<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.440> back<00:01:56.619> under

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
over I'm going to bring them back under

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.410 
over I'm going to bring them back under
and<00:01:57.490> then<00:01:58.420> tie<00:01:58.750> them<00:01:59.020> together<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:01.119> I<00:02:01.210> just

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
and then tie them together and I just

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.440 
and then tie them together and I just
use<00:02:01.570> it<00:02:01.750> like<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:01.930> regular<00:02:02.850> square<00:02:03.850> knot<00:02:04.119> for

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
use it like a regular square knot for

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
use it like a regular square knot for
that

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.290 

and<00:02:14.350> so<00:02:14.620> that'll<00:02:14.890> hold<00:02:15.040> real<00:02:15.520> nice<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.030> know

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and so that'll hold real nice you know

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.510 
and so that'll hold real nice you know
just<00:02:16.510> continue<00:02:16.600> on<00:02:16.960> along<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.560> road<00:02:17.830> also

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
just continue on along the road also

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.770 
just continue on along the road also
it's<00:02:18.670> important<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.120> we<00:02:19.210> start<00:02:19.420> from<00:02:19.570> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
it's important that we start from the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.990 
it's important that we start from the
bottom<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.290> go<00:02:20.530> up<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.860> top<00:02:21.100> that<00:02:21.580> way<00:02:21.790> our

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
bottom and go up to the top that way our

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.580 
bottom and go up to the top that way our
frogs<00:02:22.270> were<00:02:22.450> kind<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:22.720> shingled<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.200> top<00:02:23.410> of

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
frogs were kind of shingled on top of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.010 
frogs were kind of shingled on top of
each<00:02:23.710> other<00:02:23.890> and<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.760> one<00:02:25.510> branch<00:02:25.840> will

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
each other and so that one branch will

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.990 
each other and so that one branch will
shed<00:02:26.200> water<00:02:26.410> onto<00:02:26.800> the<00:02:27.010> next<00:02:27.250> front<00:02:27.550> onto<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
shed water onto the next front onto the

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.220 
shed water onto the next front onto the
next<00:02:28.180> front<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.570> all<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> way<00:02:28.810> down<00:02:28.990> to<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
next front and all the way down to the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.170 
next front and all the way down to the
ground<00:02:29.470> rather<00:02:30.160> than<00:02:30.280> going<00:02:30.580> through<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.030> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
ground rather than going through it and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:40.649 
ground rather than going through it and
into<00:02:31.450> our<00:02:31.690> shelter

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.849 

now<00:02:41.659> I'm<00:02:41.780> getting<00:02:42.019> really<00:02:42.230> close<00:02:42.439> to<00:02:42.590> being

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
now I'm getting really close to being

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:43.330 
now I'm getting really close to being
done

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
done

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.339 
done
however<00:02:43.730> I've<00:02:43.849> got<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.180> get<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> top<00:02:44.719> now<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
however I've got to get the top now the

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.069 
however I've got to get the top now the
very<00:02:45.680> top<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.340> well<00:02:46.760> out<00:02:46.939> of<00:02:46.969> my<00:02:47.150> reach<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.719> so

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
very top is well out of my reach and so

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.589 
very top is well out of my reach and so
what<00:02:48.290> I'm<00:02:48.379> gonna<00:02:48.499> have<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.829> end<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.069> doing<00:02:49.129> is

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
what I'm gonna have to end up doing is

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.420 
what I'm gonna have to end up doing is
weaving<00:02:50.599> weaving<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.469> branch<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.069> palm

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
weaving weaving the branch of the palm

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.360 
weaving weaving the branch of the palm
frond<00:02:53.030> up<00:02:53.569> into<00:02:54.109> there<00:02:54.319> and<00:02:54.499> then<00:02:54.859> go<00:02:55.069> around

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
frond up into there and then go around

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.009 
frond up into there and then go around
go<00:02:55.760> on<00:02:55.879> the<00:02:55.969> inside<00:02:56.359> and<00:02:56.599> make<00:02:56.840> sure

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
go on the inside and make sure

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:21.830 
go on the inside and make sure
everything<00:02:57.439> is<00:02:57.530> steady<00:02:57.829> up<00:02:58.280> at<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.700> very<00:02:58.849> top

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.870 

now<00:03:22.840> before<00:03:23.200> I<00:03:23.230> try<00:03:23.650> wedging<00:03:24.070> this<00:03:24.220> into<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
now before I try wedging this into the

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.090 
now before I try wedging this into the
into<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> structure<00:03:26.080> what<00:03:26.500> I'm<00:03:26.590> gonna<00:03:26.710> do<00:03:26.950> is

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
into the structure what I'm gonna do is

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.860 
into the structure what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.250> going<00:03:27.460> to<00:03:27.490> sharpen<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.060> a<00:03:28.300> little

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
I'm just going to sharpen this a little

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.560 
I'm just going to sharpen this a little
bit<00:03:30.390> so<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:33.520> it'll<00:03:33.880> go<00:03:34.090> into<00:03:34.240> a<00:03:34.360> nice

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
bit so that the it'll go into a nice

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.040 
bit so that the it'll go into a nice
small<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.200> tight<00:03:35.440> space<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.910> it'll<00:03:37.810> be<00:03:37.900> nice

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
small and tight space and it'll be nice

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.560 
small and tight space and it'll be nice
and<00:03:38.290> tight<00:03:38.640> now<00:03:39.640> on<00:03:39.850> these<00:03:40.030> palm<00:03:40.270> fronds

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
and tight now on these palm fronds

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.810 
and tight now on these palm fronds
there's<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.140> lot<00:03:41.290> of<00:03:41.380> these<00:03:41.500> fibers<00:03:41.800> so<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.610> like

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
there's a lot of these fibers so I like

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820 
there's a lot of these fibers so I like
to<00:03:42.850> go<00:03:43.060> ahead<00:03:43.120> and<00:03:43.270> collect<00:03:43.420> those<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.080> these

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
to go ahead and collect those and these

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.160 
to go ahead and collect those and these
will<00:03:44.950> make<00:03:45.070> some<00:03:45.280> pretty<00:03:45.400> good<00:03:45.520> cordage<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.960> I

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
will make some pretty good cordage if I

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.740 
will make some pretty good cordage if I
need<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.440> make<00:03:47.590> some<00:03:47.740> quarters<00:03:48.070> later<00:03:48.750> all

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
need to make some quarters later all

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750 
need to make some quarters later all
right<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.590> looks<00:03:50.620> like<00:03:50.920> it's<00:03:51.220> pretty<00:03:51.640> much

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
right so it looks like it's pretty much

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.090 
right so it looks like it's pretty much
done<00:03:52.150> there's<00:03:52.690> a<00:03:52.810> few<00:03:53.110> small<00:03:53.350> holes<00:03:53.530> up<00:03:53.890> in<00:03:54.010> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
done there's a few small holes up in the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.710 
done there's a few small holes up in the
top<00:03:54.280> which<00:03:54.850> I'll<00:03:55.000> probably<00:03:55.120> go<00:03:55.390> back<00:03:55.540> and

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
top which I'll probably go back and

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.140 
top which I'll probably go back and
patch<00:03:55.870> later<00:03:56.170> but<00:03:57.130> I'm<00:03:57.280> gonna<00:03:57.610> have<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:57.850> go

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
patch later but I'm gonna have to go

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.370 
patch later but I'm gonna have to go
back<00:03:58.230> later

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
back later

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.740 
back later
and<00:03:59.530> kind<00:04:00.070> of<00:04:00.130> redo<00:04:00.490> stuff<00:04:00.550> because<00:04:01.390> right<00:04:01.600> now

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and kind of redo stuff because right now

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.960 
and kind of redo stuff because right now
all<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:02.020> palm<00:04:02.230> fronds<00:04:02.500> are<00:04:02.680> green<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.700> once

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
all the palm fronds are green so once

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.510 
all the palm fronds are green so once
they<00:04:04.180> dry<00:04:04.600> out<00:04:04.630> in<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:04.960> little<00:04:05.440> shrink<00:04:05.770> and<00:04:06.010> so

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
they dry out in the little shrink and so

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.550 
they dry out in the little shrink and so
that'll<00:04:07.390> likely<00:04:07.570> leave<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> few<00:04:08.170> holes<00:04:08.350> here

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
that'll likely leave a few holes here

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.260 
that'll likely leave a few holes here
and<00:04:08.650> there<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.160> I'm<00:04:09.490> gonna<00:04:09.670> have<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:09.910> go<00:04:10.060> back

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
and there so I'm gonna have to go back

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.690 
and there so I'm gonna have to go back
and<00:04:10.540> put<00:04:11.350> some<00:04:11.380> more<00:04:11.680> palm<00:04:12.040> fronds<00:04:12.310> on<00:04:12.490> there

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
and put some more palm fronds on there

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.400 
and put some more palm fronds on there
but<00:04:13.270> I'm<00:04:13.420> not<00:04:13.630> going<00:04:14.020> to<00:04:14.050> be<00:04:14.140> too<00:04:14.260> difficult

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
but I'm not going to be too difficult

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.920 
but I'm not going to be too difficult
and<00:04:15.100> right<00:04:15.550> now<00:04:15.730> I'll<00:04:16.359> feel<00:04:16.660> pretty

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
and right now I'll feel pretty

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.470 
and right now I'll feel pretty
comfortable<00:04:17.109> sleeping<00:04:17.770> in<00:04:17.919> here<00:04:18.100> it's<00:04:18.820> real

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
comfortable sleeping in here it's real

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.479 
comfortable sleeping in here it's real
nice<00:04:19.630> this<00:04:20.560> seems<00:04:20.830> pretty<00:04:20.980> solid<00:04:21.220> the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
nice this seems pretty solid the

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.490 
nice this seems pretty solid the
structure<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:21.970> real<00:04:22.150> solid<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:22.720> what's<00:04:23.290> great

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
structure is real solid and what's great

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.290 
structure is real solid and what's great
about<00:04:23.530> this<00:04:23.860> type<00:04:24.040> of<00:04:24.070> thatching<00:04:24.640> is<00:04:24.790> you<00:04:25.180> can

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
about this type of thatching is you can

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.690 
about this type of thatching is you can
apply<00:04:25.419> it<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.810> pretty<00:04:26.320> much<00:04:26.500> anything<00:04:26.800> any

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
apply it to pretty much anything any

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.880 
apply it to pretty much anything any
type<00:04:28.060> of<00:04:28.210> frame<00:04:28.480> like<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.380> kind<00:04:29.680> of<00:04:29.710> a

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
type of frame like this is kind of a

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.830 
type of frame like this is kind of a
cone<00:04:30.220> shaped<00:04:30.520> frame<00:04:30.790> sort<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.210> like<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> teepee

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
cone shaped frame sort of like a teepee

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.570 
cone shaped frame sort of like a teepee
so<00:04:32.350> now<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.560> I've<00:04:32.740> got<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.980> structure<00:04:33.220> built

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
so now that I've got the structure built

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.460 
so now that I've got the structure built
I<00:04:33.700> need<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.060> make<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.270> door<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.260> I'm<00:04:35.380> gonna

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
I need to make a door so I'm gonna

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.800 
I need to make a door so I'm gonna

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
basically make a fetch door so that it

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.480 
basically make a fetch door so that it
will<00:04:38.080> kind<00:04:38.290> of<00:04:38.350> blend<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.919> with<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.220> rest<00:04:39.250> of

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
will kind of blend in with the rest of

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.820 
will kind of blend in with the rest of
the<00:04:39.550> structure<00:04:39.880> now<00:04:40.510> I<00:04:40.810> also<00:04:41.080> want<00:04:41.260> this<00:04:41.590> Hut

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
the structure now I also want this Hut

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.820 
the structure now I also want this Hut
to<00:04:42.310> double<00:04:42.820> as<00:04:43.030> a<00:04:43.330> smokehouse<00:04:43.810> so<00:04:44.620> I'm<00:04:44.680> going

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
lot of smoke that's going to stay in

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.940 
lot of smoke that's going to stay in
there<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.090> get<00:05:19.450> all<00:05:19.570> over<00:05:19.690> that<00:05:19.870> meat<00:05:20.110> now

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950

there and I get all over that meat now
you<00:05:21.010> can<00:05:21.220> tell<00:05:21.430> there<00:05:21.880> are<00:05:21.910> some<00:05:22.330> little<00:05:22.780> holes

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
you can tell there are some little holes

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.670 
you can tell there are some little holes
and<00:05:23.320> stuff

and stuff

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.640 
and stuff
in<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.919> very<00:05:24.100> top<00:05:24.340> but<00:05:25.330> I'm<00:05:25.509> I<00:05:25.810> think<00:05:26.320> it's

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
going to be pretty waterproof so there's

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.830 
going to be pretty waterproof so there's
some<00:05:30.310> rain<00:05:30.460> being<00:05:30.669> forecasted<00:05:31.360> later<00:05:31.690> this
