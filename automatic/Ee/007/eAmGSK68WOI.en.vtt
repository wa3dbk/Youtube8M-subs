00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.770 
think about the boken matchup first time
we<00:01:52.979> saw<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.399> at<00:01:53.549> season's<00:01:54.000> beatings<00:01:54.270> where

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
we saw it was at season's beatings where

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
we saw it was at season's beatings where
implications<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.590> destroyed<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.640> many<00:01:56.849> in

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
implications just destroyed that many in

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.749 
implications just destroyed that many in
a<00:01:57.209> verse<00:01:57.390> 27<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:57.959> was<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.259> seven<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
a verse 27 it was like seven one and the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300 
a verse 27 it was like seven one and the
one<00:01:59.969> was<00:02:00.179> like<00:02:00.329> infiltration<00:02:00.990> trolling<00:02:01.829> so

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
one was like infiltration trolling so

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.339 
one was like infiltration trolling so
you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.670> see<00:02:02.849> that<00:02:02.880> Dominion<00:02:03.509> has<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.079> much

00:02:04.339 --> 00:02:04.349 
you can see that Dominion has a much

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:05.889 
you can see that Dominion has a much
more<00:02:04.500> offensive<00:02:04.799> style<00:02:04.979> like<00:02:05.189> you're<00:02:05.340> saying

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
more offensive style like you're saying

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.969 
more offensive style like you're saying
he<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.049> able<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> take<00:02:07.379> the<00:02:07.439> first<00:02:07.560> round<00:02:07.829> with

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
he was able to take the first round with

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.309 
he was able to take the first round with
it<00:02:08.099> which<00:02:08.280> took<00:02:08.879> him<00:02:09.030> awhile<00:02:09.319> against

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
it which took him awhile against

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.720 
it which took him awhile against
implication<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> last<00:02:11.190> time<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.400> played<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
implication the last time I played to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.080 
implication the last time I played to
get<00:02:11.849> that<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.150> round<00:02:12.360> oh<00:02:13.489> nice<00:02:14.489> funny<00:02:14.849> right

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
get that one round oh nice funny right

get that one round oh nice funny right
there<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:15.510> think<00:02:15.840> that's<00:02:15.989> good<00:02:16.170> oh<00:02:16.410> just

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
there I think that's good oh just

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.400 
there I think that's good oh just
missing<00:02:17.579> he<00:02:18.030> didn't<00:02:18.329> get<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.599> full<00:02:18.810> animation

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
which would have did a lot of damage but

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.780 
which would have did a lot of damage but
it<00:02:21.209> doesn't<00:02:21.780> matter<00:02:22.190> he's<00:02:23.190> even<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.609> match
