would be like an hand cannot reach at

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.710 
would be like an hand cannot reach at
this<00:01:41.039> point<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.789> we<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.210> play<00:01:42.300> that<00:01:42.479> card

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

this point but we have to play that card
so<00:01:43.910> very<00:01:44.910> easy<00:01:48.229> we<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> pluck<00:01:49.740> only<00:01:50.100> B

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
so very easy we have to pluck only B

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:09.650 
so very easy we have to pluck only B
strings<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:06.300> it<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.349> down<00:02:07.890> down<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.910> then

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
strings so it is down down and then

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.589 
strings so it is down down and then
again<00:02:10.020> another<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:11.310> before<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:12.180> give

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:21.440 
again another down but before that give
one<00:02:12.900> up<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.860> becomes<00:02:20.099> down<00:02:20.610> down<00:02:21.090> up<00:02:21.330> down

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
one up so that becomes down down up down

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:31.380 
one up so that becomes down down up down
down<00:02:23.900> down<00:02:24.900> up<00:02:25.140> down
