Asbury Ronnie's coming back to you guys
today<00:00:04.110> with<00:00:04.319> episode<00:00:04.710> 4<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.069> quest<00:00:05.520> for

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
today with episode 4 of quest for

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.700 
today with episode 4 of quest for
perfection<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.540> time<00:00:06.839> I<00:00:07.020> am<00:00:07.230> testing

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
perfection and this time I am testing

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.320 
perfection and this time I am testing
keyboards<00:00:08.189> because<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.550> guys<00:00:08.700> requested<00:00:08.849> in

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
keyboards because you guys requested in

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.000 
keyboards because you guys requested in
the<00:00:09.420> last<00:00:09.660> episode<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.590> me<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.830> test

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
the last episode for me to test

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.220 
the last episode for me to test
keyboards<00:00:11.490> test<00:00:11.700> response<00:00:12.120> times<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.630> also

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
keyboards test response times and also

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.340 
keyboards test response times and also
test<00:00:13.799> PST<00:00:14.370> versus<00:00:14.820> USB<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.480> which<00:00:15.900> has<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
test PST versus USB and which has the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
test PST versus USB and which has the
better<00:00:16.500> response<00:00:17.010> times<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:17.789> did<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
better response times so I did that

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.540 
better response times so I did that
today<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:19.080> did<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.560> methodology<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.220> used

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
today and I did the methodology I used

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.679 
today and I did the methodology I used
was<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.760> little<00:00:21.029> bit<00:00:21.119> weird<00:00:21.330> because<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
was a little bit weird because I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.439 
was a little bit weird because I
couldn't<00:00:22.020> find<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.859> program<00:00:23.730> specifically<00:00:24.180> for

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
couldn't find a program specifically for

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
couldn't find a program specifically for
testing<00:00:24.779> keyboard<00:00:25.170> response<00:00:25.619> times<00:00:26.000> so<00:00:27.000> what

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
testing keyboard response times so what

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.700 
testing keyboard response times so what
I<00:00:27.180> did<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.720> took<00:00:27.750> matters<00:00:28.260> into<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.590> own

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I did was I took matters into my own

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.150 
I did was I took matters into my own
hands

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
hands

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
hands
I<00:00:29.279> got<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> reaction<00:00:30.090> test<00:00:30.539> off<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> web<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
I got a reaction test off the web and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
I got a reaction test off the web and
then<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:31.890> used<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.460> with<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> Enter<00:00:33.030> key<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.420> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
then I used it with the Enter key and I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.260 
then I used it with the Enter key and I
pitted<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.070> first<00:00:35.370> candidate<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.910> had<00:00:36.090> here

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
pitted this first candidate we had here

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.000 
pitted this first candidate we had here
was<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.930> did<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.230> hundred<00:00:37.500> times<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
was and I did it a hundred times so I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.670 
was and I did it a hundred times so I
tested<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> hundred<00:00:38.850> times<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.870> weed<00:00:40.649> out

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
tested it a hundred times to weed out

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.799 
tested it a hundred times to weed out
any<00:00:41.070> inaccuracies<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.090> mean<00:00:42.420> even<00:00:42.719> though

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
any inaccuracies I mean even though

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.630 
any inaccuracies I mean even though
there<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.140> inaccuracies<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:44.070> still

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
there will be inaccuracies I still

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
there will be inaccuracies I still
waited<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.059> as<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.539> could<00:00:45.719> by<00:00:45.870> testing

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
waited out as much as I could by testing

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.959 
waited out as much as I could by testing
it<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.350> hundred<00:00:46.530> times<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.460> first<00:00:47.640> candidate

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
it a hundred times the first candidate

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
it a hundred times the first candidate
here<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.390> Microsoft<00:00:48.840> economic<00:00:49.590> natural

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
here is the Microsoft economic natural

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.979 
here is the Microsoft economic natural
keyboard<00:00:50.789> now<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> standard<00:00:51.570> deal

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
keyboard now this is a standard deal

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.770 
keyboard now this is a standard deal
it's<00:00:52.469> 125<00:00:53.280> Hertz<00:00:53.579> polling<00:00:54.000> or<00:00:54.090> 8<00:00:54.210> milliseconds

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
it's 125 Hertz polling or 8 milliseconds

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.020 
it's 125 Hertz polling or 8 milliseconds
response<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.710> I<00:00:56.280> tested<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.789> with

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
response time and I tested this with

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.810 
response time and I tested this with
MSI's<00:00:57.660> gaming<00:00:58.260> USB<00:00:58.680> port<00:00:59.010> versus<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.640> normal

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
MSI's gaming USB port versus the normal

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.119 
MSI's gaming USB port versus the normal
USB<00:01:00.390> port<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.379> basically<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.739> test<00:01:02.010> to

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
USB port so this is basically a test to

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.000 
USB port so this is basically a test to
find<00:01:02.160> out<00:01:02.520> if<00:01:02.579> MSI's<00:01:03.239> gaming<00:01:04.229> port<00:01:04.530> lives<00:01:04.860> up

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
find out if MSI's gaming port lives up

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.910 
find out if MSI's gaming port lives up
to<00:01:05.040> its<00:01:05.280> hype<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:06.540> next<00:01:06.780> test<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> did<00:01:07.380> more

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
to its hype the next test I did more

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.530 
to its hype the next test I did more
specifically<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:10.159> this<00:01:11.159> keyboard<00:01:11.540> has

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
specifically was the this keyboard has

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.160 
specifically was the this keyboard has
the<00:01:13.320> option<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.430> ps2<00:01:14.820> adapter<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> could

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
the option with a ps2 adapter so I could

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
the option with a ps2 adapter so I could
test<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:17.009> pacifically<00:01:17.460> USB<00:01:18.470> versus<00:01:19.470> ps2<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
test more pacifically USB versus ps2 so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130 
test more pacifically USB versus ps2 so
this<00:01:20.850> was<00:01:21.030> great<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> was<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> keyboard<00:01:22.049> that

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this was great this was a keyboard that

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.539 
this was great this was a keyboard that
was<00:01:22.200> great<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.619> doing<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
was great for doing that and in the

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.249 
was great for doing that and in the
process<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.030> testing<00:01:24.240> these<00:01:24.540> two<00:01:24.720> keyboards

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
process of testing these two keyboards

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.910 
process of testing these two keyboards
actually<00:01:25.590> found<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:27.619> expected<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:28.710> I'll<00:01:28.770> get

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
actually found out expected and I'll get

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.990 
actually found out expected and I'll get
to<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> end<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> video<00:01:29.820> but

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to that at the end of the video but

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.190 
to that at the end of the video but
let's<00:01:30.150> get<00:01:30.299> onto<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> results<00:01:30.960> here<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
let's get onto the results here the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.630 
let's get onto the results here the
first<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.710> gaming<00:01:31.950> port<00:01:32.250> versus<00:01:32.549> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
first was the gaming port versus the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.520 
first was the gaming port versus the
normal<00:01:32.790> port<00:01:33.150> now<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.630> did<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> hundred<00:01:34.020> tests

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
normal port now I did a hundred tests

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.859 
normal port now I did a hundred tests
and<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> did<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:35.880> without<00:01:35.970> any<00:01:36.360> bias<00:01:36.600> I

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and you know I did it without any bias I

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.850 
and you know I did it without any bias I
just<00:01:37.049> looked<00:01:37.200> wait<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> green<00:01:37.799> light

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
just looked wait for the green light

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
just looked wait for the green light
bang<00:01:38.400> wait<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.060> green<00:01:39.210> light<00:01:39.270> bang<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
bang wait for the green light bang so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.440 
bang wait for the green light bang so
and<00:01:40.290> as<00:01:41.159> we<00:01:41.400> see<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> gaming<00:01:42.119> port<00:01:42.329> was

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
and as we see here the gaming port was

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
and as we see here the gaming port was
actually<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.810> first<00:01:43.049> port<00:01:43.320> that<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.500> tested

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
actually the first port that I tested

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.429 
actually the first port that I tested
and<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> averaged<00:01:44.369> 252<00:01:45.119> milliseconds<00:01:45.540> over<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
and I averaged 252 milliseconds over a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
and I averaged 252 milliseconds over a
hundred<00:01:46.740> tests<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.549> next<00:01:47.820> time<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> did<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hundred tests the next time I did it the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.560 
hundred tests the next time I did it the
normal<00:01:49.020> port<00:01:49.229> was<00:01:49.350> 257<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.090> makes<00:01:51.390> me

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
normal port was 257 so this makes me

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.499 
normal port was 257 so this makes me
believe<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.680> MSI<00:01:53.549> gaming<00:01:53.579> port<00:01:54.299> is

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
believe that the MSI gaming port is

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.289 
believe that the MSI gaming port is
legit<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.200> actually<00:01:55.530> does<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:57.030> does

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
legit it actually does work so it does

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.420 
legit it actually does work so it does
provide<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.810> benefit<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.799> if<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> guys<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
provide a benefit so if you guys have a

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.639 
provide a benefit so if you guys have a
normal<00:01:59.790> keyboard<00:01:59.969> or<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.329> normal<00:02:00.689> Mouse<00:02:00.899> you

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
normal keyboard or a normal Mouse you

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
normal keyboard or a normal Mouse you
can<00:02:01.680> get<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.040> extra<00:02:02.219> eight<00:02:02.729> or<00:02:03.000> so

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
can get that extra eight or so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.569 
can get that extra eight or so
milliseconds<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.950> gaming<00:02:05.219> port

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
milliseconds out of the gaming port

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.649 
milliseconds out of the gaming port
which<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.759> actually<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.270> good<00:02:06.540> I'm

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
which is actually really good I'm

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.240 
which is actually really good I'm
impressed<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.200> MSI<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.129> actually

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
impressed with MSI that they actually

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.680 
impressed with MSI that they actually
give<00:02:08.520> it<00:02:08.670> they<00:02:08.849> deliver<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.270> product<00:02:09.479> that

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
give it they deliver a product that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.320 
give it they deliver a product that
works<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.860> next<00:02:11.069> part<00:02:11.250> here<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.760> ps2

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
works the next part here is the ps2

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.830 
works the next part here is the ps2
versus<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.050> USB

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
versus the USB

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.320 
versus the USB
so<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:14.950> another<00:02:15.220> again<00:02:15.489> a<00:02:15.519> hundred<00:02:15.730> tests

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
so this is another again a hundred tests

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.119 
so this is another again a hundred tests
and<00:02:16.480> what<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.690> found<00:02:16.930> here<00:02:17.170> like<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.739> again

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
and what I found here like this is again

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.790 
and what I found here like this is again
variants<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.819> USB<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.450> gaming<00:02:19.900> port<00:02:20.140> it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
variants so USB on the gaming port it

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.880 
variants so USB on the gaming port it
averaged<00:02:21.310> 232<00:02:22.090> milliseconds<00:02:22.900> over<00:02:23.290> 100<00:02:23.590> tests

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
averaged 232 milliseconds over 100 tests

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.979 
averaged 232 milliseconds over 100 tests
this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.280> my<00:02:24.400> mechanical<00:02:24.879> blues<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.360> the

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
this is on my mechanical blues and the

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.820 
this is on my mechanical blues and the
ps2<00:02:26.590> average<00:02:27.360> 234<00:02:28.360> milliseconds<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:29.140> again

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
ps2 average 234 milliseconds so again

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.500 
ps2 average 234 milliseconds so again
what<00:02:30.069> I've<00:02:30.190> concluded<00:02:30.519> here<00:02:31.000> now<00:02:31.239> is

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
what I've concluded here now is

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.039 
what I've concluded here now is
basically<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.459> USB<00:02:33.459> at<00:02:33.910> one<00:02:34.299> millisecond<00:02:34.959> or

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
basically that USB at one millisecond or

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.020 
basically that USB at one millisecond or
a<00:02:35.110> hunt<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.470> thousand<00:02:35.890> Hertz<00:02:36.040> poling<00:02:36.549> versus

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
a hunt a thousand Hertz poling versus

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.000 
a hunt a thousand Hertz poling versus
pierced<00:02:37.390> -<00:02:37.629> there<00:02:37.870> really<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.379> no<00:02:38.590> difference

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
pierced - there really is no difference

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.699 
pierced - there really is no difference
at<00:02:39.760> best<00:02:40.269> one<00:02:40.569> millisecond<00:02:41.200> because<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.560> my

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
at best one millisecond because in my

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.470 
at best one millisecond because in my
vent<00:02:41.950> in<00:02:42.340> my<00:02:42.400> tests<00:02:42.849> here<00:02:43.030> it<00:02:43.120> didn't<00:02:43.360> really

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
vent in my tests here it didn't really

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.020 
vent in my tests here it didn't really
make<00:02:43.690> a<00:02:43.750> difference<00:02:44.549> what<00:02:45.549> did<00:02:45.819> make<00:02:46.000> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
make a difference what did make a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.339 
make a difference what did make a
difference<00:02:46.299> though<00:02:46.690> as<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.959> could<00:02:47.079> see<00:02:47.319> here

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
difference though as you could see here

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:52.860 
difference though as you could see here
the<00:02:48.930> 234<00:02:49.930> versus<00:02:50.530> say<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.390> 252<00:02:52.390> there<00:02:52.720> was<00:02:52.840> a

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
the 234 versus say the 252 there was a

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.660 
the 234 versus say the 252 there was a
16<00:02:53.380> millisecond<00:02:54.010> difference<00:02:54.099> between

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
16 millisecond difference between

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.059 
16 millisecond difference between
keyboards<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.569> now<00:02:55.959> what<00:02:56.230> this<00:02:56.470> has<00:02:56.709> to<00:02:56.950> do

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
keyboards and now what this has to do

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.350 
keyboards and now what this has to do
and<00:02:57.250> this<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.459> my<00:02:57.579> conclusion<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.299> that

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and this is my conclusion is that

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.050 
and this is my conclusion is that
basically<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.590> actuation<00:03:00.280> point<00:03:00.730> on<00:03:00.910> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
basically the actuation point on the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.699 
basically the actuation point on the
keyboard<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.690> more<00:03:01.959> important<00:03:02.470> than<00:03:02.590> the

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
keyboard is more important than the

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.180 
keyboard is more important than the
actual<00:03:02.890> ps2<00:03:03.760> versus<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.420> usb<00:03:04.870> itself<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:06.010> with

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
actual ps2 versus the usb itself so with

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.000 
actual ps2 versus the usb itself so with
my<00:03:06.340> with<00:03:06.940> my<00:03:07.060> mechanical<00:03:07.209> keyboard<00:03:08.010> the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
my with my mechanical keyboard the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.490 
my with my mechanical keyboard the
actuation<00:03:09.549> point<00:03:09.940> is<00:03:10.030> pretty<00:03:10.209> high<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.230> as<00:03:11.379> I

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
actuation point is pretty high so as I

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.970 
actuation point is pretty high so as I
click<00:03:11.769> the<00:03:11.890> key<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:13.360> actuates<00:03:13.959> faster<00:03:14.829> than

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
click the key it actuates faster than

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.860 
click the key it actuates faster than
the<00:03:15.069> rubber<00:03:15.220> domes<00:03:15.579> do<00:03:15.819> on<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.090> ergonomic<00:03:16.720> and

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
the rubber domes do on the ergonomic and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.620 
the rubber domes do on the ergonomic and
the<00:03:17.290> ergonomic<00:03:17.910> when<00:03:18.910> I<00:03:18.940> press<00:03:19.269> it<00:03:19.299> down

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
the ergonomic when I press it down

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.670 
the ergonomic when I press it down
basically<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:21.760> only<00:03:22.359> actuated<00:03:22.989> when<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
basically it's only actuated when I

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.199 
basically it's only actuated when I
fully<00:03:24.040> press<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.489> down<00:03:24.639> so<00:03:26.880> if<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.000> guys<00:03:28.150> are

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
fully press it down so if you guys are

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.180 
fully press it down so if you guys are
gamers<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.900> will<00:03:29.019> want<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.380> keyboard<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.040> has

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
gamers you will want a keyboard that has
