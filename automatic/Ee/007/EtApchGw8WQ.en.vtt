build<00:00:46.140> for<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> animation<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.640> add<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> smart

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
build for the animation to add a smart

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
build for the animation to add a smart
builder<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:48.960> similar<00:00:49.289> ways<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.530> can<00:00:49.649> do<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
builder very similar ways you can do it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670 
builder very similar ways you can do it
one<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.000> instance<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> insert<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
one for instance is just go to insert a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.010 
one for instance is just go to insert a
smart<00:00:53.370> build<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.300> pick<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> type<00:00:54.870> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
smart build and then pick the type of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.500 
smart build and then pick the type of
smart<00:00:55.230> build<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.890> use<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.910> let's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
smart build you want to use so let's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.229 
smart build you want to use so let's
just<00:00:57.750> use<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.289> Swap<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.370> as<00:00:59.609> an<00:00:59.730> example

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
just use the Swap one as an example

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
just use the Swap one as an example
so<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> brings<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:01.980> inspector<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.609> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
so you brings up the inspector here and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.390 
so you brings up the inspector here and
it<00:01:02.789> shows<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.409> smart<00:01:04.409> build<00:01:04.619> settings<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
it shows you the smart build settings it

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.710 
it shows you the smart build settings it
also<00:01:05.519> brings<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.360> window<00:01:06.689> here

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
also brings up this little window here

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.500 
also brings up this little window here
where<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> add<00:01:07.950> images<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> do<00:01:09.390> it

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
where you can add images you can do it

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.210 
where you can add images you can do it
directly<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.140> media<00:01:10.619> browser<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.100> can

into<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.140> drop<00:01:25.439> zone

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
into this drop zone

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.760 
into this drop zone
it's<00:01:26.220> gonna<00:01:26.340> drag<00:01:26.610> twelve<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> them<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.330> there

it's gonna drag twelve of them in there
and<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.820> close<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.049> I've

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and now I can close that I can see I've

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.920 
and now I can close that I can see I've
got<00:01:31.320> twelve<00:01:31.710> different<00:01:32.009> images<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.700> here<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
got twelve different images in here if I

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.819 
got twelve different images in here if I
were<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.170> play<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.740> now<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.990> would<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
were to play it now I would see one and

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.710 
were to play it now I would see one and
I'd<00:01:38.340> use<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> forward<00:01:38.939> arrow<00:01:39.090> key<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.450> advance

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I'd use the forward arrow key to advance

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.050 
I'd use the forward arrow key to advance
to<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> next<00:01:40.280> now<00:01:41.280> that's<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.579> what<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:42.000> I

to the next now that's not what I want I

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.569 
to the next now that's not what I want I
want<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.329> automatically<00:01:42.930> advance<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.979> with

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
want it to automatically advance so with

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
want it to automatically advance so with
the<00:01:44.909> smart<00:01:45.180> build<00:01:45.360> selected<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.290> here

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the smart build selected as I have here

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.590 
the smart build selected as I have here
I<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> inspector<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> change

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I can use the inspector here to change

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.050 
I can use the inspector here to change
how<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.079> works<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.729> things<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.000> can

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
how it works so one of the things I can

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.830 
how it works so one of the things I can
do<00:01:51.390> for<00:01:51.899> instance<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:53.329> speed<00:01:54.329> things<00:01:54.570> up<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
do for instance is to speed things up a

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.859 
do for instance is to speed things up a
bit<00:01:54.869> let's<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.149> half<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.299> second<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.719> can

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bit let's do it as half a second you can

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.209 
bit let's do it as half a second you can
see<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> preview<00:01:58.439> here<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.950> little<00:01:59.100> bit

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
see the preview here that's a little bit

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.660 
see the preview here that's a little bit
better<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.880> want<00:02:00.259> and<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.040> also

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
better more what I want and I can also

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.819 
better more what I want and I can also
click<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.420> more<00:02:03.659> options<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
click on more options here and get the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
click on more options here and get the
build<00:02:05.070> order<00:02:05.430> now<00:02:06.030> I<00:02:06.090> want<00:02:06.329> them<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.540> build

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
build order now I want them all to build

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.809 
build order now I want them all to build
the<00:02:06.960> same<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.740> instead<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.190> click<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.789> want

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
the same but instead of on click I want

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.660 
the same but instead of on click I want
to<00:02:09.149> automatically<00:02:10.050> have<00:02:10.440> them<00:02:10.649> go<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.400> no

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
to automatically have them go with no

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.430 
to automatically have them go with no
delay<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:12.720> see<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> preview<00:02:13.140> what

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
delay now you can see a preview what

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.089 
delay now you can see a preview what
happened

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
happened

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.039 
happened
so<00:02:15.099> now<00:02:15.220> let<00:02:15.459> me<00:02:15.489> go<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:16.030> try<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.540> out<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:19.049> you

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
so now let me go and try it out and you

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.750 
so now let me go and try it out and you
can<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.349> get<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> very<00:02:20.709> fast<00:02:20.920> animation<00:02:21.640> of

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
can see I get a very fast animation of

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.319 
can see I get a very fast animation of
all<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.540> these<00:02:22.720> photos<00:02:23.879> so<00:02:24.879> now<00:02:25.000> let's<00:02:25.150> try

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
all of these photos so now let's try

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:28.170 
all of these photos so now let's try
some<00:02:25.629> other<00:02:25.870> ones<00:02:26.220> swap<00:02:27.220> probably<00:02:27.610> isn't<00:02:27.879> the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
some other ones swap probably isn't the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.390 
some other ones swap probably isn't the
best<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.689> but<00:02:29.260> something<00:02:29.769> like<00:02:30.040> say<00:02:31.319> shuffle

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
best one but something like say shuffle

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.059 
best one but something like say shuffle
you<00:02:33.400> can<00:02:33.549> see<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.790> preview<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.329> here<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:35.069> an

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
you can see the preview in here is an

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.300 
you can see the preview in here is an
interesting<00:02:36.220> effect<00:02:36.700> but<00:02:37.030> also<00:02:37.230> push<00:02:39.180> and

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
interesting effect but also push and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.770 
interesting effect but also push and
flip<00:02:44.640> would<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:45.849> good<00:02:46.090> one<00:02:46.209> let's<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.599> in

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
flip would be a good one let's go in

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.780 
flip would be a good one let's go in
preview<00:02:47.440> flip<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:50.220> then<00:02:51.220> if<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.489> going<00:02:51.639> too

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
preview flip and then if it's going too

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.599 
preview flip and then if it's going too
fast<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.840> simply<00:02:53.109> go<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.500> slow<00:02:54.220> things

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
fast I can simply go and slow things

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.750 
fast I can simply go and slow things
down<00:02:54.959> by<00:02:55.959> changing<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:56.500> change<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.519> duration

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
down by changing it change the duration

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.759 
down by changing it change the duration
here<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:59.019> this<00:02:59.139> might<00:02:59.319> work<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.530> little<00:02:59.590> bit

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
here so this might work a little bit

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.660 
here so this might work a little bit
better<00:03:01.409> so<00:03:02.409> you<00:03:02.500> can<00:03:02.620> imagine<00:03:02.739> some<00:03:03.099> music<00:03:03.489> and

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
better so you can imagine some music and

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.030 
better so you can imagine some music and
some<00:03:04.269> or<00:03:04.540> maybe<00:03:04.629> some<00:03:04.870> intro<00:03:05.170> audio<00:03:05.500> going

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
some or maybe some intro audio going

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.729 
some or maybe some intro audio going
over<00:03:06.340> at<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.549> beginning<00:03:06.849> of<00:03:07.000> a<00:03:07.120> video<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> once

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
over at the beginning of a video so once

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.289 
over at the beginning of a video so once
you<00:03:08.829> have<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.370> effect<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.939> want<00:03:10.090> it

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
you have the effect that you want it

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.339 
you have the effect that you want it
looks<00:03:10.450> just<00:03:10.540> like<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.840> want<00:03:10.989> when<00:03:11.079> you<00:03:11.170> play

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
looks just like you want when you play

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.580 
looks just like you want when you play
it<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.459> course<00:03:12.489> go<00:03:13.389> ahead<00:03:13.629> and<00:03:13.840> export

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
it you can of course go ahead and export

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:21.809 
it you can of course go ahead and export
it<00:03:14.739> as<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:15.609> video<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.919> go<00:03:21.129> and<00:03:21.519> just

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
it as a video and you can go and just

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.030 
it as a video and you can go and just
use<00:03:22.329> a<00:03:22.359> fixed<00:03:22.720> timing<00:03:23.139> for<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.440> advance<00:03:23.739> so<00:03:23.919> it

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
use a fixed timing for the advance so it

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.539 
use a fixed timing for the advance so it
starts<00:03:24.370> automatically<00:03:24.970> and<00:03:25.949> then<00:03:26.949> use<00:03:27.280> full

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
starts automatically and then use full

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:39.710 
starts automatically and then use full
quality<00:03:27.970> large<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:31.199> export<00:03:32.199> it<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.470> way

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.390 

here<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:40.810> is<00:03:40.870> in<00:03:41.080> the<00:03:41.170> QuickTime<00:03:41.530> Player<00:03:41.740> so

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
here it is in the QuickTime Player so

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.740 
here it is in the QuickTime Player so
there's<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.640> straight<00:03:42.850> video<00:03:43.150> I<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:43.390> take<00:03:43.630> this

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
there's a straight video I can take this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.990 
there's a straight video I can take this
video<00:03:43.960> file<00:03:44.410> now<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:44.890> just<00:03:45.370> drop<00:03:45.580> it<00:03:45.790> into

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000
