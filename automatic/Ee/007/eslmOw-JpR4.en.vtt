00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.080 

there<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.209> go<00:02:19.330> it's<00:02:20.319> installed<00:02:21.000> strong<00:02:22.200> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
there you go it's installed strong the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.039 
there you go it's installed strong the
material<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.450> gonna<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.959> about

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
material is gonna be about

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.680 
material is gonna be about
three-quarters<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.620> an<00:02:26.830> inch<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:28.120> pro<00:02:28.390> and

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
three-quarters of an inch on the pro and

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.080 
three-quarters of an inch on the pro and
I<00:02:29.110> believe<00:02:29.500> it's<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.650> half<00:02:29.830> inch<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.640> star

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
I believe it's a half inch on the star

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.610 
I believe it's a half inch on the star
fire<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.220> it<00:02:33.400> works<00:02:33.730> out<00:02:33.880> really<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:34.620> anyway

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
fire so it works out really good anyway

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.860 
fire so it works out really good anyway
nice<00:02:35.920> strong<00:02:36.280> hold<00:02:36.880> there<00:02:37.150> for<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.450> casters
