00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
is Gaylord right which is perhaps even

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.420

it usually it's a last name though it's

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.379 
it usually it's a last name though it's
not<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.709> first<00:02:45.010> name<00:02:45.219> no<00:02:45.340> no<00:02:45.519> first<00:02:45.819> name<00:02:46.030> yeah
