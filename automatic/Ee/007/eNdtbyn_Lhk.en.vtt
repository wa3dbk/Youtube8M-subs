00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
PC but these are the two options

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
PC but these are the two options
Advanced<00:01:18.479> Options<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:19.290> don't<00:01:19.830> want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> shut

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
Advanced Options I don't want to shut

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.690 
Advanced Options I don't want to shut
down<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:21.259> when<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.549> repeats

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
down so when I do this it just repeats

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.510 
down so when I do this it just repeats
itself<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.170> loop<00:01:25.470> like<00:01:25.920> I'm<00:01:26.070> stuck<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
itself like a loop like I'm stuck in a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.950 
itself like a loop like I'm stuck in a
loop<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.030> no<00:01:27.210> way<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.390> get<00:01:27.600> out<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.869> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
loop and there's no way to get out of it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.859 
loop and there's no way to get out of it
so<00:01:28.409> far<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.829> tried<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:30.150> says<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.810> do

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
so far I tried this it says it's how do

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.929 
so far I tried this it says it's how do
we<00:01:31.049> flush<00:01:31.320> my<00:01:31.500> PC<00:01:31.860> look<00:01:32.070> I'll<00:01:32.549> try<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:32.820> again

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
we flush my PC look I'll try it again

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.359 
we flush my PC look I'll try it again
this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.210> won't<00:01:33.540> ever<00:01:33.750> do<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.829> got<00:01:34.979> our<00:01:35.070> next
