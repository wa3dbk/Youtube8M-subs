 hello friends welcome to my channel today 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.580
 I'm going to teach you how to make chicken type 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.289
 kfc the chicken is crispy what we are going to 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:15.740
 need is cumin garlic ginger milk 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:17.990
 black pepper salt flour to coat or 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.710
 it can be any flour although a lot 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.119
 better is the oil coating flour 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.150
 pieces of chicken that's pretty much for 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.730
 7 pieces milk here I have beaten an egg 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.800
 ok so we also add to the 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 milk egg and flour that I said 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.620
 before 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.910
 As I said before, here we have 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.160
 whipped the milk with the egg 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.160
 then we will add cumin 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.960
 we add garlic too 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.950
 and ginger 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:57.800
 all black pepper spices 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.800
 yes, the salt is to taste 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.870
 the spices 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.870
 everyone 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.960
 and we add the pieces of chicken 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.410
 and that we should let him act act 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 for about two hours so that it 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:23.159
 concentrate or one hour is fine 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.950
 friends as you see I have made several 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.170
 cuts the chicken with the knife so that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049
 the taste is impregnated I have worked in 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.200
 the one that exists but not as you have seen 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.720
 they do not have cuts or anything but to me 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.610
 I like that the bone flavor has more flavor 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.040
 the chicken so I 'm happy to 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.110
 your 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.060
 the fryer we have put to heat 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.980
 in average temperature for the chicken 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.080
 the first thing is to do it 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.190
 The first thing we are going to do is 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.190
 Flour it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.170
 all the pieces 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 when we have finished flouring 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.450
 we return to do the same procedure 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.940
 we wet it with milk and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.620
 we do not imagine again that's why it's the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.260
 so crispy chicken 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.350
 is a thick layer and hence when 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.360
 be tied to the fryer 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.360
 and so on with everything 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.340
 I'm going to teach you a trick so that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.660
 flour is peeled off the chicken 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.310
 we should squeeze it and so the flour will 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.260
 is left or is going to stay the chicken more 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.370
 Crunchy because it sticks a lot to the chicken 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.240
 you see 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.240
 wears a thicker layer 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.629
 friends the cooking time has been 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.109
 about 15 minutes and I at the plate 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:58.090
 decorated like this and you companies 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.640
 with what you want, I do not expect you 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.530
 I liked my recipe and you know how to give it 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.010
 the and subscribe we see you until the 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.010
