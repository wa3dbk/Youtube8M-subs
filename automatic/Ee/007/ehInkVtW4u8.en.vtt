00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the record yeah that's basically it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.229 
the record yeah that's basically it
crazy<00:02:38.250> handles<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.340> be<00:02:39.489> interested<00:02:40.000> in<00:02:40.060> some

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
crazy handles that be interested in some

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.860 
crazy handles that be interested in some
detail<00:02:40.750> well<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:42.040> 5x5<00:02:42.280> area<00:02:43.209> we<00:02:43.569> got<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
detail well the 5x5 area we got the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.289 
detail well the 5x5 area we got the
stream<00:02:44.110> coming<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.620> from<00:02:44.890> here<00:02:45.160> mobs<00:02:46.060> are

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
stream coming in from here mobs are

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.479 
stream coming in from here mobs are
divided<00:02:46.750> evenly<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.380> both<00:02:47.590> sides<00:02:47.950> because<00:02:48.280> of

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
divided evenly to both sides because of

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.880 
divided evenly to both sides because of
the<00:02:48.760> configuration<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.900> symmetrical

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
the configuration and this symmetrical

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.300 
the configuration and this symmetrical
design<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.610> area<00:02:52.860> we're<00:02:55.530> on<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.769> here<00:02:57.099> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
design of the area we're on to here it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.360 
design of the area we're on to here it's
2<00:02:57.849> blocks<00:02:58.269> high<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:59.470> then<00:02:59.799> we<00:02:59.860> get<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.130> three

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
2 blocks high and then we get the three

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.160 
2 blocks high and then we get the three
block<00:03:00.640> area<00:03:00.849> where<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.329> mobs<00:03:01.540> can<00:03:01.750> start<00:03:02.019> to

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
block area where the mobs can start to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.849 
block area where the mobs can start to
jump<00:03:02.790> mmm<00:03:03.850> still<00:03:04.630> pushed<00:03:04.959> to<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.500> side<00:03:05.829> so

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
jump mmm still pushed to that side so

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.879 
jump mmm still pushed to that side so
they're<00:03:06.370> always<00:03:06.519> in<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:07.030> area<00:03:07.450> I<00:03:07.690> mean<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> can

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
they're always in that area I mean I can

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.580 
they're always in that area I mean I can
control<00:03:09.250> them<00:03:09.400> pretty<00:03:09.700> easily

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
control them pretty easily

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.080 
control them pretty easily
okay<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:13.799> back<00:03:14.799> there<00:03:15.069> you<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.400> see<00:03:15.549> my<00:03:15.579> squid

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
okay back to the killing chamber as you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.300 
okay back to the killing chamber as you
can<00:03:34.810> see<00:03:34.989> those<00:03:35.260> suspend<00:03:35.799> the<00:03:35.889> blocks<00:03:36.130> are

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
can see those suspend the blocks are

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.949 
can see those suspend the blocks are
implemented<00:03:36.940> with<00:03:37.239> arrows<00:03:37.989> in<00:03:38.019> there<00:03:39.959> neat

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959

implemented with arrows in there neat
little<00:03:41.139> trick<00:03:41.410> to<00:03:41.680> get<00:03:42.660> buttons<00:03:43.660> directly

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
little trick to get buttons directly

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.440 
little trick to get buttons directly
onto<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:45.040> dispenser<00:03:45.639> block<00:03:45.910> if<00:03:46.150> you<00:03:46.269> wanna

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
onto the dispenser block if you wanna

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.870 
onto the dispenser block if you wanna
know<00:03:46.599> how<00:03:46.750> that<00:03:46.959> works<00:03:47.349> I<00:03:47.709> could<00:03:47.920> explain<00:03:48.700> that

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
know how that works I could explain that

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.339 
know how that works I could explain that
even<00:03:48.940> in<00:03:49.450> another<00:03:49.599> video<00:03:50.019> just<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:51.670> know

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
even in another video just you know

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.020 
even in another video just you know
maybe<00:03:53.349> it's<00:03:53.560> no<00:03:53.709> trick<00:03:54.040> anybody<00:03:54.489> knows<00:03:54.700> so

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
maybe it's no trick anybody knows so

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.190 
maybe it's no trick anybody knows so
then<00:03:55.660> it's<00:03:55.840> okay<00:03:56.139> okay<00:03:56.410> anyway<00:03:57.329> yeah<00:03:58.329> you<00:03:59.079> know

then it's okay okay anyway yeah you know
here<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.650> a<00:03:59.680> little<00:04:00.419> thing<00:04:01.620> most<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:02.829> times

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
here is a little thing most of the times

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.849 
here is a little thing most of the times
records<00:04:03.609> do<00:04:03.910> drop<00:04:04.209> here<00:04:04.510> and<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:05.019> can<00:04:05.530> pick<00:04:05.709> them

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
records do drop here and I can pick them

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.770 
records do drop here and I can pick them
up<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.400> corner

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
up to the corner

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.880 
up to the corner
so<00:04:10.240> that's<00:04:11.240> my<00:04:11.600> version<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:12.350> the<00:04:12.530> record

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
so that's my version of the record

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.840 
so that's my version of the record
producing<00:04:13.550> experimental<00:04:14.360> area<00:04:14.750> little

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
producing experimental area little

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.530 
producing experimental area little
maintenance<00:04:16.850> door<00:04:17.480> to<00:04:18.350> get<00:04:18.470> in<00:04:18.620> there<00:04:19.540> yeah

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
maintenance door to get in there yeah

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:23.530 
maintenance door to get in there yeah
it's<00:04:21.350> basically<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:22.060> let<00:04:23.060> me<00:04:23.090> know<00:04:23.270> what<00:04:23.420> you

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
it's basically it let me know what you

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.490 
it's basically it let me know what you
think<00:04:23.720> of<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.500> I<00:04:25.390> think<00:04:26.390> the<00:04:26.540> advantages<00:04:27.290> are

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
think of it I think the advantages are

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:33.310 
think of it I think the advantages are
that's<00:04:27.710> a<00:04:28.180> pretty<00:04:29.180> compact<00:04:29.660> design<00:04:31.240> easy<00:04:32.320> to

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
that's a pretty compact design easy to

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.700 
that's a pretty compact design easy to
reproduce<00:04:35.500> probably<00:04:37.510> more<00:04:38.510> doable<00:04:38.990> or<00:04:39.350> easy

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
reproduce probably more doable or easy

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.800 
reproduce probably more doable or easy
to<00:04:39.890> do<00:04:40.190> for<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> lot<00:04:40.790> of<00:04:40.910> guys<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:41.420> don't

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
to do for a lot of guys but don't

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.130 
to do for a lot of guys but don't
underestimate<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:44.480> get<00:04:44.660> to<00:04:44.750> have<00:04:44.930> some

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:45.140 
underestimate it you get to have some

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.570 
underestimate it you get to have some
experience<00:04:45.620> with<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.860> water<00:04:46.040> floats<00:04:46.370> and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
experience with the water floats and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.650 
experience with the water floats and
stuff<00:04:46.790> but<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.390> think<00:04:48.200> you'll<00:04:48.560> figure<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:48.860> out

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
stuff but I think you'll figure it out

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.510 
stuff but I think you'll figure it out
alright<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.080> I'm<00:04:51.950> out

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
alright so I'm out

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.500 
alright so I'm out
