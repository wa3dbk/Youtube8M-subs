00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi to all the boys and well found 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.450
 on a channel that as usual I am 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.890
 tied up 90 and today I'm here with you for 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.269
 talk to you again about watch the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.480
 rocks the hot game of this period 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.040
 our case is too sad that sio 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.440
 I actually know very sad but 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.000
 today unfortunately I'm not here to talk about it 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.859
 so good but I'm here to put in 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.449
 light in emphasis a bit we can look 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.939
 define somehow sad of 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 video game that surely many of you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 they will have noticed if in any way 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.269
 the image was fixed in the mind 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.579
 of the three 2013 so now they will go to 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.079
 see an excuse while 2012 go to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.739
 see together a comparison that has been 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.750
 made between the game presented at e3 del 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.920
 2012 the game that came out now in the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 2014 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.410
 the images you see first not 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.020
 I made them I care about 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 I could have emphasized it but unfortunately 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.289
 some problems from time to time 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.430
 wi fi leave the game so these 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.510
 images were taken by another 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.860
 channel you find below in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.289
 description here that is right in fact 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.969
 leave under any reference why 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.829
 these images have been created 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.649
 actually I want from me immediately 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.080
 then note the images on the left 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.510
 workshops as we have been presented 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.150
 and of watchdog as indeed e 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.150
 we immediately see a difference really 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.130
 to repeat I must say now is not there 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 so much is here to analyze the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.580
 images 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.250
 I want you to see them and see 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.900
 by yourself the aspects that you go to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.500
 differentiate in the two versions we notice 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.920
 definitely a graphic downgrade 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.509
 monstrous so why this is here 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 the answers are 70 people is 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.869
 unfortunately I cannot give you an answer 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.520
 just as usual I'm here maybe a 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.700
 to express the conjectures of the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.920
 opinions maybe trying to go to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 explain all this for sure one 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.340
 possible reasons could be 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.659
 the consoles is now hearing and today the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.920
 site made to say fly comes heart with for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.390
 the balls don't wait a moment in the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.950
 sense that saw that this game is 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.200
 been distributed for all 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 platforms then also playstation 3 e 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.409
 xbox 60 maybe these consoles that 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.390
 are now called diogenes have 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.920
 put some poles that they didn't allow 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 to the developers actually of 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 create the game they showed us 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.189
 but I don't think this is true 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.069
 reason maybe the real reason what is the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.420
 the fact that today we tend to achieve a 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.140
 game that sells that sells the most 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.819
 possible 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.560
 maybe not even finished not 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.020
 the important thing is that the game comes out e 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.790
 that sells and maybe they neglect and 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.560
 those aspects that the graphic can be 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.790
 be defined secondary but seeing 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.930
 I don't think these images are 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.819
 secondary because on the other side 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
 we have a game 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.209
 on the other hand we have another and I have to 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.590
 say that I think you all in this 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.690
 moment you are glued to watch that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.300
 what the pictures you know what a show but 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.280
 now it's just the beginning of this 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.690
 video wait when actually there 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.100
 will be the explosions when there will be 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.440
 shootings when there are accidents 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.480
 that we will soon see what the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.970
 the real problem is the mentality of the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.470
 companies of today that are not made 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.560
 scruples in publishing a video game 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.820
 that we all know doc voices is not finished 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.920
 it really has so many aspects going 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.600
 finished and must be called a fucking free 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.640
 roaming I want to do everything in this case 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.930
 of free ong in a while I can especially 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.269
 have fun like crazy on mine 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.410
 mobile phone cannot browse the web 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.019
 however I can do a lot of things 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.320
 however , many others are missing for a free 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.470
 on 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.200
 now look at this scene here a 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.510
 left now will be simulated created a 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.980
 accident and on the right logically but 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.079
 also on the right but look at that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.280
 epochal difference we have on 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.230
 left Sinista we really 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.989
 an accident really many children 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.970
 machines that are going to collide it 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.100
 let's see together they go 90 ahead 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.480
 nothing here is as you know it is 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:32.940
 possible to go and interfere with the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.480
 traffic light system look here ok yes 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.450
 intervenes 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.900
 you change you put bird and on all 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.489
 lines look to the left of course 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.440
 spectacular among other things my myth 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.000
 only a car to collide on 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.260
 left desktop what happens a 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.640
 passerby rushes in to ask how they are 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 the motorist drops what grapes to see 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.329
 the others are complaining about being played on 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.829
 dickhead, nothing happened 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.150
 on success a fortune teller demo 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.650
 you meet with the sun inside and smith 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.299
 nothing happens on the left one 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.790
 shooting the actual effect of 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.530
 spectacular but look at the lightning of the 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.620
 our gun on the right looks like that 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.420
 enemies that I tell you wow 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.950
 his is in the fantastic game that 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.260
 now those are probably like 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.270
 maybe it often happens setup as 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.709
 I know the trick shooter no queues all a 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.930
 place is plugged maybe he already has it ready 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.639
 done so for a fuck but that 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.620
 difference and see the exclusion here 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:25.140
 look here now cap that will explode 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.280
 the gas pump if not 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.350
 look at the explosion on the left 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.950
 you saw on the right but what the hell 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.930
 it was really ok now 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.270
 reiterate is not the graphics that makes a 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.220
 I play the shit rock when there is a 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.180
 so important difference from one 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.320
 version to the other well yes maybe maybe the 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.660
 there is difference but above all the 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.550
 problem that I now come here to 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.630
 discuss with you and next with the 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.470
 conclusion of the images that now 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.120
 go to the point to finish the fact that has 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.460
 said and did not show me a game e 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.050
 at three we were all stunned by 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.510
 this game everyone said oh god 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.710
 when this video game will be released when 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.510
 this watch dog will be released because it is 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.520
 really fantastic 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.460
 you have seen that we were all exalted 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:13.090
 then we are now with a game that 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.220
 does not reflect our expectations and 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.720
 our high expectations we had 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.460
 on this video game and actually 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.080
 it is not a game they had shown us and 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.700
 then in quotes we can have in 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.200
 false advertising of the type if and how 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.240
 when you go 6 cup you and 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.560
 fantastic whitening toothpaste then you 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.300
 find yourself in america would not work 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.610
 just for example the camp of the caper 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.870
 but to tell us we were shown a 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.790
 really great game and then there is 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.890
 was already given a game he had 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.680
 still need time and personally 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.510
 give him time at this time a 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.670
 finish a video game not because much 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.200
 so we are not stupid god when there 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.630
 we find in our hands that we have fun 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:48.250
 but of course we say the uncle camper o 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.800
 something more we could do it 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.930
 you could end up like boh I don't know 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.730
 I'm really sorry, and I'm so sorry 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.230
 I definitely play the big game 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:59.350
 expectations that have already been a while 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.900
 I'm going to have fun, I 'll play a lot 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.710
 because anyway there is a way to play and 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.990
 have fun 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.150
 but with the knowledge that this 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.720
 game could give so much this game is 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:12.700
 was presented perhaps as the anti-gta 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.770
 Well we are honest with GTA has not 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.670
 he can't even clean them either 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.280
 shoes I'm playing 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:20.380
 I'm not a digital lover I'm not 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.030
 never ex-hardcore fan, that is, there is something else 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.720
 I normally play though if I start 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.990
 comparison 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.190
 there is so much room to do this there is so much 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.480
 way to go for watchdog for 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.940
 reach certain levels 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.120
 I believe it can be done but how it can 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.530
 be made to excuse the folk states 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.410
 I was thinking that to close it does the 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.290
 rockstar took time and Chinese from 4 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:44.620
 then years develop the other game when 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:46.810
 they are ready but they let it out 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.850
 that's how you why you should not 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.680
 to do so well that's all for it 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.660
 video what do you think guys like what 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.260
 actually they are two different games there 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.840
 you have seen 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.940
 let me know here a little bit also i 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.380
 your thoughts about it as at
