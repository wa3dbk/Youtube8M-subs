00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.919
 unfortunately last part of the series regional 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.030
 kitchen with large kahle home cooking 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 tradition 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.750
 I will make an Old Berlin recipe today 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.690
 imagine 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.580
 I'll want to meat with berliner 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
 Cooking parsley potatoes 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.320
 I will have a mini flitzer watt 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.720
 and a little beetroot salad 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.039
 I would have the consequences for you today 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.599
 make lamb meat I'm up for it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.189
 a leg of lamb brought half a 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.210
 that's about here 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.500
 one and a half kilo 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.450
 maybe now I will 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.500
 that means that's just weeks ago 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 parry cut out and in 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.890
 bite- sized pieces so about nicolas in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 to size 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.149
 then I have the back of the two yes 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.320
 is the berliner designation the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:52.559
 primeval name for the 2 in the reason 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.969
 give meat with her age and how 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.280
 Take care too much with rankommt 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 a therapy in this case nonetheless 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.230
 not garlic and a bit 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.090
 butter lard already on marks for that 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.280
 right after yes then comes one more 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.479
 bit of science with this and the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.790
 potatoes will be added later 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.439
 a little bit happy with her 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.350
 I still submit to it 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.450
 aircraft field salad with a little red 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.189
 I pray that maybe now 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.890
 First of all, would prepare the bone 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.570
 trigger flesh parry and drafts 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.310
 So I have the meat now 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.509
 bite-sized pieces cut 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 yes that's about the size of the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.619
 sliced ​​onions sliced 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.049
 so these are just like onions like 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.579
 meat of certain and the whole go 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.500
 I now in two portions so only 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.329
 times the wrong two portions one 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.430
 right big pot there I go now 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.470
 just part of the butter fat with 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.509
 buy and then I need that in two 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.369
 Portions take it out again and give 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.939
 then clean the onions and fry the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.070
 then on 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.049
 then comes yet my lamp for use 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.880
 that is here we are 800 milliliters 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.640
 if you do not have one you can too 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 But if possible take a bio 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 beer without preservatives without 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.140
 flavor enhancer and without events 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.720
 going 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.840
 so I'm going to sit in the village now and 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.340
 we had the butter to admit what 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.390
 get really hot what you can then 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 is the pure meat 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:28.080
 in the same color accepted with 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.450
 hoping for a foam spoon on stable 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:37.850
 rockenberg who can do very well 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:46.950
 now use the same again 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:54.000
 portions and so can the 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:57.770
 garlic already on it too 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.770
 I have that in your relationships 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:08.970
 Let's guess a bit 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.180
 come color 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.540
 then a current can play the 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.540
 meat 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:33.730
 why give that to me today too 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.310
 a normal always short before me 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:49.090
 have taken out 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:50.760
 but normal if you replace with the 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.640
 can 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.640
 the whole thing was warmed a bit now 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.280
 Add to that and sensitive in the shop 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.290
 gives 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.970
 you could have it now too 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.430
 also just before I have that poured 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.379
 Add one tablespoon of flour to the rolls 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.390
 were able and would therefore be 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.190
 already provided that afterwards also the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.090
 bond with it and then I give too 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.970
 right now crumble it to who that 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.250
 once again through this is again once 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.639
 boil briefly if then the bow and 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.050
 Then the sky in the country can simmer 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.200
 also the money western meat or 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:36.900
 was the meat again then then 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:39.789
 It can be really nice and dress and 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.130
 then get really nice and tender 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:44.950
 I'll leave that one for now 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.449
 one hour to one and a half you always have to 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.360
 let's lose like the quality of 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.620
 meat is whether she is beautiful nice if it 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.889
 were still a bit too firm 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.740
 currently one hour to one and a half 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.430
 All the time I spend now 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380
 small flame 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.250
 Of course, now comes the lid 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.129
 on it the want and the meat and the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.889
 Caraway and 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.909
 only if now about an hour before 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.559
 to simmer 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.029
 that looks very good too 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:13.099
 meanwhile, the onions are also 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:14.989
 quite cooked that gives it all 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:16.639
 a certain similarity must be there 

00:05:14.989 --> 00:05:17.360
 not necessarily something with me now 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.189
 work 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.249
 then when you absolutely want is a 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.349
 gain occurs can be continent to 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.209
 conclusion also in manners the 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.219
 potato starch offer 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.599
 that will simmer for another 20 minutes 

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.699
 In the meantime I have already 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:34.219
 times the potatoes are exposed 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:35.479
 so be ready and about 20 minutes 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:37.639
 then it can actually continue 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.669
 be served on about one and a half 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:44.149
 hours then everything is ready 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:47.240
 I have it easy to set up 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:52.879
 this flight salad and a few red prayers 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.979
 made slices because you also need 

00:05:52.879 --> 00:06:00.379
 not so much and then we are 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:02.149
 now it could mean that 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.339
 simply boiled potatoes need the 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:07.249
 will be back in a while 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:13.610
 played butter and then comes 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:18.079
 parsley of it now very good 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:22.089
 eat and then come now and that 

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:22.089
 meat and want 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:31.369
 and that's how it looks 

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:33.349
 can be served so jumps 

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:35.599
 the now enjoy once again 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.579
 This time it is with lamb in the 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.849
 Original recipe makes you actually 

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:43.009
 with hammel or with goat meat it 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:45.520
 not so easy to get and i have 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:47.050
 I'm wrong to put it right 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.240
 so now i hope that's a bit of fun 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.000
 I also hope that the others 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.830
 great recipes are well received who 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.539
 she has not seen it yet 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.120
 be sure to stay tuned 

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:00.909
 I'll show now I was there 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.509
 and what great recipes are presented 

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:03.370
 were 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:05.770
 Anyway, I wish a good one 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.509
 appetite have fun with eventual 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.139
 cook and maybe until 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:10.139
 next time
