00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
I like the polished look a lot with the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.380 
I like the polished look a lot with the
black<00:02:58.690> spokes<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:03.400> what<00:03:03.730> else<00:03:03.910> has<00:03:04.209> like<00:03:04.359> a

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
black spokes know what else has like a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.690 
black spokes know what else has like a
bullet<00:03:04.780> shifter<00:03:05.320> that's<00:03:05.680> stock<00:03:06.519> as<00:03:06.730> well

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.770 

that's<00:03:11.540> pretty<00:03:12.290> much<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:13.480> don't<00:03:14.480> really<00:03:14.569> need

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
that's pretty much it don't really need

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.630 
that's pretty much it don't really need
to<00:03:14.900> do<00:03:15.020> much<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.380> these<00:03:15.530> bikes<00:03:18.400> they<00:03:19.400> come

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
to do much to these bikes they come

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.089 
to do much to these bikes they come
pretty<00:03:20.420> dialed<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.349> pretty<00:03:21.590> light<00:03:21.860> and

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
pretty dialed and pretty light and

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.380 
pretty dialed and pretty light and
pretty<00:03:22.250> fast<00:03:22.690> this<00:03:23.690> bike<00:03:23.959> has<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.530> think<00:03:25.250> 51<00:03:26.239> or

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
pretty fast this bike has I think 51 or

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.340 
pretty fast this bike has I think 51 or
53<00:03:26.900> horsepower<00:03:27.410> my<00:03:27.650> old<00:03:27.910> 450<00:03:28.910> head<00:03:29.120> I<00:03:29.330> think<00:03:29.780> 53

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
53 horsepower my old 450 head I think 53

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.470 
53 horsepower my old 450 head I think 53
horsepower<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.160> it's<00:03:31.850> right<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.180> par<00:03:32.420> with

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
horsepower so it's right on par with

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.080 
horsepower so it's right on par with
that<00:03:32.750> but<00:03:33.050> obviously<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.280> power<00:03:34.489> bands<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.940> lot

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
that but obviously the power bands a lot

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:40.000 
that but obviously the power bands a lot
different<00:03:37.600> but<00:03:38.600> it<00:03:38.690> does<00:03:38.840> rip<00:03:39.110> and<00:03:39.530> it's<00:03:39.709> super

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
different but it does rip and it's super

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.320 
different but it does rip and it's super
fun<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.250> ride<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:42.530> model<00:03:42.890> has<00:03:43.069> the<00:03:43.310> linkage<00:03:44.000> I

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
fun to ride this model has the linkage I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.380 
fun to ride this model has the linkage I
think<00:03:44.630> they<00:03:44.720> started<00:03:45.050> doing<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.440> 2012

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
think they started doing that in 2012

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.750 
think they started doing that in 2012
and<00:03:47.390> this<00:03:47.569> also<00:03:47.840> has<00:03:48.200> in<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.769> clutch<00:03:49.100> it's<00:03:49.519> a

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
and this also has in the clutch it's a

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.610 
and this also has in the clutch it's a
Belleville<00:03:50.269> washer<00:03:50.750> so<00:03:50.959> it's<00:03:51.110> not<00:03:51.230> six

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
Belleville washer so it's not six

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.220 
Belleville washer so it's not six
Springs<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.280> just<00:03:52.610> one<00:03:53.510> washer<00:03:54.400> instead<00:03:55.400> of

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
Springs it's just one washer instead of

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:02.490 
Springs it's just one washer instead of
six<00:03:57.230> Springs

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:10.910 

this<00:04:03.500> also<00:04:03.769> has<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.400> V<00:04:04.850> force<00:04:05.209> for<00:04:06.100> reeds

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.590 

right<00:04:11.920> down<00:04:12.129> there

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.950 

I<00:04:20.450> think<00:04:21.450> that's<00:04:21.690> about<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.870> know

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
I think that's about it and you know

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.490 
I think that's about it and you know
what<00:04:25.080> you<00:04:25.140> guys<00:04:25.260> think<00:04:26.570> 2013<00:04:27.570> KTM<00:04:28.470> 250<00:04:28.920> SX
