00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
from my favorite band and didn't think

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
from my favorite band and didn't think
anyone<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.829> pay<00:00:35.160> attention<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.610> him

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
anyone to really pay attention to him

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.160 
anyone to really pay attention to him
but<00:00:35.940> I<00:00:35.969> got<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.149> lot<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.660> positive

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
but I got a lot of really positive

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.860 
but I got a lot of really positive
feedback<00:00:37.320> from<00:00:37.890> readers<00:00:38.309> who<00:00:38.760> would<00:00:39.570> go<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
feedback from readers who would go and

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200 
feedback from readers who would go and
look<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> music<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.700> when<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> got<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
look up the music and so when I got the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
look up the music and so when I got the
idea<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.629> maybe<00:00:42.809> some<00:00:43.079> day<00:00:43.340> I<00:00:44.340> wanted<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
idea for maybe some day I wanted to

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.330 
idea for maybe some day I wanted to
actually<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> step<00:00:45.690> further<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.340> have

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
actually take it a step further and have

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.369 
actually take it a step further and have
the<00:00:47.789> characters<00:00:48.480> actually<00:00:48.899> create<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the characters actually create the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
the characters actually create the
lyrics<00:00:49.680> instead<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.219> using<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> know

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
lyrics instead of using you know

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.150 
lyrics instead of using you know
something<00:00:52.289> from<00:00:52.410> an<00:00:52.500> established<00:00:53.010> artist

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
write can like be put together with a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.760 
write can like be put together with a
story<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.340> combined<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.530> give<00:01:16.530> someone

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
story and all combined to give someone

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.999 
story and all combined to give someone
who's<00:01:16.979> reading<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> better<00:01:18.500> experience<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
who's reading it a better experience and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.700 
who's reading it a better experience and
I<00:01:20.850> think<00:01:20.880> my<00:01:21.240> favorite<00:01:21.540> part<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.320> is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
I think my favorite part about it is

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.660 
I think my favorite part about it is
just<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> whole<00:01:24.270> concept<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.670> like

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just kind of the whole concept of like

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
just kind of the whole concept of like
how<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.970> music<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.170> fit<00:01:28.409> into<00:01:28.560> this

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
how the music is going to fit into this

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.760 
how the music is going to fit into this
and<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.250> almost<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.140> like<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> parallel

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and it's almost like a like a parallel

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.990 
and it's almost like a like a parallel
the<00:01:31.920> whole<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:32.579> like<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:34.430> giant<00:01:35.430> analogy

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the whole time or like a giant analogy

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.580 
the whole time or like a giant analogy
almost<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.630> characters<00:01:37.140> because

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
almost for the characters because

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
almost for the characters because
they're<00:01:37.619> using<00:01:38.220> these<00:01:38.340> songs<00:01:38.670> communicate

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
they're using these songs communicate

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.940 
they're using these songs communicate
almost<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.409> they're<00:01:40.530> writing<00:01:40.740> them

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
almost when they're writing them

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.889 
almost when they're writing them
together<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.850> fact<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> they<00:01:42.420> can

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
together the fact that they can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.859 
together the fact that they can
communicate<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:44.000> express<00:01:45.000> emotions<00:01:45.750> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
communicate and express emotions that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.990 
communicate and express emotions that
they<00:01:46.049> couldn't<00:01:48.799> face-to-face<00:01:49.799> through<00:01:50.729> songs

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
they couldn't face-to-face through songs

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.880 
they couldn't face-to-face through songs
I<00:01:51.420> guess<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.899> probably<00:01:52.439> my<00:01:52.560> favorite<00:01:52.860> part

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
I guess is probably my favorite part

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
I guess is probably my favorite part
about<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.399> whole<00:01:53.460> concept<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.240> then<00:01:54.810> being

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
about the whole concept and then being

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
about the whole concept and then being
able<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> part<00:01:55.890> of<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.509> help<00:01:57.509> those

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
able to be a part of that and help those

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
able to be a part of that and help those
emotions<00:01:58.259> get<00:01:58.469> through<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
emotions get through just like the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.310 
emotions get through just like the
coolest<00:01:59.490> thing<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.090> me

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.440 

so<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.070> lyrics<00:02:07.400> have<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.580> lot<00:02:07.820> of<00:02:07.850> meaning<00:02:08.090> the

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
so the lyrics have a lot of meaning the

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.630 
so the lyrics have a lot of meaning the
