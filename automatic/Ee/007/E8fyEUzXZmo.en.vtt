00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.510

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 Today's video is another way for the day 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.099
 10 years and with you were asking 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.070
 both decided to bring here in this 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.810
 video the mold skateboard for gta san andreas 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.850
 was a way that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.519
 work to find one that will work 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.080
 really the ones I found the first 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.779
 which I found were not working 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.660
 as it should and this was the only one 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 It works fine, that mold was 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.239
 made on the basis of this bike from gta san 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.670
 Andreas then with you will see in the video 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.879
 I think it will give notice to you in 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.090
 video is shaded and a sound is also 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.820
 of the g10 year bicycle is then he 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.230
 replaces the bike in a way 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.390
 whose 10 years 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
 fashion is very well done obviously has 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 some mistakes some things like 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 Imagine nothing magic is nothing that goes 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.489
 be so excited that you do not 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 Can play and is very worth it. 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.080
 install for those who like the type of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.479
 property as well and as always make a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 copy of the original gta san files 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.000
 Andreas 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.619
 never forget to do this São Paulo 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.430
 across the video but it does not cost anything 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.680
 repeat 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 make a copy of the files before 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.960
 because if any 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.479
