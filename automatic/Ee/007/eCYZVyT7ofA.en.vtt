00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.250
 hello everyone today I bring a manicure with 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.119
 a little bit of color and as always a 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:19.360
 detail in the east of 2 I will explain 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:21.330
 a little bit because I always do the 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.289
 things on this finger 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 we usually use these three fingers 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.470
 while this one and this one is more than 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.200
 this 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.910
 we do not use them so much if we want 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.500
 take something we take it more or less with 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.640
 these three fingers but this one does not 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.000
 we use both then 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.250
 spend less enamel or you 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.520
 we touch less the nail with the objects that 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:53.780
 take and we part less well 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.100
 in this hand I have this design 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.680
 that is about 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.289
 paint the girls one color less is 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.000
 that we paint it another color and we do 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.549
 little dots but without being precise 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.250
 more condensed dots in the part of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.180
 above and less condensed in the part 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.630
 below is worth this color in particular is 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.399
 one of kiko 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.750
 I have this painting because I 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:22.490
 I gave away a friend not because I 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.640
 will buy why I am unable to spend 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.640
 the money 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.509
 paintings the truth although we are very 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.970
 faces but I do not usually buy paintings 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.600
 faces 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.310
 the color is not well appreciated and it is not red 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.640
 although it looks like it on camera it is not red 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.470
 that's why I'm going to take a red so that more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.880
 or less, I tried to get the color out 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.120
 I'm going to put the flash so it looks 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.180
 well and I'm going to teach it 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:52.210
 it's like 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.740
 a garnet fuchsia 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.970
 but well this is the color I 've 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.540
 used simply 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.990
 and what we will need for this 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:05.220
 Manicure is going to be the color we want 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.759
 to paint our nails 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:13.080
 the other necessary color that I took the 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.200
 white for the detail nail a 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.000
 stick or two chopsticks and at the same time I 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.520
 this hand I am also going to make another 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.690
 design so that is not for us 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.190
 uploading 47 videos for one thing I'm going to 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.180
 take my basic painting the beige and 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.390
 then I will take salt 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 I'm going to take salt for this nail 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.489
 an effect like ice like frost 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.290
 so we do not paint our nails and 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.599
 here I started without wanting because I had 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.450
 forgotten the video and we can do 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:53.190
 the little dots simply nothing I do not 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.690
 I am using neither 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.350
 and on base to take the paint 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:02.760
 I'm just unzipped it off well 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.760
 the paint of the brush 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.980
 and I'm sticking the toothpick 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.490
 because we are going to be taking plates of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.130
 plastic or pieces of magazines to make 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.480
 this seems to me and I get tired sometimes 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.480
 then we do nothing 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.590
 dots 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.569
 condensed 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.569
 especially on the top 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.370
 give that effect 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:39.060
 as you see, I'm not 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.970
 I'm not being precise or anything, I'm 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.170
 making points where where square 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.140
 basically 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.580
 we always think that the top part 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.560
 it has to have more dots 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.420
 that the bottom part and as you 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.090
 let's go down 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.989
 we take off the dots a little 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.989
 so 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:09.090
 and even I 'm not even 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.060
 filling the entire nail but for more or 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.720
 less me 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.840
 it seems to me 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.519
 so that it is not so equal so that 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.090
 it seems that we have stuck here a 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.090
 good time and 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.720
 and it goes quite worked simply 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.720
 nothing dots 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.570
 well then 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.949
 I have to say that we have to wait well 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:42.430
 to dry the enamel if we want 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.730
 apply a shine 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.100
 because because normally painting 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.230
 be put in dots because it 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.180
 condenses all the enamel there and does not 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:53.620
 dry well at all then nothing is there 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.590
 wait 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.400
 and now I'm going to teach the other kind of 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:04.150
 design that I will make cojemos 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:08.229
 I'm going to put the camera action we take the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.850
 enamel we put it on the nail and 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.400
 we put a good amount so that the 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.410
 salt cp this can also be done with 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.820
 glue I personally prefer not 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.759
 do it with glue because it stays 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:22.590
 very close to the nail and is more aggressive 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.590
 then nothing we take the the mante 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:30.050
 they pass it through the nail 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:34.860
 that stays well 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:38.840
 soaked and then 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.840
 we put sugar, say salt 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:48.000
 we can with the salt that over tighten a 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.670
 little bit alone 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.050
 because we always have a lot of enamel 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.050
 what it does is get out 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.320
 Flattens and comes out on the sides of the nail 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.369
 and we shake the nail 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.220
 good 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.470
 now after this only remains 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.430
 and correct a couple of failures if they want 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:15.430
 also with a toothpick 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.400
 this 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.400
 we do it this way 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.189
 and this is the effect that I'm going to leave 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:36.700
 also the flash to see if it is appreciated 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:40.500
 all right 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.500
 I do not know if the truth will be appreciated 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.820
 well there is this nothing simply to 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:50.410
 I have remained hollow but 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.200
 because I'm not doing it with much 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.330
 precision the truth and nothing we take salt 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.950
 of what we have left and we do what 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.670
 same 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:04.120
 We pressed a little retired and ready 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.590
 it seems original to me because as we are 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:08.380
 in winter it has an effect like 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.820
 ice like frost and it seems very 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.350
 beautiful can be done in all 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.810
 nail 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.450
 and well, nothing that 's enough 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.270
 simple can be done with salt or with 

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.340
 sugar I took the salt because I have a 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.920
 easier container to pour it which is 

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.620
 this 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.870
 and nothing if we want after leaving it 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:32.880
 dry because you have to let it dry very 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:36.150
 well so we're not going to be that so 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.680
 wet below and the salt coming out 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.270
 outwards, when we touch 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.370
 we take everything then we have to leave it 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.050
 dry very well and if we want after 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.300
 this we can put a shine capita 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.540
 the only thing that makes the capita of brightness is 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.370
 remove that little bit of that effect from 

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.529
 relief but it is just as nice 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:54.679
 as well 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:57.270
 Well nothing this is the design I hope that 

00:07:54.679 --> 00:08:00.120
 you liked me I have spotted everything 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:03.620
 and that they put it into practice as nothing 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.620
 until the next video chao
