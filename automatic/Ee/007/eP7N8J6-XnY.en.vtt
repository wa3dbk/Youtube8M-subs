in<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.650> playoffs<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.489> he<00:02:20.150> he<00:02:20.420> kind<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.720> let

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
in the playoffs and he he kind of let

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.080

the<00:02:20.959> team<00:02:21.170> down<00:02:21.440> I<00:02:21.500> think<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.250> in<00:02:22.519> an<00:02:22.670> aspect

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the team down I think in a in an aspect

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.390 
the team down I think in a in an aspect
because<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.050> was<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.320> Game<00:02:24.590> five<00:02:25.100> or

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
because it was like Game five or

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.040 
because it was like Game five or

credit in the world they really earned

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.190

it<00:03:23.580> and<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:24.150> almost<00:03:24.270> beat<00:03:24.570> the<00:03:24.690> Celtics<00:03:24.900> in

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

that<00:03:25.290> next<00:03:25.590> series<00:03:25.890> but<00:03:26.610> who<00:03:27.270> knows<00:03:27.450> maybe<00:03:27.480> if

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that next series but who knows maybe if

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.330 
that next series but who knows maybe if
Derrick<00:03:28.140> Rose<00:03:28.320> was<00:03:28.470> healthy<00:03:28.770> maybe<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.130> bowl

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
Derrick Rose was healthy maybe the bowl

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.770 
Derrick Rose was healthy maybe the bowl
probably<00:03:30.150> could<00:03:30.360> have<00:03:30.420> made<00:03:30.480> it<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.690> the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
probably could have made it to the

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.930 
probably could have made it to the
finals<00:03:31.170> maybe<00:03:31.350> give<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.310> heat<00:03:32.490> a<00:03:32.520> better<00:03:32.730> run

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
finals maybe give the heat a better run

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.270 
finals maybe give the heat a better run
for<00:03:33.030> their<00:03:33.150> money<00:03:33.180> but<00:03:34.050> in<00:03:34.830> my<00:03:35.070> eyes

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
for their money but in my eyes

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.040 
for their money but in my eyes
yes<00:03:35.760> Derrick<00:03:36.150> Rose<00:03:36.300> going<00:03:36.570> down<00:03:36.720> last<00:03:36.900> year

yes Derrick Rose going down last year

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.330

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
only to Michael Jordan and then it was

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.219 
only to Michael Jordan and then it was
after<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.680> all-star<00:04:53.220> break<00:04:53.250> this<00:04:53.640> was<00:04:53.850> like

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
after the all-star break this was like

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.500

going<00:04:57.750> to<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.900> playoffs<00:04:58.169> everything<00:04:59.160> was

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
going to the playoffs everything was

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.370 
going to the playoffs everything was
looking<00:04:59.430> great<00:04:59.729> and<00:05:00.060> I<00:05:00.479> was<00:05:00.810> just<00:05:00.990> up<00:05:01.169> and

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
looking great and I was just up and

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.530 
looking great and I was just up and
traded<00:05:01.800> Dominique<00:05:02.190> Wilkins<00:05:02.580> but<00:05:03.300> Danny

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
traded Dominique Wilkins but Danny

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.990 
traded Dominique Wilkins but Danny
Manning<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:04.140> I<00:05:04.770> mean<00:05:05.400> that<00:05:05.430> was<00:05:05.669> just<00:05:05.729> so

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
Manning and I mean that was just so

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.820 
Manning and I mean that was just so
crazy<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.840> was<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.080> first<00:05:07.290> time<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.680> history

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
crazy it was the first time in history

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.680 
crazy it was the first time in history
and<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.490> I'm<00:05:08.610> not<00:05:08.640> mistaken<00:05:08.760> I<00:05:09.270> think<00:05:09.450> it's<00:05:09.599> the

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
and if I'm not mistaken I think it's the

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.559 
and if I'm not mistaken I think it's the
only<00:05:09.930> time<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.530> history

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
only time in history

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.679 
only time in history

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
after the all-star break and to make

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.999 
after the all-star break and to make
matters<00:05:16.699> even<00:05:17.119> worse<00:05:17.330> I<00:05:17.809> read<00:05:18.439> somewhere<00:05:18.800> that

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 
matters even worse I read somewhere that

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:21.820 
matters even worse I read somewhere that
meek<00:05:19.460> wasn't<00:05:19.909> even<00:05:20.119> told<00:05:20.389> they<00:05:21.379> say<00:05:21.589> he<00:05:21.709> was

00:05:27.309 --> 00:05:27.319 
that he had been traded so that's my

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.879 
that he had been traded so that's my
