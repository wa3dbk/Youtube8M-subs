00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
song on Decca that's I think I believe

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.930

it's<00:00:54.390> called<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.839> a<00:00:54.869> great<00:00:55.079> big<00:00:55.260> pleasure

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
it's called it's a great big pleasure

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
it's called it's a great big pleasure
but<00:00:56.940> anyway<00:00:57.359> we're<00:00:57.719> playing<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> key<00:00:58.229> of<00:00:58.320> G

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
but anyway we're playing the key of G

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.209 
but anyway we're playing the key of G
and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.850> way<00:00:59.969> that<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.180> worked<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.719> out

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
and the way that I worked this out

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.389 
and the way that I worked this out
structurally<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.939> play<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.269> g7<00:01:04.080> chord

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
structurally is that I play a g7 chord

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.370 
structurally is that I play a g7 chord
and<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.750> way<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.320> this<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.630> take<00:01:09.899> the

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
and the way that I do this is I take the

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.499 
and the way that I do this is I take the
e<00:01:10.409> structure<00:01:11.250> G<00:01:11.850> and<00:01:13.159> then<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.520> decide<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> add

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
e structure G and then I decide to add

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.800 
e structure G and then I decide to add
the<00:01:15.840> 7<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.310> couple<00:01:17.460> lessons<00:01:18.000> back<00:01:18.360> I

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the 7 now in a couple lessons back I

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.960 
the 7 now in a couple lessons back I
took<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.380> G<00:01:19.619> major<00:01:19.860> moving<00:01:20.280> up<00:01:20.399> three<00:01:20.700> frets

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
took the G major moving up three frets

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.779 
took the G major moving up three frets
and<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.539> way<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.110> have<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> seventh<00:01:23.190> chord<00:01:23.459> or

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
and that way I have the seventh chord or

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.539 
and that way I have the seventh chord or
we<00:01:24.060> didn't<00:01:24.330> b-flat<00:01:24.929> so<00:01:25.649> if<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.860> walk<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.280> three

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
we didn't b-flat so if you walk up three

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.749 
we didn't b-flat so if you walk up three
frets<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.299> have<00:01:27.569> the<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.860> tonic<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
frets you have the the tonic and the

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.219 
frets you have the the tonic and the
seventh<00:01:30.209> so<00:01:30.990> what<00:01:31.679> I<00:01:31.709> got<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:32.069> is<00:01:32.750> this<00:01:33.750> right

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
seventh so what I got here is this right

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.719 
seventh so what I got here is this right
here<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> I<00:01:38.580> have<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.420> 3rd<00:01:40.289> 5<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.820> 7<00:01:42.619> so

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
here so I have the 3rd 5 and the 7 so

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.889 
here so I have the 3rd 5 and the 7 so
all<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.030> play<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:48.479> will<00:01:48.659> fire

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
all I do is play this and that will fire

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.649

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
structure and then using the sevens so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:10.900 
structure and then using the sevens so
I'd<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.469> one<00:01:55.740> two<00:01:56.460> one<00:01:57.359> two<00:01:57.630> three<00:01:57.780> four

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.129 
finger it's meeting the fifth string
will<00:03:13.709> also<00:03:14.159> mute<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.519> first<00:03:14.879> string<00:03:15.209> it's<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
will also mute the first string it's a

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.809 
will also mute the first string it's a
movable<00:03:16.409> shape<00:03:16.769> you<00:03:16.980> can<00:03:17.069> move<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.340> up<00:03:17.519> and
