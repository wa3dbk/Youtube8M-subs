00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.059
 material that we passed where fabian

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.830

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.830
 appear ahead 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.699
 but I have it strong I do not know 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.330
 we are in contact a man who wants 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.360
 talk that he asked for the possibility of 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.520
 talk there was no aesthetic level people 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.430
 you want to communicate with us 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.220
 what we do we take care of the band 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.350
 today we are conformed is 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.090
 well what the video does and I what 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.210
 I defend Leo should defend all the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 life I'm not a friend of or I never was 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.229
 friend and I'm not friends January a 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.769
 ideology 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.769
 but j 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.010
 we do not drink, do not smoke, do not do anything 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:20.940
 then we can not we are not the other 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.180
 band we did not know how to turn on the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.180
 computer 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.150
 the wonderful truth 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.490
 is one of the people that I think has 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.490
 done a lot for Uruguayan football 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.870
 He is a person because he is alive but 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.880
 I think it has given a lot to young people 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.100
 and I want this group that is for the 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.410
 selection they have agreed a bit on what 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.280
 that he has done many things for all 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.070
 those who are today in the 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.870
 payment choices and much more than the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.300
 true that I was also surprised has done 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.130
 they play Uruguay and it arrived and I 'm not going to 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.840
 believe that they did not bring a box of 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.940
 chocolates for your children and if two bags 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.670
 shoes for the Uruguayan poor who 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.140
 I think maybe only those of us who were 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.120
 in three times changing rooms we know what 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.010
 has made fabian for all 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.380
 players and for all the people and 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.510
 known of not that I think he has done 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.390
 a lot in football and I'm not saying it's 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.650
 bad economically much less but 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.570
 is very well economically because I 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.770
 I know it's very good economically but 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.900
 yes that 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.420
 many the silver that has been dumped 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.680
 to Uruguay and evidently they have 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.760
 fun much together 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.830
 you and the other also that he named you 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.240
 you see with all the whole bar but I say 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.740
 with him specifically from time to time 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:58.670
 when the stand step back 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.340
 I'm going to put a very special block 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.470
 because for example goes to the house and the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.450
 sled to places where all the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.860
 friends of him and able to spend five or 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:15.020
 six hours 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:18.730
 and speaking has to greet him and he was 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.730
 with your friends and we are friends 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.500
 friendship trust
