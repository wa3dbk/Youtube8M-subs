00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.990 
miss Fang she made it actually easier
first<00:03:33.620> she<00:03:33.830> broke<00:03:34.040> down<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.370> content<00:03:34.880> and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
first she broke down the content and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000 
first she broke down the content and
then<00:03:35.260> gradually<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.410> started<00:03:36.500> understanding

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
then gradually I started understanding

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.850 
then gradually I started understanding
it<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:37.690> the<00:03:38.690> concept<00:03:39.110> was<00:03:39.140> relatively<00:03:39.709> easy

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
it and the concept was relatively easy

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.300 
it and the concept was relatively easy
so<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.820> have<00:03:41.330> a<00:03:41.360> problem<00:03:41.750> with<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.049> um<00:03:42.310> picked

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
so and have a problem with it um picked

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.340 
so and have a problem with it um picked
it<00:03:43.430> up<00:03:43.519> pretty<00:03:43.760> quickly<00:03:44.390> keeping<00:03:45.019> up<00:03:45.110> wasn't

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
it up pretty quickly keeping up wasn't

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.350 
it up pretty quickly keeping up wasn't
too<00:03:45.530> hard<00:03:45.739> even<00:03:46.190> sometimes<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.850> went<00:03:47.000> ahead<00:03:47.090> and

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
too hard even sometimes I went ahead and

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.570 
too hard even sometimes I went ahead and
read<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.540> further<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.080> the<00:03:48.170> book<00:03:48.350> like<00:03:48.980> some

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
read it further in the book like some

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.690 
read it further in the book like some
every<00:03:50.299> week<00:03:50.450> she<00:03:50.480> would<00:03:50.690> assign<00:03:50.870> a<00:03:50.930> chapter

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
every week she would assign a chapter

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.770 
every week she would assign a chapter
