00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
straighten the leg when the hip is are

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.249 
straighten the leg when the hip is are
flexed<00:01:34.009> at<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.520> 90<00:01:36.000> degree<00:01:36.329> angle<00:01:36.360> because<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
flexed at a 90 degree angle because the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.679 
flexed at a 90 degree angle because the
hamstring<00:01:37.829> muscles<00:01:38.280> there<00:01:38.820> is<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.119> awful<00:01:39.540> lot

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
hamstring muscles there is an awful lot

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.140 
hamstring muscles there is an awful lot
of<00:01:39.750> tenderness<00:01:40.290> in<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:40.829> area<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:41.759> it's<00:01:41.909> just

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
of tenderness in that area so it's just

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.289 
of tenderness in that area so it's just
not<00:01:42.420> possible<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.110> straighten<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> leg<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
not possible to straighten the leg and

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.819 
not possible to straighten the leg and
of<00:01:45.299> course<00:01:45.570> like<00:01:45.810> we<00:01:45.990> said<00:01:46.229> with<00:01:46.380> brazil's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
of course like we said with brazil's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.410 
of course like we said with brazil's
gives<00:01:47.130> us<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> little<00:01:47.579> bit<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:48.030> complicated

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
gives us a little bit more complicated

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
gives us a little bit more complicated

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
meningitis they're at risk for something

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.590 
meningitis they're at risk for something
called<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:22.470> hydrocephalus<00:03:23.299> which<00:03:24.299> is<00:03:24.480> an

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
called a hydrocephalus which is an

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.900 
called a hydrocephalus which is an
unusual<00:03:25.130> accumulation<00:03:26.130> of<00:03:26.310> fluid<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:26.850> the

unusual accumulation of fluid on the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
brain and this is the reason why after

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.759 
brain and this is the reason why after
long<00:03:29.640> treatment<00:03:30.000> they<00:03:30.720> put<00:03:31.019> what<00:03:31.200> is<00:03:31.290> called<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
long treatment they put what is called a

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.759 
long treatment they put what is called a
shunt<00:03:32.160> in<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.549> particular<00:03:33.290> peritoneal<00:03:34.290> shunt

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
to help shunt that extra fluid around

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.670 
to help shunt that extra fluid around
the<00:03:37.950> brain<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:39.000> goes<00:03:39.269> all<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.630> way<00:03:39.870> into

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
the brain and it goes all the way into

they can isolate the organism now there

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.190 
they can isolate the organism now there
is<00:04:40.110> a<00:04:40.140> cat<00:04:40.470> scan<00:04:40.830> which<00:04:41.160> you<00:04:41.340> know<00:04:41.720> nowadays<00:04:42.720> we

is a cat scan which you know nowadays we

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.590 
is a cat scan which you know nowadays we
have<00:04:43.230> cat<00:04:43.590> scans<00:04:44.010> which<00:04:44.330> specifically<00:04:45.330> tell

have cat scans which specifically tell

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.510 
have cat scans which specifically tell
you<00:04:45.870> if<00:04:46.320> there<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:46.740> swelling<00:04:47.100> in<00:04:47.370> the
