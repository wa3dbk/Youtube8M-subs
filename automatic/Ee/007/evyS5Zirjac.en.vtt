00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.420
 I technological advances a rhythm 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.760
 exponential trained with the 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.740
 researchers developed judicious 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.400
 process to locate the implant within 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.400
 of the brain 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.190
 the engineer of the new confessor invito 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.130
 albin luis de nadir development of the 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.440
 The first controlled brain pacemaker 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.460
 by microelectrodes located in the 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.460
 inside of the brain 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.879
 by focusing on the brain the farm 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.570
 invades more and more jones intimacy of the 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.570
 human being 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.399
 what is the video our surgery to 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.109
 a patient share about here he 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.229
 they make games to know the 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:56.000
 existing disability and if that can not 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:58.550
 to be able to follow time by itself 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.860
 to see if this image is after the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.990
 surgery although he still does not have 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 pacemaker 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:10.200
 adding the rights keeps trembling and my 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.880
 colleague turns on the pacemaker 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.229
 let's observe how his hand trembles 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.229
 Right stops immediately 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.020
 now we have the other's pacemaker 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.509
 side and the patient is unlocked can 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:32.450
 move your legs does not have your hands 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:35.569
 firm lift your head back and walk 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.159
 normally for asia the arms to 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.100
 difference of patients with 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.159
 parkinson said de galea headed for 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.340
 show the agility of your legs 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.590
 when turning off the pacemaker the crisis 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.310
 returns and when the miracle turns on 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.310
 neutrons 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.649
 even though these extraordinary 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.030
 long-term interest results 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.479
 40,000 people define moments of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.479
 elevate them 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.509
 in the area intended is very small 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.250
 size of a grain of rice and the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.890
 values â€‹â€‹are established during a 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.900
 surgery that can take more than 10 hours 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.300
 in early stimulation 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.650
 deep brain that fear waves of 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.080
 high frequency in the parts 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.209
 dysfunctional brain either for 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.040
 activate or to inhibit the 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.739
 stimulation so the symptoms of the 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.739
 disease disappear but not a cure 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.880
 researchers explore other uses 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.980
 for the pacemaker as the waves of 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.560
 high frequency can suppress desire 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.260
 of eating and they are tested as treatment 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.290
 obesity is already used to treat 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.960
 cases of severe depression and disorder 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.810
 Obsessive compulsive electrodes 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.610
 can correct our behavior 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.830
 normalize our intentions and 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.390
 change the mood has been 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.970
 demonstrated that an interface 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.430
 man-machine can be implanted in 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.200
 Our brain 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.540
 the movie sick of disorder 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.700
 obsessive compulsive resistant to all 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.040
 the classical therapies received a 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.710
 implant a year ago this little 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.660
 device contains a microchip that 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.570
 regulates high frequency waves in 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.340
 your brain the characteristics of 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.830
 waves can be regulated by their 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.410
 psychiatrist today the doctor mir be for two 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.100
 years suggests you watch a video before 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.100
 your infant 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.910
 We do not carry the video that is you 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.360
 trying to get up after the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.360
 breakfast 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.300
 I take it later but I still feel it like that 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.250
 that I must repeat the movement for 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.780
 make sure that our animal 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:56.200
 I take it I take it down I take it 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.200
 left 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.549
 I take it I leave it 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.709
 the two I leave I have to 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.709
 sentences to know that I just left 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.520
 incredible was totally obsessed 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.230
 you can see in my eyes doctor in 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:37.100
 truth is horrible about all this again 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:41.060
 with a trace glass is a difficulty 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:43.810
 to drink some liquid and then 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.810
 deliver less 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.540
 Thank you 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.750
 I feel totally normal like in the 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:55.930
 year 2000 before internal but in 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:58.009
 I do not really feel like a taiwan me 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.400
 I feel normal 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.960
 goodbye 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 how are we doing 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.500
 do not 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.900
 American scientists have arrived 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.330
 farther investigators in boston 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.320
 massachusetts paved the way for 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:24.370
 the improvement medicine to release the 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.840
 body and commissioner of your privacy 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.840
 they designated a supernatural function
