00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
good optics so i wanted to find a good

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
good optics so i wanted to find a good
replacement<00:00:51.899> for<00:00:52.940> people<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.120> are

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
replacement for people that are

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.790 
replacement for people that are
searching<00:00:54.809> for<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> wide<00:00:55.199> angle<00:00:55.350> lens<00:00:55.590> but

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
searching for a wide angle lens but

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
searching for a wide angle lens but
really<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.340> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> shell<00:00:56.760> out<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.969> lot<00:00:57.480> of

really don't want to shell out a lot of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.200 
really don't want to shell out a lot of
money<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.930> i<00:01:00.930> came<00:01:01.920> across<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
money so i came across this this is the

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.260 
money so i came across this this is the
rokinon<00:01:03.690> 14<00:01:04.260> millimeter<00:01:04.710> f<00:01:04.979> 2.8<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.939> good

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
rokinon 14 millimeter f 2.8 it's a good

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
rokinon 14 millimeter f 2.8 it's a good
lens<00:01:10.100> optically<00:01:11.659> it's<00:01:12.659> actually<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.439> my

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
lens optically it's actually in my

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.320 
lens optically it's actually in my
opinion<00:01:13.729> superior<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> tokina<00:01:15.840> 11-16

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
opinion superior than the tokina 11-16

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.950 
opinion superior than the tokina 11-16
but<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:18.990> as<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.770> canon<00:01:20.280> 14

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
but not as good as the canon 14

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.780 
but not as good as the canon 14
millimeter<00:01:21.960> wide<00:01:22.140> angle<00:01:22.470> lens<00:01:22.619> it's<00:01:23.520> right<00:01:23.729> in

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
millimeter wide angle lens it's right in

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.590 
millimeter wide angle lens it's right in
between<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.600> opinion<00:01:24.990> ok<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.979> i<00:01:26.450> was<00:01:27.450> very

this<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.810> manually<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:21.010> open<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.580> open

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
this you manually have to open it open

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.350 
this you manually have to open it open
up<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.959> lens<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.160> f-stop<00:02:24.700> that<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.060> want

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
up the lens to the f-stop that you want

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.240 
up the lens to the f-stop that you want
so<00:02:25.810> if<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.019> want<00:02:26.230> to<00:02:26.320> go<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.500> 2.8<00:02:27.070> you

so if you want to go to 2.8 you

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.479 
so if you want to go to 2.8 you
basically<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.970> to<00:02:28.090> turn<00:02:28.330> it<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.720> 2.8<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.800> you

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
basically have to turn it to 2.8 or you

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.330 
basically have to turn it to 2.8 or you
know<00:02:30.580> 22<00:02:31.180> I've<00:02:31.510> stopped<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.140> 22<00:02:32.530> gotta<00:02:32.890> turn<00:02:33.190> it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
know 22 I've stopped of 22 gotta turn it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.370 
know 22 I've stopped of 22 gotta turn it
to<00:02:33.459> f-stop<00:02:34.080> 22<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.950> can't<00:02:36.989> do<00:02:37.989> that<00:02:38.140> from

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
to f-stop 22 so you can't do that from

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.300 
to f-stop 22 so you can't do that from
in<00:02:38.620> camera<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.900> might<00:02:41.260> be<00:02:41.290> a<00:02:41.530> bit<00:02:42.070> of<00:02:42.190> an

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
in camera so that might be a bit of an

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.920 
in camera so that might be a bit of an
issue<00:02:42.430> for<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.790> guys<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.480> kind<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.810> you

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
issue for you guys and it kind of you

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
issue for you guys and it kind of you
know<00:02:43.959> for<00:02:44.230> me<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.769> kind<00:02:45.010> of<00:02:45.070> was<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.700> very

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
know for me it kind of was the very

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.990 
know for me it kind of was the very
first<00:02:46.030> day<00:02:46.420> but<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:47.019> after<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.940> kind<00:02:48.940> of

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
first day but then after that I kind of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.729 
first day but then after that I kind of
got<00:02:49.150> used<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:49.510> and<00:02:49.720> I<00:02:50.110> really<00:02:50.440> kind<00:02:50.709> of

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
got used to it and I really kind of

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.800 
got used to it and I really kind of
don't<00:02:50.950> mind<00:02:51.100> it<00:02:51.250> I<00:02:51.430> don't<00:02:51.940> mind<00:02:52.120> switching<00:02:52.540> my

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
don't mind it I don't mind switching my

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
don't mind it I don't mind switching my
aperture<00:02:53.140> manually<00:02:56.010> this<00:02:57.360> camera<00:02:58.360> hood<00:02:58.720> or

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
aperture manually this camera hood or

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.990 
aperture manually this camera hood or
it's<00:03:00.910> kind<00:03:01.150> of<00:03:01.239> very<00:03:01.620> flimsy<00:03:02.620> very<00:03:03.660> plasticky

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's kind of very flimsy very plasticky

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.520 
it's kind of very flimsy very plasticky
it<00:03:07.000> probably<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.900> were<00:03:08.019> to<00:03:08.110> drop<00:03:08.290> it

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
it probably if you were to drop it

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.800 
it probably if you were to drop it
probably<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.070> will<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.430> wouldn't<00:03:10.269> be<00:03:10.420> surprised

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
probably it will I wouldn't be surprised

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.569 
probably it will I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:03:11.019> it<00:03:11.170> like<00:03:11.320> cracked<00:03:11.739> or<00:03:12.070> anything<00:03:12.310> like<00:03:12.459> that

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
if it like cracked or anything like that

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.140 
if it like cracked or anything like that

videographer it you know it shouldn't be
a<00:04:04.110> problem<00:04:04.410> because<00:04:04.910> you're<00:04:05.910> manually

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
a problem because you're manually

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.790 
a problem because you're manually

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
focusing on your subject anyway so you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.130 
focusing on your subject anyway so you
never<00:04:10.950> use<00:04:11.370> automatic<00:04:12.270> focus<00:04:14.690> using<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:16.019> for

never use automatic focus using it for
video<00:04:16.350> at<00:04:17.070> least<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.370> don't<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:18.209> lot<00:04:18.359> of

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
video at least I don't and a lot of

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.320

professionals<00:04:18.989> don't<00:04:19.140> either<00:04:20.150> there's<00:04:21.150> three

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
professionals don't either there's three

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.270

good things in the three kind of bad
things<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.730> then<00:04:23.790> you'll<00:04:24.419> decide<00:04:24.780> whether

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
things and then you'll decide whether

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.680 
things and then you'll decide whether
you<00:04:25.470> want<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:25.860> get<00:04:26.220> this<00:04:26.340> lens<00:04:26.550> or<00:04:26.700> not<00:04:26.850> the

say that the equivalent of this would be

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.850 
say that the equivalent of this would be
a<00:05:19.500> tokina<00:05:20.310> which<00:05:21.090> is<00:05:21.270> like<00:05:21.830> seven<00:05:22.830> hundred
