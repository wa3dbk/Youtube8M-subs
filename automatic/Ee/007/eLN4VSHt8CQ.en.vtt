 impressa j9 tft a machine for the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 household you at the touch of a button

 individual milk portions for preparation 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.019
 for example from cacau 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.290
 we have a model here with a tft 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:48.839
 You simply click on her screen 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:52.799
 You can select product by clicking here 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.530
 by turning up the individual products 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.960
 then make the screen visible 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.839
 choose the appropriate product and 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.239
 to choose the one possibility 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:06.420
 another possibility is over the six 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.220
 Product buttons one of the six products 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.470
 the ones on the front of the screen 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
 to be displayed indicates to them 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.480
 now an example a latte 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 macchiato 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.280
 we have a latte macchiato glass here 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.980
 with an appropriate size 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.960
 now here's the spout for latte 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.570
 macchiato in the height adjust so that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.310
 this glass fits under it 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.080
 settings of course for this latte 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.060
 macchiato previously made that the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.730
 also fits into the glass and that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.980
 Result in the glass when I'm perfect 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.670
 now wants the latte macchiato to the 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.040
 machine times fresh live 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.600
 with our new aroma plus x the work 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 has been improved again is a strong 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:47.270
 egl grinder works very efficiently 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.899
 she works very fast now 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.850
 the radiator is produced before now 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:58.850
 steam the milk is announced from the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 Tool control that there is a milk container 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.479
 for a liter of milk 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.710
 which is tempered to four degrees four 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.869
 degree is the optimal temperature 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.090
 to produce perfect milk foam 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.310
 we have 28 seconds now 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.440
 Milk foam set that optimally 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.209
 for the glass of the quantity 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.940
 I'll put in the milk foam now 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.530
 in the glass now off immediately 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.420
 because the length has been reached 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.700
 that it also individually during the 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.510
 once again the quantities are possible 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.580
 vary 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.160
 Now the next thing is the machine 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.069
 a break we here with 30 seconds 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.080
 have set this break is for 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.790
 because so just the milk and the 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.830
 milk foam separates nicely 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.260
 a beautiful deposition takes place the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.079
 milk cools off a little bit because of that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.920
 Layering of the latte macchiato 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.170
 works very well if the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.410
 Milk is a little cooler is not allowed 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.910
 to be too hot and after this 30 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.609
 seconds it is therefore now a 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.350
 make espresso without it 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 something changes personally but 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.630
 The machine does it all 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.290
 fully automatic 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.579
 Now she switches to coffee 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.920
 Coffee comes out of the back spout 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:08.810
 and will be relatively nice in the now 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.470
 middle between foam and the milk 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.470
 drop 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.209
 so now we are absolutely one 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:23.560
 have perfect product and looks here 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.540
 again coffee settles and thus is 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 The drink is ready- made machine 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.560
 is now still inside the 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.930
 coffee grounds and is now practical 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.170
 ready for the next cafÃ© 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.750
 Respectively 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.939
 we now have the flagship here 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.849
 Flagship of the company Jurassic of the Giga 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.870
 5 the latest development from home 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.730
 Jurassic maybe a few words to 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.730
 company jurassic itself the philosophy 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.489
 From Jurassic it is the most beautiful 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.069
 Machines with the most advanced 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.139
 Technology the best fair products too 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.129
 Respectively 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:02.230
 we actually have that on the 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.120
 spiked there is actually here 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.989
 no wish strains left over 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.859
 this machine 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.959
 you can press any button at all 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:13.120
 Coffee specialties are prepared too 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.989
 always everything twice a real one 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.030
 milchkaffee 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.720
 this is almost unique in the market 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.729
 where really milk and coffee 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.550
 run in simultaneously into the cup 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.650
 you just show once again 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.960
 in this model, therefore, is the milk 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.849
 spout and integrated coffee spout 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:40.530
 I want to get up here via the rotary 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:40.530
 select the product with coffee 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.380
 we'll do it now 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.090
 the coffee of the right 100 grinder 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.960
 here in this grinder in it one is 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:54.150
 could that also be mission 50 50 or 25 75 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.340
 or just from the other grinder ever 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.100
 by taste we now see how 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.780
 said that is unique for that needs 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.729
 the machine is two customers and two 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.389
 heaters controlled simultaneously 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.160
 become 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.199
 here is now the milk and the coffee 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.360
 at the same time put into the cup 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.280
 This creates a direct 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.770
 mixing the two drinks around the 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.900
 special aroma what a milk coffee 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.430
 makes it unique and also from 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.930
 a cappuccino makes a difference 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.210
 cappuccino is finally going through 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.910
 screen and espresso made 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.800
 separately the milk coffee is just in 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.870
 a slip may be made 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.500
 you see it in the picture that gives you one 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.270
 special a special optic as well 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.150
 just the milk in the coffee the crema 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:38.360
 the coffee is already mixed here 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.699
 you can see the specialization of the company 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.880
 we are dealing with our few 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.169
 years only with the theme of coffee 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.080
 exclusively are actually worldwide 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.210
 the only absolute coffee machine 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.880
 Specialist there is no other product 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.740
 more about the company jura cares 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:01.229
 only coffee and here is one 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.210
 sortiment meanwhile emerged something 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.400
 So for each the appropriate 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.590
 machine ready keeps from the big one 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.970
 Household machine with two times works 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.990
 like all products with dairy products, etc 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.820
 prepared to a small 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.320
 machine only coffee and espresso him 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.010
 makes for the one who even 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:22.050
 do not use or would like to drink milk 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:25.020
 something for every taste 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.630
 everyone needs something for it too 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:31.050
 tailored to the wishes of the customer 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.310
 on men so there are 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.260
 household where he has several people on it 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.490
 access to the products as well 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:41.440
 Single households where I only have one person 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.820
 Coffee drinks and that certainly needs 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.020
 not necessarily such a big one 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:47.010
 machine because he maybe only two 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.010
 cups of coffee on the day of drinking
