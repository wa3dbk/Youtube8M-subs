00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.359
 what to say because not immediately because otherwise 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.870

 difficulty 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.510
 we will do normal if the difficulties do not 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 we can of quiet followed screens 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:15.270
