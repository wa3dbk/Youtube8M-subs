ahead<00:00:34.780> and<00:00:34.900> get<00:00:35.110> the<00:00:35.560> seed<00:00:36.040> typed<00:00:36.880> in<00:00:37.090> and

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
ahead and get the seed typed in and

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.240 
ahead and get the seed typed in and
let's<00:00:37.540> go<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.690> start<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:37.930> world<00:00:38.170> so<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.920> seed

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
let's go to start this world so the seed

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.639 
let's go to start this world so the seed
is<00:00:39.550> s<00:00:39.820> are<00:00:40.329> in<00:00:40.870> just<00:00:41.440> three<00:00:41.739> letters<00:00:42.270> SRM<00:00:43.649> and

I'll<00:00:44.829> just<00:00:44.980> title<00:00:45.309> this<00:00:45.460> seed<00:00:45.940> world<00:00:46.149> i<00:00:46.300> guess

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
I'll just title this seed world i guess

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.850 
I'll just title this seed world i guess
but<00:00:47.140> i<00:00:47.200> will<00:00:47.559> leave<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.160> the<00:00:49.000> seed<00:00:49.720> name<00:00:50.590> in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860 
but i will leave the the seed name in

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.380 
but i will leave the the seed name in
the<00:00:51.070> description<00:00:51.460> below<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:52.030> guys<00:00:52.180> can

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
first of all here we're in our zero

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.620 
first of all here we're in our zero
point<00:01:08.259> seven<00:01:08.350> point<00:01:08.590> three<00:01:08.650> beautiful<00:01:09.630> sun

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
having on this texture pack let me turn

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.810 
having on this texture pack let me turn
this<00:01:17.710> down<00:01:17.890> this<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.189> way<00:01:18.310> too<00:01:18.340> loud<00:01:18.579> for<00:01:18.729> me

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
okay but the reason we have stone brick

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.739 
okay but the reason we have stone brick
everywhere<00:01:24.759> is<00:01:24.880> because<00:01:25.240> i<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.539> on<00:01:25.719> a

00:01:25.739 --> 00:01:25.749 
everywhere is because i have on a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:29.789 
everywhere is because i have on a
texture<00:01:26.679> pack<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:27.039> replaces<00:01:27.579> sand<00:01:27.850> with<00:01:28.810> the

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
texture pack that replaces sand with the

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.260 
texture pack that replaces sand with the
stone<00:01:30.069> breaker<00:01:30.310> might<00:01:30.549> be<00:01:30.670> gravel<00:01:30.999> i<00:01:31.060> can't

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
stone breaker might be gravel i can't

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.359 
stone breaker might be gravel i can't
remember<00:01:31.359> but<00:01:31.990> one<00:01:32.139> of<00:01:32.229> those<00:01:32.319> two<00:01:32.499> that's<00:01:33.249> the

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
remember but one of those two that's the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.789 
remember but one of those two that's the
reason<00:01:33.609> why<00:01:33.639> you're<00:01:33.850> seeing<00:01:33.969> that<00:01:34.289> anyway<00:01:35.289> we

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
reason why you're seeing that anyway we

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.950 
reason why you're seeing that anyway we
got<00:01:35.979> some<00:01:36.130> awesome<00:01:36.249> over<00:01:36.999> a<00:01:37.030> not<00:01:37.569> overhanging

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
got some awesome over a not overhanging

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.010 
got some awesome over a not overhanging
floating<00:01:38.409> islands<00:01:38.859> here<00:01:39.719> so<00:01:40.719> there's<00:01:40.899> like

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
floating islands here so there's like

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.779 
floating islands here so there's like
separate<00:01:41.530> islands<00:01:42.009> there's<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.249> large<00:01:42.579> one

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:42.789 
separate islands there's a large one

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.179 
separate islands there's a large one
here<00:01:42.939> small<00:01:43.179> one<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:44.170> over<00:01:44.380> this<00:01:44.649> cool

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
here small one and it's over this cool

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.819 
here small one and it's over this cool
body<00:01:45.579> of<00:01:45.759> water<00:01:45.999> so<00:01:46.359> it<00:01:46.899> looks<00:01:47.079> so<00:01:47.319> sweet<00:01:47.380> under

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
body of water so it looks so sweet under

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.580 
body of water so it looks so sweet under
here<00:01:48.009> it<00:01:48.909> cut<00:01:49.359> it<00:01:49.509> cast<00:01:49.719> a<00:01:49.840> nice<00:01:49.990> little<00:01:50.170> shade

here it cut it cast a nice little shade

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.219 
here it cut it cast a nice little shade
down<00:01:51.340> under<00:01:51.789> here<00:01:52.030> for<00:01:52.299> I<00:01:52.329> don't<00:01:52.600> know<00:01:52.899> like<00:01:52.959> a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
down under here for I don't know like a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.730 
down under here for I don't know like a
little<00:01:53.729> shaded<00:01:54.729> pond<00:01:55.600> type<00:01:56.170> thing<00:01:56.469> I<00:01:56.619> don't

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
little shaded pond type thing I don't

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.559 
little shaded pond type thing I don't
know<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:56.920> looks<00:01:57.069> really<00:01:57.280> really<00:01:57.549> cool<00:01:57.579> and<00:01:57.939> I

00:01:58.559 --> 00:01:58.569 
know it looks really really cool and I

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:00.599 
know it looks really really cool and I
once<00:01:58.990> again<00:01:59.109> I<00:01:59.409> think<00:01:59.649> this<00:01:59.740> would<00:01:59.920> look<00:01:59.950> way

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
once again I think this would look way

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.340 
once again I think this would look way
different<00:02:00.880> when<00:02:01.149> I<00:02:01.329> have<00:02:01.689> the<00:02:01.840> normal<00:02:02.020> text

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
different when I have the normal text

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.050 
different when I have the normal text
back<00:02:02.499> on<00:02:02.619> but<00:02:03.069> as<00:02:03.189> you<00:02:03.310> can<00:02:03.399> see<00:02:03.579> as<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:03.819> go<00:02:03.939> over

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
back on but as you can see as we go over

this place is awesome right here also a

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.830 
this place is awesome right here also a
zero<00:03:36.340> point<00:03:36.640> seven<00:03:36.790> point<00:03:37.030> three<00:03:37.060> I<00:03:37.390> noticed

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
zero point seven point three I noticed

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.870 
zero point seven point three I noticed
it's<00:03:37.960> just<00:03:38.110> min<00:03:38.230> ago<00:03:38.410> when<00:03:39.100> you're<00:03:39.250> flying<00:03:39.520> I

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
it's just min ago when you're flying I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.940 
it's just min ago when you're flying I
would<00:03:40.240> you<00:03:40.720> would<00:03:40.840> usually<00:03:41.050> like<00:03:41.620> float

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
would you would usually like float

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.000 
would you would usually like float
forward<00:03:42.460> a<00:03:42.610> couple<00:03:42.970> extra<00:03:43.240> i<00:03:43.780> don't<00:03:44.410> know<00:03:44.500> but

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
forward a couple extra i don't know but

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.120 
forward a couple extra i don't know but
i<00:03:45.220> guess<00:03:45.790> like<00:03:45.820> 10<00:03:46.210> extra<00:03:46.390> micro<00:03:46.720> box<00:03:46.960> but<00:03:47.950> now

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
i guess like 10 extra micro box but now

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.590 
i guess like 10 extra micro box but now
it's<00:03:48.430> like<00:03:48.520> an<00:03:48.670> instant<00:03:49.060> stop<00:03:49.330> when<00:03:49.480> you<00:03:49.510> stop

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
it's like an instant stop when you stop

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.020 
it's like an instant stop when you stop
