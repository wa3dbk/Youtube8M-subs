golf ball you know everything everything

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.150 
golf ball you know everything everything
nowadays<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.079> golf<00:00:43.260> ball<00:00:43.469> technology<00:00:44.010> where

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
nowadays in golf ball technology where

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.229 
nowadays in golf ball technology where
we're<00:00:44.309> trying<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> hit<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> further<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
we're trying to hit it further and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
we're trying to hit it further and
higher<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:46.110> lower<00:00:46.379> spin<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.370> we<00:00:47.489> want<00:00:47.670> to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
higher when lower spin but we want to

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.119 
higher when lower spin but we want to
still<00:00:47.969> maintain<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.930> soft<00:00:49.530> feel<00:00:49.770> around<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
still maintain that soft feel around the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.350 
still maintain that soft feel around the
Greens<00:00:50.340> wedge<00:00:50.579> play<00:00:50.850> we<00:00:50.969> want<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.149> be<00:00:51.210> able<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
Greens wedge play we want to be able to

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.840 
Greens wedge play we want to be able to
control<00:00:51.660> our<00:00:51.780> wedges<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:53.219> golf<00:00:53.430> ball<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
control our wedges so this golf ball to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.170 
control our wedges so this golf ball to
me<00:00:54.000> seems<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> real<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.379> good<00:00:55.770> all-round

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
me seems like a real a good all-round

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.150 
me seems like a real a good all-round
alternative<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:58.170> know<00:00:58.260> for<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> club<00:00:59.010> golf

they're gonna be able to compress this

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.960 
they're gonna be able to compress this
ball<00:01:04.589> really<00:01:04.739> nicely<00:01:05.010> well<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:05.790> exactly

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
ball really nicely well that's exactly

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.880 
ball really nicely well that's exactly
right<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.229> tour<00:01:07.470> caliber

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
right this is a kind of tour caliber

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.700 
right this is a kind of tour caliber
ball<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> non<00:01:08.610> tall<00:01:08.850> golfer<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.710> in

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
ball for the non tall golfer and in

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.350 
ball for the non tall golfer and in
actual<00:01:11.070> fact<00:01:11.100> one<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> key<00:01:11.729> technologies

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
actual fact one of the key technologies

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.899 
actual fact one of the key technologies
is<00:01:12.720> something<00:01:13.020> called<00:01:13.200> spin<00:01:13.530> skin<00:01:13.830> which<00:01:14.010> we

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
is something called spin skin which we

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.840 
is something called spin skin which we
introduced<00:01:15.420> previously<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.860> z-star

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
introduced previously in the z-star

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
introduced previously in the z-star
range<00:01:18.290> with<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> spin<00:01:19.619> skin<00:01:19.890> coating<00:01:20.310> it's

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
range with the spin skin coating it's

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.620 
range with the spin skin coating it's
actually<00:01:20.700> designed<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> create<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> lot<00:01:21.600> more

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
actually designed to create a lot more

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.149 
actually designed to create a lot more
friction<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.320> lot<00:01:22.439> more<00:01:22.470> spin<00:01:22.860> around<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
friction and a lot more spin around the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.410 
friction and a lot more spin around the
Greens<00:01:23.369> did<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.640> notice<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> were

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
Greens did you notice that when you were

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.880 
Greens did you notice that when you were
head<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.720> picture<00:01:24.990> chip<00:01:25.200> shops<00:01:25.439> yeah

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
head and your picture chip shops yeah

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
head and your picture chip shops yeah
definitely<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> mean<00:01:26.549> I'm<00:01:26.670> I'm<00:01:27.390> I'm<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> Jetstar

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
