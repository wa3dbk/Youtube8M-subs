 asset today will tell you how to replace 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.960
 texture for example from one text yet 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 to another and yes and well oh so here 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.890
 how to replace 1 texture pack for example 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.510
 glass is different and so for a start to us 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 need two textures pack 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.460
 Well, for example, whether it was he was craft and pilaf 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 of wild tupac but i set a bancroft 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.480
 I have yet to make it something 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.180
 interesting but how suddenly 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.329
 went into the mantra began to build a house and then well 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.640
 it's time to put the glass and saw here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.870
 This here is this empty as a prison 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.149
 lattice but thats me he wo n't like me 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.500
 found another texture pack in the same 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:02.430
 extension put this 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.250
 urban croft at 128 discuss too 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.040
 we find the words connect for example well be 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.390
 you may have a different texture pack so 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.159
 go in textures 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 boxing and looking looking at the eye well, or what 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.299
 you need a block i already have we 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:27.210
 desktop here take and replace here 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:32.329
 so well everything is replaced now check 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.329
 Immediately to make no mistake 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.540
 salla menu and now i come back when 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.500
 conceived to 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.830
 okay, I entered the shirt and how said 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.630
 here please flowed such what spoke 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.990
 but the main thing is that glass is not only a framework 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.979
 we just and glass could but poets have 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:03.610
 in view of what you see on lan now 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:07.450
 texture pack big expansion and warm 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.929
 exactly the same you can understand that i 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:15.700
 though her lungs Stupak and the 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.950
 the moment he was very dumb as you see 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.540
 glass and true in winter the texture of that 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.739
 texture pack and how to explain that 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.600
 texture pack is easier this glass and squabble 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.810
