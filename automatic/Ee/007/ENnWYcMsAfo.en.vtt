it<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.450> little<00:03:05.600> different<00:03:06.079> too<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.889> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
it a little different too so the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.759 
it a little different too so the
question<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.489> taste<00:03:07.760> taste<00:03:08.150> here<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
question of taste taste here and the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.480 
question of taste taste here and the
camera<00:03:10.130> is<00:03:10.250> right<00:03:10.459> there<00:03:10.670> is<00:03:10.790> display<00:03:11.319> device

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.590

it's<00:03:24.970> nice<00:03:25.330> on<00:03:25.720> your<00:03:25.930> phone<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:28.020> basically

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:29.020 
it's nice on your phone and basically

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.070 
it's nice on your phone and basically
it's<00:03:29.260> like<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.740> zoo<00:03:29.980> but<00:03:30.730> with<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.570> different

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
it's like the zoo but with a different

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.130 
it's like the zoo but with a different
design<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:32.770> specs<00:03:33.730> are<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> little<00:03:34.840> different

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
design and specs are a little different

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.560 
design and specs are a little different
because<00:03:35.710> the<00:03:36.280> size<00:03:36.550> of<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.820> devices<00:03:37.150> are<00:03:37.540> a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
because the size of the devices are a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.570 
because the size of the devices are a
bit<00:03:37.780> smaller<00:03:38.050> so<00:03:38.380> basically<00:03:39.010> it's<00:03:39.130> it's

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
bit smaller so basically it's it's

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.990 
bit smaller so basically it's it's
mostly<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.180> design<00:03:40.950> okay<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.490> differences

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
mostly a design okay the differences

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.680 
mostly a design okay the differences
between<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.450> Z<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:44.040> ZL<00:03:45.040> mostly<00:03:45.970> decisions

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
between the Z and ZL mostly decisions

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.550 
between the Z and ZL mostly decisions
wise<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.700> for<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:48.820> rest<00:03:49.030> you<00:03:49.390> see<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.080> it's

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
wise and for the rest you see it it's

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.500 
wise and for the rest you see it it's
quite<00:03:50.800> similar<00:03:51.100> so<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.120> enjoyed
