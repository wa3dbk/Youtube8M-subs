some of the best keepers last year I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.439 
some of the best keepers last year I
took<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.750> ones<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> grew<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.150> set<00:00:30.150> aside

took the ones that I grew and set aside

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.999 
took the ones that I grew and set aside
as<00:00:30.660> many<00:00:30.900> as<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> thought<00:00:31.230> that<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.650> could<00:00:31.800> use

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
as many as I thought that I could use

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.620 
as many as I thought that I could use
before<00:00:32.189> they<00:00:32.460> would<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.730> bad<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.540> he

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
before they would go bad and then as he

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.020 
before they would go bad and then as he
hydrated<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.260> rest<00:00:34.290> well<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.070> January<00:00:35.640> I

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
hydrated the rest well in January I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.950 
hydrated the rest well in January I
still<00:00:36.570> had<00:00:36.809> onions<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:38.219> ran<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:39.660> this

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
still had onions and I ran out so this

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.900 
still had onions and I ran out so this
year<00:00:40.140> I'm<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.680> try<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> save<00:00:41.579> all

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.410 
year I'm just going to try to save all
of<00:00:42.149> these<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:43.260> how<00:00:43.379> far<00:00:43.620> they'll<00:00:43.800> get<00:00:43.980> me

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
of these and see how far they'll get me

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.380 
of these and see how far they'll get me
but<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:46.170> recently<00:00:47.070> found<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.820> it's

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but I recently found out that it's

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.110 
but I recently found out that it's
better<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.780> grow<00:00:49.440> onions<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.520> transplants

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
better to grow onions from transplants

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.689 
better to grow onions from transplants
or<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.260> seeds<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> start<00:00:53.190> yourself

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
or from seeds that you start yourself

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.200 
or from seeds that you start yourself
and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.149> transplant<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.500> look<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.850> some

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and then transplant so look for some

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.810 
and then transplant so look for some
Stuttgarter<00:00:57.840> seeds<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.980> turns<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.579> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
Stuttgarter seeds and it turns out that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
Stuttgarter seeds and it turns out that
stuttgarter<00:01:00.600> zeitung<00:01:02.390> ioan<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.570> they<00:01:04.019> grow

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
stuttgarter zeitung ioan and they grow

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.300 
stuttgarter zeitung ioan and they grow
better<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.769> north<00:01:05.810> they<00:01:06.810> divided<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> United

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
better up north they divided the United

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.179 
better up north they divided the United
States<00:01:08.549> into<00:01:08.970> thirds<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> top<00:01:09.750> third<00:01:10.189> you

nothing<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.670> suppose

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
nothing I suppose

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.580 
nothing I suppose
and<00:02:12.730> they're<00:02:13.390> actually<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.750> better<00:02:13.900> size<00:02:14.170> for

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
and they're actually a better size for

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.370 
and they're actually a better size for
me<00:02:14.740> because<00:02:15.160> I've<00:02:15.340> only<00:02:15.550> cooked<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.850> for<00:02:15.880> two

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
me because I've only cooked it for two

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.600 
me because I've only cooked it for two
so<00:02:17.380> I'll<00:02:17.530> let<00:02:17.620> them<00:02:17.740> dry<00:02:17.920> you<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.430> then

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
so I'll let them dry you out and then

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.200 
so I'll let them dry you out and then
weigh<00:02:18.790> them<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.150> see<00:02:19.480> what<00:02:19.630> I<00:02:19.660> got<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.940> here's

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
weigh them and see what I got so here's

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.270 
weigh them and see what I got so here's
what<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.390> ended<00:02:22.690> up<00:02:22.810> with<00:02:23.080> with<00:02:23.500> my<00:02:23.680> Stuttgarter

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
what I ended up with with my Stuttgarter

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.430 
what I ended up with with my Stuttgarter
onions<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.940> have<00:02:25.150> 10<00:02:25.780> pounds<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.260> two<00:02:26.410> ounces

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.580 
onions I have 10 pounds and two ounces
they<00:02:27.280> are<00:02:27.970> mighty<00:02:28.270> pitiful<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.290> guess<00:02:29.440> the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
they are mighty pitiful I guess the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.440 
they are mighty pitiful I guess the
average<00:02:29.950> ones<00:02:30.160> are<00:02:30.310> about<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.670> size<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
average ones are about this size and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.910 
average ones are about this size and
then<00:02:31.600> have<00:02:32.230> a<00:02:32.260> few<00:02:32.530> large<00:02:32.920> ones<00:02:33.120> but

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
then have a few large ones but

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.230 
then have a few large ones but
considering<00:02:35.920> that<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.760> are<00:02:36.850> long<00:02:37.060> day

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240
