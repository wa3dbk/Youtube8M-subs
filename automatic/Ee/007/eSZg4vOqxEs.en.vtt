00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:25.869 
television channel you're watching I'd

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.679 
television channel you're watching I'd
love<00:00:26.110> to<00:00:26.169> show<00:00:26.410> you<00:00:26.470> Liverpool<00:00:26.829> and<00:00:27.070> I<00:00:27.910> think

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
love to show you Liverpool and I think

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.089 
love to show you Liverpool and I think
we'd<00:00:28.809> be<00:00:28.899> added<00:00:29.140> but<00:00:29.439> the<00:00:29.529> end<00:00:29.649> of<00:00:29.739> Champions

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:30.099 
we'd be added but the end of Champions

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.380 
we'd be added but the end of Champions
think<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.340> might<00:00:30.520> be<00:00:30.550> more<00:00:30.759> difficult

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
think it might be more difficult

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.540 
think it might be more difficult
I<00:00:31.450> think<00:00:31.660> Lana<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.950> improvements<00:00:33.520> made

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
I think Lana the the improvements made

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.819 
I think Lana the the improvements made
in<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.910> squads<00:00:34.270> for<00:00:34.840> four<00:00:35.260> months<00:00:35.469> City<00:00:35.649> and

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
in the squads for four months City and

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.200 
in the squads for four months City and
Chelsea<00:00:36.250> it's<00:00:36.430> gonna<00:00:36.550> be<00:00:36.730> between<00:00:36.850> one<00:00:37.180> of

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
Chelsea it's gonna be between one of

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.330 
Chelsea it's gonna be between one of
them<00:00:37.390> too<00:00:37.629> and<00:00:37.870> because<00:00:38.530> I'd<00:00:38.649> like<00:00:38.770> to<00:00:38.829> put<00:00:39.129> as

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
them too and because I'd like to put as

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.130 
them too and because I'd like to put as
much<00:00:39.550> pressure<00:00:39.610> on<00:00:40.059> as<00:00:40.149> possible<00:00:40.629> I'm<00:00:40.930> gonna

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
much pressure on as possible I'm gonna

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.750 
much pressure on as possible I'm gonna
go<00:00:41.260> with<00:00:41.410> Chelsea<00:00:41.800> I<00:00:41.890> think<00:00:42.129> Marino's<00:00:42.520> gotta

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
go with Chelsea I think Marino's gotta

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.110 
go with Chelsea I think Marino's gotta
win<00:00:42.969> it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
win it

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.460 
win it
otherwise<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.780> job's<00:00:44.020> gonna<00:00:44.140> be<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.380> the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
otherwise this job's gonna be on the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:50.460 
otherwise this job's gonna be on the
line<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:48.610> we've<00:00:49.360> with<00:00:49.810> the<00:00:49.930> signs<00:00:50.140> we've<00:00:50.290> made

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
line if we've with the signs we've made

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.770 
line if we've with the signs we've made
now<00:00:50.680> no<00:00:51.100> but<00:00:51.579> I<00:00:51.640> think<00:00:51.760> we<00:00:52.000> will<00:00:52.239> strengthen<00:00:52.540> a

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
now no but I think we will strengthen a

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.990 
now no but I think we will strengthen a
bit<00:00:52.930> more<00:00:53.140> and<00:00:53.739> without<00:00:54.040> the<00:00:54.220> pressures<00:00:54.910> of

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
bit more and without the pressures of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.590 
bit more and without the pressures of
Champions<00:00:55.450> League<00:00:55.660> could<00:00:56.380> be<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.559> surprise<00:00:57.329> now

already<00:01:53.820> season<00:01:54.300> I'm<00:01:55.230> hoping<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:55.710> Alexis

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
already season I'm hoping that Alexis

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.180 
already season I'm hoping that Alexis
Sanchez<00:01:56.460> will<00:01:56.610> settle<00:01:56.910> a<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.540> better<00:01:58.200> than

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
Sanchez will settle a bit better than

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.330 
Sanchez will settle a bit better than
what<00:01:59.460> I<00:02:00.050> did<00:02:01.050> I<00:02:01.200> think<00:02:01.260> he<00:02:01.410> probably<00:02:01.710> will<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
what I did I think he probably will and

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
what I did I think he probably will and
I<00:02:02.400> think<00:02:02.430> he's<00:02:02.760> gonna<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:03.090> absolutely<00:02:03.330> class

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
I think he's gonna be absolutely class

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.870 
I think he's gonna be absolutely class
and<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:04.140> think<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:05.100> from<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.370> glimpses<00:02:05.820> of

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and I think just from the glimpses of

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.730 
and I think just from the glimpses of
him<00:02:06.120> that<00:02:06.240> I've<00:02:06.360> seen<00:02:06.570> so<00:02:06.810> far<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.140> think<00:02:07.260> he<00:02:07.590> can

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
him that I've seen so far I think he can

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.220 
him that I've seen so far I think he can
lie<00:02:07.920> up<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.190> Premier<00:02:08.520> League<00:02:11.690> yeah<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.110> know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
lie up the Premier League yeah you know

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.960 
lie up the Premier League yeah you know
you<00:02:13.290> gotta<00:02:13.770> be<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.130> win<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.370> haven't<00:02:14.700> ya

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
you gotta be in it to win it haven't ya

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.640 
you gotta be in it to win it haven't ya
I<00:02:15.000> think<00:02:15.210> I<00:02:15.270> probably<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.810> this<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.260> bad<00:02:16.440> but

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
I think I probably and this is bad but

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.200 
I think I probably and this is bad but
I'd<00:02:16.740> probably<00:02:16.920> rather<00:02:17.250> finish<00:02:17.520> bottom<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
I'd probably rather finish bottom of the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.370 
I'd probably rather finish bottom of the
tower<00:02:18.360> Champions<00:02:18.780> League<00:02:18.930> group<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.260> go

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
tower Champions League group then go

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:26.559 
tower Champions League group then go
into<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.710> day<00:02:20.160> really
