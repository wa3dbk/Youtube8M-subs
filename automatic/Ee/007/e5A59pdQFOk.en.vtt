00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.600 
Caterpie come on all of five okay I'll
see<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.680> can<00:01:43.829> work<00:01:43.860> with<00:01:44.040> here<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.430> guess

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
see what we can work with here I guess

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.480 
see what we can work with here I guess
so<00:01:45.180> what<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.390> need<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.600> do<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.869> use<00:01:46.170> growl<00:01:46.770> six

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
so what you need to do is use growl six

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.639 
so what you need to do is use growl six
times<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.360> will<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> speed<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.290> up<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
times on it will just speed this up a

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
times on it will just speed this up a
little<00:01:49.770> bit<00:01:49.979> here<00:01:50.220> because<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:51.149> is<00:01:51.509> pretty

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
little bit here because it is pretty

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.200 
little bit here because it is pretty

what you need to do well you need to get
this<00:03:02.310> thing<00:03:02.370> we<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.760> down<00:03:02.910> otherwise<00:03:03.209> it'll

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
this thing we can down otherwise it'll

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.960 
this thing we can down otherwise it'll
say<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.530> miss<00:03:04.650> the<00:03:04.799> Pokemon<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.310> with<00:03:05.819> it

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
say that you miss the Pokemon so with it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.180 
say that you miss the Pokemon so with it
using<00:03:06.269> trash<00:03:06.569> that's<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.560> pretty<00:03:07.860> good

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
using trash that's actually pretty good

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.789 
using trash that's actually pretty good
so<00:03:08.519> while<00:03:08.730> critical<00:03:09.180> hit<00:03:09.269> did<00:03:09.420> 1<00:03:09.810> HP<00:03:10.200> or<00:03:10.440> two<00:03:10.590> HP

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
so while critical hit did 1 HP or two HP

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.370 
so while critical hit did 1 HP or two HP
so<00:03:11.610> if<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.790> keep<00:03:11.910> using<00:03:12.060> growl<00:03:12.420> while<00:03:12.780> it<00:03:12.989> uses

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
so if you keep using growl while it uses

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.839 
so if you keep using growl while it uses
thrash<00:03:13.680> it's<00:03:13.980> gonna<00:03:14.099> hurt<00:03:14.340> itself<00:03:14.459> in

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
thrash it's gonna hurt itself in

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.880 
thrash it's gonna hurt itself in
confusion<00:03:15.299> event<00:03:15.630> well<00:03:15.780> it'll<00:03:16.080> get<00:03:16.470> confused

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
confusion event well it'll get confused

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.069 
confusion event well it'll get confused
eventually<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:18.299> will<00:03:18.420> hopefully<00:03:18.600> hurt

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
eventually and it will hopefully hurt

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.470 
eventually and it will hopefully hurt
itself<00:03:19.350> in<00:03:19.620> confusion<00:03:20.160> which<00:03:20.489> is<00:03:20.790> actually

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
itself in confusion which is actually

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.500 
itself in confusion which is actually
pretty<00:03:21.750> good<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.150> best<00:03:24.269> way<00:03:24.420> to

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
pretty good so that is the best way to

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:25.699 
pretty good so that is the best way to
weaken<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.840> down<00:03:24.959> otherwise<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.620> to

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
weaken it down otherwise it's going to

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.560 
weaken it down otherwise it's going to
say<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:25.890> miss<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.370> Pokemon<00:03:26.760> so<00:03:27.030> yeah<00:03:27.239> using

say you miss the Pokemon so yeah using

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.559 
say you miss the Pokemon so yeah using
prowl<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:28.489> weaken<00:03:29.489> down<00:03:29.640> its<00:03:29.880> attack<00:03:30.120> on<00:03:30.299> you

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569

going to use Thunder Wave now to sort of

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.920 
going to use Thunder Wave now to sort of
burn<00:04:22.500> some<00:04:22.800> turns<00:04:23.039> off<00:04:23.310> of<00:04:23.490> thrash<00:04:23.930> otherwise

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
burn some turns off of thrash otherwise

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.660 
burn some turns off of thrash otherwise
I<00:04:25.169> won't<00:04:25.289> be<00:04:25.500> able<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.919> attack

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
I won't be able to attack

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.310 
I won't be able to attack
well<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.240> kind<00:04:27.450> of<00:04:27.480> take<00:04:27.600> it<00:04:27.750> anyway<00:04:27.960> only<00:04:28.080> have

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
well I kind of take it anyway only have

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.740 
well I kind of take it anyway only have
tundra<00:04:28.620> shock<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:30.030> think<00:04:30.270> if<00:04:30.330> I<00:04:30.420> tackle

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
tundra shock and I think if I tackle

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.970 
tundra shock and I think if I tackle
with<00:04:30.810> anything<00:04:31.050> else<00:04:31.230> which<00:04:31.470> if<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.710> did<00:04:31.860> have

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
with anything else which if I did have

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.130 
with anything else which if I did have
an<00:04:32.100> attacking<00:04:32.370> move<00:04:32.670> it<00:04:32.820> probably<00:04:33.210> would<00:04:33.900> one

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
an attacking move it probably would one

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.510 
an attacking move it probably would one
shot<00:04:34.410> it<00:04:34.530> because<00:04:34.770> it's<00:04:34.920> on<00:04:35.010> level<00:04:35.280> one<00:04:35.490> and

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
shot it because it's on level one and

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.230 
shot it because it's on level one and
that's<00:04:35.760> an<00:04:36.140> unknown<00:04:37.140> level<00:04:37.560> really<00:04:37.890> in

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
that's an unknown level really in

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.320 
that's an unknown level really in
generation<00:04:39.240> one<00:04:39.510> so<00:04:40.730> annals<00:04:41.730> generation<00:04:42.210> to

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
generation one so annals generation to

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.030 
generation one so annals generation to
actually<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.140> it's<00:04:43.260> keeping<00:04:43.590> its

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
actually to so it's keeping its

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.740 
actually to so it's keeping its
continuing<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.790> use<00:04:44.880> thrash<00:04:45.180> which<00:04:45.450> is<00:04:45.570> good

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
continuing to use thrash which is good

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.900 
continuing to use thrash which is good
because<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.320> can<00:04:46.920> kind<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.190> wall<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.610> out<00:04:47.730> that
