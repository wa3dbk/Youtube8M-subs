00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.520
 still in the mood for nostalgia 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.010
 Let's see how the classic chevette is. 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.010
 shark of 1974 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:20.279
 almost a month has passed since this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.980
 1974 chevette a classic of the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.180
 national automobile industry 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.320
 has entered its first restoration 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 complete 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.019
 since leaving the production line of the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.019
 chevrolet 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:39.170
 the workshop responsible for the service was the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.170
 evolution car partner of the top level 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.410
 the service was done in detail 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.410
 first phase was the disassembly of the car 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.199
 then began the shop where the 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.850
 rust points accumulated in its 40 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.850
 years of life were withdrawn 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:09.299
 every detail of the body has received 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:12.290
 special treatment for professionals 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.869
 here they treat cars with a lot of affection 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.000
 literally analyzing each part for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.000
 that any defect is removed 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.689
 Another important phase was the choice of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.000
 a process that took time since 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.020
 finding the original color was no task 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.110
 easy 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.220
 in fact it had to be redone 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 drop boot until you get the right tone 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.780
 knowledge of the colorimetry this 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.200
 The professional responsible for this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.860
 fundamental in a kind of alchemy 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.799
 of colors 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.579
 he tests the mixtures until the 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.579
 desired result 

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:59.810
 the body has received the fund that guarantees 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:05.920
 the integrity of the bodywork and helps 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:09.259
 uniformity in work in service 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.819
 meticulous where again the hand of the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.819
 professional comes into play 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.560
 then it was time to paint the 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.040
 chevette in a modern greenhouse 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.690
 the ink was applied at one time 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.690
 ensuring quality in the final product 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.170
 the veteran gradually gained new 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.170
 color and life 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.650
 the interior was redone in the reno shop 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.340
 specialist in piloting and coating 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.890
 in leather, another partner of the auto news 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.720
 The initial design of our chevette was 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.280
 bring it back to originality 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.860
 first when you pick up a car 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 modified how do you do that to us 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.910
 You have to know how this car was 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.100
 made in the 70's which were the 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.930
 original features of that car 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.490
 or we will go after 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.560
 collectors of someone who has this 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.120
 car that has never been moved and we 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.740
 Look at the features of this car for 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.170
 try to bring and do the same but the most 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.320
 as close as possible to its originality 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.450
 banks are still original everywhere 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.070
 from foam to part of the back part of the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.350
 seat apart from the hardware 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.290
 are still original parts the difference 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.180
 with a coating that has already been 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.310
 it was even remade by the people themselves 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.130
 only a much clearer color a 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.740
 original and black black with black stitching 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.810
 this time instead of using a 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.150
 black synthetic leather we've opted for 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.360
 use a legitimate one even though it is not 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.760
 more like the original, it ends up having a 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.170
 finish very similar and sometimes the 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.970
 people make up we lost a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.070
 bit of originality of this car 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.200
 we will even keep a material that is 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.940
 material that is even more 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.800
 noble than that used in the car 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.600
 originally on ceiling lining 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.400
 We can already work with 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.530
 materials that are replicas of originals 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.520
 this was what we did in the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.400
 chevette 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.130
 we use a training is a beige well 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.630
 clear maybe even almost an ice that 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.600
 will obey the factory standard well 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.520
 even one is still an old ceiling ceiling 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.080
 all stuck with rods 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.660
 we got the original marks from the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.800
 car including all the finishes 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.960
 eaves 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.240
 is the way to stretch this ceiling and I passed 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.210
 it's being done, it's meant to be 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.640
 similar to the original and the 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.740
 formation of your car floor area 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.470
 we already knew that it was made in color 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.450
 What was left for us to do was 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.740
 we got a carpet the first time 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.930
 a lining was first made 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.360
 sound insulation we do not work 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.360
 a formation with the bitumen filter is 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.310
 for power 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.289
 to pass both ground noise and 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.120
 engine in the car on top of this 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.969
 we used a 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.400
 black carpet with trim 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:11.169
 also made of black 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.030
 try to get as close to the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.229
 its original formation that car that is 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.680
 of the 70's 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.240
 the result of this work will be shown 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.400
 here next week 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.229
 but if you are very curious and 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.629
 Living in Campo Grande can see 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.300
 personally the chevette in the event that 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.710
 happens this weekend at the base 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.529
 large field aerial 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:35.919
 at the auto evolution news booth 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:38.949
 store vino and wait that soon we will have 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:42.629
 more news of restorations and the car 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.629
 chosen may be your
