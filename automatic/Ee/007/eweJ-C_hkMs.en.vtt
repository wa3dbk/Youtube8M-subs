00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.589
 Hello co 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.740
 we already saw 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.449
 basic ideas about official writing 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.089
 its characteristics its applications we enter and unintentionally into a language 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:25.199
 more legal 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 I'm emphasizing content but leaving the club I'm trying 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.430
 even without dropping all that speak so much movement or 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.200
 Let's stop there. 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.800
 knowledge is never enough learning is important that you 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.630
 also wants to get to the last race and stays in a karaoke on Saturday 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.020
 this process but with the same 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.730
 I was holding my hand in March. 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.950
 so without further rondoniense 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.260
 complementary law 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.880
 when I say complementary law 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.590
 and this popular referendum want to be complementary after pressure for this 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.180
 yes we love 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.420
 supplementary law is sufficient that it is 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.740
 with absolute majority in the palm trees 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.950
 remembering the ordinary law that we have seen that I doubt last 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.290
 the next decade to be approved needs simple majority 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.150
 let's remember simple majority and the absolute majority 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.770
 absolute majority that the complementary law both speak of the approved cup 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.869
 and not half vote 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.160
 but again or again 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.850
 that is to say of all the members blood list 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.509
 when I speak simple majority is also the half plus one who never never 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.920
 needs to be all that are registered year 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 majority majority 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.259
 is to kill half more one of the possible that good to return and there 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.669
 there is no hierarchy between ordinary complementary law delegated law 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.710
 is a normative act done by the president of the republic and for this 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.499
 I need authorization from the legislature 

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:04.899
 is the presidency of the republic and can not 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:06.120
 work out 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.250
 acts 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.969
 are the exclusive competence of the national congress 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:14.509
 you can not legislate about career organization and ensure 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:18.309
 members of the public prosecutor's office 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.379
 also can not be subject of delegated law 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:26.629
 is that nationality citizenship individual electoral political rights 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:29.209
 also can not 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.870
 plans turi annual efec with samantha says 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.959
 problems between the plans that establishes spending measures and 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:39.919
 with a federal government 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:43.799
 by the federal government for four years provisional measure is a normative act 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.279
 with force of law that can be vetoed by the president of the republic in case of 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.599
 relevance and urgency of production and it is also subject to deliberation 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.939
 of the national congress, provisional measures have lost effectiveness 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:01.129
 since the recession if not converted into law within 60 days 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.799
 can be extended for another 60 days, then let's understand decree 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:10.799
 legislative acts that are subject to regulation in order to regulate such matters 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 are hypocritical exclusive to the national congress 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:18.529
 to understand the position the object of this legislative decree 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:23.559
 it is there in the constitution in Article 49 there legal talk said 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.769
 in the structure of the legislative decree 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.159
 go to the part 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.099
 Ansa before the title will have autonomy my foundation of authority now I will 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.479
 speak administrative decree samassa administrative and competence 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:42.540
 exclusive of the chief of the executive there we will have here and singular decrees 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.479
 Individual autonomous PTT regulators basically contain rules 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.889
 concrete 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.199
 it is easy to understand nationally regulated 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.779
 according to celso antônio flag of mello makes a ten interesting would be the 

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.389
 new owner of the manual 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.189
 he also says that 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:01.719
 is the difference between dem 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.009
 and Regulation 

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:05.570
 differentiation is simple 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.620
 now harvest the new law 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.310
 originally the legal system 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.190
 regulations do not have to change but to think 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.709
 because it is the principles of the law 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.049
 around mayors and governors in the area. 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.649
 but from a certain point in the race directly from the constitution 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.650
 concierge 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.509
 who issued ordinance are the ministers other authorities the ordinance and contain 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:37.370
 instructions on how to operate the service in addition to other 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.730
 artists after shooting handwriting as if it were faster with the lesion of zé 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:46.620
 Louis own failures in the specification of the tasf the correction 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.159
 the apostille will be in charge of the minister 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:56.090
 the secretary signatory of the ordinance handles it is made below the text 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.389
 there was this 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.600
 of the decree or ordinances 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.550
 after taking a little 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.400
 so that it does not overload the presidency of the republic 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.039
 with signature of repetitive acts 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:09.389
 also to avoid 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.270
 question the national press 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.610
 are known publications of acts 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.789
 already finished 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.789
 the toucan spoke in a sim dictionary 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.360
 about some terms 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.550
 first pair 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.439
 Do you know what to score? 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.939
 is the same as in 2005 the state assembly can not be separated into paragraphs 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:37.080
 the minutes can not contain the fights for the truth is a documented meeting 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.569
 certificate 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:40.749
 that's what these people are 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:45.279
 document for proof of fact the hobbies all files of the 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.349
 public service 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.749
 Paste according to ok 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.749
 is the ps directed to the servers so that is where it got there 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:55.879
 clarification of laws and decrees 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.419
 for other penalties circulates can also be called circular memo 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:04.340
 and there's more we have to surrender digital punishment 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.729
 that's right 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.180
 We already know well what is a public notice that is a burden to 

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:12.800
 opening a selection process 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.740
 is not true 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.740
 we have the definition of opinion 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:18.849
 To win 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:23.249
 which is the scientific technical floor on the subject the well for observation 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.729
 this seems to be already an integral part of a process we have to 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.569
 definition of application 

00:06:29.569 --> 00:06:35.419
 the official document in which the signatory of the document asks the 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:36.490
 all age 

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.759
 something that he Jewish 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:39.830
 dd 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.240
 I'll ask Tomé, remembering that he's speaking and official news 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.869
 in the application is good you do in third person 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:49.759
 report 

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.759
 duck did not come from a job 

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:56.810
 but not of a scientific technical nature 

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:00.229
 who told lg is going to attack but it seems 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.930
 these three definitions 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.930
 are basic because quickie 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:12.360
 I'm speaking badly about official writing and just some terms that we need 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.380
 of science 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:16.380
 because that yes it will be proved 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:23.879
 baiana anamara 

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:26.869
 now
