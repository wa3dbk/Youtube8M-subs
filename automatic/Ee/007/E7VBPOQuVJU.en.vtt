who's been where is he and I hang them
out<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> plane<00:01:36.479> threatening<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.049> just

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
out of the plane threatening to just

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.960 
out of the plane threatening to just
drop<00:01:37.619> him<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.100> plane<00:01:38.280> everyone's

give them an answer and then they

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
give them an answer and then they
realize<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> Bane<00:01:41.880> is<00:01:42.060> an<00:01:42.150> actual<00:01:42.390> fact<00:01:42.570> one

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
says um it will be painful for you and I

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.690 
says um it will be painful for you and I
has<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> little<00:01:55.829> pause<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.250> between<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.579> kind

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
has a little pause in between it's kind

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.889 
has a little pause in between it's kind
of<00:01:56.759> good<00:01:56.880> i<00:01:56.939> says<00:01:57.180> he<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.600> be<00:01:57.719> painful

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
of good i says he is it will be painful

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.550 
of good i says he is it will be painful
and<00:01:58.350> he<00:01:59.009> says<00:01:59.250> for<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.909> yeah<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.469> just

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and he says for you and yeah it was just

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.080 
and he says for you and yeah it was just
great<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:02.159> basically<00:02:02.340> a<00:02:02.579> plane<00:02:02.850> flies

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
great and then basically a plane flies

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.450 
great and then basically a plane flies
above<00:02:03.329> their<00:02:03.540> plane<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> hijacking

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
above their plane and it's a hijacking

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219 
above their plane and it's a hijacking
but<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.850> go<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.450> guys<00:02:06.659> rappel<00:02:07.049> down

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
but to go on these guys rappel down

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.479 
but to go on these guys rappel down
start<00:02:07.500> shooting<00:02:07.799> through<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.920> glass<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
start shooting through the glass and

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.040 
start shooting through the glass and
they<00:02:09.030> attach<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:10.020> plane<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> plane<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
they attach the plane to the plane of

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.080 
they attach the plane to the plane of
and<00:02:11.320> then<00:02:11.740> they<00:02:11.830> blow<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.220> wings<00:02:12.430> off<00:02:12.640> with

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and then they blow the wings off with

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then they blow the wings off with
like<00:02:13.270> c4<00:02:13.540> so<00:02:14.380> it's<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.740> known<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.100> the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
like c4 so it's just a known as the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.950 
like c4 so it's just a known as the
plane<00:02:15.370> being<00:02:15.580> carried<00:02:15.850> along<00:02:16.300> by<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.690> plane

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
plane being carried along by the plane

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.070 
plane being carried along by the plane
above<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.730> which<00:02:18.730> was<00:02:18.940> a<00:02:18.970> great<00:02:19.390> sequence<00:02:19.780> is<00:02:19.990> a

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
above it which was a great sequence is a

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.420 
above it which was a great sequence is a
brilliant<00:02:20.410> sequence<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.040> they're<00:02:21.130> basically

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
brilliant sequence and they're basically

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.970 
brilliant sequence and they're basically
bit<00:02:21.730> bein<00:02:22.060> in<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.450> dock<00:02:22.660> grabs<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.410> doctor<00:02:23.770> and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
bit bein in the dock grabs a doctor and

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.980 
bit bein in the dock grabs a doctor and
they<00:02:24.430> get<00:02:24.640> repelled<00:02:25.000> out<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.690> I'm<00:02:25.810> hanging

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
they get repelled out and I'm hanging

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.080 
they get repelled out and I'm hanging
like<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.650> top<00:02:26.860> plane<00:02:27.100> while<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.580> bath<00:02:27.880> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
like on the top plane while the bath the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.610 
like on the top plane while the bath the
bottom<00:02:28.330> plane<00:02:28.480> that's<00:02:28.660> got<00:02:28.840> hijacked<00:02:29.260> it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
bottom plane that's got hijacked it's

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.410 
bottom plane that's got hijacked it's
just<00:02:29.770> left<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.070> fall<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.610> get<00:02:30.820> destroyed<00:02:31.150> and

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
just left to fall and get destroyed and

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.540 
just left to fall and get destroyed and
there's<00:02:31.930> a<00:02:31.990> brilliant<00:02:32.680> sequence<00:02:33.100> now<00:02:33.490> as

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
there's a brilliant sequence now as

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.950 
there's a brilliant sequence now as
rumors<00:02:33.880> going<00:02:34.090> around<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.600> sequence

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
rumors going around that that sequence

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.360 
rumors going around that that sequence
is<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.110> hundred<00:02:35.350> percent<00:02:35.410> real<00:02:35.740> but<00:02:36.100> it's<00:02:36.250> not

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
is a hundred percent real but it's not

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.820 
is a hundred percent real but it's not
it's<00:02:36.580> not<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:36.850> CGI<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:37.960> real<00:02:38.590> living

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it's not like CGI is like real living

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.190 
it's not like CGI is like real living
did<00:02:39.010> that<00:02:39.130> for<00:02:39.250> real<00:02:39.400> if<00:02:39.580> that's<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.090> case

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
did that for real if that's the case

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.990 
did that for real if that's the case
wasn't<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.350> best<00:02:41.500> scenes<00:02:41.770> ever<00:02:41.980> shot<00:02:42.370> trust

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
wasn't the best scenes ever shot trust

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.580 
wasn't the best scenes ever shot trust
me<00:02:43.150> mean<00:02:43.360> when<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> watch<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.990> you're<00:02:44.320> blown

away by and blow I'll be blown away even

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.840 
away by and blow I'll be blown away even
more<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.500> know<00:02:47.620> realize<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.340> ninety

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
more if it is you know realize it ninety

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.330 
more if it is you know realize it ninety
percent<00:02:48.970> real<00:02:49.360> then<00:02:49.900> I'm<00:02:50.830> still<00:02:51.100> be<00:02:51.160> blown

can't see being hundred n reel is

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.650 
can't see being hundred n reel is
blowing<00:02:54.460> the<00:02:54.640> wings<00:02:54.820> off<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.060> plane<00:02:55.360> but<00:02:55.510> the
