they're<00:01:48.000> very<00:01:48.270> accurately<00:01:48.780> placed<00:01:49.200> there's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
they're very accurately placed there's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580

button<00:01:52.920> here<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.329> look<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.659> this

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
button here and then if we look on this

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.929 
button here and then if we look on this
side<00:01:55.049> we've<00:01:55.320> even<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.680> stones<00:01:56.040> placed<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.759> the

volume rocker which makes it a little

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.679 
volume rocker which makes it a little
bit<00:01:58.770> difficult<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> find<00:01:59.790> but<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> definitely

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bit difficult to find but it definitely

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
bit difficult to find but it definitely

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
crystals over it and we unlock it like

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.479 
crystals over it and we unlock it like
so<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.760> then<00:03:00.090> we've<00:03:00.239> got<00:03:00.419> sort<00:03:00.629> of<00:03:00.719> dual<00:03:01.019> based

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
so and then we've got sort of dual based

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.729 
so and then we've got sort of dual based
overlay<00:03:02.489> on<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.299> interface<00:03:04.230> here<00:03:04.469> this<00:03:04.650> is

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
overlay on the interface here this is
