 i 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.260
 Hello everyone here your good friend Andrew 7 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.750
 bringing you my new video that is titled 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.880
 read the top part do not be hollow 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 x good if they read the top 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.290
 They will know that my video will be a criticism 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.750
 good pokemon without further waste of time 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.059
 let's start with the good video 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.830
 surely everyone has seen pokemon and the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.260
 which is not because it is someone who did not have a 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.300
 childhood fuck xd well let's admit 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.250
 that before pokemon was a great series that 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.440
 we were all excited to see each chapter 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.000
 although it was repeated xd but all 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.040
 we know that with the passage of time 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.140
 Pokémon has become very repetitive 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.270
 it's always the same shit that gets us 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.460
 it's always like this making a miserable 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.649
 attempt to win the pokemon league but 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.450
 wait for me I like pokemon asshole not 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.610
 I will let you get involved with my anime 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.530
 favorite here is my super attack of 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.690
 tom fast fucking fucking alone 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.110
 Try it asshole and you'll see how it goes 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 xd 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.770
 well now that I got rid of ibar and 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.960
 I will continue with my criticism of good 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 he kept saying that pokemon always 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 it's the same mother does not change anything before 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.229
 I liked seeing what new pokémon came out 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.570
 but now they are all pokémons of 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.550
 forms made to the race x of in addition 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
 every time they take out more attacks that I do not know 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.869
 like shit an animal can do 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 similar thing xd to me I liked the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.470
 pokemons up to the third generation 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.500
 but those of now are a big shit 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.170
 well let's go to the next point the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 new main characters to always 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.160
 he is the protagonist as we all know 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.530
 but the new companions are very 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.360
 stupid since they replaced brock 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 and friendship and it's not the same way 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 acceptable but after that pendejada 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.390
 from down to iris is not the same anymore with the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.310
 green hair that I do not even know how 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.289
 it's called just I know it's a bad 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.240
 imitation of brock because it is also a 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.700
 gym leader who joined ace for 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.410
 accompany him with his trip iris I do not know what 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.330
 shit is also they say that in the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.730
 white pokemon or I do not know if it's black 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.709
 she is a gym leader I started 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.360
 play you are versions in my emulator 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.190
 but when I played them I only got to 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.450
 third gym or I do not remember what 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.760
 gym was but it was 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.129
 an airport with a big tower and I said 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.620
 what the fuck is this is a total shit 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:30.629
 it's not the same without the old pokemon 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.790
 it's just strange the old 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.650
 pokemon what satoshi tajiri became 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.140
 a total shit good now at 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.760
 next point the games good I admit 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.650
 that from club and rules new versions 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.480
 they have been improving until you can 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.610
 fight with coaches from around the 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.800
 world and all that but now it's much more 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.630
 difficult to complete the pokédex since if 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.610
 you do not have a certain version you can not 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.410
 complete and you stay like this forever or 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.480
 until you buy the new version and 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.370
 every time the pokemon are more difficult 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.680
 of getting either if some only get 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.599
 find at night or by event wifi in 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.579
 the personal thing I do not like very much the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.560
 new Pokémon games more than when 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.420
 I played the black pokemon or I do not remember if 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.269
 I was white when I saw the triple battle 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.220
 I said but what the fuck is this and something else 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.230
 what the fuck is there is a vampire that because 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.329
 never grow old I do not think I've done 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.970
 all that adventure shit in one 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:20.040
 year xd and what happened to pikachu because 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.440
 that I remember pikachu was chubby not 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.690
 that pikachu all toothpick xd 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.459
 in addition it becomes more mediocre every time 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.290
 I understand why you only go 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.420
 carries his strongest pokemones 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.310
 a single league and so maybe have a chance 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.109
 of winning it, but always only 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.659
 takes pikachu and captures the first 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.370
 pokemon that appears to him of good 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.829
 So much for my video hope you there 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.450
 liked and if not then I'm not interested xd 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.069
