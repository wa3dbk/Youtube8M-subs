00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
it and took it to the beach probably it

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.780 
it and took it to the beach probably it
is<00:01:03.199> ridiculously<00:01:04.199> good<00:01:04.409> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.650> beach<00:01:04.830> loose

is ridiculously good at the beach loose
and<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.450> will<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:06.810> hop<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.530> dunes<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and it will just hop over the dunes it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
and it will just hop over the dunes it
will<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.310> skip<00:01:08.729> over<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:09.420> nothing<00:01:09.570> if

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
will just skip over like it's nothing if

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.750 
will just skip over like it's nothing if
it<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> four<00:01:10.979> wheel<00:01:11.159> drive<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.640> would

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
it was four wheel drive it would

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.609 
it was four wheel drive it would
probably<00:01:12.060> struggle<00:01:12.600> because<00:01:12.810> i<00:01:12.869> took<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.140> /<00:01:13.380> to

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
probably struggle because i took my / to

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
was going to be my bashing so I'll be

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.140 
was going to be my bashing so I'll be
changing<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.440> lot<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.370> it's<00:03:34.760> going<00:03:35.090> to

probably get worn out but it's going to

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.340 
probably get worn out but it's going to
be<00:03:37.580> totally<00:03:37.910> worth<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.630> it's<00:03:38.989> going<00:03:39.290> to

be totally worth it and it's going to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.620 
be totally worth it and it's going to
