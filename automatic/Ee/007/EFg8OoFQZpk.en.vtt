00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.680
 zero point 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.130
 friends how about we give you our 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.050
 greet them my name yohanan díaz vargas 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.630
 thank you very much for joining me in this 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.450
 comment of this day that we are going to 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.760
 dedicate to the popocatépetl volcano and these 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.760
 unidentified flying objects that 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.619
 So much noise they make and what they have called so much 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.840
 the attention of the community or to 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.480
 international level but there are also 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.070
 to stand out from the news here in 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.640
 the Mexican Republic that now what 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.650
 address 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.300
 in a serious way in a way 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.580
 objective and good because it was in October 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.010
 2012 that there were two important issues 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.440
 within the agenda of the phenomenon at the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.690
 international on the one hand the arrival of 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.110
 end of the world on December 21 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.500
 of 2012 where you will remember that you 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.500
 he assured that it came now if the end 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.629
 of the world the final judgment and many others 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.840
 things that were said words that 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.060
 they used and it's been good five 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 months and until now it did not happen 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.130
 absolutely nothing and on the other side 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.500
 we have the presence of UFOs around 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.340
 to the volcano popocatépetl objects of 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.880
 different 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:25.150
 structures colors light manifestation 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.220
 that suddenly good because it 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.450
 they became a point of discussion and 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.070
 analysis between the means of 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.200
 most important communication in the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.810
 Mexico this course 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.360
 generated that from that moment thousands 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.700
 of eyes will start to flip with greater 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.560
 frequency towards the volcano in search of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 these flying objects and even 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.760
 they went to light the 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.430
 testimonies of residents surrounding the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.290
 region of 'la son mont and as well as 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.350
 voices of UFO investigators and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.560
 contacted with beings from other planets 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.720
 who coincide do you listen well 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.330
 who agree on the possible 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.270
 existence of an extraterrestrial base 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.010
 inside the amazing wow volcano this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 especially when disclosure 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.030
 scientific community says gentlemen there 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.070
 that we prudently have to have 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.600
 very careful but what happens 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.130
 when there are photos that what happens 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.110
 when there are videos what is happening 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.880
 when the testimonies are there, what 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.850
 happens then is that it brings us to 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.990
 consider precisely what there is 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.570
 the intention and interest and there we see it 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.910
 there we see it clearly good because 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.040
 these anomalous objects it seems that 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.230
 enter the volcano popocatépetl what 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.240
 it seems that these craters come out 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.070
 flying objects and when the 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.330
 scientists 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.640
 precisely those who affirm that no 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.180
 it is an extraterrestrial base that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.160
 there is no investigation 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.860
 scientific either national or others 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.470
 countries in this place then what what 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.640
 we must be what we owe from 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:00.550
 think and why we have not ventured and 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.970
 we affirm that precisely that there is a 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.890
 base there in the popocatépetl volcano of 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.490
 beings that come from other parts of the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.740
 universe to see how it is 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.560
 acting in what way is 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 interacting with humans this 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.330
 volcano the eternal guardian of our 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.540
 country 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.790
 it is said that these objects are there for 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.580
 control the goyo activity and it's 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.800
 that in December of 1994 maybe you 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.630
 remember it was the last time that the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.510
 eternal guardian recorded an explosion 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.300
 that produced gas and ash that came to 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.420
 more than 25 kilometers away without 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.760
 However, on May 7 the little 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.830
 he woke up again throwing ashes at 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.710
 more than 3.2 kilometers high and 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.470
 Incandescent fragments at 700 meters 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.030
 of the crater approximately according to 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.460
 this data then with the center 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.260
 national disaster prevention 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:00.640
 recorded an episode of tremor 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.190
 spasmodic spasmodic tremor if what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.820
 we could consider shaking during 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.680
 approximately eight hours for eight 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.320
 hours and good as the ashes arrived 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.850
 to 10 municipalities in southern Tlaxcala and 20 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.650
 municipalities southeast of town 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.340
 mainly in the Tehuacán area 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.590
 which is 135 kilometers away 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.990
 roughly from the crater and although the 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.030
 activity of the volcano decreased at 5 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.510
 from the morning of last Wednesday 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.670
 8 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.710
 in May the researchers and by 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:32.290
 of course the watchers of heaven are 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.360
 more than attentive to what may happen or 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.460
 see the ones around this 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.380
 volcano because you have to remember that the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.140
 experience tells us that there are great 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 possibilities of UFO presence during 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:46.390
 the moments of greatest activity of gift 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.400
 goyo so well then you have to be at 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.890
 pending and limitation for you if 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.260
 have a photograph some video not 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.000
 get it here to networks of a 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.250
 ossuary server you find me
