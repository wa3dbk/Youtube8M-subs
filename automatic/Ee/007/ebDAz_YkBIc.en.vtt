myself I lead with HIPAA dining is with

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.370 
myself I lead with HIPAA dining is with
gengar<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.540> I<00:00:09.540> don't<00:00:09.870> really<00:00:10.019> know<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.290> the

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
gengar and I don't really know what the

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.660 
gengar and I don't really know what the
scan<00:00:10.559> guard<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.800> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.519> i'm<00:00:11.639> just

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
scan guard is going to do so i'm just

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.910 
scan guard is going to do so i'm just
going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.910> sub<00:00:12.090> stealth<00:00:12.509> rocks<00:00:12.840> i<00:00:13.200> expect<00:00:13.830> to

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
going to sub stealth rocks i expect to

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.750 
going to sub stealth rocks i expect to
hypnosis<00:00:14.340> but<00:00:15.949> i'm<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.070> quite<00:00:17.369> sure<00:00:17.400> what

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
hypnosis but i'm not quite sure what

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.099 
hypnosis but i'm not quite sure what
you're<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.330> use<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> in<00:00:18.720> power

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you're going to do and use it in power

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.710 
you're going to do and use it in power
and<00:00:20.100> it's<00:00:20.340> super<00:00:20.640> effective<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.390> know<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and it's super effective so I know it's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.890 
and it's super effective so I know it's
either<00:00:21.990> hidden<00:00:22.350> power<00:00:22.590> ice<00:00:22.859> or<00:00:23.160> grass<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.380> I'm

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
either hidden power ice or grass and I'm

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.029 
either hidden power ice or grass and I'm
thinking<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:28.289> likely<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.800> hidden

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
thinking it's more likely to be hidden

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.319 
thinking it's more likely to be hidden
power<00:00:29.310> ice<00:00:31.099> for<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.430> know<00:00:32.550> obvious<00:00:32.940> reasons

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
power ice for you know obvious reasons

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.290 
power ice for you know obvious reasons
so<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.800> decide<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> switch<00:00:35.460> into<00:00:35.760> something

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
so I decide to switch into something

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.290 
so I decide to switch into something
that<00:00:36.450> would<00:00:36.630> help<00:00:36.930> me<00:00:37.110> find<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:38.059> which<00:00:39.059> hidden

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that would help me find out which hidden

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.270 
that would help me find out which hidden
power<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.840> without<00:00:40.170> taking<00:00:40.800> loads<00:00:41.190> of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
power it is without taking loads of

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
power it is without taking loads of
damage<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.570> would<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:43.110> gyarados<00:00:46.039> use

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
damage and that would be my gyarados use

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
damage and that would be my gyarados use
it<00:00:47.190> again<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> because<00:00:48.780> it's<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.140> normal<00:00:49.350> hit

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
it again and because it's a normal hit

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
it again and because it's a normal hit
that<00:00:49.829> means<00:00:49.980> it's<00:00:50.100> hidden<00:00:50.250> power<00:00:50.460> ice<00:00:51.710> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that means it's hidden power ice so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.520 
that means it's hidden power ice so
that's<00:00:52.829> good<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.190> know<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> here<00:00:55.260> i<00:00:55.320> switch

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that's good to know so here i switch

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.410 
that's good to know so here i switch
into<00:00:55.739> something<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.820> going<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.300> absorb

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
into something that is going to absorb

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.770 
into something that is going to absorb
the<00:00:58.370> inevitable<00:00:59.370> thunderbolt<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.510> that's

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the inevitable thunderbolt and that's

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.490 
the inevitable thunderbolt and that's
Garchomp<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:02.510> I<00:01:03.510> fitness<00:01:03.989> stay<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.290> here

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
Garchomp and I fitness stay in here

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
Garchomp and I fitness stay in here
because<00:01:04.949> normally<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.850> cars<00:01:06.060> are<00:01:06.210> faster<00:01:06.570> but

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
because normally in cars are faster but

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.899 
because normally in cars are faster but
mine<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> choice<00:01:07.470> scarf<00:01:07.770> Garchomp<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.640> there

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
mine is a choice scarf Garchomp so there

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:16.429 
mine is a choice scarf Garchomp so there
goes<00:01:09.119> his<00:01:09.420> gengar<00:01:09.990> who<00:01:10.860> for<00:01:11.070> me<00:01:14.869> so<00:01:15.869> he<00:01:15.990> sins<00:01:16.229> in

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
goes his gengar who for me so he sins in

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.450 
goes his gengar who for me so he sins in
his<00:01:16.470> own<00:01:16.920> Garchomp<00:01:17.580> here<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:19.220> I<00:01:20.220> have<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
his own Garchomp here and I have to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.820 
his own Garchomp here and I have to
switch<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:21.110> because<00:01:22.110> I'm<00:01:22.380> locked<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
switch out because I'm locked in a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.200 
switch out because I'm locked in a
crunch<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.310> didn't<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.850> do<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> whole

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
crunch which didn't kind of do a whole

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.109 
crunch which didn't kind of do a whole
lot<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> Garchomp<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:26.040> I<00:01:26.490> switch<00:01:26.759> out<00:01:26.939> to

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
lot to a Garchomp and I switch out to

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.950 
lot to a Garchomp and I switch out to
Celebi<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> physical<00:01:28.080> wall<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.350> mine<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.930> for<00:01:30.930> a

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
Celebi a physical wall of mine and for a

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.140 
Celebi a physical wall of mine and for a
second<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> thought<00:01:31.820> Celebi<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.939> going

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
second there I thought Celebi is going

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.330 
second there I thought Celebi is going
to<00:01:33.210> sweep<00:01:33.390> his<00:01:33.509> entire<00:01:33.810> team<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:35.040> didn't<00:01:35.250> have

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
to sweep his entire team he didn't have

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
to sweep his entire team he didn't have
some<00:01:35.579> weight<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.119> didn't<00:01:36.450> seem<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.840> have<00:01:36.900> any

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
some weight you didn't seem to have any

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.330 
some weight you didn't seem to have any
way<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.320> counter<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:39.590> play<00:01:40.590> well<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.070> he

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
way to counter it I play well but he

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.940 
way to counter it I play well but he
plays<00:01:41.579> really<00:01:41.909> well<00:01:42.229> when<00:01:43.229> he<00:01:43.409> kills<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
plays really well when he kills this

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
plays really well when he kills this
thing<00:01:44.250> so<00:01:45.799> this<00:01:46.799> Lobby<00:01:47.130> has<00:01:47.280> she<00:01:47.549> made<00:01:47.820> myself

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
thing so this Lobby has she made myself

be<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.570> much<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.689> non-factor<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.470> this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
be pretty much a non-factor in this

be pretty much a non-factor in this
battle<00:01:49.979> its<00:01:50.399> entire<00:01:50.759> next<00:01:51.450> few<00:01:51.659> minutes<00:01:51.899> is

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
battle its entire next few minutes is

00:01:52.259 --> 00:02:02.980 
battle its entire next few minutes is
kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.680> pointless<00:01:52.860> actually

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.870 

Alista<00:02:03.990> shows<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.740> potency<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.370> Celebi

how<00:02:11.880> much<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.210> problem<00:02:12.450> would<00:02:12.690> be<00:02:12.720> for<00:02:13.050> him

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
how much of a problem would be for him

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.880 
how much of a problem would be for him
people<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.060> mean<00:02:15.780> they<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:15.959> very<00:02:16.200> there<00:02:16.770> are

some<00:02:17.040> things<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.370> can<00:02:17.520> counter<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.880> Celebi

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
some things that can counter this Celebi

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.800 
some things that can counter this Celebi
but<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:18.990> whole<00:02:19.200> lot<00:02:23.090> so<00:02:24.090> here<00:02:24.330> switches<00:02:24.660> out

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
but a whole lot so here switches out

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.840 
but a whole lot so here switches out
like<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.140> pretty<00:02:25.290> much<00:02:25.350> has<00:02:25.620> two<00:02:28.850> things

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
like you pretty much has two things

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.900 
like you pretty much has two things
about<00:02:30.030> it<00:02:30.150> quite<00:02:30.360> some<00:02:30.570> time<00:02:30.750> now<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:34.910> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
about it quite some time now and the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:42.680 
about it quite some time now and the
eventually<00:02:36.450> switches<00:02:36.900> in<00:02:37.760> registeel<00:02:41.690> by

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
eventually switches in registeel by

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:49.559 
eventually switches in registeel by
always<00:02:42.959> thinking<00:02:43.320> about<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.560> for<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.830> while

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and I take the opportunity to call mind

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.670

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
physical wall and I kill him with a

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.760 
physical wall and I kill him with a
second<00:05:28.240> earthquake<00:05:28.440> I'm<00:05:29.440> just<00:05:29.560> kind<00:05:29.740> of

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
second earthquake I'm just kind of

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.860 
second earthquake I'm just kind of
surprised<00:05:30.100> I<00:05:30.430> didn't<00:05:31.000> know<00:05:31.060> we'd<00:05:31.210> be<00:05:31.240> a<00:05:31.360> to<00:05:31.570> AKO

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
surprised I didn't know we'd be a to AKO

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.290 
surprised I didn't know we'd be a to AKO
I<00:05:31.990> thought<00:05:32.260> would<00:05:32.350> be<00:05:32.410> like<00:05:32.680> a<00:05:32.710> three<00:05:32.980> hit<00:05:33.100> KO

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
I thought would be like a three hit KO

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.950 
I thought would be like a three hit KO
but<00:05:34.300> what's<00:05:34.690> kind<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:34.900> cool<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:37.630> he<00:05:37.720> switches

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
but what's kind of cool and he switches

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.590 
but what's kind of cool and he switches
in<00:05:38.200> infernape<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.100> I'm<00:05:39.730> expecting<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.330> grass

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
in infernape and I'm expecting the grass

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:46.080 
in infernape and I'm expecting the grass
knot<00:05:42.180> or<00:05:43.560> another<00:05:44.560> similar<00:05:45.100> move<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:45.760> I<00:05:45.850> switch

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
knot or another similar move so I switch

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.909 
knot or another similar move so I switch
any<00:05:46.270> Karo<00:05:46.540> dose<00:05:47.640> and<00:05:49.050> he<00:05:50.050> takes<00:05:50.290> a<00:05:50.650> lot<00:05:50.890> of

damage from Grass Knot but looking at
the<00:05:53.169> hip<00:05:53.290> points<00:05:53.440> I<00:05:53.650> know<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:53.830> can<00:05:54.100> survive

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
the hip points I know I can survive

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.909 
the hip points I know I can survive
another<00:05:54.580> one<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:55.660> I'm<00:05:55.780> just<00:05:55.960> going<00:05:56.169> to<00:05:56.320> go<00:05:56.470> with

sandstorm<00:06:00.880> as<00:06:01.150> I<00:06:01.210> expected<00:06:01.540> but<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:01.990> worth

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:02.169 
sandstorm as I expected but it's worth

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.900 
sandstorm as I expected but it's worth
it<00:06:02.320> because<00:06:02.950> you<00:06:03.190> would<00:06:03.280> need<00:06:03.400> to<00:06:03.520> getting<00:06:03.729> rid

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910
