behind why I play the chord the way that

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.250 
behind why I play the chord the way that
I<00:00:28.680> do<00:00:28.910> when<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:29.939> first<00:00:30.330> started<00:00:30.750> playing<00:00:30.929> guitar

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
I do when I first started playing guitar

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.549 
I do when I first started playing guitar
I<00:00:31.910> remember<00:00:32.910> learning<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.480> G<00:00:33.690> chord<00:00:33.960> or<00:00:34.440> an

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
I remember learning the G chord or an

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590 
I remember learning the G chord or an
abbreviated<00:00:35.130> way<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> learn<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.940> G<00:00:36.090> chord<00:00:36.300> and

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
abbreviated way to learn the G chord and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.780 
abbreviated way to learn the G chord and
thinking<00:00:37.320> if<00:00:37.500> these<00:00:37.680> two<00:00:37.860> chords<00:00:38.280> don't<00:00:38.430> start

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
thinking if these two chords don't start

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.119 
thinking if these two chords don't start
getting<00:00:38.969> easier<00:00:39.690> fast<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:40.649> no<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:41.010> I'm

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
getting easier fast there's no way I'm

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.220 
getting easier fast there's no way I'm
gonna<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> guitar<00:00:41.940> player<00:00:42.239> but<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.960> want<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
there are really three fingers that I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.040 
there are really three fingers that I
typically<00:00:59.219> use<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.969> G<00:01:00.149> chord<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.930> it's

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
typically use in the G chord but it's

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
typically use in the G chord but it's
not<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.590> three<00:01:01.890> fingers<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.460> most

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
not the same three fingers that most

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.060 
not the same three fingers that most
people<00:01:03.120> use<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.780> very<00:01:03.989> first<00:01:04.290> G<00:01:04.559> chord<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
people use the very first G chord that I

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.730 
people use the very first G chord that I
learned<00:01:05.400> was<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.299> three<00:01:06.869> finger<00:01:07.080> chord<00:01:07.560> that

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
learned was a three finger chord that

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.760 
learned was a three finger chord that
looked<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.380> exactly<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.560> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
looked just like this exactly like this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.940 
looked just like this exactly like this
and<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.220> had<00:01:11.490> my<00:01:11.790> middle<00:01:12.090> finger<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.560> low<00:01:13.710> E

that to you it's one that you need to
know<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.479> well<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.110> that's<00:01:44.009> where<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> would

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
know as well and that's where I would

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
know as well and that's where I would
simply<00:01:44.700> take<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.060> ring<00:01:45.420> finger<00:01:45.869> move<00:01:46.409> it<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.680> to

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
simply take my ring finger move it up to

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.969 
simply take my ring finger move it up to
the<00:01:46.920> B<00:01:47.159> string<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.970> third<00:01:48.210> fret<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.979> then

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the B string on the third fret and then

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
the B string on the third fret and then
take<00:01:50.520> my<00:01:50.640> pinky<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.390> place<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.229> where<00:01:52.380> my<00:01:52.560> ring

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
take my pinky and place it where my ring

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.429 
take my pinky and place it where my ring
finger<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.579> so<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> big<00:01:55.049> full

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
finger was so that you have a big full

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.330 
finger was so that you have a big full
four<00:01:56.130> finger<00:01:56.610> g<00:01:57.149> chord<00:01:57.570> sounds<00:01:57.990> like<00:01:58.110> this

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.850 

and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> progressed<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.409> got<00:02:04.560> more

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and then as I progressed and got more

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
and then as I progressed and got more
and<00:02:05.009> more<00:02:05.100> into<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.549> bluegrass<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
and more into the bluegrass in the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.979 
and more into the bluegrass in the
country<00:02:07.049> side<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.560> things<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.599> got<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.660> little

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
country side of things I got a little

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
country side of things I got a little
lazy<00:02:10.679> perhaps<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.940> really<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.930> was<00:02:13.050> just<00:02:13.080> a

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lazy perhaps but really it was just a

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.860 
lazy perhaps but really it was just a
change<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.489> I<00:02:14.640> made<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.450> help<00:02:15.599> in<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
change that I made to help in the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
change that I made to help in the
particular<00:02:16.170> style<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:17.010> wanted<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.550> play

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
particular style that I wanted to play

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.410 
particular style that I wanted to play
and<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.450> actually<00:02:19.010> lifted<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.489> index<00:02:20.970> finger

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and I actually lifted my index finger

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.900 
and I actually lifted my index finger
off<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.410> string<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.459> don't<00:02:23.519> use

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
off of that a string and I don't use

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.839 
off of that a string and I don't use
that<00:02:24.200> index<00:02:25.200> finger<00:02:25.260> anymore<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.220> my<00:02:26.250> G<00:02:26.580> chord

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
that index finger anymore in my G chord

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.140 
that index finger anymore in my G chord
in<00:02:27.030> most<00:02:27.690> cases<00:02:28.110> now<00:02:28.980> you<00:02:29.040> might<00:02:29.310> say<00:02:29.610> well

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
in most cases now you might say well

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.759 
in most cases now you might say well
that<00:02:30.180> wouldn't<00:02:30.690> sound<00:02:30.959> right<00:02:31.319> to<00:02:31.560> have<00:02:31.739> that

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
that wouldn't sound right to have that

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.640 
that wouldn't sound right to have that
big<00:02:32.160> honkin<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.940> string<00:02:33.750> going<00:02:33.989> during<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.410> G

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
big honkin a string going during the G

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.180 
big honkin a string going during the G
chord<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.340> wouldn't<00:02:36.650> it's<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.860> sound

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
chord and it wouldn't it's not sound

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.880 
chord and it wouldn't it's not sound
good<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.819> would<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.150> correct<00:02:39.299> but<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.739> way

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
good you would be correct but the way

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.100 
good you would be correct but the way
that<00:02:41.040> we<00:02:41.160> make<00:02:41.340> up<00:02:41.519> for<00:02:41.549> that<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.750> bottom

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
that we make up for that is the bottom

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.500 
that we make up for that is the bottom
part<00:02:43.319> of<00:02:43.560> our<00:02:43.709> middle<00:02:44.040> finger<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:45.030> fleshy

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
part of our middle finger that fleshy

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.240 
part of our middle finger that fleshy
part<00:02:45.989> I<00:02:46.920> will<00:02:47.610> lightly<00:02:47.940> grace<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.200> over<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.980> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
part I will lightly grace it over that a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.360 
part I will lightly grace it over that a
string<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.880> mute<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.810> deaden<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.220> that

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
string and mute it deaden it so that

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.640 
string and mute it deaden it so that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
reasons why I do that first of all when

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
stuff I like to accent the first beat of

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.119 
stuff I like to accent the first beat of
the<00:03:23.659> measure<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.049> one<00:03:24.409> way<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.709> we<00:03:24.799> can<00:03:24.950> do

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
the measure and one way that we can do

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.390 
the measure and one way that we can do
that<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.760> hammer<00:03:26.390> on<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:27.110> these<00:03:27.560> G<00:03:27.920> chords

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
that is to hammer on to these G chords

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.180 
that is to hammer on to these G chords
okay<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.629> what<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:29.840> will<00:03:30.110> do<00:03:30.260> at<00:03:30.409> the<00:03:30.530> very<00:03:30.739> first

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
okay so what I will do at the very first

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.740 
okay so what I will do at the very first
beat<00:03:31.459> of<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.609> measure<00:03:31.819> instead<00:03:32.390> of<00:03:32.569> just

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
beat of the measure instead of just

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.730 
beat of the measure instead of just
playing

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:36.740 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.250 

I<00:03:36.800> will<00:03:37.490> sometimes<00:03:37.760> reach<00:03:38.330> up<00:03:38.600> and<00:03:38.840> with<00:03:39.050> my

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
I will sometimes reach up and with my

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.700 
I will sometimes reach up and with my

then for my very first note I will
hammer<00:03:47.480> onto<00:03:48.050> that<00:03:48.170> third<00:03:48.440> fret<00:03:48.770> sounds<00:03:49.100> like

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
hammer onto that third fret sounds like

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
that chord the only ones that I'm not in

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.130 
that chord the only ones that I'm not in
control<00:06:07.520> of<00:06:07.790> are<00:06:08.750> this<00:06:08.930> middle<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:10.310> g<00:06:10.580> strings

control of are this middle and g strings
the<00:06:12.140> same<00:06:12.470> rule<00:06:12.860> applies<00:06:13.250> whenever<00:06:13.550> I<00:06:13.730> want<00:06:14.000> to

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 
the same rule applies whenever I want to

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:16.000 
the same rule applies whenever I want to
mute<00:06:14.360> up<00:06:14.600> so<00:06:15.170> then<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.350> lot<00:06:15.470> of<00:06:15.560> times<00:06:15.740> when<00:06:15.920> I'm

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
mute up so then a lot of times when I'm

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.810 
mute up so then a lot of times when I'm
getting<00:06:16.130> into<00:06:16.520> some<00:06:16.730> syncopated<00:06:17.510> rhythms

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
getting into some syncopated rhythms

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.030 
getting into some syncopated rhythms
I'll<00:06:19.820> lift<00:06:20.120> my<00:06:20.360> fingers<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.050> kill<00:06:21.440> a<00:06:21.680> lot<00:06:21.710> of

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.090 

it's<00:06:28.510> a<00:06:28.540> very<00:06:28.780> good<00:06:28.990> technique<00:06:29.380> anyway<00:06:29.950> I<00:06:30.040> just

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
it's a very good technique anyway I just

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.830 
it's a very good technique anyway I just
wanted<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.580> take<00:06:30.700> a<00:06:30.760> minute<00:06:31.000> or<00:06:31.270> a<00:06:31.360> few<00:06:31.720> minutes

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.380 
wanted to take a minute or a few minutes
to<00:06:32.350> explain<00:06:32.740> why<00:06:33.010> I<00:06:33.040> play<00:06:33.490> my<00:06:33.640> G<00:06:33.850> chord<00:06:34.150> that

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
to explain why I play my G chord that

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.780 
to explain why I play my G chord that
way<00:06:34.570> sometimes<00:06:35.320> when<00:06:35.890> the<00:06:35.980> song<00:06:36.190> calls<00:06:36.460> for<00:06:36.730> it

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
way sometimes when the song calls for it

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.700 
way sometimes when the song calls for it
I<00:06:37.210> will<00:06:37.480> go<00:06:37.600> back<00:06:37.750> to<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:38.050> traditional<00:06:38.650> way

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710
