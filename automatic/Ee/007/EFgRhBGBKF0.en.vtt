00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 we come back with more 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.179
 abc rural 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.099
 let's go to the correspondence block 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.410
 but first I want to remind you something because 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.230
 they also ask us why 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.210
 trades the eggs are out of the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.329
 refrigerator 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.480
 in Paraguay the normal temperature that 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:26.210
 we have is above 30 degrees 35-40 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.329
 as now for that reason if the eggs 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.059
 were refrigerated when leaving the 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.879
 local automatically start at 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.940
 warm and transpire when you reach the 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 house is the wet waterfall and that makes 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.129
 that the people's skin gets dirty 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.800
 want to clean them and that causes damage 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.340
 to egg quality because they open 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.010
 the pores that's why it's good to look at 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.379
 date that was egg packaging have it 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.769
 in the carton take to the refrigerator and there 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.750
 yes keep in mind that just there is 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.719
 they can start processing the eggs 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.920
 Let's go to Mr. Ricardo's letter 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.990
 vázquez who wrote us to rural 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.940
 abc.com.py and asks us for a material about 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.000
 cultivation of grass in the garden 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.090
 it's a very interesting topic because the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.460
 housewives and the gentlemen who work 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.050
 in the garden they ask us what they are 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.300
 the problems they have because they do not 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.970
 walk the grass let's check with 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.070
 someone and knows a lot about the subject that is the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.880
 engineer Ricardo to 20 who was going to talk 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.270
 of the care and cultivation of grass in 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270
 the garden 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.290
 or not 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.130
 and today we can talk a little 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.550
 briefly and in a practical way about the 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.330
 better the correct follow up for 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:57.090
 plant pastures see lawn that is all 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.310
 a subject the engineer explains the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.720
 importance of an adequate system of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.420
 watering to have a good grass another 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.360
 fundamental element in the pasture for its 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.000
 correct development is the amount of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:17.489
 water that we can provide the grass 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.620
 you need a lot of water a lot of water and it's 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.090
 a concept of common sense as they are 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.680
 grass and have very very roots 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.510
 superficial on the ground do not go anymore 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.450
 beyond 8 centimeters from the ground 5 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.250
 centimeters then of course for the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.380
 evapotranspiration that generates the soil 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.630
 by the heat by the sun on 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.610
 everything in the summer makes the water in 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.410
 the first 5 or 10 centimeters are 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.420
 evaporate and that soil in those first 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.450
 centimeters what is dry so that 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.940
 let's ensure a good grass development 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.980
 shadow as we want to tell you sometimes in 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.540
 our pasture on our lawn is 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.239
 fundamental 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.910
 hours of sunlight and a correct system 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.260
 no irrigation water does will lack the 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.720
 first five centimeters of soil 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.970
 One aspect to take into account is the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.430
 leveling the soil once done 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.650
 correct preparation of the soil that is 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.819
 fundamental for the grass especially 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.549
 as I was saying by the first 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:15.909
 centimeters of roots that the grass has 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:19.540
 what we have to do is ensure the 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:22.810
 soil leveling because once you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.159
 we raise the grass if we do not ensure its 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.379
 correct to leveling for the 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.480
 water circulation then we are going to 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.370
 have water retention problems in 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.109
 certain sectors pockets water in the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.819
 sectors sectors of the garden or the 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:35.319
 professional 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.690
 shows how the 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:40.930
 planting the grass the two forms 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.060
 plantations are the plantation being weighted 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.739
 in breads as we call it here that are 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.590
 bread the one that more or less have 15 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.770
 centimeters on each side 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.230
 square that is purchased 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.930
 it costs approximately 10000 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.360
 guaraní the meter bought when we go to 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.720
 place on the floor we have that 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.340
 place 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:05.050
 well together one of the others a good bread 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.950
 next to the other side that happens and 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.050
 we place very separated then they go to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.650
 create some furrows in the grass and that 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.829
 will generate small channels that are 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.030
 very flashy and very ugly in the aspect to 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.829
 make sure that those breads are well 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.340
 together one from the other 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:28.240
 subsequently we watered and watered 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:30.460
 very deeply once the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.470
 water has penetrated well into the ground 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.930
 has absorbed well from the loaves with a 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.240
 mallet with a wooden mallet usually 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.790
 we called floors hit him 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.400
 what would be the practical effect and how the 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.200
 bread dough like the grass brings a 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.500
 surface of about five centimeters of 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:48.650
 ground 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.350
 that soil if it is very dry remains hard 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.210
 is hard because of the idea of ​​once 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.190
 planted places a single gift so that 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 acquire plasticity to make it more 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.490
 manageable as it was humid at 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.040
 hit him with the floor what we do 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.350
 we expanded those loaves placed and they remain 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.780
 perfectly united with one another 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:08.180
 finally the engineer talks about others 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.910
 systems of planting the grass to another 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.890
 planting form the least common because 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.010
 takes more time in its development is the 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.220
 planting in seedlings with seedlings 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.810
 what it means is to bring the seedlings of 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.540
 grass the grass has rhizomes that 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.419
 they go long then they are cutting in 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.700
 every root intersection and with that 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.520
 we took and transplanted 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.340
 where we want to implement our 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.430
 lawn having a system is more economical 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.800
 because it does not generate us costs of 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.350
 transportation but that's why it's much more 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:45.500
 slow also in its development that is a 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.720
 implantation in seedlings so that it takes 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.720
 a total and general coverage of our 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.300
 grass in summer we would need about three 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.449
 approximately months 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.740
 it's pretty much this in seedlings 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.810
 it also requires much more security in 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.050
 the contribution of water, that is, we do not have 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.750
 to leave you without water remember that a 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.360
 dish that has gone up a cut trauma and 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.129
 has just been placed so it 's that 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.409
 grass needs a period of time 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:19.590
 prudential to start generating roots 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.590
 to develop within the soil
