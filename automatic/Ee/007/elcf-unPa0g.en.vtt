00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.500
 believe these regions 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:17.150
 the special program on their 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:17.150
 writing is starting but one responds to me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.930
 in July it was back there and I waited 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.140
 patiently for five months 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.379
 but it's time it 's time to release 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.579
 of assassin's creed goal and actions 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.850
 pedigree unit 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.360
 then today i responded to the special 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.360
 dark 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.550
 they are fields the hen guinea fowl that 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.290
 everything for this show I separated 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.880
 some curiosities in general that several 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.470
 people are telling you to take 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.770
 the last questions before arriving at 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.840
 shop but the cisco go home my brother 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.250
 starting with the assassin's creed goal and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.380
 many of you have asked your 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.630
 The full armor used is the same as the 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.820
 adwords picks up near the end of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 yes, maybe so 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.180
 contextualizing the games if 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.979
 pass in very close 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 assassin's creed black flag he is there 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.560
 some decades before the access that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.630
 turned space more or less in 1956 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.660
 so you will see a lot in 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.210
 between these games and also with the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.090
 assassin's creed and three would actually be 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.229
 the end of this trilogy will then have 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.970
 a lot of things tied up 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.340
 will have a lot in common and will have 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.869
 a lot of new things such as something 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.810
 which you may not have noticed until 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.280
 Now the cold can catch you in the game. 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.320
 take a look at the videos we have 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.270
 already on the channel here on youtube when 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.120
 I got hit in the water until it starts. 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.450
 whiten and that gives you the time goes 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.690
 make up the Catholic frozen nose 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.640
 Baggage gets a new way 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.360

 people copy online for four people 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.510

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.040
 there are a lot of people answering some 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.959
