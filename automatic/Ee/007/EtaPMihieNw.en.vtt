00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.179
 with whip because I want to introduce myself 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:28.520
 and we have special science cooks by 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.520
 please let the man in black 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.330
 to sing 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:43.309
 this is already seen well seen 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.629
 let's show how thanks to a 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 glass ceramic we can do magic vale 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.229
 we have here an induction vitro that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.299
 works in the following way for the 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.549
 people who do not know this plate has 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:04.229
 an electric coil that is generating 

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:06.090
 electricity below and generates a field 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.190
 magnetic that is transmitted to the container 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.630
 that we put over is worth inside this 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.159
 vessel with the magnetic field it 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.690
 create electricity currents that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.110
 they heat the container and that's why 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.110
 we can cook 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.960
 but we can also do the following 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.180
 let's place 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.610
 this aluminum plate that we have here 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.140
 here are two remove one and we are going to put 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.580
 This glass of medium is worth because 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.650
 we have said the magnetic field that 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.020
 generates the coil is transmitted to the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.940
 aluminum and when creating currents 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 electrical inside another field is created 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.119
 magnetic direction opposite to 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:39.540
 magnetic field that we had created 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 before 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.700
 first thing very well 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.220
 in the opposite direction although we had and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.220
 suddenly 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:14.230
 and you have no idea of the guide 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:14.230
 from the program when I go shit 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.319
 the trafficker 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.310
 we can only create too 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.260
 electricity ok we have here about 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.520
 normal cables and current hooked 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.260
 to a diode there is no battery or anything with 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.610
 which would be impossible for this to look 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.940
 video what we have but if what 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.940
 we place 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.840
 in the electric current enee stays 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.249
 inside the cable is enough for 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.469
 the diome is understood and we can put 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:45.650
 everything we want to do the tree 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.650
 christmas 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.310
 at home 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.680
 Imagine 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:33.530
 and this is very much in line with what 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.239
 we were talking about let's put 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.340
 prove this that we have here that are 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.050
 water purification filters is worth 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.090
 this filter got to have water 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.849
 that it is not potable to make it drinkable 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.019
 It is worth eliminating 99.9 percent of the 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.550
 bacteria that has water and 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.920
 balls and we're going to put it to the test 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.120
 first with a normal soda and 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.110
 current so you can see the effect that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:00.130
 It's worth here I'll be able to see the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.130
 puddles and well I was not too afraid 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.959
 we encourage we do not say brands we'll just say 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:08.590
 that is not bic and now let's try to 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.769
 see how 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.780
 see how he filters it and lets see the other 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.410
 even if it is not we are used to 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.410
 we have one night 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.190
 very little but not only and the taste the 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.750
 taste of know less than it should 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.480
 but now let's take it to the extreme and 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.940
 let's make a soup of poison 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.830
 here you have different elements please 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.340
 to alberto 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.919
 this fish tank 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.919
 I dedicate a lot 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:09.590
 a sand flavor with stones next to the 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.389
 spending puddle water sarkozy that 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.389
 authentic the puddle is good 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:27.720
 it has cost you a band of 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:31.190
 bathe in time 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.680
 finally the star element 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.680
 this is rabbit shit 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.600
 and now is when we really would like 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.600
 know if brown 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.500
 really eliminates 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.390
 and you are doing well 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:20.270
 slowly 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.480
 of space for time to filter 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.480
 all right 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:31.560
 gross 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:34.550
 clean people are putting 8 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.550
 Wow 

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:47.240
 and a little bit more but the cockles of 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.240
 the bad ones also enclose the plants 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:55.389
 we all want
