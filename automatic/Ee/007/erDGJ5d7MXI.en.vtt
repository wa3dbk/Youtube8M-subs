 with the preparation in a hot pan 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.509
 let's make these rich whiting 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.899
 they're from acapulco in the north we're not 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.210
 very familiar with these rich 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.210
 preparations and for that and I like it a lot 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.610
 prepare them because we have the advantage 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.770
 well that at a national level we can 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
 see and now internationally that the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 good internet and you can see us in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.940
 anywhere in the world so I 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.190
 I tell you that it's seafood and it's 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.730
 delicious onion 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.030
 Garlic 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.750
 let's put fish is white fish 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.760
 the fish that you find more more 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:13.010
 cool and economical because that we are going to use 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.160
 exactly then see how rich it is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.140
 to chop as finite as possible between 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.620
 matt and nito the filling will be more 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:26.150
 soft then there we already smell 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.630
 delicious and nothing else is onion and garlic a 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.630
 little bit of salt then imagine that 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.900
 you are whiting, they are like golden tacos 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.470
 but 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.920
 of fish in some places make them 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.770
 of raw dough 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.959
 of corn of course they make the tortilla 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.200
 then they put the filling and fry them 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:52.280
 as if they were quesadillas then 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:55.520
 well let's put delicious tomato 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.069
 olive that is the key I think of this 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.610
 stew chile a little bit of oregano let's go 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.740
 to put cilantro or the grass that you 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.460
 want to use 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.440
 let's put a little bit of nail and 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.200
 Well, I've been talked about in some 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.480
 places you put cinnamon as you see it 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.020
 cinnamon skin will also be left 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.250
 delicious very well a little broth 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:27.980
 of chicken or fish stock and so is going to 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.560
 combine all the ingredients very well 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.210
 then I will retire already smells rich 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.610
 now you can make tacos you can 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.770
 make quesadillas but today I 'm going to 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.300
 show how whiting is done 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.400
 then we take a corn tortilla 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.030
 how is it 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:50.390
 preferably that this freshly 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.409
 made or can you reheat in the 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:57.950
 microwave in a very plastic bag 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:04:00.910
 important then we take a few sticks 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.150
 of wood 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.480
