 micro usb to a direct connector of 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.220
 hdmi output to be able to connect it to 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.200
 our television good the tie as 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.560
 I told them it's pretty simple for the part 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.080
 from behind - and tells us a little about 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.009
 characteristic of this product which 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.899
 there are two basic objectives that we 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.350
 deliver and that I know they do not make me 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.090
 delivery at the time of being using it 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.429
 let's take out what is the wrapper of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.880
 the box as you can see does not have 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:37.039
 absolutely nothing in the instructions 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.110
 brought her from behind in the box so 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.020
 let's leave aside to focus 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.940
 basically in the post of sites like 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.530
 you can see here we have it we are going to 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.679
 take out of practical that covers it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.869
 decline to move and that we do not know 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.170
 Blame inaugurated the shot that took 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.549
 well as you can see it's pretty simple 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 mhl mobile high definition 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.330
 then as you can see 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.050
 it's very simple I come back guys here 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.990
 we have what is the output of hdmi and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.360
 more time than for what is the output 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.600
 well of the TV that comes out an h 20 and 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.970
 that enters or leaves directly from the 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.790
 accessory we had the micro input 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.670
 usb for the device I'm going to what it is 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.540
 a microusb ticket also which 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 they must connect our charger 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.820
 as the mobile phone charger or 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.480
 connected very directly micro goes up to 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.880
 device 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.030
 then to the correct one so that it works 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:42.270
 here we have a comparison more or less 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.920
 sport eligible in values ​​and how 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.350
 They could see what we compared with Samsung 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.170
 galaxy s2 and it's pretty small here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.140
 we have what is the comparison with the 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.620
 Original samsung galaxy s2 charger 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.860
 and we are still very very small have 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.709
 an approximate measurement of 5 centimeters 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.760
 so it makes it pretty easy enough 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.739
 to be used 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.989
 good here we have the charger which is 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.629
 connects to the current obviously and 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.000
 new plug in what is the output of your 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.020
 charger what is a micro usb it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.660
 plug into what is the device 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.380
 and that we have bought and that we are 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.230
 analyzing in am m hl is connected from this 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.480
 way in what is micro input your 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.880
 time and obviously we are going to connect it to what 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.220
 what is the current for it to work and 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.180
 then the next step is going to be 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.330
 connect what is health follows hdmi 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.310
 and put estrada in this case to what is 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.010
 the device is connected from 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.590
 TV and then to the output ready 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 data then we have to connect what 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.320
 is the micro sd input of data at 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.930
 what is the team and here is not going to 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.460
 appear a picture of how it will look 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.280
 finally with the state of the body 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.880
 towards the setup financed to have wellber 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.760
 and the connection is quite simple and so 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.880
 everything will automatically come out of 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.670
 our television that is the image of in 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.800
 this case of galaxy s2 we are 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.100
 projecting directly stalin just from 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:20.250
 any device that allows the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.350
 using a connector to external 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.960
 to make other passes in the image 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.070
 they grab up there so it's good you 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:33.150
 generates that followed the unboxing and analysis 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:35.010
 hl detector for devices with a
