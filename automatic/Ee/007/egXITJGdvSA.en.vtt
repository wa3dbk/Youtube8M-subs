00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.680
 prostitution 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.680
 the years have passed 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:07.570
 despite her parents' homesickness, she never 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:11.780

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.000
 the searches 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.690
 wishing a poster of looking for himself in 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.080
 any place where he would allow him to 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.899
 poster had put his own 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.490
 photo written below 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:40.610
 I still love you, come home. 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:44.810
 the same happened without any news 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.270
 until one day a row of soup for the 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.670
 needy people 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.490
 the girl saw the photo and her mother who despite 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.100
 to have aged quite a lot 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.429
 kept the same look she 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.160
 kept in their memories can not 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:04.910
 contain the emotion and on that same day 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.209
 He came back home and it was late at night. 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:13.420
 When she arrived shy, she approached the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:17.240
 door and hit but she left alone 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.250
 she came in scared frightened by the idea 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.360
 that some thief had invaded the 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.510
 House 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.260
 and God knows what they could have 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.570
 made the river to the room and saw his mother 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.470
 sleeping, woke up 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.600
 they both cried hugged 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.660
 reconcile the ones remembering the door 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.210
 when the girl said 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.440
 The mother tea was so scary. 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:48.709
 when I arrived because my daughter is 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.450
 the front door was open and I 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.220
 I thought some thief had invaded 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.980
 the House 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.010
 You need to take more care but do not 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.510
 You can forget the open door. 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.989
 No, my love, you do not understand me. 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:08.209
 I have not forgotten the door open since the day 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.970
 Where did you leave? 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.970
 This door has never been closed again. 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:30.580
 It is true that the kiss has changed to the 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.060
 his father when he was still far from his 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:39.520
 father and moved with passion and beautiful 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:44.400
