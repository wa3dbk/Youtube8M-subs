here now remember that lying button I

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.060 
here now remember that lying button I
was<00:02:27.400> referring<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.870> what<00:02:29.320> I<00:02:29.590> was

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
was referring to this is what I was

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.770 
was referring to this is what I was
talking<00:02:30.670> about<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.330> basically<00:02:31.660> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
talking about so this is basically a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.600 
talking about so this is basically a
line<00:02:32.170> jack<00:02:32.560> right<00:02:32.830> here<00:02:33.040> now<00:02:33.220> what's<00:02:33.490> this

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
line jack right here now what's this

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.670 
line jack right here now what's this
line<00:02:33.850> jack<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.900> line<00:02:35.110> jack<00:02:35.320> for<00:02:35.560> is

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
line jack for this line jack for is

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.650 
line jack for this line jack for is
basically<00:02:36.010> you<00:02:36.070> can<00:02:36.220> plug<00:02:36.460> in<00:02:36.640> other<00:02:37.240> devices

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
basically you can plug in other devices

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.720 
basically you can plug in other devices
so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.560> like<00:02:38.710> stream<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.250> sound<00:02:39.490> from

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
so you can like stream the sound from

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.240 
so you can like stream the sound from
your<00:02:39.940> device<00:02:40.390> all<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:40.990> way<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.709> stereo

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
your device all the way to the stereo

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.850 
your device all the way to the stereo
system<00:02:42.430> right<00:02:42.790> here<00:02:43.090> for<00:02:43.390> example<00:02:43.600> one<00:02:44.020> time<00:02:44.260> I

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
system right here for example one time I

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.820 
system right here for example one time I
used<00:02:45.160> it<00:02:45.370> was<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.120> plug<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.510> some<00:02:46.830> composite

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
used it was to plug in some composite

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.400 
used it was to plug in some composite
audio<00:02:48.190> plugs<00:02:48.550> in<00:02:48.760> there<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.270> then<00:02:49.810> I<00:02:49.959> hooked

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
audio plugs in there and then I hooked

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.600 
audio plugs in there and then I hooked
up<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.740> Nintendo<00:02:51.190> GameCube<00:02:51.459> to<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:51.970> to<00:02:53.610> put

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
up the Nintendo GameCube to it to put

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.370 
up the Nintendo GameCube to it to put
this<00:02:54.850> play<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.450> sound<00:02:55.690> through<00:02:55.959> the<00:02:56.050> stereo

this play the sound through the stereo

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.600 
this play the sound through the stereo
system<00:02:56.500> right<00:02:56.770> here<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.160> can<00:02:57.340> use<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
system right here so I can use the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.420 
system right here so I can use the
cassette<00:02:58.000> player<00:02:58.709> right<00:02:59.709> here<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.070> record

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.970 
time
you<00:04:26.980> had<00:04:27.870> push-button<00:04:28.870> simultaneously<00:04:29.800> is

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
you had push-button simultaneously is

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.520 
you had push-button simultaneously is
when<00:04:30.280> you're<00:04:30.550> recording<00:04:30.970> so<00:04:31.750> overall<00:04:32.170> this<00:04:32.470> is

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
when you're recording so overall this is

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.560 
when you're recording so overall this is
a<00:04:32.680> great<00:04:32.920> stereo<00:04:33.400> system<00:04:33.820> I'm<00:04:33.970> not<00:04:34.000> sure<00:04:34.360> if
