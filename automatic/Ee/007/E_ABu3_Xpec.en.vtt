00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the bleeder valve and as I do it I'll

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.929 
the bleeder valve and as I do it I'll
push<00:01:30.659> down<00:01:30.929> here<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.319> the<00:01:31.409> pedal<00:01:31.939> sending

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
push down here on the pedal sending

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.019 
push down here on the pedal sending

the reservoir they used fluid reservoir
and<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.869> close<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.409> bleeder<00:01:40.619> valve

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
and I will close the bleeder valve

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.830 
and I will close the bleeder valve
before<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> let<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.670> back<00:01:41.849> up<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.539> don't<00:01:42.719> want

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
before I let this back up you don't want

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.330 
before I let this back up you don't want
to<00:01:43.020> suck<00:01:43.229> any<00:01:43.349> air<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.979> system

otherwise<00:01:44.609> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.179> start<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.569> over

00:01:45.589 --> 00:01:45.599 
otherwise you have to start all over

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:50.300 
otherwise you have to start all over
again<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.340> again<00:01:47.569> I'll<00:01:48.569> open<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.310> push

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
again so again I'll open this up push

again so again I'll open this up push
down<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> pedal<00:01:51.119> gently<00:01:51.599> and<00:01:51.779> let<00:01:51.929> some

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
down on the pedal gently and let some

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.169 
down on the pedal gently and let some
fluid<00:01:52.349> come<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.679> I'll<00:01:52.979> close<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.429> before<00:01:54.149> I

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
fluid come out I'll close that before I

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.839 
fluid come out I'll close that before I
let<00:01:54.599> this<00:01:54.719> back<00:01:54.959> up<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.679> I'll<00:01:56.249> do<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> until

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
let this back up and I'll do that until

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.489 
let this back up and I'll do that until
I<00:01:56.969> get<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.270> down<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.719> near<00:01:57.959> the<00:01:58.079> bottom<00:01:58.289> of

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
I get this down to near the bottom of

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.669 
I get this down to near the bottom of
the<00:01:58.619> reservoir<00:01:59.240> then<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.479> will<00:02:00.719> torque<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.499> to

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
the reservoir then I will torque that to

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.529 
the reservoir then I will torque that to
eight<00:02:01.799> Newton<00:02:02.130> meters<00:02:02.429> sorry<00:02:02.969> six<00:02:03.239> Newton

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
eight Newton meters sorry six Newton

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.010 
eight Newton meters sorry six Newton
meters<00:02:03.829> and<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:05.369> will<00:02:05.659> fill<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.810> up<00:02:06.869> with

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
meters and I will fill this up with

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.320 
meters and I will fill this up with
d-o-t<00:02:07.590> type<00:02:07.799> four<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.250> using<00:02:08.520> pin<00:02:08.729> Tosun<00:02:09.119> made

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
d-o-t type four I'm using pin Tosun made

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.630 
d-o-t type four I'm using pin Tosun made
in<00:02:09.450> Germany<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.200> best<00:02:10.440> it's<00:02:11.430> full

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
in Germany it's the best it's full

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.200 
in Germany it's the best it's full
synthetic<00:02:11.880> dot4<00:02:12.780> type<00:02:13.320> brake<00:02:13.560> fluid<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.210> then

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
synthetic dot4 type brake fluid and then

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.730 
synthetic dot4 type brake fluid and then
I'll<00:02:15.330> snug<00:02:15.570> these<00:02:15.720> down<00:02:15.780> put<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.470> cover<00:02:16.650> back

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
I'll snug these down put the cover back

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.790 
I'll snug these down put the cover back
on<00:02:17.070> and<00:02:17.250> we're<00:02:17.550> done

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800
