with it then we watch system number two

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.549 
with it then we watch system number two
and<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.730> one<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.179> deck<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.540> California<00:00:13.139> this

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559

Sierras<00:00:15.330> we're<00:00:15.690> watching<00:00:16.049> for<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.710> 8<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.039> 10

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
Sierras we're watching for about 8 to 10

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.470 
Sierras we're watching for about 8 to 10
inches<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.730> snow<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.270> up<00:00:18.359> in

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
inches of snow when you get up in

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.300 
inches of snow when you get up in
elevation<00:00:18.930> up<00:00:19.050> above<00:00:19.320> about<00:00:19.529> seven<00:00:19.920> or<00:00:20.160> eight

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310

elevation up above about seven or eight
thousand<00:00:20.789> feet<00:00:20.910> so<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> going<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.720> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
thousand feet so this is going to be one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.570 
thousand feet so this is going to be one
to<00:00:22.050> watch<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.470> then<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> course<00:00:22.949> we<00:00:23.310> have<00:00:23.430> that
