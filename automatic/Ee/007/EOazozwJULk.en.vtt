00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
hey guys Dave Kincaid with Abel cine

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.020 
hey guys Dave Kincaid with Abel cine
here<00:00:22.350> were<00:00:22.710> at<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.190> Zeiss<00:00:23.400> booth<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.910> we're

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
here were at the Zeiss booth and we're

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.090 
here were at the Zeiss booth and we're
talking<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.870> Zeiss<00:00:25.080> guys<00:00:25.320> about<00:00:25.800> their

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.100 
talking to the Zeiss guys about their

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.420 
talking to the Zeiss guys about their
new<00:00:26.370> digital<00:00:26.970> motor<00:00:27.210> driver<00:00:27.860> for<00:00:28.860> the<00:00:28.950> compact

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:29.430 
new digital motor driver for the compact

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.410 
new digital motor driver for the compact
zoom<00:00:29.670> line<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:31.290> motor<00:00:31.530> drive<00:00:31.830> is

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
zoom line so this motor drive is

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.820 
zoom line so this motor drive is
mountable<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.660> any<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> compact<00:00:34.470> zooms

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
mountable on any of the compact zooms

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.250 
mountable on any of the compact zooms
each<00:00:35.760> zoom<00:00:36.060> will<00:00:36.239> have<00:00:36.360> its<00:00:36.480> own<00:00:36.600> base<00:00:36.960> plate

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
each zoom will have its own base plate

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.170 
each zoom will have its own base plate
will<00:00:38.010> show<00:00:38.130> you<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.670> know<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:38.940> bit<00:00:39.030> of

will show you I you know a little bit of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.850 
will show you I you know a little bit of
details<00:00:39.510> about<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.960> as<00:00:40.080> well<00:00:40.260> each<00:00:40.530> zoom<00:00:40.710> has

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
details about that as well each zoom has

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
we have the ability to drive it with a

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.189 
we have the ability to drive it with a
canon<00:00:50.550> zoom<00:00:50.670> demand<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.449> fujinon<00:00:51.930> zoom

canon zoom demand or a fujinon zoom
demand<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:53.040> also<00:00:53.190> could<00:00:53.400> do<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
demand we also could do it with a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.290 
demand we also could do it with a
Preston<00:00:54.059> if<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.239> wanted<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.970> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
Preston if we wanted to and this is a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.720 
Preston if we wanted to and this is a
mock-up<00:00:57.720> uh<00:00:57.900> but<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.230> now<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:59.040> not<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.519> full

the lenses quick releasing it on and off
of<00:01:35.790> each<00:01:36.030> one<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.480> quick<00:01:36.690> release<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> via

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
of each one you can quick release it via

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.350 
of each one you can quick release it via
just<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.160> little<00:01:38.700> Lieber<00:01:38.820> arm<00:01:39.090> right<00:01:39.300> here

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
just the little Lieber arm right here

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.510 
just the little Lieber arm right here
pushing<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.410> it<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.680> then<00:01:40.980> turning<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
pushing in on it and then turning it

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.270 
pushing in on it and then turning it
that's<00:01:41.730> what<00:01:41.940> locks<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.960> we're<00:01:43.920> able<00:01:44.010> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
that's what locks it so we're able to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.910 
that's what locks it so we're able to
quickly<00:01:44.610> sis<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> off<00:01:45.510> of<00:01:45.540> any<00:01:46.020> of<00:01:46.350> our<00:01:46.530> any
