Giardia a coli and it filters that stuff

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.639 
Giardia a coli and it filters that stuff
down<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> about<00:00:50.100> 0.1<00:00:50.879> micron<00:00:51.600> absolute<00:00:52.320> so

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
down to about 0.1 micron absolute so
