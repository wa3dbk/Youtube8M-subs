it's<00:00:04.560> not<00:00:04.799> like<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.220> have<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.580> an<00:00:05.700> amazing

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
it's not like you have to be an amazing

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.870 
it's not like you have to be an amazing
draftsman<00:00:07.170> now<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> animate<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.160> 3d<00:00:08.550> and

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
draftsman now to animate in 3d and

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.610 
draftsman now to animate in 3d and
that's<00:00:09.150> been<00:00:09.599> proven<00:00:09.960> there<00:00:10.380> are<00:00:10.500> some

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
that's been proven there are some

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.320 
that's been proven there are some
amazing<00:00:10.830> 3d<00:00:11.340> guys<00:00:11.610> out<00:00:11.849> there<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:12.179> don't

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
amazing 3d guys out there that don't

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.860 
amazing 3d guys out there that don't
draw<00:00:12.719> as<00:00:13.019> well<00:00:13.469> as<00:00:13.769> others<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.610> and<00:00:14.870> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
draw as well as others you know and the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.200 
draw as well as others you know and the
reason<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.320> bring<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.619> up<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.980> because<00:00:17.310> it's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
reason I bring this up is because it's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
reason I bring this up is because it's
not<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.570> much<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:19.310> drawing<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
not so much about drawing it's about the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.470 
not so much about drawing it's about the
physicality<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.130> making<00:00:23.519> marks<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> page

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
physicality of making marks on a page

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.679 
physicality of making marks on a page
and<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.830> feel<00:00:26.340> relative<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.449> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
and how they feel relative to the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.720 
and how they feel relative to the
physical<00:00:28.140> world<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.769> then<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.519> through

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
physical world and then going through

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
physical world and then going through
that<00:00:29.820> process<00:00:30.510> will<00:00:30.779> allow<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.949> better

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that process will allow you to better

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.030 
that process will allow you to better
understand<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.140> physical<00:00:34.559> world<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.010> new

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
understand the physical world in a new

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.010 
understand the physical world in a new
way<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.760> then<00:00:36.239> hopefully<00:00:36.480> you'll<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.780> able<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
way and then hopefully you'll be able to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.950 
way and then hopefully you'll be able to
take<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.200> process<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.190> apply<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.390> 3d

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
take that process and apply it to 3d

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.170 
take that process and apply it to 3d
animation<00:00:40.649> or<00:00:40.829> 2d<00:00:41.219> animation<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> course<00:00:42.000> but

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
animation or 2d animation of course but

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.729 
animation or 2d animation of course but
to<00:00:42.300> anything<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.899> doesn't<00:00:43.140> really<00:00:43.440> matter

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
to anything it doesn't really matter

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.319 
to anything it doesn't really matter
what<00:00:43.950> it<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> could<00:00:44.370> be<00:00:44.430> sculpting<00:00:44.969> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
what it is you could be sculpting you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.029 
what it is you could be sculpting you
know<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:45.539> modeling<00:00:45.960> in<00:00:46.170> 3d<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.800> still<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
know or modeling in 3d it's still the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
know or modeling in 3d it's still the
same<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.579> my<00:00:47.910> point<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.510> guess<00:00:48.719> that

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
same thing my point is I guess that

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
same thing my point is I guess that
there's<00:00:49.289> numerous<00:00:49.559> ways<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:50.160> use<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.579> I'm

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
there's numerous ways to use what I'm

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.610 
there's numerous ways to use what I'm
teaching<00:00:50.820> you<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.079> happen<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> be

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
teaching you and I just happen to be

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.139 
teaching you and I just happen to be
teaching<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> through<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> act<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.879> drawing

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
teaching it through the act of drawing

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.360 
teaching it through the act of drawing
you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.899> last<00:00:55.170> week<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:56.010> was

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you know what last week was about was

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.170 
you know what last week was about was
understanding<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.440> body<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.760> whole

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
understanding that the body is a whole

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.830 
understanding that the body is a whole
unit<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.170> find<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.890> lot<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.520> people<00:01:03.149> do

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
unit and what I find a lot of people do

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
unit and what I find a lot of people do
especially<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.830> beginnings<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.400> their

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
especially in the beginnings of their

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
especially in the beginnings of their
drawing<00:01:06.479> careers<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.229> they<00:01:07.710> turn<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> body

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
drawing careers is they turn the body

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
drawing careers is they turn the body
into<00:01:08.369> parts<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.810> like<00:01:09.930> okay<00:01:10.049> now

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
into parts you know it's like okay now

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.359 
into parts you know it's like okay now
I'm<00:01:10.380> going<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> draw<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.740> head<00:01:10.979> no<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.250> gonna

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
I'm going to draw the head no I'm gonna

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.800 
I'm going to draw the head no I'm gonna
draw<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.610> arm<00:01:11.850> now<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.150> gonna<00:01:12.270> draw<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> leg

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
draw the arm now I'm gonna draw the leg

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.750 
draw the arm now I'm gonna draw the leg
now<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.080> gonna<00:01:13.200> draw<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.380> foot<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.830> my

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
now I'm gonna draw the foot and my

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.640 
now I'm gonna draw the foot and my
approach<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.509> exact<00:01:15.900> opposite<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
approach is the exact opposite of that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
approach is the exact opposite of that
my<00:01:17.460> approach<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.689> know<00:01:18.810> understand<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
my approach is you know understand the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
my approach is you know understand the
fluidity<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.400> line<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.909> what<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.180> means

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
fluidity of the line and what it means

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.740 
fluidity of the line and what it means
and<00:01:22.040> then<00:01:23.040> take<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> ride

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and then take it for a ride

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.740 
and then take it for a ride
you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> ride<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.799> road<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.189> rhythm<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
you want to ride the road of rhythm and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.940 
you want to ride the road of rhythm and
try<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> entire<00:01:28.650> figure

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
try and get through the entire figure

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.399 
try and get through the entire figure
with<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.549> concept<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.390> that<00:01:30.540> road<00:01:31.170> of

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
with this concept and that road of

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.100 
with this concept and that road of
rhythm<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.430> glue<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.240> holds<00:01:33.390> together

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
rhythm is the glue that holds together

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.850 
rhythm is the glue that holds together
our<00:01:34.790> physiques<00:01:35.790> our<00:01:36.060> physicality<00:01:36.540> as<00:01:37.020> we<00:01:37.710> do

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
our physiques our physicality as we do

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.010 
our physiques our physicality as we do
the<00:01:38.009> things<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.610> another<00:01:39.540> great<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:39.990> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
the things we do another great way to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.069 
the things we do another great way to
look<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.590> would<00:01:40.860> be<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.729> chain<00:01:42.390> every

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
look at it would be like a chain every

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.289 
look at it would be like a chain every
link<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.040> chain<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.579> connected<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.149> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
link in the chain is connected to the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
link in the chain is connected to the
next<00:01:45.600> link<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.740> same<00:01:46.890> way<00:01:47.040> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
next link and that's the same way that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.149 
next link and that's the same way that
force<00:01:47.430> works<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.060> there<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.869> be<00:01:48.899> no<00:01:49.439> break<00:01:49.829> in

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
force works and there can be no break in

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.920 
force works and there can be no break in
the<00:01:50.610> chain<00:01:50.640> if<00:01:51.180> there's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.420> break<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the chain if there's a break in the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
the chain if there's a break in the
chain<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.159> pose<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.549> has<00:01:53.700> been<00:01:54.000> broken

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
chain then the pose it has been broken

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.940 
chain then the pose it has been broken
you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.079> like<00:01:55.229> if<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> finger<00:01:55.770> doesn't

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
you know it's like if the finger doesn't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.649 
you know it's like if the finger doesn't
work<00:01:56.250> right<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.820> rest<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> pose<00:01:57.390> doesn't

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
work right the rest of the pose doesn't

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
work right the rest of the pose doesn't
work<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.560> all<00:01:58.680> needs<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.950> work<00:01:59.219> smoothly

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
work right it all needs to work smoothly

you<00:02:03.930> see<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.380> drawing<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.009> that

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
you see in this drawing is that

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
you see in this drawing is that
everything<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.969> starting<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.420> tie<00:02:06.659> together

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
everything is starting to tie together

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.710 
everything is starting to tie together
you<00:02:07.680> know<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> point<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.340> again<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.209> it's

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
you know the point is again that it's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
you know the point is again that it's
all<00:02:09.929> syncing<00:02:10.530> up<00:02:10.679> right<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> can<00:02:11.430> get<00:02:11.610> from

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
all syncing up right so I can get from

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
all syncing up right so I can get from
let's<00:02:12.330> say<00:02:12.450> here<00:02:12.720> where<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> hand<00:02:13.260> would<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
let's say here where the hand would be

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.220 
let's say here where the hand would be
up<00:02:14.010> through<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.579> body<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.569> know<00:02:15.629> get<00:02:15.930> up<00:02:16.049> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
up through the body you know get up to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.110 
up through the body you know get up to
this<00:02:16.379> leg<00:02:16.650> right<00:02:17.129> hook<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.700> leg<00:02:17.939> and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
this leg right hook up to this leg and

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.569 
this leg right hook up to this leg and
then<00:02:18.239> run<00:02:18.450> myself<00:02:18.629> down<00:02:19.109> so<00:02:19.469> you<00:02:20.159> realize<00:02:20.549> that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
then run myself down so you realize that

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.440 
then run myself down so you realize that
in<00:02:21.269> one<00:02:22.109> road<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.859> rhythm<00:02:23.310> I've<00:02:23.819> gotten<00:02:24.269> from

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
in one road of rhythm I've gotten from

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.229 
in one road of rhythm I've gotten from
the<00:02:24.900> hand<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:25.950> foot<00:02:25.980> that's<00:02:26.609> pretty<00:02:27.030> big

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
the hand to the foot that's pretty big

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.179 
the hand to the foot that's pretty big
right<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.750> as<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.049> start<00:02:28.260> seeing<00:02:28.650> those

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
right and as you start seeing those

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.129 
right and as you start seeing those
rhythms<00:02:29.819> that<00:02:30.329> are<00:02:30.450> constructed<00:02:31.019> out<00:02:31.079> of

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:31.139 
rhythms that are constructed out of

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.229 
rhythms that are constructed out of
directional<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.920> applied<00:02:32.159> forces<00:02:32.639> it

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
directional and applied forces it

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.020 
directional and applied forces it
becomes<00:02:33.719> that<00:02:34.019> much<00:02:34.079> faster<00:02:34.829> for<00:02:35.459> you<00:02:35.639> to

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
becomes that much faster for you to

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.599 
becomes that much faster for you to
assess<00:02:36.629> what<00:02:37.049> you're<00:02:37.290> looking<00:02:37.680> at<00:02:37.859> that's<00:02:38.310> one

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
assess what you're looking at that's one

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.459 
assess what you're looking at that's one
line<00:02:38.879> right<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.389> could<00:02:39.629> take<00:02:39.780> a<00:02:39.810> second<00:02:40.290> line

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:40.469 
line right I could take a second line

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.559 
line right I could take a second line
I'm<00:02:40.889> gonna<00:02:41.159> guess<00:02:41.370> what<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> model's<00:02:41.969> leg<00:02:42.239> was

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
I'm gonna guess what the model's leg was

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.089 
I'm gonna guess what the model's leg was
doing<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.930> other<00:02:43.109> leg<00:02:43.409> but<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> would<00:02:43.980> almost

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
doing this other leg but I would almost

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:45.619 
doing this other leg but I would almost
guarantee<00:02:44.609> it<00:02:44.639> was<00:02:44.849> like<00:02:45.000> front<00:02:45.299> of<00:02:45.389> thigh

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
guarantee it was like front of thigh

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.750 
guarantee it was like front of thigh
back<00:02:46.139> of<00:02:46.349> calf<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.889> then<00:02:47.040> down<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.489> foot

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
back of calf and then down to the foot

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.970 
back of calf and then down to the foot
so<00:02:48.419> something<00:02:48.810> like<00:02:48.840> that<00:02:49.169> let's<00:02:49.379> say<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.739> like

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
so something like that let's say I like

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.050 
so something like that let's say I like
could<00:02:50.159> have<00:02:50.250> been<00:02:50.340> up<00:02:50.489> to<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:50.730> it<00:02:50.970> doesn't

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
could have been up to but it doesn't

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490 
could have been up to but it doesn't
feel<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.659> so<00:02:52.169> that<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.379> have<00:02:52.470> been

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
feel like that so that would have been

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.619 
feel like that so that would have been
like<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.829> second<00:02:53.250> idea<00:02:53.519> I<00:02:53.790> could<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.419> had

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
like the second idea I could have had

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.020 
like the second idea I could have had
the<00:02:55.139> back<00:02:55.379> into<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.859> neck<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.220> head<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.790> then

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the back into the neck and head and then

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.270 
the back into the neck and head and then
worked<00:02:57.389> from<00:02:57.599> one<00:02:57.840> arm<00:02:58.079> you<00:02:58.739> know<00:02:58.829> out<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.159> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
worked from one arm you know out to the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.890 
worked from one arm you know out to the
next<00:02:59.430> arm<00:02:59.700> let's<00:02:59.879> say<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.060> was<00:03:00.180> on<00:03:00.299> her<00:03:00.419> hip<00:03:00.599> I'm

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
next arm let's say it was on her hip I'm

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.080 
next arm let's say it was on her hip I'm
not<00:03:01.079> sure<00:03:01.260> anymore<00:03:01.469> of<00:03:01.709> that<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:02.040> but<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.459> can

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
not sure anymore of that one but you can

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.959 
not sure anymore of that one but you can
see<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.359> very<00:03:03.569> few<00:03:04.079> roads<00:03:04.829> of<00:03:05.250> rhythm<00:03:05.669> I've

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
see in very few roads of rhythm I've

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.080 
see in very few roads of rhythm I've
captured<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:07.349> entire<00:03:07.739> figure<00:03:08.069> and<00:03:08.430> that

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
captured the entire figure and that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.869 
captured the entire figure and that
moves<00:03:09.419> me<00:03:09.859> intellectually<00:03:10.859> up<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.370> pyramid

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
moves me intellectually up the pyramid

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.690 
moves me intellectually up the pyramid
to<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> better<00:03:12.810> understanding<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.889> what<00:03:14.489> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
to a better understanding of what the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.819 
to a better understanding of what the
model<00:03:15.060> was<00:03:15.209> doing<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.659> very<00:03:15.900> quickly<00:03:16.319> right

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
model was doing and very quickly right

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.830 
model was doing and very quickly right
it<00:03:17.189> didn't<00:03:17.459> take<00:03:17.579> me<00:03:17.729> long<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:18.209> draw<00:03:18.419> these<00:03:18.599> red

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
it didn't take me long to draw these red

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.539 
it didn't take me long to draw these red
and<00:03:18.959> green<00:03:19.139> lines<00:03:19.379> and<00:03:19.680> therefore<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.459> know

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
and green lines and therefore you know

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:21.830 
and green lines and therefore you know
the<00:03:20.579> more<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.849> practice<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.329> again<00:03:21.720> the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the more you practice that again the

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.750 
the more you practice that again the
faster<00:03:22.229> you<00:03:22.349> assess<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:23.250> you're<00:03:23.370> looking<00:03:23.639> at

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
faster you assess what you're looking at

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.309 
faster you assess what you're looking at
and<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.120> hope<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.389> makes<00:03:24.599> sense<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:25.169> is

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
and I hope that makes sense this is

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.629 
and I hope that makes sense this is
probably<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.829> most<00:03:26.040> important<00:03:26.489> thing

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639 
probably one of the most important thing

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.640 
probably one of the most important thing
I<00:03:26.790> can<00:03:27.000> teach<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.359> this<00:03:27.540> term<00:03:27.840> is<00:03:28.109> you

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
I can teach you this term is you

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.649 
I can teach you this term is you
understanding<00:03:29.250> rhythm<00:03:29.609> you<00:03:29.970> know<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.269> how<00:03:30.449> it

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
understanding rhythm you know and how it

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.390 
understanding rhythm you know and how it
works<00:03:31.019> through<00:03:31.349> the<00:03:31.439> figure<00:03:31.859> and<00:03:32.069> that<00:03:32.129> it

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
works through the figure and that it

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.309 
works through the figure and that it
connects<00:03:32.790> you<00:03:33.180> know<00:03:33.299> Connect<00:03:33.659> is<00:03:33.870> definitely

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
connects you know Connect is definitely

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.889 
connects you know Connect is definitely
the<00:03:34.439> key<00:03:34.650> word
