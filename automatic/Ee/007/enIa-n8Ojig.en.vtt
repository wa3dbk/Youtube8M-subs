of<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.519> move<00:00:11.759> but<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.719> actually<00:00:12.929> pretty

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
of this move but it is actually pretty

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.640 
of this move but it is actually pretty
fucking<00:00:14.179> there<00:00:15.179> are<00:00:15.269> two<00:00:15.509> things<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.199> have<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
fucking there are two things you have to

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.790 
fucking there are two things you have to
remember<00:00:16.800> about<00:00:17.100> when<00:00:17.580> performing<00:00:18.029> them<00:00:18.800> one

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
remember about when performing them one

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.310 
remember about when performing them one
thing<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.310> that<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.900> lower<00:00:22.170> your

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
thing is that you have to lower your

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.779 
thing is that you have to lower your
shield<00:00:23.119> like<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.330> second<00:00:24.900> before<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.500> attack

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
shield like a second before the attack

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.220 
shield like a second before the attack
if<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:26.849> do<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.300> put<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.720> lock<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:29.090> because<00:00:30.230> when

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
if you do it put a lock on because when

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.330 
if you do it put a lock on because when
you<00:00:31.349> try<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.650> stop<00:00:32.899> just<00:00:36.260> just<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> moment<00:00:37.620> you

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
you try to stop just just the moment you

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.220 
you try to stop just just the moment you
lower<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.760> shield<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.239> are<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> fail

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
lower the shield you are going to fail

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.630 
lower the shield you are going to fail
and<00:00:41.360> that's<00:00:42.360> pretty<00:00:42.510> much<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.960> let's<00:00:43.800> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and that's pretty much it let's that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
and that's pretty much it let's that
becomes<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.180> easy<00:00:45.300> if<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:45.960> lower<00:00:46.530> your

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
becomes really easy if you lower your

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.080 
becomes really easy if you lower your
shield<00:00:47.239> just<00:00:48.239> momentum<00:00:48.780> home<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:50.090> second

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
shield just momentum home and a second

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.580 
shield just momentum home and a second
before<00:00:51.629> your<00:00:52.440> attack<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:54.079> the<00:00:55.079> second<00:00:55.440> thing

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
before your attack and the second thing

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.000 
before your attack and the second thing
is<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> better<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> perform<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.750> attack

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
is it is better to perform the attack

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.670 
is it is better to perform the attack
without<00:00:59.010> block<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.699> it's<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:01.289> fucking

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
without block on it's really fucking

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.600 
without block on it's really fucking
easy<00:01:01.770> use<00:01:02.129> run<00:01:03.000> around<00:01:03.149> low<00:01:03.830> stubborn<00:01:04.830> that's

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
easy use run around low stubborn that's

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.499 
easy use run around low stubborn that's
it<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.390> really<00:01:06.750> really

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.539 

well<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.600> guess<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.619> pretty<00:01:16.649> useful<00:01:17.159> move

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
well I guess that's a pretty useful move

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.170 
well I guess that's a pretty useful move
but<00:01:19.100> there's<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.430> thing<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.640> bothers<00:01:20.820> me
