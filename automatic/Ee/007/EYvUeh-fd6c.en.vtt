00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.210
 Hello, today I want to talk about 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.710
 how to install and on-board computer 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.780
 grand-x 1g staff 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.360
 In general, I basically did not plan to do 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.119
 This video but a lot of requests were 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.460
 just show how to still put 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:28.250
 very simple let us complete 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.460
 such is the cord itself 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.460
 here's a computer so here it looks like a circuit 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:40.220
 Anyone interested can see 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.870
 carefully in general the first thing we do 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.430
 this is plug in didactics 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.770
 diagnostic block it is located 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.079
 right here you will definitely not find her 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.019
 confuse pasted 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.660
 jack then i advise some 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.750
 wire a long insert it into it 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.530
 bottom hole to hook here this one 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.489
 edge 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.820
 wire and pull out any further 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.480
 when we pulled the wire out of here we 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.480
 we connect 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:16.999
 very conveniently disconnect the board itself 

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:16.999
 connector 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:28.390
 everyone got push it in place 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:31.179
 so to speak dislocation everything we have he became 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.030
 on the spot but me the reason is disconnected 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.880
 by which I turned it off while watching 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.479
 in neighboring video streams as it is not 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.640
 discharged the battery in general everything but he 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.469
 installed with us is working 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.539
 if now the key books 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.420
 we will have a diagnostic block 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:53.819
 function on it all 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.819
 successful installations goodbye
