00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.019
 Hi everyone! How are you? The month of 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.599
 Today I 'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 delicious lemon pie topping 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.540
 Sigh 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.119
 so whatever you want to learn to do this 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.270
 Dessert just keep going in china 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 ingredient we will need to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:29.939
 150 grams of melted butter and 200 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.610
 grams of cracker is born the first 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.399
 step is to mash the cracker 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 you can use a processor or 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.739
 blender both does the important thing 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.170
 leave biscuits very thin as if they were 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 a flour 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.070
 the next step is to mix the butter 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:52.530
 this cookie flour melted 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 mix everything very well until flour stays 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.120
 pretty obina 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.520
 then I come with a baking dish 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.610
 with removable background and begin to change 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.299
 this clay around the sides and in the 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.299
 baking sheet background 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.840
 this rate is a little bit of work 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.220
 the best way to start is to know 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 by the sides 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.240
 when the sides are ready 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.400
 you speak the background 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.040
 try to leave more or less the same 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.790
 thick on the sides to get a 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.790
 beautiful wedding 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 after you have failed all you will know with 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.020
 this mass 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.070
 Let's take the preheated oven to 180 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:51.649
 degrees for 15 minutes or until you see 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:53.539
 that ours was already gilded care 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.649
 not to burn for this mass to stay 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.649
 golden lightly 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:07.039
 then just take it out and let's go 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.360
 prepare a lot of lemon ingredient 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.420
 for the filling 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:16.160
 We're going to need a side of cream. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.510
 milk without whey 300 grams two cans of 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.989
 condensed milk 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.239
 seven hundred and ninety grams 100 ml of 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:29.500
 lemon juice an unflavored gelatin and 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.500
 lemon zest to taste 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.069
 add all the ingredients in the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.019
 blender except lemon zest 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.879
 do not forget to prepare the gelatin 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.690
 colorless according to the people of the 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.450
 Europe 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.150
 I bought luiz henrique's and you're from 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.579
 cold water 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.269
 I then mixed milk in a water bath 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.890
 until it is free and just add 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.930
 the only indicator 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.670
 let's beat this mix during the 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.349
 five minutes after he hit 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.019
 for five minutes 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.920
 just add this cream on the 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:13.269
 baking sheet is over there all over the flag 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.269
 to be well leveled 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.659
 add the lemon zest on top of the 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.659
 cre 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.569
 cover with the film and refrigerate the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.560
 2 hours 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.950
 now let's prepare the coverage 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.909
 Ingredients 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:48.049
 We'll need six clearings and 300 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:50.329
 grams of refined sugar on TV let's 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.810
 beat the egg whites until they 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.780
 to be very consistent at the point where 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.639
 you will hear the bowl upside down they 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:06.769
 do not fall then just add the 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:08.949
 sugar in this mixture beating for 15 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.949
 years 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.980
 and point of the sigh must stay is this 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.980
 if I turn soft it does not fall 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.620
 remove the baking sheet from the refrigerator and 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.330
 present their children to the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.330

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.530
 finish with pine cones and linan is now 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.350
 only take to the preheated oven at 180 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:50.760
 degrees to brown the top of the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:54.950
 sigh about 15 minutes more or 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.950
 less depends on the fire 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.850
 now it 's just smoking 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.510
 I 'm not even a little honey on top of 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.510
 pie 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.290
 the end result was this one pie 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.290
