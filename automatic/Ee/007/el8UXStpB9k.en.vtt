00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:33.170 
actually found the 5200 video with this
tripod<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.530> is<00:00:26.740> the<00:00:27.730> me<00:00:28.150> photo<00:00:28.539> a<00:00:31.860> 1350<00:00:32.860> I

great tripod so from $189 you're not

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.859 
great tripod so from $189 you're not
gonna<00:01:12.249> get<00:01:12.459> a<00:01:12.490> carbon<00:01:12.880> fiber<00:01:13.119> tripod<00:01:13.359> this<00:01:13.689> is

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
gonna get a carbon fiber tripod this is

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.699 
gonna get a carbon fiber tripod this is
still<00:01:14.369> aluminum<00:01:15.369> but<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:17.170> great<00:01:17.409> part<00:01:17.649> about

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
still aluminum but the great part about

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:19.469 
still aluminum but the great part about
this<00:01:18.009> is<00:01:18.219> that<00:01:18.369> it's<00:01:18.549> small<00:01:18.969> and<00:01:18.999> then<00:01:19.329> also

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
this is that it's small and then also

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.899 
this is that it's small and then also
two<00:01:19.689> expands<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.319> lot<00:01:20.439> so<00:01:20.649> let<00:01:20.770> me<00:01:20.859> show<00:01:21.189> you<00:01:21.249> so

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
two expands a lot so let me show you so

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.760 
two expands a lot so let me show you so
the<00:01:21.999> legs<00:01:22.179> fold<00:01:22.539> out<00:01:22.749> so<00:01:23.020> this<00:01:23.139> tripod

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the legs fold out so this tripod

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.370 
the legs fold out so this tripod
collapses<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.459> itself<00:01:24.490> essentially<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:26.289> you

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
collapses on itself essentially so you

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.739 
collapses on itself essentially so you
lock<00:01:26.590> each<00:01:26.829> leg<00:01:27.130> in<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:29.259> take<00:01:29.529> the<00:01:29.619> tripod<00:01:30.100> out

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:30.749 
lock each leg in and take the tripod out

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:37.559 
lock each leg in and take the tripod out
and<00:01:31.829> these<00:01:32.829> twists<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.259> mock<00:01:35.999> it's<00:01:36.999> pretty

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
and these twists to a mock it's pretty

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:44.190 
and these twists to a mock it's pretty
quick<00:01:37.899> setup<00:01:38.319> actually<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.159> it<00:01:42.369> can<00:01:42.700> also<00:01:43.479> be

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
quick setup actually and it can also be

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.169 
quick setup actually and it can also be
walked<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:45.039> lower<00:01:45.279> position<00:01:45.579> if<00:01:45.939> you<00:01:46.029> want

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
walked in a lower position if you want

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:49.830 
walked in a lower position if you want
to<00:01:46.240> take<00:01:46.419> really<00:01:47.049> low<00:01:47.649> angle<00:01:48.310> shots<00:01:48.599> it<00:01:49.599> is

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
to take really low angle shots it is

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
to take really low angle shots it is
possible<00:01:50.439> to<00:01:50.469> do<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.829> with<00:01:51.009> this<00:01:54.209> and<00:01:55.259> see

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
possible to do that with this and see

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080 
possible to do that with this and see
one<00:01:57.700> more<00:01:58.060> side<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.469> these<00:02:00.369> do<00:02:00.669> come<00:02:00.729> in

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
one more side and these do come in

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.699 
one more side and these do come in
multiple<00:02:01.239> colors<00:02:01.569> I<00:02:02.109> got<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:02.439> green<00:02:02.679> one

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
multiple colors I got the green one

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:06.330 
multiple colors I got the green one
there's<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.369> red<00:02:03.669> a<00:02:03.700> purple<00:02:04.529> I<00:02:05.529> believe<00:02:06.249> they

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
there's a red a purple I believe they

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.800 
there's a red a purple I believe they
have<00:02:06.429> a<00:02:06.489> silver<00:02:06.880> one<00:02:07.029> too<00:02:07.299> they<00:02:07.479> didn't<00:02:07.659> have

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
have a silver one too they didn't have

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.680 
have a silver one too they didn't have
it<00:02:07.959> when<00:02:08.050> I<00:02:08.110> was<00:02:08.349> there<00:02:09.090> well<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.119> like<00:02:10.539> the

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
it when I was there well I like the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.970 
it when I was there well I like the
green<00:02:10.899> that's<00:02:11.050> not<00:02:11.260> bad<00:02:11.470> I<00:02:11.590> think<00:02:11.770> they<00:02:11.830> have<00:02:11.950> a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980

blue<00:02:12.220> one<00:02:12.400> too

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
blue one too

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.700 
blue one too
they<00:02:13.900> have<00:02:14.170> different<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.890> sizes<00:02:15.520> too<00:02:16.710> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
they have different on sizes too this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.220

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
one is their medium-sized tripod and

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.660 
one is their medium-sized tripod and
they<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> smaller<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:24.190> if<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.430> want<00:02:24.610> to

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:56.930 
happy with the investment I think that

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.880 
happy with the investment I think that
the<00:06:57.740> price<00:06:58.010> that<00:06:58.190> they<00:06:58.340> charge<00:06:58.580> for<00:06:59.000> it<00:06:59.890> it's

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:00.890 
the price that they charge for it it's

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:04.150 
the price that they charge for it it's
really<00:07:01.790> low<00:07:02.120> for<00:07:02.480> a<00:07:02.840> tripod<00:07:03.470> that<00:07:03.710> has<00:07:03.920> as<00:07:04.070> many

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
really low for a tripod that has as many

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.750 
really low for a tripod that has as many
capabilities<00:07:04.820> and<00:07:05.240> it's<00:07:05.330> built<00:07:05.510> this<00:07:05.690> well

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:06.760 
capabilities and it's built this well

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.790 
capabilities and it's built this well
and<00:07:07.760> so<00:07:08.000> you<00:07:08.510> fold<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:08.900> up<00:07:11.320> and<00:07:12.320> you<00:07:12.380> can<00:07:12.500> put<00:07:12.680> it

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 
and so you fold it up and you can put it

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.010 
and so you fold it up and you can put it
into<00:07:12.950> this<00:07:13.190> bag<00:07:13.460> and<00:07:13.670> it<00:07:13.730> fits<00:07:13.970> right<00:07:14.300> into<00:07:14.690> the
