00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
you can read you have to start it over

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.630 
you can read you have to start it over
the<00:00:54.140> whole<00:00:54.320> idea<00:00:54.530> is<00:00:54.800> be<00:00:55.010> able<00:00:55.100> to<00:00:55.309> start<00:00:55.550> it

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
the whole idea is be able to start it

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.850 
the whole idea is be able to start it
and<00:00:55.760> finish<00:00:56.000> it<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.270> one<00:00:56.300> night<00:00:56.530> it's<00:00:57.530> actually

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
and finish it in one night it's actually

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.650 
and finish it in one night it's actually
more<00:00:58.010> like<00:00:58.220> hearthstone<00:00:58.730> where<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.420> get

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
more like hearthstone where you get

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.110 
more like hearthstone where you get
three<00:01:00.020> cards<00:01:00.440> per<00:01:00.649> round<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:01.790> have<00:01:01.970> to

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
three cards per round and you have to

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.700 
three cards per round and you have to
make<00:01:02.149> very<00:01:02.480> careful<00:01:02.899> decisions<00:01:03.380> about<00:01:03.500> how

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
make very careful decisions about how

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.439 
make very careful decisions about how
you<00:01:03.770> want<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.070> build<00:01:04.220> out<00:01:04.369> your<00:01:04.399> team<00:01:04.759> for

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
you want to build out your team for

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.210 
you want to build out your team for
example<00:01:05.899> if<00:01:05.990> you<00:01:06.140> wait<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.470> round<00:01:06.680> 10<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.160> you

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
example if you wait to round 10 and you

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.130 
example if you wait to round 10 and you
don't<00:01:07.399> have<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.550> quarterback<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.810> might<00:01:08.990> not

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
don't have a quarterback you might not

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.570 
don't have a quarterback you might not
see<00:01:09.200> a<00:01:09.410> quarterback<00:01:09.920> in<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.160> last<00:01:10.340> four

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
see a quarterback in the last four

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.249 
see a quarterback in the last four
rounds<00:01:10.940> then<00:01:11.060> you're<00:01:11.180> kind<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.479> screwed<00:01:11.660> so

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
rounds then you're kind of screwed so

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:13.510 
rounds then you're kind of screwed so
it's<00:01:12.380> important<00:01:12.830> to<00:01:12.890> get<00:01:12.979> the<00:01:13.130> critical

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's important to get the critical

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.859 
it's important to get the critical
positions<00:01:14.000> to<00:01:14.119> build<00:01:14.330> your<00:01:14.450> offense<00:01:14.540> and

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
positions to build your offense and

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.320 
positions to build your offense and
defense<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.740> early<00:01:16.070> rounds<00:01:16.100> some<00:01:17.090> really

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
defense in the early rounds some really

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.719 
defense in the early rounds some really
tough<00:01:17.540> strategic<00:01:18.050> decisions<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:19.220> yeah<00:01:19.399> it's

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
tough strategic decisions but yeah it's

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:20.830 
tough strategic decisions but yeah it's
more<00:01:19.880> like<00:01:20.060> hearth<00:01:20.270> stone<00:01:20.450> with<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.630> three
