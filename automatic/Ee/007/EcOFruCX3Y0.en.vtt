atmosphere I'm looking forward to it but
being<00:00:48.660> honest<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.680> quite<00:00:49.770> hard

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
being honest it's actually quite hard

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.380 
being honest it's actually quite hard
key<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.340> predict<00:00:50.640> because<00:00:50.760> we've<00:00:51.059> had<00:00:51.210> been<00:00:51.360> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
key and predict because we've had been a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.389 
key and predict because we've had been a
cup<00:00:51.660> game<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.020> always<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.590> anything<00:00:53.250> can

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
cup game I always see this anything can

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.889 
cup game I always see this anything can
happen<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.879> don't<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.210> predict<00:00:54.539> them<00:00:54.660> because

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
happen I don't I predict them because

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.630 
happen I don't I predict them because
we've<00:00:55.020> seen<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.440> many<00:00:55.559> upsets<00:00:56.039> over<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> years

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we've seen so many upsets over the years

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.029 
we've seen so many upsets over the years
with<00:00:57.030> any<00:00:57.270> cup<00:00:57.570> game<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.379> me<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> depends

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
with any cup game and for me it depends

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.340 
with any cup game and for me it depends
on<00:00:59.280> what<00:00:59.489> man<00:00:59.670> united<00:01:00.030> team<00:01:00.210> shows<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.510> user<00:01:01.170> a

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on what man united team shows up user a

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.170 
on what man united team shows up user a
very<00:01:01.620> inconsistent<00:01:02.250> team<00:01:02.640> we've<00:01:02.850> seen<00:01:02.879> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
very inconsistent team we've seen that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.640 
very inconsistent team we've seen that
this<00:01:03.329> season<00:01:03.750> where<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.989> see<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.229> one<00:01:04.409> step

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this season where you see it one step

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.740 
this season where you see it one step
forward<00:01:04.890> one<00:01:05.250> step<00:01:05.400> back<00:01:05.549> you'll<00:01:06.150> beat<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> team

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
forward one step back you'll beat a team

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.420 
forward one step back you'll beat a team
then<00:01:07.170> you'll<00:01:07.350> lose<00:01:07.530> against<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.920> team<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.310> it's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
then you'll lose against a team and it's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.730 
then you'll lose against a team and it's
been<00:01:08.610> very<00:01:08.760> inconsistent<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.659> under<00:01:10.380> David

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
been very inconsistent and under David

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.350 
been very inconsistent and under David
Moyes<00:01:10.920> i<00:01:11.189> should<00:01:11.580> say<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> mean<00:01:12.000> since<00:01:12.210> you've

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
Moyes i should say I mean since you've

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
Moyes i should say I mean since you've
lost<00:01:12.540> Ferguson<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.409> hasn't<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.340> been<00:01:14.640> what

being honest you still have the squad's
that<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.659> used<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.350> there's<00:01:22.770> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that is used to have I think there's a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.350 
that is used to have I think there's a
lot<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.040> gaps<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> squad<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.030> think<00:01:24.240> you're

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
lot of gaps in that squad I think you're

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
lot of gaps in that squad I think you're
midfields<00:01:24.930> very<00:01:25.170> weak<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.560> mean<00:01:25.680> I'm<00:01:25.770> not

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
midfields very weak I mean I'm not

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.200 
midfields very weak I mean I'm not
trying<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:26.130> criticize<00:01:26.250> yeah<00:01:26.700> I'm<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.970> being

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
trying to criticize yeah I'm just being

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.640 
trying to criticize yeah I'm just being
honest<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> my<00:01:27.720> opinion<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.350> you've<00:01:28.500> got<00:01:28.590> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
honest in my opinion and you've got a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.620 
honest in my opinion and you've got a
great<00:01:28.890> strike<00:01:29.280> force<00:01:29.549> but<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.479> at

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
great strike force but I think at

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.390 
great strike force but I think at
midfields<00:01:31.290> week<00:01:31.500> were<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:32.009> cleverly

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
midfields week were like so cleverly

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
midfields week were like so cleverly
Anderson<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.750> hasn't<00:01:33.900> really

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
Anderson and it just hasn't really

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.230 
Anderson and it just hasn't really
worked<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.770> us<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.460> that's<00:01:35.759> why<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:35.970> say<00:01:36.119> about

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
worked for us but that's why I say about

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.670 
worked for us but that's why I say about
inconsistency<00:01:37.020> your<00:01:37.140> squads<00:01:37.409> very

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
