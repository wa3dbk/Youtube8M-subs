00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
we don't have investors and so that's

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.580 
we don't have investors and so that's
one<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:44.899> reasons<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.170> we<00:01:45.289> could<00:01:45.440> say

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
one of the reasons that we could say

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.370 
one of the reasons that we could say
small<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.819> had<00:01:46.970> pressure<00:01:47.299> to<00:01:47.690> make<00:01:47.869> profit

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
small if we had pressure to make profit

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.990 
small if we had pressure to make profit
from<00:01:48.560> investors<00:01:49.280> that<00:01:49.459> always<00:01:49.670> wanted<00:01:49.909> to

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
from investors that always wanted to

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.760 
from investors that always wanted to
return<00:01:50.090> on<00:01:50.539> their<00:01:50.690> investment<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.560> would<00:01:51.649> get

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
return on their investment it would get

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.320 
return on their investment it would get
much<00:01:51.920> more<00:01:52.069> difficult<00:01:52.520> Adam<00:01:53.000> was<00:01:53.179> the<00:01:53.299> first

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
much more difficult Adam was the first

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.469 
much more difficult Adam was the first
beer<00:01:53.979> Adam<00:01:54.979> beer<00:01:55.310> was<00:01:55.610> something<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.360> was

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
beer Adam beer was something that was

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.090 
beer Adam beer was something that was
made<00:01:56.659> in<00:01:56.810> Dortmund<00:01:57.170> Germany<00:01:57.439> once<00:01:57.830> upon<00:01:58.069> a

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
made in Dortmund Germany once upon a

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.370 
made in Dortmund Germany once upon a
time<00:01:58.369> Fred<00:01:58.880> Eckhart<00:01:59.299> and<00:01:59.479> Michael<00:01:59.929> Jackson

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
time Fred Eckhart and Michael Jackson

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.080 
time Fred Eckhart and Michael Jackson
both<00:02:00.500> talked<00:02:00.799> about<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.310> in<00:02:01.399> their<00:02:01.520> books<00:02:01.789> and

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
both talked about it in their books and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.699 
both talked about it in their books and
so<00:02:02.659> I<00:02:02.689> thought<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.080> would<00:02:03.170> be<00:02:03.229> a<00:02:03.259> great<00:02:03.470> beer<00:02:03.619> to

00:02:03.699 --> 00:02:03.709 
so I thought it would be a great beer to

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:05.770 
so I thought it would be a great beer to
start<00:02:03.979> with<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.369> then<00:02:04.640> that<00:02:04.819> became<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:05.209> trend

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
start with and then that became a trend

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.770 
start with and then that became a trend
for<00:02:06.349> four-letter<00:02:06.709> names<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:07.490> beers<00:02:07.819> Dave<00:02:08.390> is

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
for four-letter names for beers Dave is

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.349 
for four-letter names for beers Dave is
made<00:02:09.080> with<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.470> nice<00:02:09.769> distilled<00:02:10.280> process<00:02:10.940> so

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
made with a nice distilled process so

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.150 
made with a nice distilled process so
instead<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.780> taking<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.109> alcohol<00:02:12.320> out<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:13.070> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
instead of taking the alcohol out of the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.520 
instead of taking the alcohol out of the
beer<00:02:13.400> we're<00:02:14.000> taking<00:02:14.359> the<00:02:14.480> water<00:02:14.780> out<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
beer we're taking the water out of the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.199 
beer we're taking the water out of the
beer<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:15.769> so<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.160> concentrates<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.760> alcohol

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
beer and so it concentrates the alcohol

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.420 
beer and so it concentrates the alcohol
but<00:02:17.630> leaves<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.989> sugars<00:02:18.320> that<00:02:18.680> I<00:02:18.799> had<00:02:18.950> started

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
but leaves the sugars that I had started

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.490 
but leaves the sugars that I had started
a<00:02:19.489> barley<00:02:19.820> wine<00:02:19.970> festival<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:21.049> grown<00:02:21.320> to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
a barley wine festival it's grown to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.099 
a barley wine festival it's grown to
where<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.799> had<00:02:21.920> 58<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.760> year<00:02:23.000> Alan<00:02:23.630> came<00:02:23.870> down

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:24.109 
where we had 58 this year Alan came down

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:26.110 
where we had 58 this year Alan came down
I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.500> he<00:02:24.650> slept<00:02:24.890> on<00:02:25.040> my<00:02:25.160> couch<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.790> he<00:02:26.000> had

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
I think he slept on my couch and he had

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.180 
I think he slept on my couch and he had
a<00:02:26.150> great<00:02:26.390> time<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:27.290> next<00:02:27.560> year<00:02:27.709> he<00:02:27.799> shows<00:02:28.010> up

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
a great time the next year he shows up

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.830 
a great time the next year he shows up
with<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.400> beer<00:02:28.790> and

almost 30% alcohol but very subdued and
gentle<00:02:41.629> now<00:02:41.810> more<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> port<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.370> he<00:02:43.489> won

the<00:02:43.819> barley<00:02:44.090> wine<00:02:44.209> festival<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.840> year<00:02:45.080> with

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
the barley wine festival that year with

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.960 
the barley wine festival that year with
it<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.530> judges<00:02:45.769> were<00:02:45.980> arguing<00:02:46.430> over<00:02:46.580> whether

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
it the judges were arguing over whether

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.630 
it the judges were arguing over whether
it<00:02:47.690> should<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:47.989> thrown<00:02:48.410> out<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.430> festival

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
it should be thrown out of the festival

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.589 
it should be thrown out of the festival
because<00:02:50.239> it<00:02:50.390> was<00:02:50.599> wood<00:02:50.840> aged<00:02:51.080> and<00:02:51.470> so<00:02:52.069> strong

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
because it was wood aged and so strong

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.759 
because it was wood aged and so strong
that<00:02:53.599> they<00:02:53.720> didn't<00:02:53.989> think<00:02:54.080> it<00:02:54.200> was<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.500> style

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
that they didn't think it was to style

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.140 
that they didn't think it was to style
and<00:02:55.040> then<00:02:55.129> there<00:02:55.250> was<00:02:55.340> another<00:02:55.370> group<00:02:55.700> at<00:02:56.060> the

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
and then there was another group at the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.280 
and then there was another group at the
table<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.599> said<00:02:56.810> this<00:02:56.930> is<00:02:56.989> the<00:02:57.110> most

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
table that said this is the most

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.559 
table that said this is the most
fantastic<00:02:57.410> beer<00:02:58.069> I've<00:02:58.160> ever<00:02:58.400> had<00:02:58.610> and<00:02:59.390> it's

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
fantastic beer I've ever had and it's

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.300 
fantastic beer I've ever had and it's
gotta<00:02:59.780> win<00:03:00.019> this<00:03:00.170> thing<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:00.709> think<00:03:01.099> it<00:03:01.190> was

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
gotta win this thing I think it was

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.190 
gotta win this thing I think it was
probably<00:03:01.519> about<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.880> year<00:03:02.000> after<00:03:02.630> Alan<00:03:02.900> won<00:03:03.049> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
probably about a year after Alan won the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.440 
probably about a year after Alan won the
barley<00:03:03.500> wine<00:03:03.620> festival<00:03:04.190> he<00:03:04.400> shows<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:04.940> at<00:03:05.209> the

wood he sliced the end of the barrel off

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.440 
wood he sliced the end of the barrel off

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
broke the barrel even though people have

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.860 
broke the barrel even though people have

bottle<00:03:21.290> of<00:03:21.379> it<00:03:21.560> it<00:03:22.340> still<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.970> very<00:03:23.599> tasty

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
bottle of it it still is very tasty

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.740 
bottle of it it still is very tasty
thing<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.440> drink<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.790> so<00:03:26.060> people<00:03:26.360> have<00:03:26.510> been

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
thing to drink and so people have been

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.970 
thing to drink and so people have been
disappointed<00:03:27.319> I<00:03:27.410> don't<00:03:27.590> think

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.820 

so<00:03:31.580> we're<00:03:31.790> almost<00:03:31.879> done<00:03:32.239> with<00:03:32.450> the<00:03:32.660> mash<00:03:32.870> we'll

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
so we're almost done with the mash we'll

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.890 
so we're almost done with the mash we'll
use<00:03:34.099> a<00:03:34.129> little<00:03:34.610> over<00:03:34.879> 500<00:03:35.360> pounds<00:03:35.599> of<00:03:35.660> grain

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
use a little over 500 pounds of grain

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.589 
use a little over 500 pounds of grain
and<00:03:36.349> that'll<00:03:37.129> produce<00:03:37.280> about<00:03:37.580> 120<00:03:38.180> gallons<00:03:38.480> of

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
and that'll produce about 120 gallons of

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.440 
and that'll produce about 120 gallons of
beer<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:39.140> definitely<00:03:39.970> doesn't<00:03:40.970> seem<00:03:41.300> like

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
beer it definitely doesn't seem like

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.199 
beer it definitely doesn't seem like
it's<00:03:41.629> been<00:03:41.690> 20<00:03:42.050> years<00:03:42.080> we've<00:03:42.410> done<00:03:42.790> 36<00:03:43.790> under

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
it's been 20 years we've done 36 under

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.199 
it's been 20 years we've done 36 under
3700<00:03:45.080> preusse<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:46.220> fact<00:03:46.459> that<00:03:46.730> we<00:03:46.849> have<00:03:47.000> such

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209
