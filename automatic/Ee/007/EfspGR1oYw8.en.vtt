 villamizar susan creations in this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.600
 opportunity I want to show you how 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.029
 transform these children's shoes or 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.840
 yours that already after this scope 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.599
 are a bit worn to turn them 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.929
 in these bright and glamorous 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.660
 shoes I'm going to show you a lot technique 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.239
 more practical and much easier 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.500
 so that you will make the materials that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.710
 we are going to use is going to be glue cloth a 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 chinese brush a sealer for frost 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.330
 in ultra metallic scouring fabric in this 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.350
 I will do it 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.260
 aquamarine 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.480
 and medium laser frost 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.949
 medium means that he should be canceled 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 is a little bit bigger than frost 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.140
 conventionally good the procedure is 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.960
 the next 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.630
 we take glue cloth and start 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.840
 apply to the whole shoe we're going to 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:16.400
 Apply three coats letting one dry 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.590
 after the other once they are dry 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.370
 the result is going to be this one that is going to 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.940
 get the sticky shoe I recommend them 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.980
 use a little box or a blog sheet 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.890
 so that the time for the frost 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.100
 fall did not waste and the uer and they go to 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.740
 pick up the ones we're going to pick up with your finger and 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.050
 let's apply in everything 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.590
 putting pressure on him and that's what we're doing 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.190
 filling all once we have it already 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.230
 all frosty look at it as it looks delhi 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.300
 we are not going to do it first with the 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.940
 Medium grainy rime now what 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.880
 let's do is with the frost 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.160
 ultra metallic normal aquamarine 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.970
 again we got together and what we are going 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.630
 to do is play 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.259
 scrubbing this so that to cover 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.149
 the spaces that we have left 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.120
 without the frost 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.939
 mediated for example look here all that 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.980
 space that looks good you see everything 

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.319
 we're going to cover that once 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.769
 let's have the whole shoe frosty and 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.959
 CÃ¡ceres until uploading them very well as 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.120
 says the thicker one tapped that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.670
 have a hand to take all the 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:34.030
 excess and if we see that we need 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.689
 some spaces we come back again and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.510
 we apply the same as it fell 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:44.950
 we are going to apply with the sealer for 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:49.069
 frost we are going to apply a layer of 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.950
 sealants this so why not 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.850
 we drop the frost we leave it 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.650
 to dry very well is dry very fast 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.460
 this did help us protect the 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.190
 frosts so that we will not fall 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.410
 well my girls and the final result are 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.860
 these beautiful shoes look at me I've 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.010
 added a little bow to the side 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:16.390
 measure how they are 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:19.150
 super cute for your girls and look 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.129
 beautiful or you can also use 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.200
 some shoes of you and transform it 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:24.800
