00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.570
 efe to doubt one of the largest hydraulic infrastructure works in 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.910
 all the history of our country hsbc we gladly receive josé luis 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.880
 luege tamargo to let us talk about the project detected 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.840
 impressive that at the latest thousands of direct and indirect jobs in that 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.300
 state of hidalgo also of quality of its services many by the invitation 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.880
 very happy, especially because 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.519
 start this project 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.149
 it is from evo morals have been imported either for mexico 

00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.979
 present president calderón spoke of in 2010 be year of recovery 

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:31.229
 economic 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.429
 and one of the c7 lines push this big infrastructure project 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:36.820
 that generate jobs 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.929
 the state is also plant 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.350
 discover a 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.550
 a historical debt with the state of hidalgo 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.200
 the whole history of the city lived for a hundred years 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.570
 Sewage is sent to the Hidalgo state without treatment 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.380
 contaminating affecting the health of people in many places the 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.090
 legality 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.460
 and the idea is to treat the water with an optimum quality so that the kun apart 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.930
 can be used in industry and another in technified irrigation 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.389
 to have even 

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:07.350
 the culture of higher quality of life the benefit is for how many people and 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.189
 that only for hidalgo josé luis is good this plant that today receives the 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.730
 water d 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.080
 the central miso fidel the future opponent suroriente 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.490
 the partizán are at only toto and everything for all we can the albos are for 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.180
 Irrigation districts in Hidalgo 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.090
 and for some it induces also 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.320
 The benefit is more than eight hundred thousand people 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.100
 those that can directly benefit are three large irrigation districts 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 by a hundred families that have dedicated their entire lives to growing corn 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.360
 of alfalfa some vegetables 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.510
 but that the idea is that the first one also serves to promote 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.540
 a technification of agricultural irrigation that then the other important challenge that 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.750
 we carry in parallel 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.170
 and you already did on the issue of job creation is very important 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.020
 because we are talking about roughly 15 thousand 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 indirect jobs that will generate and four thousand direct not so is this area 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.739
 is a prisoner a plant with two processes a train of conventional processes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.890
 and another chemist 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.040
 but very high capacity to give us an idea from the capacity this 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.010
 plant when we talk about 35 cubic meters per second 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.150
 the figure stays in the air fiallo what I say is imagine 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.719
 a tinaco of ministers 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.850
 now 35 they would not fit in 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.540
 we are in this in this act in this space 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.620
 every second pass black water 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 aguascalientes is in the capacity the plant behind a gigantic screen 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.799
 with a great generation also d 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.620
 the capture of methane this is an important fact because in the process of 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.610
 water cleaning sludge is generated that must be stabilized that there is 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.599
 the irs sicar that I know that deposit them 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.599
 but in the digesters of the obama generates a large amount 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.439
 electric power 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.969
 this leaves modest 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:48.939
 methane gas 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.939
 that only generate sewage and garbage 

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:55.439
 and this is going to favor recovering 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.469
 the electric energy 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.709
 although for silver itself, silver is practically 90% 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.279
 I went through his facet enough uto 

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.150
 l 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.919
 is the start presence is a good investment 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:09.879
 but many of these are needed in the country 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.679
 us is that this area was easy that before 

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.039
 added to two very large ones that are already in process of construction and 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:18.449
 they ripped the two big points 

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.019
 both of the drowned the cold water plant 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.829
 these two large plants are also going to 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.319
 all the black waters of the metropolitan area of ​​Guadalajara 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.319
 He said 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.019
 two and a half years Guadalajara is going to be a city that passes 100% 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:34.109
 with results 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.479
 NGOs as an inexplicable historical issue does not 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:40.139
 we start let's say as ceded 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.370
 1 a policy of water sanitation 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.759
 it does not go down the drains either, nobody notices it 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.179
 and they had a gentleman without treatment 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:49.909
 cough this plant alone 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.639
 will treat 60% of the entire volume of sewage water that it generated in the 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.720
 Mexico City I Mean Federal District 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.129
 and they are the metropolitan of the state of mexico 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.439
 and then the only advance of this plant 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.780
 will represent on it in the national grams number 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.549
 for a base of three percentage points 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.819
 followed him we go only with the atotonilco plant 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:11.660
 to go up 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.479
 the moccasin 10 percentage points forgiveness 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.259
 going from 40 to 50 percent of treatment the idea is that when that 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.939
 plant is in operation 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:25.240
 we have for us 89 new plants in the country 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.620
 and we are above 60% p average 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.100
 the wastewater treatment when we make the benefits in full 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.230
 When this plant is in operation that one hundred percent this plant has 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.710
 a 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.670
 buy or confusion of three years concludes that in 2002 the idea is that 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.060
 this great work what fernandito I thank you very much that supposes the issuer 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.770
 East 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.730
 that plant that tunnel also 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.580
 the ctc concluded in 2002 entós 2012 is the start 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.340
 both of the east emitting tunnel and b in the treatment plant of 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.289
 atotonilco 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:05:00.059
 from that moment onwards, in parallel, we support carrying programs of 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.219
 technification 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.230
 of modernization of irrigation in Hidalgo 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.620
 pintos that in parallel will be because the tunnel itself in the next 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.790
 federal administration 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.490
 all these benefits are written out 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.780
 now we also have the idea said after plants for the valley of mexico 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.069
 percent we finish already the entire basic project say a plant that is going to 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.379
 treat by the side of the fed federal zone to the texcoco lake 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:26.360
 a high capacity of treatment also the stowaways in this same 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.129
 month ecoseries percent to finish 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.029
 do not leave it because you're here 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:36.099
 what happens with the water supply for the mexico valley and with it the 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.199
 semar the water that arrives from cutzamala how to spend in this 2010 and all these 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.279
 alejandro projects are part of a water sustainability program 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:47.029
 who put the president in 2007 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.969
 because the most important thing for emery's is to reduce the 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.969
 overextraction at last the extraction of water from the subsoil 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.559
 the average they have in Mexico 

00:05:55.559 --> 00:05:57.650
 the over-exploitation of its aquifer 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.170
 and of course we as depending on more than other external sources of 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:02.210
 basin of the lerma 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.110
 is a very large battery of wells and cutzamala system that throughout 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.789
 2009 we had about a lot of problems 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.879
 per cent that by the way this cold front brought us a lot of good water 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:15.719
 quite rain in the sum of kutxa bad I'm going three days with rains in 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:17.020
 cancun somalies osuna 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.499
 the part that I see scenes d of the cold we are going that the city of mexico 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:24.610
 then we have to concentrate on a very ambitious program of 

00:06:24.609 --> 00:06:26.819
 rehabilitation of the cutzamala system 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.680
 and that includes among the evil of the entire infrastructure let's say in the 

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.589
 pumping and purification conduction 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.349
 a program that allows calderón pushed very strongly that is the 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:37.749
 reforestation 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:40.069
 through what the national forestry commission 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.379
 of almost 64 thousand hectares in any case the basins the microwatersheds 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:49.099
 they feed the listening system more but we continue with the cuts this video 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.629
 and definitely of all of him in all of January and probably 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.559
 we will continue with the cut that we have until now 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:07:00.129
 as long as we recover what we see the guide curve is to say the 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:02.419
 minimum that they should have 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.149
 the companies 

00:07:04.149 --> 00:07:08.219
 in parallel one fota mohsén being much in the programs that if science 

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:11.679
 We have to say that both the atotonilco silver and the east emitter tunnel 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:16.559
 and in the programs the bayern are very coordinated with the federal district 

00:07:16.559 --> 00:07:20.009
 with the state of mexico with the authorities the guard also with the 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:21.029
 municipalities 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:25.280
 i the central part which we find 1010 is the efficiency 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.809
 we have had in Guantanamo psoe tried a campaign 

00:07:27.809 --> 00:07:29.740
 the use of careful watersheds 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.930
 for a we are not going to put very hard in the care of water 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.660
 in the primary secondary network and light systems of the operating bodies 

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.020
 municipal and federal district cti 

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.809
 that is a very important issue 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:45.099
 because josé luis parra was postponed black morals cáceres year equally 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:46.089
 for you good morning 

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:48.329
