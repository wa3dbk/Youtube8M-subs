00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.660
 the sap is collected at the beginning of the 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.580
 spring when the arts are in 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.290
 state of inactivity and when the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.839
 temperature reaches three or four 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.210
 degrees centigrade the cycle of 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.400
 Freezing and thawing alters the pressure 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.609
 inside the tree and triggers the flow 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 of sap the first step is to drill the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.930
 trees a hole is made a 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.240
 centimeter by five deep and it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.540
 Carefully insert a tube is 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.579
 important not to damage the bark that does not 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.260
 it would only harm the tree but 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.510
 would allow air to enter the 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:45.110
 sap what would spoil the taste no longer 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.410
 you see too many sap buckets 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.410
 today the sap is pumped through tubes 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.650
 polyethylene 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.190
 that reach a pumping station 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.860
 the areas a 90 and 75 water and only a 25 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.650
 sugar to transform the sap into 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.290
 syrup you have to boil it you need 40 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.800
 liters of sap to make a liter 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.800
 syrup 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.460
 When the tank is full, the sap 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.700
 Pumping automatically into a tank 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.770
 stainless steel located in the sugar bowl 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.330
 the most advanced producers use a 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.130
 special machine that concentrates 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.180
 partially the sap by osmosis 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.250
 inverse this process triples the level 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:37.500
 of natural sugar from the sap so 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.350
 you have to take it - from there the sap 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.450
 flows to the evaporator heats the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.799
 sap to the boiling point and it 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.890
 keep boiling the time it is 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.319
 needed to evaporate 66% of water 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 If the water evaporates very fast or very 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:55.319
 Slowly it will negatively affect the color 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.420
 to the taste and texture of the syrup without 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.580
 however and this is where the experience 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.640
 it is everything there is not a cooking time 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.950
 established the sugar producers of 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.659
 Experienced art can say when 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.659
 is ready just to look at it 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.459
 the sugar level is checked using 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.459
 a device called high total 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.870
 when the syrup is at its point it 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.909
 put in a pressure filter to 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.420
 eliminate calcium waste and other 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:39.879
 impurities the syrup is stored in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.859
 drums that have been steam cleaned 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.470
 'laboratory analyzes a sample of each 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.110
 barrel 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.940
 using sophisticated instruments the 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.720
 technicians classify the color from 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.480
 dark to extra clear they also evaluate the 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.760
 quality the lowest quality syrup is 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.490
 intended for industrial use the highest 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.950
 quality for retail sale 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.510
 syrup is pasteurized and then 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.760
 store in huge steel tanks 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.920
 Stainless tanks are sealed to the 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.960
 vacuum with a nitrogen barrier for 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.510
 preserve flavor and color and to 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.910
 avoid fermentation, in addition, 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.890
 prevents the syrup from crystallizing after 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.080
 the laboratory uses an instrument 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.850
 called absorption spectrophotometer 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.100
 atomic to analyze the content 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.510
 syrup mineral and to ensure that 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.510
 meets the quality levels 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.230
 then the syrup is heated in 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.440
 stainless steel heaters and it 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.420
 go through industrial filters with this 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.680
 step it is guaranteed that the syrup will be 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.680
 perfectly clear 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.960
 finally just before bottling 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.900
 it heats up again this time to 82 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.910
 degrees Celsius with this is not only 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.710
 sterilizes in the bottles but it 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.700
 guarantees that the syrup will have a life 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.700
 4 years 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.290
 the maple syrup has a high 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.200
 sugar content but less calories 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.620
 that honey or brown sugar is 100% 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.110
 pure and natural and is a good source of 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.610
 three essential nutrients a calcium 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:31.080
 potassium and magnesium and of course you know 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.080
 great with the pancakes
