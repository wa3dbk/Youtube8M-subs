00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.770 
lying down and flip his legs up and try
to<00:01:30.920> stop<00:01:31.189> a<00:01:31.220> puck<00:01:31.490> walls<00:01:31.700> finish<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.119> high<00:01:32.360> and

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
to stop a puck walls finish a high and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.660 
to stop a puck walls finish a high and
deflect<00:01:33.439> pops<00:01:33.679> from<00:01:34.039> coming<00:01:34.399> up<00:01:34.490> from<00:01:34.610> the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
deflect pops from coming up from the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.520 
deflect pops from coming up from the
corners<00:01:35.119> you<00:01:35.450> can<00:01:35.570> make<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.020> safe<00:01:36.259> from<00:01:36.470> a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
corners you can make a safe from a

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.169 
corners you can make a safe from a
seated<00:01:36.799> position<00:01:36.950> so<00:01:37.759> there's<00:01:37.939> a<00:01:38.000> lot<00:01:38.149> more

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:38.179 
seated position so there's a lot more

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.969 
seated position so there's a lot more
stuff<00:01:38.689> that<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:38.929> can<00:01:39.049> do<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.380> would<00:01:39.799> give

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
stuff that you can do that would give

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.169 
stuff that you can do that would give
you<00:01:40.070> a<00:01:40.130> little<00:01:40.340> more<00:01:40.429> control<00:01:40.850> over<00:01:40.880> the

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
you a little more control over the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.240 
you a little more control over the
goalie<00:01:41.420> so<00:01:41.899> we<00:01:42.049> really<00:01:42.320> brought<00:01:42.679> that<00:01:42.740> out<00:01:42.950> and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
goalie so we really brought that out and

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.710 
goalie so we really brought that out and
we<00:01:43.310> think<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.640> going<00:01:43.759> to<00:01:43.819> be<00:01:43.909> a<00:01:44.030> huge<00:01:44.569> thing

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
we think it's going to be a huge thing

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.890 
we think it's going to be a huge thing
that<00:01:44.990> our<00:01:45.200> consumers<00:01:45.440> would<00:01:45.709> love
