00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello, my name is young 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.770
 will 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.349
 I am a trainer and creative case in 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.290
 the courses stung shot today I'm going 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.070
 tell you about a straight neck mount 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.150
 on a piece of studies 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.880
 here I have prepared a pass that is 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.859
 present like that already in canvas and it's 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 to say to stiffen with 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.789
 fusible features available on a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.960
 part of the neck here is the 2 the top and the 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.180
 underneath and here you have the neckline 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.360
 supposed I'm going is english these two 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 left following the outline of the canvas 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.230
 it will help me to sew 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.390
 regularly I will put some bread in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 through and now I'll be able to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.270
 sting I start with a point a point 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.270
 stop while backing up 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.350
 I can remove the pins let it 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.350
 gently because there is hungary 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.580
 I do not have them that I prefer it avoids 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.220
 to damage the needles for the machine 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.380
 and the breakpoint I'm going now 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.970
 equalize by intersecting a little bit 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.780
 especially in the rounds and I'm going 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.260
 to make a sting of maintenance while spreading 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.260
 sewing 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.190
 I scratch a little bit in the shade and I 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.330
 will do the sting of keeping in 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.540
 starting right after the round says this 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.050
 it is to make a beautiful finish 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.700
 could go back to also do it 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:53.550
 I prefer to do this sting of 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.470
 maintaining that's so I centered their 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.790
 peers of the feet on the seam and I 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.590
 shifted right to the right 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:08.240
 so on the side of the canvas that is going to be in 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.240
 below a small breakpoint 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.350
 I'm careful to always leave the 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.840
 open seam underneath I stop 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:26.580
 a little bit before the rounding I'm going 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.500
 return the pass now and here where 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.989
 there was the maintenance of it will bite 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.060
 against the koussa will not be seen what 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.620
 will see it will be on that side I do not 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.870
 do not have to topstitch 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.290
 that very well leave like that there I 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.720
 go back to the finger like Thursday since 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.510
 it's cotton otherwise it would have to be 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.100
 go back to this side before the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.530
 go up we'll say he's ironed 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.530
 this is the future coll
