well on earth box so if you do that then
I<00:02:45.350> thought<00:02:45.800> absolutely<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:46.310> between<00:02:46.490> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
I thought absolutely but between the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.300 
I thought absolutely but between the
boxes<00:02:46.940> we<00:02:47.060> played<00:02:47.240> well<00:02:47.420> too

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
boxes we played well too

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.900

not just United and home in the lead for
the<00:02:53.030> first<00:02:53.060> time<00:02:53.840> in<00:02:54.380> 30<00:02:55.010> years<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:56.360> don't<00:02:56.840> think

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
the first time in 30 years I don't think

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.990 
the first time in 30 years I don't think
we<00:02:57.650> give<00:02:57.770> it<00:02:57.890> any<00:02:58.010> more<00:02:58.160> unlucky<00:02:58.489> them<00:02:58.730> about

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
we give it any more unlucky them about

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.630 
we give it any more unlucky them about
another<00:02:59.360> fossil<00:02:59.599> where<00:03:00.050> was<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.640> incredible
