gear for reasons other than you would
think<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.429> example<00:00:30.240> yes

Bugsy can walk on a flat collar
beautifully<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.649> know<00:00:34.770> will<00:00:35.010> walk<00:00:35.399> on

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
beautifully you know will walk on

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.420

whatever<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> put<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.630> but<00:00:37.170> we<00:00:37.380> use<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
whatever I put it on but we use a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.959 
whatever I put it on but we use a
martingale<00:00:39.210> now<00:00:39.960> we<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.770> these<00:00:41.070> simply

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
martingale now we use these simply

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.779 
martingale now we use these simply
because<00:00:42.360> with<00:00:42.809> my<00:00:43.110> neuropathy<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.129> fewer

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
because with my neuropathy the fewer

buckles and clasps and clips and
everything<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> better<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.140> really

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
everything the better so this is really

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.799 
everything the better so this is really
nice<00:00:49.620> because<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.340> come<00:00:52.399> what's<00:00:53.399> up

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
nice because that's come what's up

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.360 
nice because that's come what's up
because<00:00:54.809> I<00:00:55.020> can<00:00:55.199> just<00:00:55.410> slide<00:00:55.949> it<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.190> over

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
because I can just slide it right over

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.330 
because I can just slide it right over
his<00:00:56.699> head<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.079> easy<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.530> now<00:00:59.280> to

minor and pointless reason to use the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.900 
nothing wrong with that the wheelchair
leash<00:03:44.290> which<00:03:44.590> clips<00:03:45.160> onto<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> wheelchair<00:03:45.850> of

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
leash which clips onto the wheelchair of

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.390 
leash which clips onto the wheelchair of
it<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.090> also<00:03:46.269> it<00:03:46.720> doubles<00:03:47.380> as<00:03:47.709> another

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
it is also it doubles as another

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.220 
it is also it doubles as another
hands-free<00:03:49.000> leash<00:03:49.269> because<00:03:49.450> I<00:03:49.630> made<00:03:49.900> it<00:03:50.049> to

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
hands-free leash because I made it to

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.319 
hands-free leash because I made it to
hook<00:03:50.590> on<00:03:50.859> to<00:03:51.099> my<00:03:51.220> wrist<00:03:51.430> it's<00:03:51.849> just<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.299> a

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
hook on to my wrist it's just like a

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.059 
hook on to my wrist it's just like a
bracelet<00:03:52.840> so<00:03:52.959> obviously<00:03:53.470> when<00:03:53.709> you're<00:03:53.799> using

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
bracelet so obviously when you're using

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.370 
bracelet so obviously when you're using
both<00:03:54.280> hands<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.670> wheel<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.269> very<00:03:55.870> difficult

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
both hands to wheel it's very difficult

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.050 
both hands to wheel it's very difficult
to<00:03:56.680> hold<00:03:56.799> on<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.099> a<00:03:57.130> leash<00:03:57.340> at<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.579> same<00:03:57.790> time

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
to hold on to a leash at the same time

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.420 
to hold on to a leash at the same time
and<00:03:58.510> then<00:03:58.720> AB<00:03:58.959> neuropathy<00:03:59.680> on<00:03:59.829> top<00:04:00.099> of<00:04:00.310> that

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
and then AB neuropathy on top of that

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.460 
and then AB neuropathy on top of that
and<00:04:00.730> it's<00:04:00.880> darn<00:04:01.239> near<00:04:01.510> impossible<00:04:01.840> if<00:04:02.380> you

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and it's darn near impossible if you

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.349 
and it's darn near impossible if you
have<00:04:02.620> a<00:04:02.799> problem<00:04:03.340> with<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.519> gear<00:04:03.760> somebody

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:04.359 
have a problem with the gear somebody

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.259 
have a problem with the gear somebody
uses<00:04:04.810> keep<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.410> to<00:04:05.530> yourself<00:04:05.889> unless<00:04:06.099> the<00:04:07.090> dog

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
uses keep it to yourself unless the dog

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.180 
uses keep it to yourself unless the dog
is<00:04:07.450> being<00:04:07.660> injured<00:04:08.049> or<00:04:08.290> harmed<00:04:08.560> or<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.099> is

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
is being injured or harmed or it is

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.320 
is being injured or harmed or it is
dangerous<00:04:09.700> in<00:04:09.940> some

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
dangerous in some

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.590 
dangerous in some
then<00:04:10.660> you<00:04:11.500> know<00:04:11.620> obviously<00:04:12.160> but<00:04:13.060> just<00:04:15.600> don't

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
then you know obviously but just don't

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.070 
then you know obviously but just don't
be<00:04:17.019> so<00:04:19.350> judgy<00:04:20.350> and<00:04:20.910> mean<00:04:21.910> this<00:04:22.510> is<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.690> terrible

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
be so judgy and mean this is a terrible

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.170 
be so judgy and mean this is a terrible
rant<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.830> feel<00:04:24.160> like<00:04:24.340> this<00:04:24.520> video<00:04:24.820> really

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
rant I feel like this video really

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.240 
rant I feel like this video really
needed<00:04:25.660> to<00:04:25.690> be<00:04:25.960> made<00:04:26.170> and<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.740> trying<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.070> be

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
needed to be made and just trying to be

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.430 
needed to be made and just trying to be
a<00:04:27.280> little<00:04:27.430> more<00:04:27.700> understanding<00:04:28.540> because<00:04:28.900> just

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
a little more understanding because just

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.080 
a little more understanding because just
because<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.860> dog<00:04:30.040> isn't<00:04:30.490> walking<00:04:30.640> on<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:30.970> flat

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
because the dog isn't walking on a flat

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.970 
because the dog isn't walking on a flat
vocal<00:04:31.600> collar<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:32.110> doesn't<00:04:32.140> mean<00:04:32.590> they<00:04:32.710> can't

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
vocal collar it doesn't mean they can't

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.500 
vocal collar it doesn't mean they can't
it<00:04:33.220> doesn't<00:04:33.640> mean<00:04:33.790> they<00:04:33.940> don't<00:04:34.150> know<00:04:34.300> how<00:04:34.480> to

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
it doesn't mean they don't know how to

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.080

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
and and like I said my example was just

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.660 
and and like I said my example was just
one<00:04:37.390> of<00:04:37.540> many<00:04:37.780> oh<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.590> should<00:04:38.620> also<00:04:39.040> say<00:04:39.190> one

more thing I'm sorry this is just the

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.250 
more thing I'm sorry this is just the
most<00:04:41.830> pointless<00:04:42.580> unstructured<00:04:43.570> rant<00:04:44.050> I've

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
most pointless unstructured rant I've

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.970
