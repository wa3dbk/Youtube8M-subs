00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.760
 not previously understood but afterwards 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.650
 do you understand that you feel it when you 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.500

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.940

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.549
 go do it to show that you are per 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.560
 can immediately surprise yourself 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.729
 I wanted I wanted to go here later 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 to start with 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.679
 ok within 4 minutes more than you can 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.509
 breathing 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.920
 let me push you to be hungry 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.560
 to breathe 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 so within 4 minutes without breathing 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.280
 since I push you more than plus like 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.469
 you could breathe it and it is 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.409
 a way through which more oxygen enters 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:50.069
 your body ends up where its through 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:52.619
 the acidification occurs less so you 

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.109
 feels here he is i am not getting tired 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.909
 No what is this wim guts through 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:59.039
 geert help what should we do 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.630
 we go and we do breathing exercises 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.690
 two minutes too and then you go the 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.170
 make imprints 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.800
 within 3 minutes bk ok where you come 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.230
 gets it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:15.090
 fully in and do not let go completely 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.090
 but fully in again 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.610
 keep it up keep it up 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.690
 are you going to feel light we already had in you 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.090
 heard that makes sense because the co2 looks like 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.090
 and the o2 that is released in your body 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.200
 passages outside your lungs 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 just keep the focus on feeling that way 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.480
 you become focused and continue 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.930
 just continue and the or feeling goes 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.000
 therefore and in a moment you will do your best 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.670
 that's the only thing i'm a regular at 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:03.040
 keep your head I will do my best this way 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:05.200
 immediately after and were let go here 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.820
 Continue yes seriously you want to go deeper 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.480
 your body me 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.920
 we seriously okay i will stand next to you now 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.670
 then you get a little further guidance 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.340
 so 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.510
 ok i can row a plate yes we go 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.780
 we turn we go to the last time 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.930
 who was the coffins 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.660
 now so 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.950
 so 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.950
 the laps of traffic 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.310
 baby monitor 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.510
 so we have had more power 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.740
 actually to press 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.100
 then if we didn't have that exercise 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.620
 done yes well that's precisely because you have more 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:48.160
 taught him the here that co2 from it 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.620
 body and more oxygen in it 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.290
 to apply your tissue and a yes 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.000
 then if you can oxygen your hair 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.890
 just keep on coming heavy 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.110
 both to about twenty times that is 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.880
 in my experience 10 more than I normally do 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.620
 could it is already interesting yes 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.790
 we have a lot more out of me but we do 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.040
 think maybe it should be with this 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.810
 yes that the ice could go again then 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.370
 we will do it again is good at it 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.760
 yes i think it is crazy next to me 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.760
 a nice thing 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.480
