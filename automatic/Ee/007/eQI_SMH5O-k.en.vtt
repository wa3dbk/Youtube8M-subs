who<00:00:32.850> didn't<00:00:33.329> eat<00:00:33.600> breakfast<00:00:34.020> why<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.530> that

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
who didn't eat breakfast why is that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.370

they tend to eat more the rest of the
day<00:00:37.559> yeah<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> most<00:00:38.430> likely<00:00:38.700> reason

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
day yeah that's the most likely reason

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.229 
day yeah that's the most likely reason
also<00:00:39.570> their<00:00:39.899> diets<00:00:40.290> were<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.920> as<00:00:41.550> healthy

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
also their diets were not as healthy

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
also their diets were not as healthy
they<00:00:42.809> found<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.230> had<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.680> less

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

they found that they had a lot less
fiber<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.430> calcium<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.090> diet<00:00:45.149> too<00:00:45.660> so

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
fiber and calcium in their diet too so

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.630 
fiber and calcium in their diet too so
