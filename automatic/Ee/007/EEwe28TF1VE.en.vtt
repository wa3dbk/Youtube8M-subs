00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
that they do not need and then they'll

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.480 
that they do not need and then they'll
put<00:01:11.510> the<00:01:11.630> remaining<00:01:12.110> 6<00:01:12.620> on<00:01:12.950> a<00:01:12.979> blank<00:01:13.250> piece<00:01:13.430> of

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
put the remaining 6 on a blank piece of

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
for making a paper airplane they can

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.789 
for making a paper airplane they can
then<00:01:19.010> exchange<00:01:19.880> it<00:01:20.270> with<00:01:20.390> a<00:01:20.420> classmate<00:01:20.720> or<00:01:21.620> you

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
then exchange it with a classmate or you

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:23.170 
then exchange it with a classmate or you
can<00:01:21.950> just<00:01:22.070> let<00:01:22.250> them<00:01:22.430> go<00:01:22.580> off<00:01:22.729> their<00:01:22.970> own

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
can just let them go off their own

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.770 
can just let them go off their own
algorithm<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.549> they<00:01:25.549> will<00:01:25.880> follow<00:01:26.330> it<00:01:26.600> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
algorithm and they will follow it and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.100 
algorithm and they will follow it and
actually<00:01:27.200> make<00:01:27.860> paper<00:01:28.220> airplanes<00:01:28.930> after<00:01:29.930> that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
actually make paper airplanes after that

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.500 
actually make paper airplanes after that
you<00:01:30.350> can<00:01:30.590> take<00:01:30.890> them<00:01:31.190> outside<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.000> fly<00:01:32.299> them

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
you can take them outside and fly them

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.810 
you can take them outside and fly them
around<00:01:33.100> incorporate<00:01:34.100> it<00:01:34.220> into<00:01:34.369> another

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
around incorporate it into another

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.390 
around incorporate it into another

completed

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.219 
completed
we<00:01:40.460> have<00:01:40.790> heard<00:01:41.090> some<00:01:41.210> concerns<00:01:41.690> that<00:01:41.990> in

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
we have heard some concerns that in

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.280 
we have heard some concerns that in
young<00:01:42.979> classrooms<00:01:43.729> there<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:44.810> potential

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
young classrooms there is the potential

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.160 
young classrooms there is the potential
for<00:01:45.560> injury<00:01:45.950> with<00:01:46.610> paper<00:01:46.850> airplanes<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.780> we

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
for injury with paper airplanes and we

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.010 
for injury with paper airplanes and we
found<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.159> if<00:01:49.340> you<00:01:49.369> blunt<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.299> edge<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.840> the

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
found that if you blunt the edge of the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.230 
found that if you blunt the edge of the
airplane<00:01:51.439> either<00:01:51.740> by<00:01:51.950> folding<00:01:52.369> it<00:01:52.490> in<00:01:52.640> cutting

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
be that not only does it not fly as far

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.399 
be that not only does it not fly as far
and<00:01:58.790> as<00:01:58.880> fast<00:01:58.909> it's<00:01:59.540> a<00:01:59.659> lot<00:01:59.840> less<00:02:00.020> likely<00:02:00.259> to

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
and as fast it's a lot less likely to

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.740 
and as fast it's a lot less likely to
injure<00:02:00.890> somebody<00:02:01.130> so<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.850> concerns<00:02:02.299> you<00:02:02.570> can
