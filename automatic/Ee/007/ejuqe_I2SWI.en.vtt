00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.610
 I do not remember such a season yet 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.400
 was in chelyabinsk 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.910
 Well, the goal was very pleasant 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.580
 polar bear to hand over the prize for winning 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.320
 division here but once again the final 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.779
 the opportunity was to see the game better 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 runoff the first period ended 30 very 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 I can confidently play a team 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.509
 wish good luck i think that with such a game 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.210
 team 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.980
 well at least should go far in 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 this playoff team plays very 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.850
 plays well with confidence that season 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 the guys have reached almost the desired 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.590
 the result now actually speaking 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.330
 and experience was added separately of course I want 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.040
 say you have a great coach 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:54.660
 this is what anwar returned to junior for 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.990
 order that apparently strictly speaking 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.900
 help juniors take the cup this again 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.840
 such a guarantee of success is probably my 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.030
 flyer purely financial reasons 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.799
 To me, this change is basically absolutely not 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.710
 like broken sports principle 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.869
 mikhail understand this all but 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.010
 Now the financial situation is so much 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.340
 complicated by just counting 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:22.660
 budget forced to take that step 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.710
 otherwise it may happen that at the end 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.990
 playoffs we have no money left 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.360
 pay for the flight of moving teams 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.280
 so this is not very popular for us 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.340
 unpleasant but on forced measure 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.190
 times financially difficult but nobody 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.170
 did not call me yet did not say that 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.160
 plans to leave the youth hockey 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.910
 league new teams in the championship I am not 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.830
 expect them in the championship team from 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.220
 Murmansky wants to leave if everything goes 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.560
 well, they will come here 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.410
 expect probably a little shrink 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.470
 the number of championship teams is at the expense of 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:05.270
 the fact that several teams do not have 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:08.450
 let's say so successful will go play 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.480
 primacy here but cardinal changes 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.470
 we don't expect just want to do 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.450
 championship a little bit even stronger 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.520
 let's say a little bit so elite so 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.640
 competition to boost it 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.380
 the quality here but you know we say 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.380
 no negative changes
