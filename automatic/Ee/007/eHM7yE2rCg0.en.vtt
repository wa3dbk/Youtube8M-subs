 mama 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.020
 hello and welcome to the auto blog 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:10.940
 for testing the new fiat during 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.290
 April 4 out thirty years ago is 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.539
 become a real icon of the cities 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.550
 but not only today 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.900
 unveils the third generation then 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.890
 is she up to her predecessors 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.890
 we will try to answer it 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.509
 this version 4 4 retains the features 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.490
 rondouillard inaugurated by the third 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.529
 generation but benefits from a kit 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.170
 bodywork going with its vocation of 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.820
 bow fighter from bow to stern 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.980
 she receives plastic elements 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.040
 black and metal protections under 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.590
 the body is elevated 4.7 cm 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.360
 with a ground clearance of 16 cm she 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.730
 inaugurates two new colors 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.860
 laurange sicily and the Tuscan worm of 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.100
 our very military test model in 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.100
 blade 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.110
 the interior is identical to the panda 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.090
 normal with its caron theme 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.660
 using square shapes at the edges 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.670
 rounded 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.590
 this version takes up the lounge finish 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.720
 of the panda with among others the 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.180
 dual drive direction air conditioning or 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.180
 the car stereo cd mp3 with 6 speakers 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.780
 if you imagine the behavior of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.210
 band at 4 4 like that you're wrong 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.130
 the car does not have to blush in front of everything 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.480
 much bigger grounds we can not imagine 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.340
 necessarily transalpine on 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.500
 the most hostile terrain of the globe but 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.520
 it would be wrong to underestimate it 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.830
 off-road uses a new 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.570
 visco hydraulic coupler placed under 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.270
 the drive shaft is managed by 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.890
 an electronic central as soon as the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.660
 speed of rotation of the roads differs 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.820
 between front and rear axles 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.380
 the oil pump drives the disks 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.150
 clutch to move to the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.250
 full transmission in terms of 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.050
 comfort the operation is imperceptible 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.490
 however it will only take a short 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.140
 moment to feel the car getting 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:02:00.330
 put back in laxe in case of understeer 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:02:02.340
 or oversteer on tracks like this 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.350
 Geopark in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges his 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 small size and his abilities takes him 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.270
 to get out of all situations 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.370
 far from the simple claw system of his 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.980
 predecessor 30 years old the new 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 panda 4.4 equips the activable ulb 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.959
 under 50 km this variant of the spd 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.240
 active traction control and simulates action 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.990
 a mechanical locking device by braking 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.430
 the rear wheel losing grip 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.410
 associated with the 190 diesel block 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 newtons-meters of torque at 1500 rpm 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.310
 minute his name an attack of 21 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.110
 degrees and leaks at 36 degrees the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.470
 city ​​dweller absorbs without blinking 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.239
 slopes up to 70% and green 55% 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.709
 and despite its 5-speed gearbox 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.540
 conventional 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.340
 the diesel version is more 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.380
 comfortable off the beaten track that the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.630
 petrol declination with a box 6 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.370
 reports with the first short gear 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.080
 the third generation of fiat panda 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.910
 4.4 and finally less identifiable 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
 that the very first however the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.580
 work done on 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.110
 electronics and mechanics children 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.000
 a real pass by all who did not 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.770
 to blush in the face of bigger fighter 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.770
 while doing a good job in the city
