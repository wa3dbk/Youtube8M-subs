00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.130
 and well hi all to all gamers 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.330
 it's me are erasures I hope that 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.890
 you're fine me it's really going 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.689
 nickel so today so we get 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.360
 found on a video that is really 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.010
 Special fully that what has 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
 never been produced i believe on youtube 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.980
 so this is a video that I could 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.960
 realize so in league 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.239
 listen to me well in league so I'm 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 platinum grade i think i have to be 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.290
 80 stuff like that so it's a part 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.510
 basic r &amp; d but you will see 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.250
 there that there was something 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.129
 exceptional during this part you 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.119
 go see a player who was called 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.629
 chichi gold or something like that 

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.769
 bargain hunters or something like that and suddenly 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.510
 you will simply see that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.510
 it's something that has been for the 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.030
 first time in my life I have it 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.369
 discovered on youtube in their tube of 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.140
 discovered on the playstation 3 and I 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.940
 did not know that it existed 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.110
 so was called 6 gold 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.180
 so that's it so I just 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 explain to you this is a lobby so 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.970
 you will see that a few sleeves 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.530
 you will see appear but 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.880
 hundreds late hundreds of heads not 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.100
 dozens of missiles 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.730
 storm as well as drone players 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.410
 escort things like those of 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.090
 shot while he made k23 he 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.250
 so this is really a part where we have 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.190
 we lost but we lost 6 1 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.840
 so after that it's normal we lost but 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.340
 good you will immediately noticed 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.410
 that there I play a lot of snipers on 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.970
 this part then there I was waiting the 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.750
 first so I got bumped by 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 chi x 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.910
 now we're going to call it that so they and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.010
 41 in bronze and you'll see what he 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.560
 will we produce then look well at the 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.550
 card there a drone I know more what 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.200
 like drones once it's a drone 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.550
 escort a lot of stars and you go 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 see them and the halestorm missiles 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 was coming in waves so and 2 a missile 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 at the storm 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 you can see that he has that 1 he has 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.220
 his assets and there you can see everything 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 which balance so I do not know if this lobby 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.240
 existed but he is tanned he should 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.800
 to be totally banned because 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.840
 liliana they are trying to rank in 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.160
 league and so I came across this 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.590
 part it really pissed me off but 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.430
 good I found it funny anyway 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.690
 you can see that all the missiles 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.910
 of a storm that happens so there is some 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.310
 three that are put at the same time there are 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.739
 an aircraft or an escort drone he's me 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.650
 seems so you can see that's it 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.080
 it's really parts of shit and I 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.680
 do not even understand why it should 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.010
 I do not understand why it's in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.489
 league 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.900
 it's okay it should be banned so the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.700
 was playing with French and he 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.760
 found that wall amusing to win 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.069
 with a lobby frankly I 'll have it 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.659
 told them it's his serve is that 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.670
 serves visit it was strictly for 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:53.870
 nothing or there I said I'm struggling so 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.159
 So here you go to enjoy this 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.349
 part I hope even if we had a 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:58.849
 unacceptable defeat a good early on 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.370
 is 4 and in the end we fall back I'll be 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.140
 all by the way and you'll see 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.430
 so here are all the assets 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.879
 arrive in waves 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.170
 and so here at once I was not there 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.420
 too happy you can see that there I 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.379
 make names with the with the camera and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.230
 then I was moving 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.250
 everywhere in not in the room is there 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.900
 I like and I thought I'll do 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.519
 a little challenge then there lodestar he goes 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.980
 to be launched and I would like to go 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.819
 defuse the bomb by dodging all that 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.450
 but you will see that it is 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.700
 impossible 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.480
 and therefore So here it really is 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.889
 long time I had not made a video 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 commented and I found this video 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.430
 weird enough to make it 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.139
 true that it's not videos for a 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.849
 often cited as controlling parties 

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.959
 that especially on bo2 I did not know that these 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.739
 parts there existed so so that's it 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.129
 I hope this video will make you happy 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.700
 is there in passing and 431 subscribers I 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.500
 thanks all for about 65 miles 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.599
 lives it seems to me 62000 pyre more 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.370
 between these two areas so that's it 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.049
 so I hope this year will be will 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.099
 good and I hope a lot of 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.540
 people will subscribe 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:59.510
 so we can see that we are 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.530
 more than two months and the mower a 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.620
 someone I did not know 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.760
 absolutely not and so here is where 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.870
 we are already here for the 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.879
 fourth round 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.989
 and you know that in league it takes six 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.160
 points to win so this is true 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:12.590
 I told myself right now if 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.910
 swing the strict like that it was 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.459
 lost to me from before that so I 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:19.370
 think I just had the one 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.650
 jelly was looking for its then if I sell 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.979
 to the visa officer I'm not 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.400
 I take cover I aim and the boom 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:28.930
 I did so I had 6 gold 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.570
 whoever was doing the one who was doing 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.000
 the lobbies so here it was it was 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.830
 really a really tchité part and 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 So that's so it made me shit 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.580
 you can understand it but hey it's 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.930
 true that it's not every day that I 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.949
 order parties like that we know 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.270
 that's not really what to tell you apart 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.770
 that it really becomes a part 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.660
 disgusting so there you can see I 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.009
 am alone 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.289
 good in the face I do not know if they had 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.180
 higher or lower levels but 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:54.340
 we could not do it 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.030
 a glass we will say correctly or 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:01.150
 e4v 415 lobby come to us 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.860
 challenge you can see that julio 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.630
 custom baptista with armored base 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.490
 it seems to me and ballistic processor 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.800
 so here it is here I am all alone 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:15.789
 we know the song I want to do I 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.350
 to make me stop at the last 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.699
 sleeve you'll see I'm not going to you 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.370
 to say but I'm going to realize a little 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:23.289
 carnage except one that will stumble on the 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.090
 submachine gun it seems to me so here are the 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:29.639
 others so I let you listen to this 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.289
 they tell me we guys guys 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:38.380
 before him quietly my mouth 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:41.080
 wicked and the clip cdefi is quite 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.680
 nothing go here so these dogs gold who 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.949
 did all that 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.570
 so I find myself can moment 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:50.650
 of loneliness niro against a lobby 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.229
 unacceptable so here I think I have 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.490
 still to bump it seems to me that 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:54.880
 I decided to go directly from 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.159
 the other side 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.070
 so there I saw full so j down 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:03.220
 where I try in water and there I think it 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.199
 told me literally to me by the way 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.120
 I believe that this bullet was not 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.710
 all destined for me but hey you go 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.710
 see who will still kill me the 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.449
 so that's the first quick scope 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.190
 second quick scope and this is a 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.139
 kind of scop dredge that is not of 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.050
 everything about me so 

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:22.120
 so I drink too much entrie is so low there 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.289
 we start the last run for me and 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.460
 after that I will leave you so I 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.199
 thanks all the people who 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.639
 let's look at this video a lot of 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.710
 people like my videos right now 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:31.659
 and it's true that I have quotation marks 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:32.139
 there are fans who see themselves as 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:33.219
 fans 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:36.129
 you will see that here I am going to make a 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:37.080
 little carnage I'm going to kill one here is 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:39.249
 from 1 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.449
 so I thanked all the people 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:42.249
 who have subscribed to my channel and who 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.949
 will subscribe to the passage the sale urns 

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:48.980
 and is not finished the beginning of a legend 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:50.840
 up with coop and here I go out 

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:52.010
 b 23 yesterday but then I saw that someone 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.510
 shoot me from behind 

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:54.440
 so here I decided to throw an arrow 

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:57.169
 but you will see that I'm going all 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.490
 to simply die stupidly and 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.199
 he's going to me 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.020
