this is ashes of singularity and it's a

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.720 
this is ashes of singularity and it's a
new<00:00:06.960> strategy<00:00:07.770> game<00:00:08.040> we're<00:00:08.189> working<00:00:08.490> on<00:00:08.580> to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
new strategy game we're working on to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.850 
new strategy game we're working on to
come<00:00:08.910> out<00:00:09.030> that's<00:00:09.300> what's<00:00:09.420> come<00:00:09.630> out<00:00:09.860> next

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
come out that's what's come out next

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.339 
come out that's what's come out next
year<00:00:11.040> ish<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.780> what<00:00:12.780> we're<00:00:12.929> showing<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.259> on

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
year ish and what we're showing it on

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.680 
year ish and what we're showing it on
here<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> mantle<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.700> running<00:00:14.910> at<00:00:15.059> 4k

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
here is a mantle it's running at 4k

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.620 
here is a mantle it's running at 4k
resolution<00:00:16.470> ok<00:00:16.920> so<00:00:17.250> like<00:00:17.609> if<00:00:18.180> we<00:00:18.420> were<00:00:18.480> running

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
resolution ok so like if we were running

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.560 
resolution ok so like if we were running
on<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.900> saved<00:00:19.590> directx<00:00:20.430> 11<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.910> were<00:00:21.090> not<00:00:21.300> going

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
on a saved directx 11 you were not going

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.900 
on a saved directx 11 you were not going
to<00:00:21.600> run<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.140> 4k<00:00:22.980> that's<00:00:23.250> not<00:00:23.430> even<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
to run this at 4k that's not even a

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.960 
to run this at 4k that's not even a
possibility<00:00:24.289> so<00:00:25.289> thanks<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.650> mantle<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.760> as

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
possibility so thanks to mantle and as

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.720 
possibility so thanks to mantle and as
well<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.240> DirectX<00:00:27.720> 12<00:00:27.840> we<00:00:28.740> can<00:00:28.890> now<00:00:29.039> do<00:00:29.099> things

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
well as DirectX 12 we can now do things

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.939 
well as DirectX 12 we can now do things
that<00:00:29.970> just<00:00:30.240> weren't<00:00:30.420> possible<00:00:30.949> previously

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that just weren't possible previously

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
that just weren't possible previously
you<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> genuinely<00:00:33.090> spectacular<00:00:33.930> level

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you have a genuinely spectacular level

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.310 
you have a genuinely spectacular level
of<00:00:34.290> complexity<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:35.130> on<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:35.579> have

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
of complexity going on here you have

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.350 
of complexity going on here you have
thousands<00:00:37.320> thousands<00:00:38.219> several<00:00:38.700> thousand

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
thousands thousands several thousand

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.119 
thousands thousands several thousand
units<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.110> being<00:00:40.260> displayed<00:00:40.590> simultaneously

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
units are being displayed simultaneously

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.340 
units are being displayed simultaneously
on<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.910> screen<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> most

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
on the screen and one of the most

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.810 
on the screen and one of the most
important<00:00:43.800> things<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.250> is<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.670> is

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
important things about this is this is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.790 
important things about this is this is
really<00:00:45.120> using<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> hardware<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.320> full<00:00:46.500> effect

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
really using the hardware to full effect

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.340 
really using the hardware to full effect
yeah<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> dual<00:00:48.149> GPU<00:00:48.660> set<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.230> an

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
yeah we have a dual GPU set up in an

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.520 
yeah we have a dual GPU set up in an
eight<00:00:49.530> core<00:00:49.770> cpu<00:00:50.250> running<00:00:50.610> flat<00:00:50.969> out<00:00:51.530> exactly

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
eight core cpu running flat out exactly

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.189 
eight core cpu running flat out exactly
now<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.890> before<00:00:53.010> mantle<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.850> just<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> do

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
now and before mantle I just going to do

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.069 
now and before mantle I just going to do
that<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.980> even<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.940> your<00:00:57.090> GPU<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.809> amazing

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
that you even if your GPU can do amazing

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.049 
that you even if your GPU can do amazing
things<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.829> just<00:00:58.859> couldn't<00:00:59.309> feed<00:00:59.609> it<00:00:59.760> fast

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
things we just couldn't feed it fast

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.170 
things we just couldn't feed it fast
enough<00:01:00.239> because<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.289> our<00:01:01.859> input<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.850> gpo

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
enough because the our input to the gpo

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.990 
enough because the our input to the gpo
would<00:01:03.300> be<00:01:03.420> serialized<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:05.339> was<00:01:05.850> basically

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
would be serialized so it was basically

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.140 
would be serialized so it was basically
a<00:01:06.270> traffic<00:01:06.689> cop<00:01:06.900> between<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> CPU<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.760> GPU

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
a traffic cop between the CPU in the GPU

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.410 
a traffic cop between the CPU in the GPU
but<00:01:09.299> now<00:01:09.799> every<00:01:10.799> single<00:01:11.130> core<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.670> your<00:01:11.760> CPU<00:01:12.240> is

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
but now every single core of your CPU is

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
but now every single core of your CPU is
getting<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.750> fully<00:01:13.049> utilized<00:01:13.560> there's<00:01:14.100> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
getting you fully utilized there's a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.380 
getting you fully utilized there's a
number<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.790> interesting<00:01:15.060> things

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
number of really interesting things

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.999 
number of really interesting things
especially<00:01:15.840> from<00:01:16.140> a<00:01:16.170> technical<00:01:16.560> point<00:01:16.860> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
especially from a technical point of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
especially from a technical point of

strategy<00:01:54.060> games<00:01:54.270> used<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.790> many

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
strategy games used to be like many

strategy games used to be like many
years<00:01:57.030> ago<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.380> built<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.070> is

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
years ago and what we have built here is

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.270 
years ago and what we have built here is
a<00:01:59.880> game<00:02:00.659> where<00:02:00.930> we<00:02:01.079> can<00:02:01.259> put<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.829> an<00:02:01.979> entire

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
a game where we can put you in an entire

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.340 
a game where we can put you in an entire
war<00:02:02.880> rather<00:02:03.180> than<00:02:03.420> just<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.689> single<00:02:03.930> battle

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
war rather than just a single battle

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.180 
war rather than just a single battle
unlike<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.250> lot<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> games

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
unlike a lot of games

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.100 
unlike a lot of games
and<00:02:07.280> previous<00:02:07.970> generation<00:02:08.540> we<00:02:08.750> were<00:02:08.869> really

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
and previous generation we were really

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
and previous generation we were really
limited<00:02:09.619> by<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.830> technology<00:02:09.979> we<00:02:10.670> couldn't

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
limited by the technology we couldn't

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.110 
limited by the technology we couldn't
offer<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.480> huge<00:02:12.440> number<00:02:13.160> of<00:02:13.190> units<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:13.850> someone

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
offer a huge number of units for someone

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.730 
offer a huge number of units for someone
to<00:02:14.240> control<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.230> because<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.530> this

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
to control but because of this

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.890 
to control but because of this
next-generation<00:02:16.490> api's<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.420> technology

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
next-generation api's and technology

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.270 
next-generation api's and technology
we're<00:02:17.990> able<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.380> bring<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.710> much<00:02:18.920> wider

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
we're able to bring a much wider

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.490 
we're able to bring a much wider
experience<00:02:19.730> so<00:02:20.660> this<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:20.840> running<00:02:21.200> right<00:02:21.320> now

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
running and looking great here people

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.940 
running and looking great here people
have<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.480> understand<00:02:29.840> that<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.170> it's<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.800> lot

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
have to understand that it's it's a lot

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.200 
have to understand that it's it's a lot
of<00:02:31.070> times<00:02:31.310> what<00:02:31.460> happens<00:02:31.520> in<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.030> game<00:02:32.180> like

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
of times what happens in a game like

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.470 
of times what happens in a game like
this<00:02:32.360> may<00:02:32.600> be<00:02:32.690> played<00:02:33.020> any<00:02:33.560> RTS<00:02:34.180> you'll<00:02:35.180> notice

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
this may be played any RTS you'll notice

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.180 
this may be played any RTS you'll notice
that<00:02:35.510> sometimes<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.140> framerate<00:02:36.410> is<00:02:36.740> most<00:02:37.070> of

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
that sometimes the framerate is most of

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.710 
that sometimes the framerate is most of
time<00:02:37.280> frame<00:02:37.490> works<00:02:37.610> fine<00:02:37.790> but<00:02:37.850> because<00:02:38.360> the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
time frame works fine but because the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
time frame works fine but because the
player<00:02:38.990> can<00:02:39.260> do<00:02:39.440> whatever<00:02:39.680> they<00:02:39.890> want<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.610> can

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
player can do whatever they want we can

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.520 
player can do whatever they want we can
get<00:02:40.880> these<00:02:41.000> peak<00:02:41.330> situations<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.290> if<00:02:42.440> you

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
get these peak situations because if you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.230 
get these peak situations because if you
see<00:02:42.710> here<00:02:43.010> there's<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.460> massive<00:02:43.760> battle

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
see here there's this massive battle

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.210 
see here there's this massive battle
going<00:02:44.420> on<00:02:44.660> because<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.560> what<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.010> player

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
going on because that's what the player

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.370 
going on because that's what the player
wanted<00:02:46.610> to<00:02:46.730> do<00:02:46.880> but<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.630> can<00:02:47.780> see<00:02:47.930> here<00:02:48.170> the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
wanted to do but you can see here the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.180 
wanted to do but you can see here the
first<00:02:48.590> thing<00:02:48.680> that's<00:02:48.830> sort<00:02:48.980> of<00:02:49.100> interesting

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
first thing that's sort of interesting

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.100 
first thing that's sort of interesting
is<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.820> can<00:02:49.970> see<00:02:50.120> that<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.390> Amanda<00:02:50.900> allows

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
is you can see that this Amanda allows

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.050 
is you can see that this Amanda allows
us<00:02:51.290> to<00:02:51.350> do<00:02:51.470> explicit<00:02:52.040> multi-gpu<00:02:52.520> which<00:02:52.850> we've

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
us to do explicit multi-gpu which we've

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.870 
us to do explicit multi-gpu which we've
been<00:02:53.240> extremely<00:02:53.750> happy<00:02:54.350> with<00:02:54.380> indeed<00:02:55.160> and<00:02:55.370> you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
been extremely happy with indeed and you

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.400 
been extremely happy with indeed and you
can<00:02:56.030> see<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.240> those<00:02:56.600> are<00:02:56.780> what<00:02:57.050> we<00:02:57.140> call<00:02:57.170> the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
can see that those are what we call the

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.110 
can see that those are what we call the
fences<00:02:57.830> it<00:02:58.010> stat<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.490> telling<00:02:58.820> us<00:02:58.910> it's

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
fences it stat it's telling us it's

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.550 
fences it stat it's telling us it's
flickering<00:02:59.420> there<00:02:59.660> because<00:02:59.990> it's<00:03:00.140> telling<00:03:00.440> us

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
flickering there because it's telling us

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.890 
flickering there because it's telling us
which<00:03:01.310> GPUs<00:03:01.850> are<00:03:02.030> full<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.360> most<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.750> time

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
which GPUs are full and most of the time

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.180 
which GPUs are full and most of the time
those<00:03:03.110> are<00:03:03.230> blinking<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.650> off<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:04.040> means

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
those are blinking on and off that means

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.710 
those are blinking on and off that means
most<00:03:04.460> more<00:03:04.700> or<00:03:04.820> less<00:03:04.940> we're<00:03:05.360> keeping<00:03:05.630> those

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
most more or less we're keeping those

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.570 
most more or less we're keeping those
GPUs<00:03:06.140> completely<00:03:06.590> filled<00:03:06.830> and<00:03:07.040> so<00:03:07.340> you<00:03:07.430> can

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
GPUs completely filled and so you can

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.250 
GPUs completely filled and so you can
see<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:07.790> even<00:03:08.060> it's<00:03:08.240> incredibly<00:03:08.840> complex

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
see that even it's incredibly complex

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.070 
see that even it's incredibly complex
scenes<00:03:09.940> mantle<00:03:10.940> is<00:03:11.090> ripping<00:03:11.450> through<00:03:11.660> it<00:03:11.810> so

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
scenes mantle is ripping through it so

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.500 
scenes mantle is ripping through it so
fast<00:03:12.350> hey<00:03:13.010> you're<00:03:13.550> losing<00:03:14.030> just<00:03:14.300> three

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
fast hey you're losing just three

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.870 
fast hey you're losing just three
milliseconds<00:03:14.780> or<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.410> per<00:03:15.650> frame<00:03:15.890> yes<00:03:16.430> only

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
milliseconds or so per frame yes only

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.850 
milliseconds or so per frame yes only
three<00:03:17.000> milliseconds<00:03:17.480> is<00:03:17.900> being<00:03:18.110> spent<00:03:18.380> inside

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
three milliseconds is being spent inside

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.040 
three milliseconds is being spent inside
the<00:03:19.130> driver<00:03:19.370> sack<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:20.209> so<00:03:20.360> that's<00:03:20.480> fantastic

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
the driver sack and so that's fantastic

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.540 
the driver sack and so that's fantastic
news<00:03:21.110> so<00:03:21.320> it's<00:03:21.440> not<00:03:21.560> it's<00:03:21.980> no<00:03:22.100> longer<00:03:22.250> taking

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
news so it's not it's no longer taking

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.640 
news so it's not it's no longer taking
away<00:03:22.820> CPU<00:03:23.330> from<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.870> things<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.200> we<00:03:24.320> want<00:03:24.530> to

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
away CPU from the things that we want to

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.640
