00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
to be tricky and I'm happy that I was

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.849 
to be tricky and I'm happy that I was
able<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.600> counter<00:00:18.960> his<00:00:20.150> pace<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.449> his<00:00:21.859> his

able to counter his pace and his his

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
able to counter his pace and his his
good<00:00:23.070> play<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.279> mean<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.699> was<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:24.050> tricky<00:00:25.050> match

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
good play I mean it was a tricky match

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.160 
good play I mean it was a tricky match
especially<00:00:25.470> at<00:00:25.859> once<00:00:26.160> at<00:00:26.340> all<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.050> in<00:00:28.050> the

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
especially at once at all and and in the

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
especially at once at all and and in the
third<00:00:28.199> set<00:00:28.680> sort<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.130> beginning<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
third set sort of in the beginning I

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.279 
third set sort of in the beginning I
thought<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> key<00:00:30.720> moment<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.170> know

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
thought that was a key moment you know

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.130 
thought that was a key moment you know
because<00:00:32.090> he<00:00:33.090> had<00:00:33.239> momentum<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.809> his<00:00:33.840> side<00:00:33.930> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
because he had momentum on his side I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.069 
because he had momentum on his side I
was<00:00:34.520> not<00:00:35.520> returning<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.329> serving<00:00:36.660> exactly

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
was not returning and serving exactly

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.229 
was not returning and serving exactly
the<00:00:37.200> way<00:00:37.350> I<00:00:37.380> wanted<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.070> was<00:00:38.730> able<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.059> come

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the way I wanted and I was able to come

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780 
the way I wanted and I was able to come
turned<00:00:39.570> around<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.050> then<00:00:40.340> finish<00:00:41.340> strong<00:00:41.610> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
turned around and then finish strong in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.880 
turned around and then finish strong in
the<00:00:41.879> set<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> then<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> fourth

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the set and then in the in the fourth

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.700 
the set and then in the in the fourth
things<00:00:44.280> were<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:44.460> easier<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:45.469> tough<00:00:46.469> match

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
things were a bit easier but tough match

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
things were a bit easier but tough match
from<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.219> start<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> finish<00:00:47.789> really<00:00:48.030> because

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
from from start to finish really because

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
from from start to finish really because
also<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.809> set<00:00:48.989> could<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.260> gone<00:00:49.440> come

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
also the first set could have gone come

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.220 
also the first set could have gone come
differently<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.850> know<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> Roger<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.020> play

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
stadium is only half filled it then gets

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.779 
stadium is only half filled it then gets
more<00:00:58.530> filled<00:00:58.770> obviously<00:00:59.250> during<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> match

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
more filled obviously during the match

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
but is it long is it different not only

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.130 
but is it long is it different not only
that's<00:01:01.920> 5050<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.879> when<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.059> come<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.359> New<00:01:03.930> York

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
that's 5050 here when I come to New York

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
that's 5050 here when I come to New York
day<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.769> night<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:04.949> mean<00:01:05.309> they<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.850> put<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
day and night I mean they can put you

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.840 
day and night I mean they can put you
every<00:01:06.510> every<00:01:07.320> time<00:01:07.740> night<00:01:07.979> session<00:01:08.430> because<00:01:08.610> i

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
every every time night session because i

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
every every time night session because i
think<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.540> good<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> mix<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.200> up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
think it's not it's good to mix it up

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.100 
think it's not it's good to mix it up
and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.950> think<00:01:11.729> also<00:01:11.939> missy<00:01:12.330> CBS<00:01:12.689> comes<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
and then i think also missy CBS comes in

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
and then i think also missy CBS comes in
on<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> weekend<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.670> request<00:01:15.119> me

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
on the weekend so then they request me

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.440 
on the weekend so then they request me
to<00:01:15.509> play<00:01:15.930> during<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> day<00:01:16.380> sometimes<00:01:16.890> but

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
to play during the day sometimes but

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
to play during the day sometimes but
this<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.570> kind<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.619> practice<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.250> know

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this is kind of how we practice you know

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.010 
this is kind of how we practice you know
during<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> daytime<00:01:21.060> ninety<00:01:21.570> percent<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
during the daytime ninety percent of the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.350 
during the daytime ninety percent of the
time<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> feels<00:01:22.710> almost<00:01:23.549> more<00:01:23.880> natural<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time so it feels almost more natural to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
time so it feels almost more natural to
play<00:01:24.780> during<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.380> day<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.860> night<00:01:25.920> at

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
play during the day and at night at

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.950 
play during the day and at night at
night<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:26.790> just<00:01:27.000> know<00:01:27.150> it's<00:01:27.420> just<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> like

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
night you just know it's just so like

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.490 
night you just know it's just so like
electricity<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.780> only<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.290> match

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
electricity it's a it's only one match

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.170 
electricity it's a it's only one match
happening<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.369> rest<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> courts

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
happening all the rest of the courts

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.210 
happening all the rest of the courts
usually<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.780> done<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> focus<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.890> only<00:01:35.009> on

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
usually are done so the focus is only on

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
usually are done so the focus is only on
you<00:01:36.170> but<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:38.490> other<00:01:38.759> grandstands<00:01:39.299> usually

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you but the other grandstands usually

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.060 
you but the other grandstands usually
you<00:01:39.630> play<00:01:39.810> only<00:01:39.990> during<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> day<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.950> me

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
you play only during the day so for me

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.819 
you play only during the day so for me
this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.720> pretty<00:01:42.720> pretty<00:01:43.049> normal<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.470> come<00:01:43.710> out

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this is pretty pretty normal to come out

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.039 
this is pretty pretty normal to come out
and<00:01:43.979> play<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.579> o'clock<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.600> said<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:45.810> you

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and play one o'clock you said that you

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.480 
and play one o'clock you said that you
thought<00:01:46.079> he<00:01:46.619> took<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> momentum<00:01:47.340> in<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
because of the time violation maybe uh I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.060 
because of the time violation maybe uh I
don't<00:01:59.899> think<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.289> I<00:02:00.380> mean<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.619> came<00:02:00.710> a<00:02:00.770> bit<00:02:00.979> out

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
don't think so I mean it came a bit out

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.419 
don't think so I mean it came a bit out
of<00:02:01.100> nowhere<00:02:01.899> but<00:02:02.899> I<00:02:02.929> like<00:02:03.799> what<00:02:03.950> I<00:02:03.979> mentioned

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
of nowhere but I like what I mentioned

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.789 
of nowhere but I like what I mentioned
you<00:02:04.520> know<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.670> mean<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.090> his<00:02:05.899> time<00:02:06.289> violations

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
you know I mean like his time violations

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.229 
you know I mean like his time violations
come<00:02:06.950> out<00:02:07.039> of<00:02:07.130> nowhere<00:02:07.250> sometimes<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.149> then

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
come out of nowhere sometimes and then

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.020 
come out of nowhere sometimes and then
they<00:02:08.840> don't<00:02:08.989> ever<00:02:09.140> come<00:02:09.380> back<00:02:09.410> again<00:02:10.030> it's

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
they don't ever come back again it's

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.180 
they don't ever come back again it's
it's<00:02:11.330> look<00:02:12.140> I<00:02:12.260> me<00:02:12.380> if<00:02:12.470> it<00:02:12.560> was<00:02:12.650> really<00:02:12.920> taking

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's look I me if it was really taking

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.559 
it's look I me if it was really taking
too<00:02:13.280> much<00:02:13.400> time<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.670> think<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.060> correct<00:02:14.300> that

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
too much time I think it's correct that

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.080 
too much time I think it's correct that
you<00:02:14.780> want<00:02:15.500> a<00:02:15.560> guy<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:16.040> then<00:02:16.250> you<00:02:16.880> should<00:02:17.060> just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
you want a guy but then you should just

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.990 
you want a guy but then you should just
stay<00:02:17.420> tough<00:02:18.140> you<00:02:18.349> know<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> also<00:02:19.400> go<00:02:19.640> to<00:02:19.700> point

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
stay tough you know and also go to point

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.790 
stay tough you know and also go to point
penalty<00:02:20.239> but<00:02:20.569> I<00:02:20.690> think<00:02:21.050> Marc<00:02:21.349> Maron<00:02:21.680> was

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.670 
penalty but I think Marc Maron was
playing<00:02:22.069> pretty<00:02:22.580> quick<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.150> know<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.410> was

important to finish strong i think the

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.300 
important to finish strong i think the
beginning<00:05:19.020> is<00:05:19.140> vital<00:05:20.070> and<00:05:20.220> in<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.120> tiebreak

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310

beginning is vital and in a tiebreak
people<00:05:23.310> always<00:05:23.490> say<00:05:23.670> the<00:05:23.790> big<00:05:23.970> service<00:05:24.300> have

people always say the big service have
an<00:05:24.540> advantage<00:05:24.810> maybe<00:05:25.470> two<00:05:26.100> degree<00:05:26.430> i<00:05:26.460> think

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
an advantage maybe two degree i think

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.330 
an advantage maybe two degree i think
that's<00:05:27.330> that's<00:05:27.660> the<00:05:27.870> case<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.890> you<00:05:29.010> just

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
that's that's the case but you just

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.370 
that's that's the case but you just
think<00:05:29.580> try<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:29.940> take<00:05:30.930> all<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.230> right

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
think try to take all the right

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.680 
think try to take all the right
decisions<00:05:31.580> in<00:05:32.580> that<00:05:32.880> very<00:05:33.090> short<00:05:33.450> period<00:05:33.660> of

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690

the french open final one against

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.920 
the french open final one against
söderling<00:05:45.000> well<00:05:45.120> i<00:05:45.180> think<00:05:45.270> i<00:05:45.419> hit<00:05:45.570> three<00:05:45.840> or

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
söderling well i think i hit three or

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.450 
söderling well i think i hit three or
four<00:05:46.080> aces<00:05:46.440> and<00:05:46.650> everything<00:05:47.070> kind<00:05:47.160> of<00:05:47.250> worked

four aces and everything kind of worked

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.790 
four aces and everything kind of worked
so<00:05:47.720> you<00:05:48.720> just<00:05:48.900> hope<00:05:49.050> they<00:05:49.260> happen<00:05:49.620> at<00:05:49.710> the

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
so you just hope they happen at the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.590 
so you just hope they happen at the
right<00:05:49.919> time<00:05:50.190> and<00:05:50.430> action<00:05:50.850> grad<00:05:51.030> Sam's<00:05:51.300> tie

of Donald Young and his recent progress

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.780 
of Donald Young and his recent progress
I<00:06:01.520> mean<00:06:02.600> never<00:06:03.600> practice<00:06:04.560> with<00:06:04.740> him<00:06:04.890> so<00:06:05.250> honest

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
I mean never practice with him so honest

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.119 
I mean never practice with him so honest
I<00:06:05.940> don't<00:06:06.000> know

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:07.129 
I don't know

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.579 
I don't know
very<00:06:07.819> well<00:06:08.059> even<00:06:08.449> as<00:06:08.539> a<00:06:08.569> person<00:06:09.020> it's<00:06:09.139> just<00:06:09.409> a

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
very well even as a person it's just a

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:11.649 
very well even as a person it's just a
what's<00:06:10.189> going<00:06:10.429> on<00:06:10.550> kind<00:06:10.909> of<00:06:10.939> thing<00:06:11.149> so<00:06:11.449> it's

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
what's going on kind of thing so it's

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.679 
what's going on kind of thing so it's
pretty<00:06:11.899> relaxed<00:06:12.499> but<00:06:12.759> I<00:06:13.759> saw<00:06:14.330> a<00:06:14.360> bit<00:06:14.509> of<00:06:14.599> the

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:14.689 
pretty relaxed but I saw a bit of the

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:17.649 
pretty relaxed but I saw a bit of the
mattress<00:06:14.839> for<00:06:15.169> income<00:06:15.589> which<00:06:15.830> was<00:06:16.419> hard<00:06:17.419> to

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
mattress for income which was hard to

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.979 
mattress for income which was hard to
watch<00:06:17.689> because<00:06:18.139> the<00:06:18.679> NDA<00:06:18.889> ended<00:06:19.099> up<00:06:19.189> losing

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:19.989 
watch because the NDA ended up losing

00:06:19.989 --> 00:06:24.309 
watch because the NDA ended up losing
but<00:06:20.989> the<00:06:21.349> nominee<00:06:22.159> I<00:06:22.249> think<00:06:22.639> he's<00:06:22.969> been<00:06:23.899> real

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319 
but the nominee I think he's been real

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:25.989 
but the nominee I think he's been real
good<00:06:24.349> at<00:06:24.830> the<00:06:24.919> very<00:06:25.129> young<00:06:25.369> age<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:25.849> I<00:06:25.909> think

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:25.999 
good at the very young age so I think

00:06:25.999 --> 00:06:29.919 
good at the very young age so I think
his<00:06:26.800> is<00:06:27.800> coming<00:06:28.129> into<00:06:28.219> the<00:06:28.369> tour<00:06:28.639> was<00:06:29.149> rather

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:29.929 
his is coming into the tour was rather

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:31.809 
his is coming into the tour was rather
complicated<00:06:30.649> i<00:06:31.009> think<00:06:31.279> you<00:06:31.399> know<00:06:31.459> getting<00:06:31.699> a

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
complicated i think you know getting a

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:33.689 
complicated i think you know getting a
lot<00:06:31.939> of<00:06:31.969> wild<00:06:32.239> cards<00:06:32.569> getting<00:06:32.809> a<00:06:32.869> lot<00:06:33.019> of<00:06:33.050> help

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
lot of wild cards getting a lot of help

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.850 
lot of wild cards getting a lot of help
creates<00:06:34.699> a<00:06:34.759> lot<00:06:34.909> of<00:06:34.969> pressure<00:06:35.269> right<00:06:35.599> so<00:06:36.019> and

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
creates a lot of pressure right so and

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.730 
creates a lot of pressure right so and
that's<00:06:37.069> hard<00:06:37.879> to<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:41.449> live<00:06:41.599> up<00:06:41.749> to<00:06:41.929> i<00:06:42.229> really

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
that's hard to to live up to i really

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.709 
that's hard to to live up to i really
feel<00:06:42.919> that<00:06:42.979> because<00:06:43.399> i<00:06:43.639> had<00:06:43.789> expectations<00:06:44.119> too

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:44.719 
feel that because i had expectations too

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:46.350 
feel that because i had expectations too
but<00:06:44.959> you<00:06:45.199> know<00:06:45.289> i<00:06:45.529> had<00:06:45.769> them<00:06:45.919> when<00:06:46.069> I<00:06:46.159> was

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 
but you know i had them when I was

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.309 
but you know i had them when I was
seventeen<00:06:47.360> eighteen<00:06:47.689> nineteen<00:06:47.719> he<00:06:48.139> may<00:06:48.259> be

00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 
seventeen eighteen nineteen he may be

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.540 
seventeen eighteen nineteen he may be
either<00:06:48.469> when<00:06:48.679> he<00:06:48.740> was<00:06:48.860> fifteen<00:06:49.189> sixteen

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:49.550 
either when he was fifteen sixteen

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.909 
either when he was fifteen sixteen
seventeen<00:06:49.580> it's<00:06:50.119> a<00:06:50.179> big<00:06:50.300> difference<00:06:50.830> but<00:06:51.830> it

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 
seventeen it's a big difference but it

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:53.320 
seventeen it's a big difference but it
seems<00:06:52.099> like<00:06:52.189> he's<00:06:52.369> making<00:06:52.490> his<00:06:52.699> move<00:06:52.729> now<00:06:52.939> and

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.330 
seems like he's making his move now and

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.359 
seems like he's making his move now and
he's<00:06:54.169> had<00:06:54.349> some<00:06:54.499> good<00:06:54.529> wins<00:06:54.830> and<00:06:55.129> think<00:06:55.279> you'd

00:06:55.359 --> 00:06:55.369 
he's had some good wins and think you'd

00:06:55.369 --> 00:06:57.879 
he's had some good wins and think you'd
be<00:06:55.459> Mary<00:06:55.729> disunion<00:06:56.149> and<00:06:56.389> wells<00:06:56.569> right<00:06:56.809> so<00:06:57.050> here

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
be Mary disunion and wells right so here

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.169 
be Mary disunion and wells right so here
again<00:06:57.919> he's<00:06:58.249> backing<00:06:58.550> it<00:06:58.579> up<00:06:58.699> with<00:06:58.759> some<00:06:59.059> good

00:06:59.169 --> 00:06:59.179 
again he's backing it up with some good

00:06:59.179 --> 00:07:01.480 
again he's backing it up with some good
play<00:06:59.419> I<00:06:59.689> guess<00:07:00.409> the<00:07:00.589> goal<00:07:00.769> is<00:07:00.949> for<00:07:00.979> him<00:07:01.309> after

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.490 
play I guess the goal is for him after

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.209 
play I guess the goal is for him after
that<00:07:01.699> to<00:07:02.089> start<00:07:02.479> doing<00:07:03.050> better<00:07:03.289> maybe<00:07:03.949> also

00:07:04.209 --> 00:07:04.219 
that to start doing better maybe also

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:07.119 
that to start doing better maybe also
away<00:07:04.490> from<00:07:04.699> America<00:07:05.179> and<00:07:05.539> that's<00:07:06.259> that's<00:07:06.889> the

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:07.129 
away from America and that's that's the

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:08.619 
away from America and that's that's the
key<00:07:07.309> from<00:07:07.550> for<00:07:07.819> most<00:07:07.969> Americans<00:07:08.419> in<00:07:08.539> my
