00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.250
 new tutorial of the canal de quito aguas 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.380
 and we present a tutorial a 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.380
 presentation of a club for servers 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.020
 good the plugin 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.900
 your standard case ss here we can see the 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.020
 help 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.020
 but we go 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.260
 and the tubing is very good because as 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.010
 You see here the items as 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.589
 drugged but 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.850
 Lima does not choose anything with the button 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:39.850
 left that shows 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 a type of store to return the price 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.050
 200 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.320
 the one that has been put on sale to the seller 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.840
 and here the amount that is unlimited 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.510
 because he has put the administrators 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.920
 of the east and elite in question and then with 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.920
 the right button I understand 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.949
 to buy 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.140
 OK 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.890
 but we can also create our 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 own stores 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.729
 How to create our own stores with 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.729
 the command of the ss 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.000
 here the amount we would put 1 because 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.000
 single 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:32.520
 quantity and the price to 500 other 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.920
 and now when we do right button in 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.820
 a block will be put 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.550
 put the engine 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.450
 we can change 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.450
 delete it 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.050
 we really do not have to write down what 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.830
 as 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.830
 that's 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.050
 and I see its power of more quantity 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.460
 because I have the range of we have to if 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.190
 let them 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:08.910
 23 for example 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 and if it is a quantity and the price is 20 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.420
 I valued already when we do right button 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.420
 given out there 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:25.510
 you see here we can put more 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.879
 more things and we can remove it and remove 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.329
 the prices are very low as we can 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.329
 change 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.270
 now we make a right button and change the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.890
 price to 3 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.340
 We use the mix in this regard 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.319
 essences 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.610
 I'm going to put the last and deleted troops 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.240
 and look 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.240
 s 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.940
 and the price 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.820
 Bogota 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.560
 let's leave it there 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.310
 the left button 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.710
 this I did not do to the inventor and I told the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.780
 amount because even though it 's set to 24 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.620
 his fast if here there was more 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.280
 the most expensive day 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 good 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.599
 for a day 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:46.390
 that's all an economy plan like it is 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.390
 the essential miguel icon 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.950
 goodbye from basic type 5 to another
