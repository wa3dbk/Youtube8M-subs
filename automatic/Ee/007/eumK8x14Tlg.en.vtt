00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello to all and welcome to a new text as of tonight will be strong to 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:05.350
 what we have to do 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.730
 paris i will test for you the right audio accessories what 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.049
 insupport for iphone 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.429
 for this support for 120 destinations from 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.750
 using your iphone as I have two other vehicles 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.119
 which you will see is quite original in any case I have never seen 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.569
 sports news bulletin 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.880
 so why is he from today perhaps against 6 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.990
 then yes 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.990
 the support after the rest 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.560
 so it's pretty classic at the level of maintaining the iphone but cons 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.190
 policy 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.080
 an element in the foot 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.630
 who looks like a little more that can not demobilize since Friday 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.430
 so I learned by promoting the description of this accessory 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.210
 the website of our partner 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.260
 chloÃ© diphonique the I thank again 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.240
 kurt does some states of the United States outright forbid the supports the 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.280
 gps who are even 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.280
 they are attached are not taken with a suction cup for safety reasons 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.170
 or because it hampers the vision of particular 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.680
 malaria on all these disappointed PD ideas account for what's happening at 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.720
 dashboard 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.650
 and that's precisely the keyboard part 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.540
 particularity of the parliament 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.860
 of this gps support and that there was a posture that did not 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.510
 a wide base 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.860
 kyle which allows to deposit on the dashboard 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.830
 so obviously one of the cars above all dashboards 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 different that are not necessarily for his dish 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.790
 chrysler 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.950
 it is very real subject that can accommodate such an accessory 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.470
 and could suddenly the design of 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.060
 this gps support integrates this problem 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.730
 so first of all my opinion 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.670
 he could not see it but this ps support should show heavy 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.900
 when we take a strong point 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.870
 it's the first thing that jumps out at us is the 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.400
 the weight of the debt object of the study 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 which weighs 700 grams which is relatively 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.940
 why an object of that year and made everyone Parisian 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.460
 pascal sleeve 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.020
 7% 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.649
 product in cycling ride on the base 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.119
 who did according to them also 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:14.559
 if we make the accounts are good beginnings shy to complete this year at 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:15.469
 world 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:17.779
 good support 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.119
 and in addition to that you have from below 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.799
 from above small support m 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.849
 who makes it one 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.839
 to understand why and how much of the interview 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:30.619
 paper protection here 

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:31.999
 who did that 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.859
 it is certified one also feels very rough so anti-slip 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:38.930
 we already know that these two elements so the more weight the young man 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.739
 attractive anti-slip 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.399
 done when you put on the dashboard 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.909
 the material to the edge that is a little leaning like that where like that 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.910
 over there the rack of rusks will not risk falling 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.819
 so I did the few tests with my iphone 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:56.740
 taking into account the rise 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.899
 a few minutes 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.659
 the name that has no problem the long stand 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.449
 do not doubt then he moves a little bit including the scoop ronaldo with his 

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:06.469
 terraces 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.739
 it moves a little 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.629
 mervil overall what are you on an already abnormal road 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.539
 some doubt that the reversal 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:18.539
 marc the romand forum and 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.399
 well maintained on the dashboard 

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:24.769
 even his return actually I'm forced to ask a big block 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.889
 why people in power the right says the report 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.319
 so we have a positioning like that the football if you position yourself 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.049
 dress a little on why 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.049
 the non-slip surface taking into account others 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:39.940
 The middle schooler 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.359
 at the corner post 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:43.119
 there is no problem 

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.179
 about iphone nokia hardware 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:48.559
 so that indicated at the end of the week 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.949
 we are going to the dissident book that brings together later 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:54.769
 so it's on a universal support% 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.369
 for iphone mortgaged 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:04:00.999
 the places between cell phones because 25 supports that is at 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:02.270
 variable geometry 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.270
 to the greatest victory 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:11.179
 and yet I will show you with my iphone 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.529
 so you can be done from here 

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.529
 is that since his hub roissy 

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:25.969
 I could not stand strong enough 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:26.909
 suddenly the ol 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:29.930
 for fans of novels I am a disbeliever 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.330
 we have nothing to envy to maintain 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.240
 during training camp 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.139
 to make it more cautious of the sport 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.139
 you have parties at the back 

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:44.180
 the list of babysitters 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.520
 eqtype ...% places 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.800
 as usual I wear in every way 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.080
 Tuesday, September 6th 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.080
 workouts every day right now for me 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:00.689
 so it happened the site went very quickly 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.669
 very useful especially because if your dashboard I think all the 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.680
 world will be forced to justify the peak position 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.940
 and in more world this year that allows you to adjust a bit in all 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.210
 meaning 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.320
 so the the bullish support that keeps women who 

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:17.590
 still turning 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.249
 benefit still continues he 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.779
 so to position it insists he 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:24.509
 portraitist 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.509
 political situation in guinea in more often the 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:31.129
 GPS applications in Montpellier is often more practical 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.180
 and therefore not see the short so it's a little more than 10% 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:39.089
 it's turning his head over the folk scene 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:42.289
 they have plenty to release like that 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.110
 fascinating state street not need him 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.800
 faces of readers 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.960
 you are an informed user as it is most often 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:56.930
 this opposing party is still making these arrests 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.650
 so to finish this set without counting the number of bankruptcies these formulas on 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.499
 the website of our partner the usa 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.949
 19 years old 90 so it's really a very very very interesting 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.809
 more the number of researchers is for sale 

00:06:13.809 --> 00:06:16.809
 a new gps support for morning drive because he 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.689
 as you see here and as you surely know that I change sides 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.680
 almost every day or so 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.580
 the support I had in fact it is more suitable only in the 93rd minute 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:31.599
 for its part materialized 7% powerful 

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:35.409
 and suddenly no longer suitable it is a support all on behalf of the first 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:36.960
 quarter 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.069
 and in addition 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:41.249
 even sometimes I use lephone 3gs but my wife 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:46.179
 so that the match was really going to support more universal help 

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:50.039
 this one is really 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:51.559
 by calling the places 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.559
 the price-performance ratio is simply excellent 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:57.469
 but I could not go hungry for other models 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:02.210
 it is often earlier between 30 and 50 euros the gps support sucker 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.380
 so there for only for less than 20 euros the moments that at once 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.860
 universal 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.740
 it's quite original because they land on the dashboard of the court 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.000
 but you will have a gel 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.550
 vision 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:16.899
 of voting by others it will be me or less generous 

00:07:16.899 --> 00:07:19.899
 so it's still under construction an accessory for all who use 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:24.259
 well then a little mattered from the soummam a mobile phone 

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:28.639
 that neither do I recommend 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.719
 Very strongly 

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:34.099
 hello thank you northwest is as usual the same sector will be 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:38.870
 the atmosphere on the site thanks to a contest 

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.229
 see you soon
