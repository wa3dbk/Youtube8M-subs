 to see how we paint the conditions 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.750
 I tell you that the most important thing is 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.210
 that today is expected swell 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.860
 elevated this mainly the coasts 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.140
 of the littoral of the Gulf of Mexico due to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.339
 its tier that we have this precisely 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.499
 in the isthmus of tehuantepec 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.659
 so take it quite into account 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.069

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.239

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:31.099
 instability we have enough cloudiness 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.720
 tense but this good without possibility of 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.300
 rains and is that you have to see the positive 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.370
 meanwhile in general for the part 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470
 from the northwest as we can appreciate here 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.040
 in the image we have enough cloudiness 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.940
 but as they talked of absence 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.860

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.380

 with very clear skies in good part 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.800
 of the national territory and where 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.330
 find low cloudiness does not matter 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.770
 because there's not much likelihood of 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.570
 rain anyway in these points 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.730
