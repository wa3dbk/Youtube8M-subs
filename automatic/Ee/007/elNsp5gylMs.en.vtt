 future commercials 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:13.479

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.140

 who answered me and so to explain that it was necessary to 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.180
 photos open a folder 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.900

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.310
 immediately had to become directly to the offices and for that 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.320
 I live 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.600

 alassane ouattara as winner here 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.280
 so it was up to them in the end that convinced me to develop new 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.580
 uses as has been done at the expense of the right-wing party ducks 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.570

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.569
 after reaching a floor 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.019
 for the time when the thought was the most difficult than expected for May 22 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.569
 it seems they already ensure exhausted work than expected so 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.929
