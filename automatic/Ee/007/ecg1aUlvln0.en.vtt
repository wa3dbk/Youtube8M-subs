00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.720
 niras table tennis star 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.150

 not even since the Chinese did not provide insight either 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.470
 so the suggestion of generation m 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 but that it is not that I recognized on the street being shown yes people who 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.940
 has seen if a good sports person has animals and how many 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.050
 Yes that is 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.390
 she did not forget my water 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.080
 here in china you can't just go to a hockey club or a table tennis club and how 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.320
 is that actually here 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.060
 well it is something else arranged about that nonsense 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.130
 the table tennis club them 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.300
 no that you have with is always related to the army or son of one 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.110
 railroad the a team 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.660
 Yeah so 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.040
 people play for a sudden home in the park of course and then all go 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.760
 tables and play there 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.350
 you also do not have to pay for, for example, having that money 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.350
 sophie 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.640
 take him hockey year that is all institutionalized so people 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 However, it's going to be a hit at times 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.280
 thyssen recreation sport that can only be done in the park 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.240
 are not from 3,000 school gyms in china 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.399
 And with a yes, talent does come out and they have it 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.469
 of course a constant province and competitions and so on 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.210
 and after one 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.070
 and they also have a certain ladder competition system so the best 8 of the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.740
 province 10 which then go against the best 8 of it 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 national team and attacks were only 8 of the backlog 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.220
 system 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.010
 actually its fiftieth fit is china lets itself be while playing 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.280
 best side 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.380
 daily life, according to vriesekoop, looks a bit different from them 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.740
 you actually know how to learn for yourself 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.070
 It is natural 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.600
 Japanese for the foreigners yourself 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.000
 if that is too clean from everyone butcher we are still very nice 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.979
 but it is all they have anyway 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:14.999
 all very much thought out and 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:20.239
 they can also do that very well, but this is not just 8 when I am here 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.969
 just 

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.329
 leading an ordinary life without the Olympic Games
