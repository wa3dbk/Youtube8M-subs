certainly seems to be an interesting
wave<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.870> sightings<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.980> always

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
wave of sightings and it's always

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.149 
wave of sightings and it's always
fascinating<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.920> activity<00:01:04.920> like

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
fascinating when you get activity like

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.340

this<00:01:05.400> over<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> period<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.479> different<00:01:06.840> nights<00:01:07.049> I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
this over a period of different nights I

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.770 
this over a period of different nights I
think<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:08.040> key<00:01:08.369> question<00:01:09.060> would<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.659> it's

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
think my key question would be and it's

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
think my key question would be and it's
really<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> question<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.909> Air<00:01:12.030> Force

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
really a question for the the Air Force

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.560 
really a question for the the Air Force
and<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:13.020> FAA<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:14.159> anyone<00:01:14.549> checked<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:15.060> radar

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.539 
I wouldn't have thought so and I've seen
some<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.850> footage<00:01:45.149> myself<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.259> what

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
some of this footage myself and what

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.520 
some of this footage myself and what
struck<00:01:47.549> me<00:01:47.850> about<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.119> was<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.689> way<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.110> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
struck me about it was the way that it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310 
struck me about it was the way that it
appeared<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.979> change<00:01:50.490> color<00:01:51.000> at<00:01:51.420> some<00:01:51.960> stage

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
appeared to change color at some stage

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
appeared to change color at some stage
and<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.610> interesting<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.270> mean<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
and that's quite interesting I mean I

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.810 
and that's quite interesting I mean I
think<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.810> ever<00:01:55.140> one<00:01:55.680> would<00:01:55.890> need<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.310> get<00:01:56.520> hold

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
think as ever one would need to get hold

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.300 
think as ever one would need to get hold
of<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> original<00:01:57.600> camera<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.530> original<00:01:58.979> film

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of the original camera the original film

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
of the original camera the original film
footage<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.390> proper<00:02:00.899> forensic

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
footage and do some proper forensic

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.100 
footage and do some proper forensic
analysis<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.850> get<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.270> bottom<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.840> but

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
analysis to get to the bottom of it but

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
analysis to get to the bottom of it but
it's<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.530> certainly<00:02:04.799> interesting<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
it's it's certainly interesting and as I

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.670 
it's it's certainly interesting and as I
say<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> fact<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.110> it's<00:02:07.380> come<00:02:07.649> back

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
say the fact that it's it's come back

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.710 
say the fact that it's it's come back
over<00:02:08.190> several<00:02:08.459> nights<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.149> been<00:02:09.270> seen<00:02:09.509> by

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
over several nights and been seen by

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.800 
over several nights and been seen by
many<00:02:09.780> different<00:02:10.080> people<00:02:10.430> is<00:02:11.430> makes<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.569> quite

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
many different people is makes it quite

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.340 
many different people is makes it quite
a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
a

a
citing<00:02:13.920> well<00:02:14.670> as<00:02:14.850> far<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.180> analysis<00:02:15.600> of

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
citing well as far as the analysis of

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.930 
citing well as far as the analysis of
the<00:02:15.840> film<00:02:16.050> we<00:02:16.410> intend<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:17.040> just<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
the film we intend to do just that and

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.640 
the film we intend to do just that and
it's<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.240> several<00:02:18.570> people<00:02:18.750> were<00:02:19.170> being<00:02:19.350> told

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it's now several people were being told

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.050 
it's now several people were being told
it<00:02:19.800> because<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.250> has<00:02:20.310> been<00:02:20.520> happening<00:02:20.700> night

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it because this has been happening night

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.120 
it because this has been happening night
after<00:02:21.330> night<00:02:21.450> people<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.350> now<00:02:22.470> gathered<00:02:22.980> on

in<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> row<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.450> happens<00:02:30.960> about<00:02:31.110> each<00:02:31.590> night

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
in a row it happens about each night

lights stay up for about two hours

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.150 
lights stay up for about two hours
sometimes<00:02:36.390> they<00:02:36.600> doom<00:02:36.900> sometimes<00:02:37.860> they<00:02:38.010> get

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
brighter sometimes they move up they

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.060 
brighter sometimes they move up they
move<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.170> one<00:02:40.350> side<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:40.950> they

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
move to one side and then they

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.040 
move to one side and then they
eventually<00:02:41.420> disappear<00:02:42.420> what<00:02:42.630> do<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.750> make<00:02:42.900> of

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
eventually disappear what do you make of

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.110 
eventually disappear what do you make of
it<00:02:43.110> all<00:02:44.420> well<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.450> most<00:02:46.260> UFO<00:02:46.680> sightings<00:02:47.490> do<00:02:47.880> turn

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it all well I most UFO sightings do turn

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.240 
it all well I most UFO sightings do turn
out<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.570> have<00:02:48.600> conventional<00:02:49.440> explanations

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
out to have conventional explanations

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.620 
out to have conventional explanations
they<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.730> be<00:02:51.110> lasers<00:02:52.250> searchlights

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
they can be lasers searchlights

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.080 
they can be lasers searchlights
fireworks<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:55.050> Chinese<00:02:55.980> lanterns<00:02:56.610> which<00:02:56.880> are

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
fireworks the Chinese lanterns which are

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.930 
fireworks the Chinese lanterns which are
quite<00:02:57.240> popular<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.020> people<00:02:58.320> let<00:02:58.530> these<00:02:58.710> often

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
quite popular and people let these often

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.730 
quite popular and people let these often

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
parties and barbecues and things like

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.890 
parties and barbecues and things like
that<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.460> I<00:03:02.520> think<00:03:02.640> what<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:03.060> interesting<00:03:03.420> is

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
that but I think what is interesting is

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
that but I think what is interesting is
is<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.470> these<00:03:04.710> days<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.160> course<00:03:05.400> almost

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
is that these days of course almost

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.210 
is that these days of course almost
everyone<00:03:06.300> has<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.840> cell<00:03:07.320> phone<00:03:07.620> with<00:03:08.130> the

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
everyone has a cell phone with the

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.910 
everyone has a cell phone with the
capability<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:08.880> take<00:03:09.180> photos<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.930> videos<00:03:10.350> so

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
capability to take photos and videos so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.890 
capability to take photos and videos so
out<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.610> tens<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.120> thousands<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.720> people

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
out of the tens of thousands of people

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.690 
out of the tens of thousands of people
who<00:03:13.170> see<00:03:13.380> UFOs<00:03:13.620> each<00:03:14.100> year<00:03:14.430> we're<00:03:14.610> getting

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
who see UFOs each year we're getting

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700 
who see UFOs each year we're getting
more<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.270> more<00:03:15.480> of<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.810> interesting

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
more and more of this interesting

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.830 
more and more of this interesting
footage<00:03:17.040> so<00:03:17.610> we're<00:03:17.820> more<00:03:17.970> likely<00:03:18.390> to<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.660> to

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
footage so we're more likely to get to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.390 
footage so we're more likely to get to
the<00:03:18.930> bottom<00:03:19.080> of<00:03:19.260> these<00:03:19.440> sorts<00:03:19.800> of<00:03:19.890> mysteries

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
the bottom of these sorts of mysteries

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.980 
the bottom of these sorts of mysteries
and<00:03:20.610> we<00:03:21.120> certainly<00:03:21.390> hope<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.690> get<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> the

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
and we certainly hope to get to the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.900 
and we certainly hope to get to the
bottom<00:03:22.140> of<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.410> one<00:03:22.650> Nick<00:03:22.830> Papa<00:03:23.100> from<00:03:23.550> London
