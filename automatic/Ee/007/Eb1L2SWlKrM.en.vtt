00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.990
 I thought already on the ground floor community I 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.650
 shout and you're alive with a trembling voice 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.019

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.540
 above the plates externally fell on Wednesday at nine 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.970
 pm Irina Poltava planted 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.280
 his daughter in the elevator on the eighth floor but not 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.210
 I managed to move away from the cabin as I heard 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.700
 creepy crash palexpo fly with 1 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.760
 screeching with these stones these 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:34.760
 spacers you are here for the table because she has 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.460
 there panic was tearing down the elevator 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.680
 flew five floors and stopped between 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.890
 fourth and third floors thanks 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.410
 emergency braking system 25-year-old 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.780
 the girl stayed locked in the cockpit 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.510
 the tenants immediately called the control room 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.210
 Odessa elevator and also in your section 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.450
 but after waiting more than half an hour decided 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.410
 to act themselves here and so is destined to 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:03.170
 there were girls orient during and 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.239
 flee and just because we 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.200
 was a detachment in one hundred and twenty second home 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.770
 avenue 122 was so women just 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.590
 entered the elevator and fell down and to death 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.140
 when the lift broke the noise was so 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.120
 strong that some tenants are right there 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.760
 ran out of apartments frightened 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:26.120
 earthquakes have the impression that thunder 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.840
 so thundering thundered such a roar was 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.080
 that just horror shuddered and everything here 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.530
 and this is not the first time or single 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:39.560
 us it happens systematically or 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.380
 the tenants are already at the limit of all the problems with 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.229
 the elevator tenants got used to the mechanism already 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.450
 long outdated his term in the cockpit is often not 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.670
 doors open 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.049
 buttons do not work or lift gets stuck 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.369
 between the floors elevator many probably 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.100
 as much as we live in this house 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.380
 almost 40 years over the 40 years we have changed 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.700
 booth but probably did not change the cable 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.079
 changed the motor I don't know what because I 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.970
 I live on all of us, too, it is very difficult for me 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.310
 climb each after work on foot 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.470
 but nevertheless we rise with us 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.480
 target if the plain is half a year from 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.910
 years does not work at all we are for it 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.560
 We pay regularly if it works it 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.720
 works so do n't heal run in 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.849
 the elevator or run for the elevator sits in 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.830
 the elevator she wants here so she thought 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.780
 so sounded behind the walls of the house and stress and 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.299
 monk 1 put somewhere to pour out 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.060
 each item to file Odessans sure 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:33.280
 the elevator collapsed because the old one broke off 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.860
 cable from public utilities to this effect 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.530
 completely different opinion the next day 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.380
 after the incident they informed the tenant 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.079
 that they broke down the cabin door themselves 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.760
 thatâ€™s why the elevator itself is worth getting 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.040
 we have no official comment 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.950
 failed in Suvorov not in the main 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.590
 Department of Service Odessa is not in the 98th 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.359
 plot zhks about Suvorov was not 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.100
 not a single employee who knows 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.350
 incident in the nine-story building on 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.549
 volunteer Julia Fedorova Vitaly 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.549
