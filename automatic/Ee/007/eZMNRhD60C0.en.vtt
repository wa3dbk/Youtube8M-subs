00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
more half tubes and like that followed

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.270 
more half tubes and like that followed
by<00:01:14.070> slightly<00:01:15.000> smaller<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:15.890> for<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> other

by slightly smaller one for the other

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.719 
by slightly smaller one for the other
arm<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> he<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.360> have<00:01:18.840> him<00:01:19.020> doing<00:01:19.229> his<00:01:19.530> pose

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.320 

that<00:01:23.729> he<00:01:23.909> does<00:01:24.119> obviously<00:01:24.540> um<00:01:25.880> then<00:01:26.880> for<00:01:27.090> his

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
that he does obviously um then for his

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.700 
that he does obviously um then for his
trunks<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.229> did<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:29.070> half<00:01:29.790> circle<00:01:30.680> made<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
trunks I just did a half circle made a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.999 
trunks I just did a half circle made a
plaque<00:01:32.040> put<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.360> did<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> half

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
plaque put it right there I did a half

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.550 
plaque put it right there I did a half
circle<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.729> believe<00:01:36.150> his<00:01:36.360> elbow<00:01:36.780> pads<00:01:37.079> too

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
circle for I believe his elbow pads too

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.300 
circle for I believe his elbow pads too
and<00:01:37.829> his<00:01:38.400> knee<00:01:38.700> pads<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.329> his<00:01:39.780> shoes<00:01:40.310> simply

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and his knee pads and his shoes simply

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.380 
and his knee pads and his shoes simply
because<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:42.649> was<00:01:43.649> not<00:01:43.920> super<00:01:44.640> experienced<00:01:45.299> when

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
because I was not super experienced when

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.050 
because I was not super experienced when
I<00:01:45.420> made<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.799> didn't<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> lot<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
I made this and I didn't have a lot of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
I made this and I didn't have a lot of
stuff<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.619> figured<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.520> looks<00:01:50.850> good<00:01:51.090> enough

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
stuff but I figured it looks good enough

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.490 
stuff but I figured it looks good enough
so<00:01:52.009> now<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.040> his<00:01:53.340> legs<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.270> same<00:01:54.810> thing<00:01:55.079> at

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
so now for his legs do the same thing at

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.289 
so now for his legs do the same thing at
with<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:55.829> arms<00:01:56.189> make<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.579> half<00:01:56.670> tubes<00:01:56.969> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
with the arms make the half tubes and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.929 
with the arms make the half tubes and
then<00:01:58.110> you'll<00:01:58.710> just<00:01:58.890> do<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> knee<00:01:59.430> pad<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.670> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
then you'll just do a knee pad in the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.510 
then you'll just do a knee pad in the
middle<00:02:00.299> because<00:02:00.840> there<00:02:01.680> wasn't<00:02:01.920> enough<00:02:02.399> room

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
middle because there wasn't enough room

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.649 
middle because there wasn't enough room
to<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.000> full<00:02:03.210> legs<00:02:04.430> first<00:02:05.430> feet<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.299> can<00:02:06.329> do

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
to do is full legs first feet you can do

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.999 
to do is full legs first feet you can do
a<00:02:06.689> half<00:02:07.259> circle<00:02:07.530> like<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.599> do

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
a half circle like that or you can do

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.380 
a half circle like that or you can do
some<00:02:11.009> other<00:02:11.129> technique<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.180> use<00:02:12.360> for

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
some other technique that you use for

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.500 
some other technique that you use for
making<00:02:12.750> boots

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
making boots

and<00:02:38.769> actually<00:02:39.040> I'm<00:02:39.459> going<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:40.000> shrink<00:02:40.269> these

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
and actually I'm going to shrink these

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.000 
and actually I'm going to shrink these
so<00:02:40.989> that<00:02:41.019> they<00:02:41.440> fit<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:41.890> his<00:02:42.069> arm<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:44.010> just

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
so that they fit in his arm I just

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.080 
so that they fit in his arm I just
realized<00:02:45.459> that<00:02:46.450> they<00:02:46.720> weren't<00:02:46.959> so<00:02:48.060> more<00:02:49.060> like

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
realized that they weren't so more like

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.250 
realized that they weren't so more like
that<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.750> guess<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:51.239> it's<00:02:52.239> probably<00:02:52.569> impossible

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that I guess is it's probably impossible

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.789 
that I guess is it's probably impossible
to<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.159> actual<00:02:54.670> tattoo<00:02:55.120> even<00:02:55.870> just<00:02:56.409> doing

to do is actual tattoo even just doing
it<00:02:56.950> by<00:02:57.129> itself<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:58.810> looks<00:02:59.349> good<00:02:59.560> enough<00:02:59.829> i

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
it by itself so that looks good enough i

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.839 
it by itself so that looks good enough i
guess<00:03:00.040> um<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:01.389> his<00:03:01.480> beard<00:03:02.519> it's<00:03:03.519> easy<00:03:03.670> you

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
hear voices in my head then for his eyes

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.830 
hear voices in my head then for his eyes
I<00:03:23.709> just<00:03:23.949> did<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.160> quarter<00:03:24.669> circle<00:03:25.090> black<00:03:25.389> like

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
I just did a quarter circle black like

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.439 
I just did a quarter circle black like
so<00:03:26.310> because<00:03:27.310> his<00:03:27.459> eyes<00:03:27.639> are<00:03:27.849> closed<00:03:28.120> when<00:03:28.389> he

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:28.449 
so because his eyes are closed when he

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:30.659 
so because his eyes are closed when he
does<00:03:28.629> this<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.169> he's<00:03:29.290> taken<00:03:29.799> in<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.010> cheering

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:30.669 
does this and he's taken in the cheering

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.610 
does this and he's taken in the cheering
that's<00:03:30.819> the<00:03:30.970> audience<00:03:31.299> then<00:03:32.230> you'll<00:03:32.379> use

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
that's the audience then you'll use

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.039 
that's the audience then you'll use
visor<00:03:33.069> for<00:03:33.699> his<00:03:33.819> mouth<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.449> like<00:03:34.569> with<00:03:34.900> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
ninja put it right there and actually

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.229
