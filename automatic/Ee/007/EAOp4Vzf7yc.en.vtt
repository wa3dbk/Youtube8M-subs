00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.170 
little bit nicer and more platforms yeah
we<00:02:58.579> everyone<00:02:59.060> loves<00:02:59.329> platforms<00:03:00.049> not<00:03:00.739> really

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
we everyone loves platforms not really

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.500 
we everyone loves platforms not really
quite<00:03:02.180> boarding<00:03:02.600> but<00:03:02.780> yet<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.200> can<00:03:03.890> really<00:03:04.100> show

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.160 
quite boarding but yet I can really show
show<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:05.920> build<00:03:06.920> process<00:03:07.130> of<00:03:07.579> this<00:03:07.900> very<00:03:08.900> well

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
show the build process of this very well

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.069 
show the build process of this very well
since<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:10.730> inside<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> camera<00:03:11.870> studio

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
since it's inside in the camera studio

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.840 
since it's inside in the camera studio
mod<00:03:12.410> would<00:03:12.590> just<00:03:12.799> go<00:03:12.950> through<00:03:12.980> blocks<00:03:13.579> which

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
mod would just go through blocks which

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.710 
mod would just go through blocks which
would<00:03:14.000> make<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.420> look<00:03:15.160> awful<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.209> decided<00:03:17.630> to

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
would make it look awful so I decided to

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.170 
would make it look awful so I decided to
post<00:03:17.900> build<00:03:18.470> most<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:19.100> it<00:03:19.220> off<00:03:19.370> camera<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
post build most of it off camera and

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.840 
post build most of it off camera and

cream<00:04:30.620> because<00:04:30.830> I<00:04:31.040> think<00:04:31.160> that<00:04:31.610> would<00:04:31.700> make<00:04:31.850> it

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
cream because I think that would make it

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.360 
cream because I think that would make it
look<00:04:32.060> a<00:04:32.300> little<00:04:32.510> bit<00:04:32.720> overcrowded<00:04:33.320> so<00:04:34.190> if<00:04:34.280> you

jump on board of the ship
