00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.920 
guys can see my skin is actually the
surfers<00:00:48.090> oh<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.270> seems<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.600> you're<00:00:48.719> pretty

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
surfers oh my seems that you're pretty

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.209 
surfers oh my seems that you're pretty
flat<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:50.039> just<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.610> lot<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.850> scars<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
flat I just a lot of scars so I have to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.369 
flat I just a lot of scars so I have to
use<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> primer<00:00:53.610> with<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:55.320> doesn't

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
use a primer with this so it doesn't

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
use a primer with this so it doesn't
sneak<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.129> force<00:00:56.430> because<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
sneak into my force because this is a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.939 
sneak into my force because this is a
water-based<00:00:57.360> foundation<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.199> usually

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
water-based foundation and usually

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.080 
water-based foundation and usually
water-based<00:00:59.309> foundations<00:00:59.730> because<00:00:59.969> they're

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
water-based foundations because they're

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
water-based foundations because they're
so<00:01:00.210> thin<00:01:00.510> they<00:01:00.780> kind<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.710> accentuate<00:01:02.340> your

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
so thin they kind of do accentuate your

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850 
so thin they kind of do accentuate your
pores<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.359> whatnot<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.960> as<00:01:04.619> far<00:01:04.799> as

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
pores and whatnot but as far as

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.950 
pores and whatnot but as far as
application<00:01:05.430> goes<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.850> find<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
application goes I find that for this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.630 
application goes I find that for this
foundation<00:01:07.439> because<00:01:07.560> its<00:01:07.830> water<00:01:07.979> based<00:01:08.250> it's

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
foundation because its water based it's

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.359 
foundation because its water based it's
better<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.090> apply<00:01:09.180> with<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.630> fingers<00:01:09.990> so

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
better to apply with your fingers so

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.510 
better to apply with your fingers so
yeah<00:01:11.369> i'll<00:01:11.970> stop<00:01:12.180> rambling<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520
