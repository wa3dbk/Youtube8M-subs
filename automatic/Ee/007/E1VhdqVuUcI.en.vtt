video<00:00:09.090> seemed<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.230> get<00:00:10.620> pretty<00:00:10.679> popular<00:00:11.099> I

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
video seemed to get pretty popular I

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.940 
video seemed to get pretty popular I
thought<00:00:12.150> I'd<00:00:12.300> go<00:00:12.450> more<00:00:12.690> specific<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.380> go<00:00:13.559> into

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
thought I'd go more specific and go into

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.180 
thought I'd go more specific and go into
each<00:00:14.639> class<00:00:15.120> individually<00:00:16.049> each<00:00:16.260> game<00:00:16.920> type

each class individually each game type
individually<00:00:18.020> just<00:00:19.020> go<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.199> little<00:00:19.380> bit<00:00:19.590> more

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
individually just go a little bit more

in<00:01:39.329> depth<00:01:39.600> later<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.920> begin<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
in depth later as you begin to see the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840 
in depth later as you begin to see the
scale<00:01:41.820> more<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.390> game<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.430> I'm<00:01:44.549> going<00:01:44.729> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
scale more in game so what I'm going to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.460 
scale more in game so what I'm going to
do<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.899> play<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> couple<00:01:46.860> matches<00:01:47.399> and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
do is just play a couple matches and

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:54.020 
do is just play a couple matches and
you'll<00:01:49.470> get<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.770> see<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.070> he's<00:01:50.159> like<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
you'll get to see what he's like so the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
you'll get to see what he's like so the
Scout<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> fastest<00:01:55.259> character<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Scout is the fastest character in the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.060 
Scout is the fastest character in the
game<00:01:56.390> he<00:01:57.390> runs<00:01:57.689> at<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> believe<00:01:58.439> twice<00:01:58.799> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
game he runs at I believe twice the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.760 
game he runs at I believe twice the
speed<00:01:59.399> as<00:01:59.759> any<00:02:00.750> other<00:02:00.899> character<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> game

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
speed as any other character in the game

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.200 
speed as any other character in the game
and<00:02:03.380> when<00:02:04.380> he's<00:02:04.530> capturing<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.219> point<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.820> as

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and when he's capturing a point it's as

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.139 
and when he's capturing a point it's as
if<00:02:06.540> he<00:02:07.039> the<00:02:08.039> point<00:02:08.310> is<00:02:08.429> being<00:02:08.580> captured<00:02:08.640> by<00:02:09.000> two

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
if he the point is being captured by two

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.530 
if he the point is being captured by two
people<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:10.470> he<00:02:10.739> captures<00:02:11.250> with<00:02:11.629> two<00:02:12.629> times

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
people so he captures with two times

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.750 
people so he captures with two times
I<00:02:13.629> guess<00:02:14.319> capture<00:02:14.799> rate<00:02:15.010> if<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.280> want<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:15.640> put

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
I guess capture rate if you want to put

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.809 
I guess capture rate if you want to put
it<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:15.879> way<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.950> Scout<00:02:18.219> can<00:02:18.459> double<00:02:18.790> jump

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
it that way the Scout can double jump

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.470 
it that way the Scout can double jump
which<00:02:19.480> allows<00:02:20.349> him<00:02:20.650> to<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:21.159> extra<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:22.269> guess

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
which allows him to have extra I guess

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.229 
which allows him to have extra I guess
movement<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.500> air<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.730> reason<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.120> would

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
movement in the air the reason you would

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.179 
movement in the air the reason you would
want<00:02:25.269> that<00:02:25.569> is<00:02:26.049> you<00:02:26.439> know<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> dodge<00:02:26.890> enemy

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
want that is you know to dodge enemy

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.580 
want that is you know to dodge enemy
attacks<00:02:27.730> or<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.959> know<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.170> make<00:02:29.319> things

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
attacks or you know to make things

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.429 
attacks or you know to make things
confusing<00:02:29.829> for<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.430> opponents<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:32.230> one

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
confusing for your opponents the one

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.339 
confusing for your opponents the one
downside<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:33.209> engineer<00:02:34.209> centuries<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.989> still

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
downside is engineer centuries can still

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.319 
downside is engineer centuries can still
lock<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.159> even<00:02:36.670> with<00:02:36.849> all<00:02:37.030> of<00:02:37.060> your

lock on to you even with all of your
moving<00:02:37.720> around<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.859> if<00:02:39.519> you<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:39.970> a<00:02:40.000> century

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
moving around so if you see a century

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.240 
moving around so if you see a century
you're<00:02:40.720> still<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:41.500> as<00:02:41.769> doomed<00:02:42.069> now<00:02:47.159> some<00:02:48.159> of

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:49.449 
special if you have this gun out as you

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:51.710 
special if you have this gun out as you
run<00:03:49.690> around<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:50.229> get<00:03:50.379> a<00:03:50.409> meter<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.949> fills<00:03:51.190> up

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
run around you get a meter that fills up

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.719 
run around you get a meter that fills up
here<00:03:52.720> I'll<00:03:52.810> show<00:03:52.840> it<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.079> you<00:03:53.169> and<00:03:53.379> as<00:03:54.370> the

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
here I'll show it to you and as the

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.569 
here I'll show it to you and as the
meter<00:03:54.940> fills<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.479> when<00:03:56.109> it<00:03:56.229> fills<00:03:56.439> up<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:57.250> do

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
meter fills up when it fills up you do

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:00.119 
meter fills up when it fills up you do
1.5<00:03:58.569> times<00:03:59.019> damage<00:03:59.470> until<00:03:59.709> they<00:03:59.859> meet<00:03:59.979> our

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
1.5 times damage until they meet our

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.539 
1.5 times damage until they meet our
empties<00:04:00.959> so<00:04:01.959> it's<00:04:02.109> good<00:04:02.260> to<00:04:02.290> have<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.859> you<00:04:03.519> can

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
empties so it's good to have if you can

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:05.520 
empties so it's good to have if you can
time<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.000> correctly<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.810> know<00:04:04.930> it's<00:04:05.109> deadly

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
time it correctly you know it's deadly

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.309 
time it correctly you know it's deadly
here's<00:04:06.310> the<00:04:06.370> critical<00:04:06.639> ax<00:04:07.000> instead<00:04:07.389> of<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:31.730 
do it myself just to pass the time when

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.490 
do it myself just to pass the time when
you're<00:07:31.850> playing<00:07:32.090> is<00:07:32.270> the<00:07:32.390> Scout<00:07:32.660> the<00:07:33.080> number
