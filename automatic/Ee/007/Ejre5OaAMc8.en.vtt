taller<00:01:26.300> really<00:01:27.300> shows<00:01:27.540> off<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> glads<00:01:28.170> which

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
taller really shows off the glads which

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.990 
taller really shows off the glads which
is<00:01:29.100> why<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> chose<00:01:29.400> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
is why I chose it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.060

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
plus it's a little wider so everything

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.040 
plus it's a little wider so everything
can<00:01:32.280> spread<00:01:32.550> apart<00:01:32.880> more<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.540> can<00:01:33.600> see

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
can spread apart more so you can see

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.030 
can spread apart more so you can see
every<00:01:34.590> bloom<00:01:35.960> to<00:01:36.960> start<00:01:37.260> out<00:01:37.470> we're<00:01:37.890> gonna

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
every bloom to start out we're gonna

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.700 
every bloom to start out we're gonna
take<00:01:38.460> our<00:01:38.670> glads<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.869> they<00:01:39.990> have<00:01:40.170> these<00:01:40.320> nice

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
take our glads and they have these nice

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
take our glads and they have these nice
shoes<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.910> them<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.660> I<00:01:42.690> like<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.020> take<00:01:43.200> them

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
shoes to them but I like to take them

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.930 
shoes to them but I like to take them
off<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.710> sometimes<00:01:44.190> they<00:01:44.580> yellow<00:01:44.910> a

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
off because sometimes they yellow a

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.550 
off because sometimes they yellow a
little<00:01:45.270> faster<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.580> can't<00:01:47.790> achieve<00:01:48.330> them

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
little faster so you can't achieve them

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.700 
little faster so you can't achieve them
and<00:01:49.680> then<00:01:50.750> just<00:01:51.750> cut<00:01:52.020> each<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.350> them<00:01:52.440> at<00:01:52.620> an

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
and then just cut each of them at an

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.090 
and then just cut each of them at an
angle<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> place<00:01:54.840> them<00:01:55.080> within<00:01:55.260> this<00:01:55.950> space

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
angle and place them within this space

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.500 
angle and place them within this space
and<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.250> didn't<00:01:59.550> make<00:01:59.850> them<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> little<00:02:00.270> bit

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
and you didn't make them a little bit

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.840 
and you didn't make them a little bit
different<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.020> height<00:02:01.260> if<00:02:01.440> you'd<00:02:01.620> like<00:02:01.850> it's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
different and height if you'd like it's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.230 
different and height if you'd like it's
nice<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.330> have<00:02:03.479> them<00:02:03.600> not<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:03.840> all<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.350> same

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:09.530 

so<00:04:59.230> really<00:04:59.410> like<00:04:59.700> modern<00:05:00.700> fun<00:05:01.180> piece

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.900 
cool and there we got our large peaches
the<00:05:12.660> piece<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:12.990> finished<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:13.710> we'll<00:05:14.520> move<00:05:14.670> on

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
the piece is finished so we'll move on

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.160 
the piece is finished so we'll move on
to<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.480> smaller<00:05:15.870> piece<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:18.270> really<00:05:18.660> wanted

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
to a smaller piece and I really wanted

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.650 
to a smaller piece and I really wanted
to<00:05:19.230> highlight<00:05:19.650> the<00:05:20.070> irises<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.640> this<00:05:21.030> one<00:05:21.300> so

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
to highlight the irises and this one so

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.870 
to highlight the irises and this one so
that's<00:05:21.750> why<00:05:22.020> we're<00:05:22.230> doing<00:05:22.500> just<00:05:22.830> the<00:05:23.370> irises

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
that's why we're doing just the irises

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.760 
that's why we're doing just the irises
and<00:05:23.910> roses<00:05:25.580> first<00:05:26.580> take<00:05:27.540> off<00:05:27.690> any<00:05:27.960> petal<00:05:28.440> or

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
and roses first take off any petal or

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.510 
and roses first take off any petal or
any<00:05:29.100> leads<00:05:29.400> that<00:05:29.670> might<00:05:29.850> be<00:05:30.000> on<00:05:30.090> your<00:05:30.120> roses

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
any leads that might be on your roses

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.950 
any leads that might be on your roses
and<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:32.700> I'm<00:05:32.820> just<00:05:32.970> gonna<00:05:33.150> place<00:05:33.480> these

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.080 

right<00:05:36.960> inside<00:05:37.320> the<00:05:37.470> vase<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:38.100> don't<00:05:38.940> really

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
right inside the vase I don't really

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.910 
right inside the vase I don't really
want<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.360> have<00:05:39.480> a<00:05:39.540> leaf<00:05:39.780> inside<00:05:40.260> this<00:05:40.560> time<00:05:40.890> I

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
want to have a leaf inside this time I

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.670 
want to have a leaf inside this time I
think<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:42.330> stems<00:05:42.630> are<00:05:42.870> kind<00:05:43.080> of<00:05:43.170> beautiful<00:05:43.560> on

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
think the stems are kind of beautiful on

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.320 
think the stems are kind of beautiful on
their<00:05:43.830> own

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.640 

just<00:05:47.080> be<00:05:47.259> cut

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.950 

we're<00:05:51.190> just<00:05:51.340> gonna<00:05:51.550> put<00:05:51.910> all<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.330> roses<00:05:52.750> in<00:05:52.780> a

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.350 
we're just gonna put all the roses in a
nice<00:05:53.139> group<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:54.490> wonderful<00:05:55.030> thing<00:05:55.240> about

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
nice group the wonderful thing about

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.650 
nice group the wonderful thing about
adding<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.229> irises<00:05:56.830> to<00:05:57.100> this<00:05:57.250> is<00:05:58.210> that<00:05:58.449> once

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
adding the irises to this is that once

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.950 
adding the irises to this is that once
they're<00:05:59.050> in<00:05:59.470> place<00:06:00.190> they<00:06:01.000> look<00:06:01.210> really<00:06:01.600> closed

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
they're in place they look really closed

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.060 
they're in place they look really closed
but<00:06:02.440> they'll<00:06:02.620> open<00:06:03.100> into<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.490> huge<00:06:04.000> beautiful

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
but they'll open into a huge beautiful

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.670 
but they'll open into a huge beautiful
showpiece<00:06:06.070> of<00:06:06.100> the<00:06:06.370> arrangement<00:06:07.380> so<00:06:08.380> I<00:06:08.410> like

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
showpiece of the arrangement so I like

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.680 
showpiece of the arrangement so I like
to<00:06:08.710> put<00:06:09.040> them<00:06:09.190> on<00:06:09.400> their<00:06:09.639> own<00:06:09.669> that<00:06:10.330> way<00:06:10.479> when

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:10.690 
to put them on their own that way when

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:11.969 
to put them on their own that way when
they<00:06:10.810> open<00:06:11.199> they<00:06:11.530> look<00:06:11.680> like<00:06:11.800> they<00:06:11.949> were

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:11.979 
they open they look like they were

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:13.950 
they open they look like they were
supposed<00:06:12.400> to<00:06:12.520> be<00:06:12.699> even<00:06:13.330> taller<00:06:13.570> than<00:06:13.870> when

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
supposed to be even taller than when

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.490 
supposed to be even taller than when
they<00:06:14.080> started

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
they started

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.960 
they started
so<00:06:15.690> makes<00:06:16.690> it<00:06:16.900> less<00:06:17.080> of<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:18.190> differentiation

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
so makes it less of a differentiation

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.279 
so makes it less of a differentiation
when<00:06:19.120> they<00:06:19.210> do<00:06:19.270> start<00:06:19.660> to<00:06:19.780> bloom

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:23.289 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:26.469 

so<00:06:24.289> we<00:06:24.380> have<00:06:24.530> a<00:06:24.560> nice<00:06:24.740> little<00:06:25.240> pyramid<00:06:26.240> of

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
so we have a nice little pyramid of

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.230 
so we have a nice little pyramid of
roses<00:06:26.840> going<00:06:27.139> on<00:06:27.490> and<00:06:28.490> then<00:06:28.610> we'll<00:06:28.759> take<00:06:29.030> our

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
roses going on and then we'll take our

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:37.680 
roses going on and then we'll take our
iris

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:40.050 

maybe<00:06:37.840> it'll<00:06:38.140> show

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060 
maybe it'll show

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.760 
maybe it'll show
and<00:06:40.150> then<00:06:40.720> we're<00:06:40.810> gonna<00:06:40.900> place<00:06:41.200> this<00:06:41.410> right

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770
