00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
look at that chip damage basically this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
look at that chip damage basically this
is<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> completely<00:01:19.290> current<00:01:19.650> eat<00:01:19.770> if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.369> time

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
is a completely current eat if you time

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.190 
is a completely current eat if you time
it<00:01:20.610> correctly<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:21.720> do<00:01:21.840> any<00:01:22.020> other

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
it correctly you can't do any other

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.170 
it correctly you can't do any other
normal<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.860> string<00:01:23.220> other<00:01:23.490> than<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:23.909> for

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
normal or string other than one for

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.760 
normal or string other than one for
because<00:01:24.780> they<00:01:24.960> will<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.170> able<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> armor<00:01:25.650> out

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because they will be able to armor out

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.910 
because they will be able to armor out
and<00:01:26.540> let<00:01:27.540> me<00:01:27.630> demonstrate<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:28.110> practical<00:01:28.619> setup

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and let me demonstrate a practical setup

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.090 
and let me demonstrate a practical setup
here<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.810> we're<00:01:30.810> gonna<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.170> block<00:01:31.860> mode

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
here so we're gonna go block mode

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
here so we're gonna go block mode
automatic<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.659> is<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> setup<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.320> find

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
automatic and this is the setup I find

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.899 
automatic and this is the setup I find
it's<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> variation<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.369> what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> do<00:01:35.640> in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
it's a variation on what I do in

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's a variation on what I do in
