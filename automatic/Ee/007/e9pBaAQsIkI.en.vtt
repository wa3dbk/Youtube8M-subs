but I've got an egg and it's a hundred
degrees<00:00:17.279> outside<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:18.150> by<00:00:18.840> that<00:00:18.920> posting<00:00:19.920> it

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
degrees outside so by that posting it

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.070 
degrees outside so by that posting it
should<00:00:20.189> be<00:00:20.310> about<00:00:20.480> 160<00:00:21.480> i<00:00:21.510> believe<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> black

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080

should be about 160 i believe the black
pavement<00:00:22.500> here<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:22.800> let's<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.310> if<00:00:23.369> we<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.550> fry

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
pavement here so let's see if we can fry

or drain it gets clogged up you can pour
a<00:02:11.599> little<00:02:12.599> bit<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.840> baking<00:02:13.140> soda<00:02:13.170> into<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.799> down

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
a little bit of baking soda into it down

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.710 
a little bit of baking soda into it down
into<00:02:14.489> it<00:02:14.579> as<00:02:14.700> much<00:02:15.090> as<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.269> can<00:02:15.329> get<00:02:15.450> into<00:02:15.599> it

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
into it as much as you can get into it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.240 
into it as much as you can get into it
and<00:02:15.780> then<00:02:15.900> vinegar<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.410> it'll<00:02:16.620> bubble<00:02:16.860> up<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
and then vinegar and it'll bubble up and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.640 
and then vinegar and it'll bubble up and
it's<00:02:17.670> kind<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.819> like<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:17.970> natural<00:02:18.390> drain<00:02:19.349> over

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
it's kind of like a natural drain over

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's kind of like a natural drain over
that<00:02:19.799> won't<00:02:20.040> put<00:02:20.310> your<00:02:20.459> drain<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.730> much<00:02:20.880> as

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
that won't put your drain as much as

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.400 
that won't put your drain as much as
other<00:02:21.090> things<00:02:21.390> but<00:02:21.540> it'll<00:02:21.690> really<00:02:21.810> help

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
other things but it'll really help

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.720 
other things but it'll really help
unclog<00:02:22.799> things<00:02:23.069> I've<00:02:23.190> used<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.459> in<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.610> past

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
unclog things I've used that in the past

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:24.890 
unclog things I've used that in the past
quite<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> few<00:02:24.180> times<00:02:24.360> when<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.599> garbage

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
quite a few times when the garbage

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.990 
quite a few times when the garbage
disposals<00:02:25.349> got<00:02:25.500> cleaned<00:02:25.739> up<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.099> try<00:02:26.790> that<00:02:26.819> out

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
disposals got cleaned up so try that out

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.729 
disposals got cleaned up so try that out
when<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.420> go<00:02:27.569> back<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> egg<00:02:28.410> here<00:02:28.590> we'll

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
when we go back to the egg here we'll
