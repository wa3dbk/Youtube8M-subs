00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.520 
disciplines 36 miles an hour 34 miles
now<00:00:08.189> we<00:00:08.820> built<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.150> ski<00:00:09.330> specifically<00:00:09.900> for<00:00:10.080> 34

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
now we built the ski specifically for 34

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.789 
now we built the ski specifically for 34
it's<00:00:11.070> RS<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.719> the<00:00:12.719> S<00:00:12.809> stands<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.259> speed<00:00:13.620> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
it's RS to the S stands for speed and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's RS to the S stands for speed and
that's<00:00:13.950> exactly<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:14.610> need<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:14.820> 34<00:00:15.179> miles

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
that's exactly what you need at 34 miles

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's exactly what you need at 34 miles
an<00:00:15.480> hour<00:00:15.540> more<00:00:16.109> speed<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> finish<00:00:16.949> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
an hour more speed to the finish the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.090 
an hour more speed to the finish the
turn<00:00:17.369> more<00:00:18.119> speed<00:00:18.390> cross<00:00:18.690> course<00:00:18.990> we<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
turn more speed cross course we have the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
turn more speed cross course we have the
world's<00:00:20.369> finest<00:00:20.789> 34<00:00:21.270> mile<00:00:21.480> per<00:00:21.689> hour<00:00:21.750> high-end

skiers<00:00:22.650> as<00:00:22.830> part<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.850> our<00:00:23.970> design<00:00:24.300> team<00:00:24.330> so<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
skiers as part of our design team so we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.410 
skiers as part of our design team so we
basically<00:00:25.199> said<00:00:25.800> make<00:00:26.340> yourself<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.849> ski<00:00:27.119> for

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
basically said make yourself a ski for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.870 
basically said make yourself a ski for
you<00:00:27.539> when<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.590> slow<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.830> boat<00:00:29.039> down<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> 34

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you when you slow the boat down to 34

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.749 
you when you slow the boat down to 34
miles<00:00:30.119> per<00:00:30.359> hour<00:00:30.710> everything<00:00:31.710> changes<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.640> we

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
miles per hour everything changes so we

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.970 
miles per hour everything changes so we
decided<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> design<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.630> ski<00:00:33.989> specifically<00:00:34.739> for

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
decided to design a ski specifically for

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.060 
decided to design a ski specifically for
34<00:00:35.940> miles<00:00:36.180> per<00:00:36.420> hour<00:00:36.510> skiers<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.770> biggest

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
34 miles per hour skiers the biggest

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.959 
34 miles per hour skiers the biggest
difference<00:00:38.340> between<00:00:38.370> 6<00:00:39.230> 34<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.379> 36<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.070> what

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
difference between 6 34 and 36 is what

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
difference between 6 34 and 36 is what
you<00:00:42.090> see<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.360> guys<00:00:42.780> riding<00:00:43.079> at<00:00:44.070> 36<00:00:44.520> miles<00:00:44.670> are

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
you see is guys riding at 36 miles are

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
you see is guys riding at 36 miles are
made<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> 66<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.200> then<00:00:46.320> go<00:00:46.469> down

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
made the right in a 66 and then go down

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
made the right in a 66 and then go down
to<00:00:46.649> 34<00:00:47.100> miles<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:47.460> hour<00:00:47.550> only<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> go<00:00:48.059> up

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
to 34 miles an hour only have to go up

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.709 
to 34 miles an hour only have to go up
the<00:00:48.300> size<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.719> 22<00:00:49.170> 67<00:00:49.739> or<00:00:49.829> 68<00:00:50.239> to<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> same

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the size of 22 67 or 68 to get the same

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.560 
the size of 22 67 or 68 to get the same
acceleration<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.300> lift<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.539> of

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
acceleration to get the same lift out of

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
acceleration to get the same lift out of
the<00:00:54.719> ski<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.649> were<00:00:55.770> trying<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.100> do

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the ski and so what we were trying to do

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
the ski and so what we were trying to do
is<00:00:56.340> come<00:00:56.520> up<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.760> package<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> would

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is come up with a package that would

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
is come up with a package that would
allow<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:59.100> guy<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.370> stay<00:00:59.789> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> same<00:01:00.239> side

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
allow that guy to stay on the same side

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.299 
allow that guy to stay on the same side
ski<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.170> turn<00:01:01.410> better<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:02.160> it's

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
ski which will turn better because it's

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.590 
ski which will turn better because it's
on<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> smaller<00:01:02.579> ski<00:01:03.000> but<00:01:03.180> yet<00:01:03.359> get<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
on a smaller ski but yet get the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.289 
on a smaller ski but yet get the
acceleration<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.650> glide<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.850> he<00:01:05.970> was

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
acceleration and the glide that he was

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.480 
acceleration and the glide that he was
getting<00:01:06.450> at<00:01:06.630> 36<00:01:07.110> miles<00:01:07.350> an<00:01:07.530> hour<00:01:07.650> that's<00:01:08.400> what

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
getting at 36 miles an hour that's what

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
getting at 36 miles an hour that's what
we've<00:01:08.640> achieved<00:01:08.729> would<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.540> us<00:01:09.659> two<00:01:10.040> we<00:01:11.040> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
we've achieved would be us two we do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
we've achieved would be us two we do
this<00:01:11.340> by<00:01:11.520> employing<00:01:11.850> speedstep<00:01:12.510> technology

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this by employing speedstep technology

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230 
this by employing speedstep technology

bottom isn't anything new I mean is new
to<00:01:19.380> skis<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:19.979> been<00:01:20.100> around<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.670> boats

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
to skis but it's been around with boats

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.429 
to skis but it's been around with boats
and<00:01:21.210> that's<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.570> where<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> idea<00:01:22.049> came

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and that's really where the idea came

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.170 
and that's really where the idea came
from<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.369> this<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.670> offshore<00:01:23.820> racing

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
from you see this in offshore racing

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.630 
from you see this in offshore racing
boats<00:01:24.630> speed<00:01:24.900> boats<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.200> reduce<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.439> drag

once you get to a certain speed all that
surface<00:01:32.100> area<00:01:32.340> creates<00:01:32.670> drag<00:01:32.939> so<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> got<00:01:33.570> to

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
surface area creates drag so you got to
