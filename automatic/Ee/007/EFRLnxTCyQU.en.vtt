usage of stopping time to overcome the

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.770 
usage of stopping time to overcome the
obstacles<00:00:34.039> is<00:00:34.250> demonstrated<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.270> the<00:00:35.390> several

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
obstacles is demonstrated in the several

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.799 
obstacles is demonstrated in the several
examples<00:00:36.249> the<00:00:37.249> first<00:00:37.579> obstacle<00:00:37.969> is<00:00:38.449> a<00:00:38.480> laser

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
examples the first obstacle is a laser

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.160 
examples the first obstacle is a laser
ditch<00:00:39.199> it<00:00:40.010> is<00:00:40.280> too<00:00:40.550> wide<00:00:40.760> for<00:00:40.789> jumping<00:00:41.719> over

ditch it is too wide for jumping over

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.739 
ditch it is too wide for jumping over
and<00:00:42.350> lasers<00:00:43.190> move<00:00:43.429> too<00:00:43.670> fast<00:00:43.999> for<00:00:44.449> stingy

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:44.749 
and lasers move too fast for stingy

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:48.279 
and lasers move too fast for stingy
managed<00:00:45.319> to<00:00:45.559> run<00:00:45.739> between<00:00:45.949> them<00:00:46.960> however<00:00:47.960> if

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 
managed to run between them however if

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:50.979 
managed to run between them however if
we<00:00:48.679> stop<00:00:48.979> time<00:00:49.309> it<00:00:49.640> stops<00:00:49.969> even<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.539> lasers

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
we stop time it stops even the lasers

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.169 
we stop time it stops even the lasers
and<00:00:51.199> stingy<00:00:51.469> can<00:00:51.890> pass<00:00:52.219> carefully<00:00:52.940> between

00:00:53.169 --> 00:00:53.179 
and stingy can pass carefully between

00:00:53.179 --> 00:01:24.230 
and stingy can pass carefully between
them

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.330 

here<00:01:25.240> we<00:01:25.390> can<00:01:25.509> see<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.780> classical<00:01:26.470> example<00:01:26.649> of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
here we can see a classical example of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.520 
here we can see a classical example of
usage<00:01:27.670> of<00:01:27.790> hadron<00:01:28.240> known<00:01:28.570> from<00:01:28.899> previous<00:01:29.290> Tove

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
usage of hadron known from previous Tove

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.680 
usage of hadron known from previous Tove
log<00:01:29.770> but<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.759> differ<00:01:30.970> in<00:01:31.149> that<00:01:31.180> for<00:01:31.539> the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
log but it differ in that for the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.900 
log but it differ in that for the
opening<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.500> second<00:01:32.979> doors<00:01:33.280> needed<00:01:33.820> to

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
opening of the second doors needed to

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.389 
opening of the second doors needed to
gain<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.180> same<00:01:34.420> tetrahedron<00:01:35.410> which<00:01:35.590> can<00:01:36.190> be

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
gain the same tetrahedron which can be

00:01:36.399 --> 00:02:01.410 
gain the same tetrahedron which can be
only<00:01:36.580> one<00:01:36.789> in<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.179> room

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.020 

again<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.990> use<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.229> stopping<00:02:03.799> time<00:02:04.070> in<00:02:04.369> fact

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
again we use a stopping time in fact

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.899 
again we use a stopping time in fact
that<00:02:05.630> stingy<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.350> not<00:02:06.530> affected<00:02:07.040> by<00:02:07.070> time<00:02:07.580> and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that stingy is not affected by time and

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.120 
that stingy is not affected by time and
is<00:02:08.390> therefore<00:02:08.660> able<00:02:09.080> to<00:02:09.440> continue<00:02:09.979> to

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
is therefore able to continue to

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.900 
is therefore able to continue to
manipulate<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:10.850> the<00:02:10.970> environment<00:02:12.580> this<00:02:13.580> way

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
manipulate with the environment this way

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.690 
manipulate with the environment this way
stingy<00:02:14.360> gets<00:02:14.840> into<00:02:15.230> situation<00:02:15.950> when<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.580> is

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
stingy gets into situation when it is

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.150 
stingy gets into situation when it is
not<00:02:16.880> longer<00:02:17.209> possible<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.870> return<00:02:18.350> but<00:02:18.980> in

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
not longer possible to return but in

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:29.380 
not longer possible to return but in
this<00:02:19.280> case<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.910> doesn't<00:02:20.269> matter<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:29.060> next

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
this case it doesn't matter in the next

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.690 
this case it doesn't matter in the next
room<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.930> a<00:02:29.959> so-called<00:02:30.260> Blue<00:02:30.890> has<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.519> wall

of<00:05:23.710> stopping<00:05:24.160> time<00:05:24.400> and<00:05:24.760> next<00:05:25.330> time<00:05:25.720> we<00:05:26.080> will

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
of stopping time and next time we will

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.590 
of stopping time and next time we will
see<00:05:26.290> more<00:05:26.860> advanced<00:05:27.610> features<00:05:28.150> such<00:05:28.360> as
