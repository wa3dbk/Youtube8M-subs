demonstration along the lines of the

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.070 
demonstration along the lines of the
paintings<00:00:29.860> that<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.100> have<00:00:30.460> with<00:00:30.760> me<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.600> two<00:00:31.810> on

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
paintings that I have with me the two on

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.260 
paintings that I have with me the two on
the<00:00:32.380> back<00:00:32.560> these<00:00:32.980> are<00:00:33.010> watercolors<00:00:33.790> and<00:00:33.970> the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
the back these are watercolors and the

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.470 
the back these are watercolors and the
one<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:34.450> this<00:00:34.750> side<00:00:34.960> is<00:00:35.140> an<00:00:35.290> acrylic<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:37.270> we're

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
one on this side is an acrylic so we're

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.690 
one on this side is an acrylic so we're
going<00:00:37.720> to<00:00:37.870> be<00:00:38.020> working<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.680> controlling<00:00:39.400> the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
going to be working on controlling the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.420 
going to be working on controlling the
out<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:40.059> control<00:00:40.270> these<00:00:41.170> are<00:00:41.230> situations<00:00:41.620> that

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
out of control these are situations that

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.610 
out of control these are situations that
I<00:00:42.489> often<00:00:42.820> see<00:00:43.300> in<00:00:43.540> my<00:00:43.750> workshops<00:00:44.320> where<00:00:44.590> people

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
I often see in my workshops where people

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.010 
I often see in my workshops where people
struggle<00:00:45.220> away<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.510> things<00:00:46.750> that<00:00:46.840> are

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
struggle away with the things that are

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.990 
struggle away with the things that are
going<00:00:47.230> on<00:00:47.470> in<00:00:47.739> particular<00:00:47.949> we're<00:00:48.670> going<00:00:48.699> to<00:00:48.879> be

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
going on in particular we're going to be

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.240 
going on in particular we're going to be
working<00:00:49.269> wet<00:00:49.659> into<00:00:49.989> wet<00:00:50.199> and<00:00:50.440> building

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
working wet into wet and building

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.770 
working wet into wet and building
multiple<00:00:51.430> layers

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.350 

so<00:00:57.780> if<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.890> painting<00:00:59.190> in<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.520> positive<00:00:59.790> the

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
so if I was painting in the positive the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.479 
so if I was painting in the positive the
way<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> most<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> us<00:01:01.200> usually<00:01:01.470> work<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.010> would

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
way that most of us usually work I would

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.479 
way that most of us usually work I would
be<00:01:02.520> filling<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:03.840> shape<00:01:04.229> with<00:01:04.530> color<00:01:04.890> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
be filling in my shape with color but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.980 
be filling in my shape with color but
instead<00:01:05.940> of<00:01:06.000> doing<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.630> I'm

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
instead of doing that because I'm

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.859 
instead of doing that because I'm
working<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.619> negative<00:01:07.950> I'm<00:01:08.460> painting<00:01:09.300> the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
working in the negative I'm painting the

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.960 
working in the negative I'm painting the
space<00:01:10.290> around<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.130> I'm<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.880> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
space around it so I'm just going to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.749 
space around it so I'm just going to
glide<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.540> color<00:01:12.869> over<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.350> I'm<00:01:13.759> committing

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
glide that color over and I'm committing

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.180 
glide that color over and I'm committing
to<00:01:14.910> memory<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.840> stroke<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:16.800> making

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
to memory this stroke that I'm making

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.350 
to memory this stroke that I'm making
and<00:01:17.869> I'm<00:01:18.869> going<00:01:19.050> to<00:01:19.110> pull<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> color<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:20.360> wash

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
and I'm going to pull the color out wash

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690 
and I'm going to pull the color out wash
it<00:01:21.390> away<00:01:21.690> this<00:01:22.410> is<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:22.920> good<00:01:23.100> idea<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
it away this is a really good idea to

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.820 
it away this is a really good idea to
practice<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.630> before<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.440> into<00:01:25.650> a

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
practice this before you get into a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.010 
practice this before you get into a
painting<00:01:26.550> especially<00:01:26.940> when<00:01:27.690> you're<00:01:27.840> working

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
painting especially when you're working

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.300 
painting especially when you're working
wet<00:01:28.440> into<00:01:28.770> wet<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> your<00:01:31.560> hand<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
wet into wet so that your hand is

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
wet into wet so that your hand is
trained<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.210> shapes<00:01:33.539> that<00:01:33.780> you're<00:01:34.140> making

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
trained to the shapes that you're making

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.430 
trained to the shapes that you're making
again<00:01:35.009> I'm<00:01:35.220> washing<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.149> color<00:01:36.479> away<00:01:39.440> let's

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
again I'm washing that color away let's

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.499 
again I'm washing that color away let's
try<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.770> once<00:01:41.039> more<00:01:41.160> without<00:01:41.729> drawing<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.330> in

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
try it once more without drawing it in

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.020 
try it once more without drawing it in
but<00:01:43.440> that's<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.890> basic<00:01:44.310> concept<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.970> what

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
but that's the basic concept of what

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.920 
but that's the basic concept of what
we're<00:01:45.330> after

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
we're after

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.560 
we're after
so<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.560> stroke<00:01:47.270> load<00:01:48.270> up<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.630> brush<00:01:48.990> one

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
so this stroke load up this brush one

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.800 
so this stroke load up this brush one
two<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:53.670> fill<00:01:53.940> that<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.479> bit<00:01:54.600> more

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
two and fill that in a little bit more

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.380 
two and fill that in a little bit more
so<00:01:55.140> there's<00:01:55.350> my<00:01:55.590> basic<00:01:56.039> shape<00:01:56.310> now<00:01:56.940> in<00:01:57.690> my

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
so there's my basic shape now in my

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
so there's my basic shape now in my
sample<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:00.630> photograph<00:02:01.259> they<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.099> not

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sample and my photograph they have not

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.510 
sample and my photograph they have not
just<00:02:02.670> cut<00:02:02.849> into<00:02:03.060> them<00:02:03.649> so<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.160> to<00:02:05.250> do

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
just cut into them so I'm going to do

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
just cut into them so I'm going to do
that<00:02:05.789> with<00:02:06.300> my<00:02:06.630> brush<00:02:07.020> I'm<00:02:07.289> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> cut

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that with my brush I'm going to cut

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.030 
that with my brush I'm going to cut
those<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.459> now<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.330> I'm<00:02:12.599> carving<00:02:13.050> away<00:02:13.560> at<00:02:13.830> that

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
those in now so I'm carving away at that

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.780 
those in now so I'm carving away at that
shape

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.280 

when<00:02:21.790> you're<00:02:21.970> working<00:02:22.120> with<00:02:22.360> watercolors<00:02:23.260> you

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
when you're working with watercolors you

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.369 
when you're working with watercolors you
don't<00:02:23.860> have<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.489> just<00:02:24.730> put<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.090> on<00:02:25.209> with<00:02:25.840> thin

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
don't have to just put it on with thin

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.509 
don't have to just put it on with thin
layers<00:02:27.090> drying<00:02:28.090> in<00:02:28.299> between<00:02:29.010> paint<00:02:30.010> does<00:02:30.280> such

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
layers drying in between paint does such

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.100 
layers drying in between paint does such
fabulous<00:02:31.000> stuff

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
fabulous stuff

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.250 
fabulous stuff
oh<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.950> just<00:02:33.250> spreads<00:02:33.700> and<00:02:34.060> it<00:02:34.150> flows<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.140> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
oh it just spreads and it flows and it

really wet look at those nice darks in
here<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:15.189> thinking<00:03:15.250> about<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.239> overall

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
here I'm thinking about the overall

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.240 
here I'm thinking about the overall
movement<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.739> structure<00:03:18.579> of<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:19.810> plant<00:03:20.650> the

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
movement the structure of the plant the

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.819 
movement the structure of the plant the
stems<00:03:21.730> more<00:03:22.659> code<00:03:22.930> do<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.349> notice<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.620> haven't

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
stems more code do you notice I haven't

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.500 
stems more code do you notice I haven't
washed<00:03:23.950> my<00:03:24.189> brush<00:03:24.400> out<00:03:24.609> yet<00:03:27.060> let's<00:03:28.060> just<00:03:28.299> put

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
washed my brush out yet let's just put

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.740 
washed my brush out yet let's just put
some<00:03:28.540> of<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.810> rosy<00:03:29.680> color<00:03:29.949> in<00:03:30.220> here<00:03:30.750> that

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
some of that rosy color in here that

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.250 
some of that rosy color in here that
nice<00:03:31.959> color<00:03:33.389> even<00:03:34.389> though<00:03:34.419> we've<00:03:34.690> got<00:03:34.720> some

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
nice color even though we've got some

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.960 
nice color even though we've got some
pretty<00:03:35.410> bright<00:03:35.769> lights<00:03:36.069> on<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.669> in<00:03:36.790> the

pretty bright lights on here in the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.979 
pretty bright lights on here in the
studio<00:03:37.419> you<00:03:37.810> can<00:03:38.049> see<00:03:38.440> how<00:03:38.739> long<00:03:39.190> I<00:03:39.669> have<00:03:40.180> to

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
studio you can see how long I have to

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.610 
studio you can see how long I have to
work<00:03:41.349> in<00:03:41.650> this<00:03:41.829> wet<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.669> wet<00:03:43.620> approach

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
work in this wet and wet approach

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.550 
work in this wet and wet approach
building<00:03:45.549> up<00:03:45.699> these<00:03:45.940> layers<00:03:46.269> because<00:03:47.049> first

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
building up these layers because first

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.979 
building up these layers because first
of<00:03:47.709> all<00:03:47.859> I<00:03:48.069> wet<00:03:48.430> my<00:03:48.609> paper<00:03:48.879> so<00:03:49.269> completely<00:03:49.720> to

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
of all I wet my paper so completely to

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.140 
of all I wet my paper so completely to
begin<00:03:50.319> with<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:50.709> put<00:03:51.190> it<00:03:51.310> on<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.609> non-porous

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
begin with and put it on this non-porous

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.000 
begin with and put it on this non-porous
surface<00:03:52.599> so<00:03:52.720> it's<00:03:52.870> really<00:03:53.079> stewing<00:03:53.709> in<00:03:53.829> its

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
surface so it's really stewing in its

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.629 
surface so it's really stewing in its
own<00:03:54.190> juice<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:56.349> I'm<00:03:56.530> using<00:03:56.799> all<00:03:57.069> this<00:03:57.280> thick

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
own juice and I'm using all this thick

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.659 
own juice and I'm using all this thick
paint<00:03:58.199> I've<00:03:59.199> got<00:03:59.500> my<00:03:59.709> little<00:03:59.949> rigger<00:04:00.280> brush

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:00.669 
paint I've got my little rigger brush

paint I've got my little rigger brush
and<00:04:01.530> I'm<00:04:02.530> wetting<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.190> down<00:04:03.459> I'm<00:04:04.389> going<00:04:04.540> to

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
and I'm wetting it down I'm going to

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.530 
and I'm wetting it down I'm going to
take<00:04:04.750> out<00:04:04.870> some<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.290> water<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.970> I'm<00:04:06.970> going

take out some of the water and I'm going
to<00:04:07.900> just<00:04:08.340> tickle<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.459> just<00:04:09.699> like<00:04:09.819> I<00:04:09.940> am<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.209> my

arm just tickle it across the surface of

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.170 
arm just tickle it across the surface of
the<00:04:13.659> paper<00:04:14.620> just<00:04:15.220> because<00:04:15.549> they<00:04:15.760> said<00:04:15.970> it's

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the paper just because they said it's

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.949 
the paper just because they said it's
it's<00:04:16.479> so<00:04:16.900> vulnerable<00:04:17.639> just<00:04:18.639> a<00:04:18.820> wee<00:04:19.060> brushing

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
it's so vulnerable just a wee brushing

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.080 
it's so vulnerable just a wee brushing
with<00:04:20.169> this<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.680> little<00:04:21.190> bit<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.459> moisture<00:04:21.609> on

this<00:04:22.360> long<00:04:22.630> brush<00:04:22.960> and<00:04:23.229> I<00:04:23.409> should<00:04:23.740> get<00:04:23.919> some

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
this long brush and I should get some

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.550 
this long brush and I should get some
nice<00:04:24.340> little<00:04:24.610> light<00:04:24.880> lines<00:04:25.560> happening

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
little lines down in there just to break

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.950 
little lines down in there just to break
that<00:04:38.800> up<00:04:38.950> a<00:04:39.220> bit

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960

build a lot of layers and we looked at

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.839 
build a lot of layers and we looked at
building<00:05:49.990> multiple<00:05:50.139> layers<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:51.010> that's

building multiple layers and that's
exactly<00:05:52.330> what<00:05:52.479> you<00:05:52.630> would<00:05:52.750> do<00:05:52.960> you<00:05:53.110> just

just carving it away and then I'll wash
