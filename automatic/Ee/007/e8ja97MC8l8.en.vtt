and they would have used these terraces
here<00:01:51.410> too<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:52.550> think<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:53.180> we<00:01:53.330> hold<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:54.290> plants

but but the depth of that cool cold

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.219 
but but the depth of that cool cold
water<00:02:02.000> coming<00:02:02.300> through<00:02:02.420> one<00:02:02.810> after<00:02:03.200> another
