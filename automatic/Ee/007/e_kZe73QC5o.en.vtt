00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
test tube and a water with your magnetic

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.989 
test tube and a water with your magnetic
stirrer<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:37.490> make<00:01:37.999> sure<00:01:38.240> that<00:01:38.539> the<00:01:38.689> gas<00:01:38.990> will

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
stirrer to make sure that the gas will

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.730 
stirrer to make sure that the gas will
go<00:01:40.999> from<00:01:41.270> here<00:01:41.630> in<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.200> water

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
go from here in the water

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.889 
go from here in the water
the<00:01:42.920> magnetic<00:01:43.280> stirrer<00:01:43.759> is<00:01:44.030> not<00:01:44.270> absolutely

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
the magnetic stirrer is not absolutely

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.800 
the magnetic stirrer is not absolutely
necessary<00:01:45.049> but<00:01:45.920> it's<00:01:46.459> a<00:01:46.609> good<00:01:46.789> thing<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.329> mix

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
necessary but it's a good thing to mix

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.069 
necessary but it's a good thing to mix
up<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.350> water<00:01:48.619> with<00:01:49.659> hydrochloric<00:01:50.659> acid

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 
up the water with hydrochloric acid

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.160 
up the water with hydrochloric acid
later<00:01:51.319> so<00:01:52.039> if<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.429> have<00:01:52.639> one<00:01:52.999> turn<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.600> on<00:01:53.810> now

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
later so if you have one turn it on now

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.700 
later so if you have one turn it on now
and<00:01:55.359> go<00:01:56.359> on<00:01:56.600> with<00:01:56.780> next<00:01:57.259> step

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.459 

now<00:02:02.710> put<00:02:03.159> some<00:02:03.189> pressure<00:02:03.759> on<00:02:03.999> your<00:02:04.240> pipette<00:02:04.749> so

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
now put some pressure on your pipette so

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:07.739 
now put some pressure on your pipette so
that<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.859> sulfuric<00:02:06.340> acid<00:02:06.909> would<00:02:07.119> drop<00:02:07.390> down

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:07.749 
that the sulfuric acid would drop down

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:10.830 
that the sulfuric acid would drop down
on<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.319> sole<00:02:08.769> and<00:02:09.129> you<00:02:09.160> will<00:02:10.090> see<00:02:10.239> that<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.450> gas

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
on the sole and you will see that a gas

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.199 
on the sole and you will see that a gas
is<00:02:11.769> coming<00:02:12.010> out<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.610> here<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:14.879> getting<00:02:15.879> here

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
is coming out of here and getting here

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.390 
is coming out of here and getting here
in<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.629> water<00:02:19.319> it's<00:02:20.319> an<00:02:20.560> exothermic<00:02:20.920> reaction

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
in the water it's an exothermic reaction

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.150 
in the water it's an exothermic reaction
so<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.120> test<00:02:22.690> tube<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.170> turnip<00:02:23.560> if<00:02:23.680> long

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
so the test tube the turnip if long

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.119 
so the test tube the turnip if long
often<00:02:24.400> enough<00:02:24.879> take<00:02:25.390> some<00:02:26.140> more<00:02:26.379> salt<00:02:26.860> or

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
often enough take some more salt or

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.600 
often enough take some more salt or
sulfuric<00:02:27.670> acid<00:02:28.180> and<00:02:28.330> drop<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.230> down<00:02:29.260> again<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
sulfuric acid and drop it down again the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.009 
sulfuric acid and drop it down again the
reaction<00:02:31.090> will<00:02:31.269> go<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:34.019> more

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
reaction will go on and more

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.100 
reaction will go on and more
hydrochloric<00:02:35.829> acid<00:02:36.220> will<00:02:36.700> be<00:02:36.879> produced<00:02:37.450> the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
hydrochloric acid will be produced the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.610 
hydrochloric acid will be produced the
pH<00:02:38.650> meter<00:02:39.040> which<00:02:39.640> first<00:02:40.060> showed<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.629> pH<00:02:41.590> of

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
pH meter which first showed a pH of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.819 
pH meter which first showed a pH of
around<00:02:42.040> seven<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:43.480> shows<00:02:44.049> the<00:02:44.260> pH<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:45.420> 2.6

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
around seven now shows the pH of 2.6

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.460 
around seven now shows the pH of 2.6
because<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.569> hydrochloric<00:02:49.569> gas<00:02:50.140> in<00:02:50.349> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
because the hydrochloric gas in the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.270 
because the hydrochloric gas in the
water<00:02:50.709> makes<00:02:51.160> an<00:02:51.340> acid<00:02:51.760> solution<00:02:52.920> apart<00:02:53.920> from

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
water makes an acid solution apart from

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.150 
water makes an acid solution apart from
the<00:02:54.579> hydrochloric<00:02:55.299> acid<00:02:55.810> there's<00:02:56.109> also<00:02:56.319> put

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the hydrochloric acid there's also put

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.449 
the hydrochloric acid there's also put
sodium<00:02:57.609> sulfate<00:02:58.390> produced<00:02:59.220> with<00:03:00.220> this

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
sodium sulfate produced with this

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.940 
sodium sulfate produced with this
reaction<00:03:01.329> here<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:01.840> see<00:03:02.109> the<00:03:02.500> chemical
