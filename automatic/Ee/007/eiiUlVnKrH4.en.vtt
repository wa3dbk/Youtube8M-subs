00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.220
 the carnet com py 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.970
 may chic 7x3 configure and switzerland part 1 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:11.590
 can show a good idea of ​​the possibilities of the statut studying in 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:14.740
 detail on Tuesday and that you remove with cvc huizar 

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:18.929
 although this application allows us to modify parameters of the network as the 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:20.339
 eccentric and mac 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:23.529
 select between protocols like ttp and ftp patch 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 does not allow the user to father their own code 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.570
 at the time of implementing a system we must necessarily prove the merger 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.240
 it's dry on the mp side 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.890
 The first thing we have to do is select the folder from which we are going 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910
 to work is to say everything the state is installed 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.640
 the basic project is the Mallorcan only that is serious / tcp 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.800
 let's try ap 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.040
 While there several examples made with the touch and convenient to start with 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.270
 this 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.710
 there are others with support for uefa and quiterian ssl encryption 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.540
 what are we doing the cb to the assistant what files are we going to 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.690
 set up 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.110
 you have to keep in mind that the one that sticks and stick configure and switzerland adds 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.110
 little fusion in the statut commenting code 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.010
 as we know lc 18 does not combine the commented code nor the associated functions 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.160
 thus saving pi program memory 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.110
 we can add support for different services web server is client and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 medium is the ftp market and it's that 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.960
 this instance we will create web server that allows access to a page 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.730
 by means of the arch direction invertí client and medellín 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.840
 b before which we can send a level or automatically to a certain 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.900
 event 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.900
 for example if the temperature rises above the threshold 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.890
 as we mentioned previously Kika service that is enabled average of the 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.360
 assistant commented on the state so that pse 18 I did not combine it 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.820
 this instance it is worth mentioning that in this topic it is saying that it is organizing 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.940
 arias archives 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.010
 the headers that inhabit the services are in the file 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.010
 tcp and p finally counted h 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.730
 not all state functions are available through tc felipe 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.239
 configure and secure 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.409
 that's why it's important to access the tcp file and trust I counted hy comments 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.009
 services that we do not need 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.079
 in this way we are optimizing the use of program-memory
