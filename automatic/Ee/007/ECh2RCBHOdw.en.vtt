duder be replaced I want to do the same

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.280 
duder be replaced I want to do the same
thing<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.650> side<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:24.720> looks<00:01:24.930> like<00:01:25.080> it's

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
thing on this side it looks like it's

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.569 
thing on this side it looks like it's
already<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> point<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:28.009> if<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> get<00:01:29.340> much

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
already to that point so if you get much

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.100 
already to that point so if you get much
beyond<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.180> then<00:01:30.630> you're<00:01:30.750> not<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:31.049> to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
beyond that then you're not going to

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.410 
beyond that then you're not going to
have<00:01:31.290> any<00:01:31.439> more<00:01:31.650> threads<00:01:31.979> or<00:01:32.189> bolt<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:33.299> able

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
have any more threads or bolt to be able

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.679 
have any more threads or bolt to be able
to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.810> but<00:01:34.290> once<00:01:34.470> you've<00:01:34.650> completed<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
to do it but once you've completed it

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.469 
to do it but once you've completed it
you'll<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.840> you're<00:01:37.049> done<00:01:37.369> because<00:01:38.390> when<00:01:39.390> you

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
you'll know you're done because when you

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.450 
you'll know you're done because when you
put<00:01:39.659> your<00:01:39.780> fingers<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> chain

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
put your fingers you see where the chain

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.660 
put your fingers you see where the chain
rubs<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.060> slide<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:44.130> can<00:01:44.159> put<00:01:44.460> two

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
rubs on the slide here you can put two

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.370 
rubs on the slide here you can put two
fingers<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.170> you

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
fingers in there and that's it you

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.359 
fingers in there and that's it you
should<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.740> some<00:01:47.070> slack<00:01:47.579> two<00:01:48.030> fingers<00:01:48.450> worth

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
should have some slack two fingers worth

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.620 
should have some slack two fingers worth
but<00:01:50.369> not<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.759> more<00:01:50.790> than<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.479> can<00:01:51.509> see

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
but not much more than that you can see

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.899
