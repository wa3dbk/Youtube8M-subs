00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.590
 hello I'm sofía to seen and this is like 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.790
 make baked potatoes with spices here 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.790
 in my daughter or in Spanish 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.430
 for this we need thyme potatoes 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.260
 paprika and oregano oil and salt to taste 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.029
 What we will do now is to wash the 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.400
 potatoes because this time we choose to stay 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.110
 with the peel for our recipe the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.510
 let's cut into slices like the ones 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.510
 we have here in this way 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.560
 we cut them like this 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.230
 ok once this is done we are going to have a 

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:48.190
 source for oven to which we already put 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.230
 oil let's put our potatoes 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.190
 separated at the source 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.890
 in this way ok so the same ones 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.640
 let's take our spices 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.640
 a little oregano 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.380
 instant 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.380
 and then the rest of the condiments 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.100
 Now we are going to put a little bit of 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.100
 Pepper 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.609
 a little bit of salt 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.680
 and finally we're going to put it, we're going to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.680
 spray with oil 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.189
 now we take them to the oven more or less 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.649
 about 25 30 minutes or what you think 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.649
 necessary at a temperature of 180 degrees 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.090
 and the baked potatoes are ready with 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.030
 spices now I'm going to eat them with 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.920

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.260

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.260
