00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
let's demonstrate it one more time so

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.569 
let's demonstrate it one more time so
it's<00:00:55.090> going<00:00:55.300> around<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:55.960> his<00:00:56.110> right<00:00:56.379> foot

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579

inside out leaves in his left foot to
push<00:01:00.160> it<00:01:00.430> away<00:01:00.520> so<00:01:00.879> now<00:01:01.030> we're<00:01:01.210> going<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.390> do<00:01:01.480> is

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
push it away so now we're going to do is

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.679 
push it away so now we're going to do is
they'll<00:01:02.320> roll<00:01:02.590> over<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:04.210> scissors<00:01:04.570> at

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
they'll roll over and the scissors at

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.880 
they'll roll over and the scissors at
the<00:01:04.809> same<00:01:05.049> time<00:01:05.320> let's<00:01:05.710> see<00:01:05.799> that<00:01:05.979> now<00:01:07.890> perfect

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
the same time let's see that now perfect

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.580 
the same time let's see that now perfect
so<00:01:09.369> the<00:01:09.549> roll<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.150> bringing<00:01:10.960> him<00:01:11.049> into<00:01:11.290> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so the roll is bringing him into the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.800 
so the roll is bringing him into the
scissors<00:01:11.950> move<00:01:12.299> using<00:01:13.299> his<00:01:13.390> right<00:01:13.600> foot

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
scissors move using his right foot

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.600 
scissors move using his right foot
inside<00:01:14.500> out<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:15.010> push<00:01:15.159> it<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.340> with<00:01:15.460> his<00:01:15.580> left

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.120 
inside out and push it in with his left
foot<00:01:15.850> let's<00:01:16.119> demonstrate<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.540> one<00:01:16.630> more<00:01:16.720> time

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
foot let's demonstrate it one more time

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.620 
foot let's demonstrate it one more time
so<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.280> role<00:01:18.520> then<00:01:19.450> this<00:01:19.659> scissors<00:01:20.250> perfect

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
so the role then this scissors perfect

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.000 
so the role then this scissors perfect
now<00:01:22.630> he's<00:01:22.900> going<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.170> demonstrate<00:01:23.290> just<00:01:23.799> the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
now he's going to demonstrate just the

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.590 
now he's going to demonstrate just the
sitter's<00:01:24.310> move<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.670> double<00:01:25.119> scissors<00:01:25.450> this

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
sitter's move a double scissors this

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.249 
sitter's move a double scissors this
time<00:01:25.810> by<00:01:25.990> itself<00:01:29.759> perfect<00:01:30.759> perfect<00:01:31.689> so<00:01:32.140> what

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
time by itself perfect perfect so what

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:33.840 
time by itself perfect perfect so what
he's<00:01:32.380> doing<00:01:32.590> it<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.770> going<00:01:32.979> right<00:01:33.400> foot<00:01:33.670> first

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
he's doing it is going right foot first

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.210 
he's doing it is going right foot first
left<00:01:34.479> foot<00:01:34.720> then<00:01:35.110> back<00:01:35.320> with<00:01:35.500> this<00:01:35.650> right<00:01:35.890> foot

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
left foot then back with this right foot

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.219 
left foot then back with this right foot
so<00:01:37.150> now<00:01:37.299> what<00:01:37.450> he's<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.750> to<00:01:37.780> do<00:01:37.869> is<00:01:37.990> going<00:01:38.170> to

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
so now what he's going to do is going to

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.170 
so now what he's going to do is going to
use<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.439> roll<00:01:38.680> now<00:01:39.430> with<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.880> double

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
use the roll now with the double

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.700 
use the roll now with the double
scissors<00:01:40.509> now<00:01:42.570> roll<00:01:43.570> double<00:01:44.380> scissors

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
scissors now roll double scissors

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.830 
scissors now roll double scissors
perfect<00:01:45.250> so<00:01:45.640> what<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.880> role<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.299> doing<00:01:46.600> is

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
perfect so what the role is doing is

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.690 
perfect so what the role is doing is
bringing<00:01:47.229> them<00:01:47.439> into<00:01:47.650> the<00:01:47.979> double<00:01:48.310> scissors

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
bringing them into the double scissors

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.850 
bringing them into the double scissors
so<00:01:49.060> he's<00:01:49.210> rolling<00:01:49.540> it<00:01:49.720> then<00:01:50.110> dulles<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.560> right

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
so he's rolling it then dulles is right

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.770 
so he's rolling it then dulles is right
then<00:01:51.520> left<00:01:51.820> let's<00:01:52.119> demonstrate<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.630> one

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
then left let's demonstrate that one

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.850 
then left let's demonstrate that one
more<00:01:52.869> time<00:01:52.930> police<00:01:54.720> roll<00:01:55.720> double<00:01:56.530> scissors

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
more time police roll double scissors

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.550 
more time police roll double scissors
perfect<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.720> demonstrating<00:01:59.350> the

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
perfect so that is demonstrating the

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.299 
perfect so that is demonstrating the
roll<00:01:59.829> and<00:02:00.070> double<00:02:00.640> scissors<00:02:01.030> move
