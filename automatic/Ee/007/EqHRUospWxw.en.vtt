00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello girls as nothing today I bring you a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.049
 video to make a review of a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.190
 product that I bought in my past and 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.469
 nothing is the 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.209
 the sap brush I have it here is with 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.360
 the plastic because I know that the videos 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:20.020
 is much better when you teach them in 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:23.349
 its packaging and you see it a little good 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.970
 you can know I tell you good because this is 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.890
 the brush also made me many 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.320
 thank you I saw it on facebook yes 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.020
 that you are recommended here in the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 right and good as it has the 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.610
 green here has a pretty color 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.340
 bright and then it seems to me like 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.530
 a little witch or a little bug or something 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.170
 good but good let's talk a little 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.909
 what is the product to see you 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.670
 you know that I have curly hair that 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:51.399
 here where you see it, this is because 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.159
 plancha is nothing but iron 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.019
 then I one of my worst nightmares 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.749
 What also happens to me is Christmas 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.850
 typical that you go on a trip and do not take the 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.339
 conditioner after to wash the hair and 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.520
 you say god two I will have gotten it the 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.770
 conditioner and or without conditioner is 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.050
 that I cry and tears tucked up 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.260
 here because it is that 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.790
 my hair I have it dry well now what 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.940
 I have a little more fat than you already know 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.190
 but usually with the wick appointment it 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.710
 It dries quite apart I have it 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.500
 wavy me without conditioner I can not 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.860
 live then I'm a little fan of 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.370
 this type of brush they have then a 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.890
 little the or so a little different that 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.830
 try to be between sentry and good 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.720
 I saw this and saw a promotion that 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.200
 had for facebook good because also 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.710
 they sell it they sell it with and sell it 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.810
 in at stores on store tv points 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 then there is a web page called 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.210
 of sata dotcom which is what it's called 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.280
 this brush and had a promotion that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.500
 they were without shipping costs then I 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.190
 I said look I'm going to take advantage and I'm going 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.860
 to buy and asia I met a little time 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.040
 I had also bought this and I 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.440
 I liked it but I did not like it that much because 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.260
 is in question has only two 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.620
 types of times larger ones and others 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.500
 smaller and this one being smaller 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.690
 It was like I got the feeling that 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.180
 I combed but I have to put my hand 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.370
 behind or something to push you because it's 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.819
 as if I only unravel what I 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.580
 it's the outside part and this was from the 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.860
 brand michel mercier good this what 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.940
 I bought my carrefour good, this is the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.690
 truth is that I'm liking and 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.209
 I already used it several times and 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.040
 I liked it a lot because I like it 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.810
 like it because in principle it does not have a handle 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.180
 then it's like you have more control 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.489
 about the brush that when you take a 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.879
 mango is like that force be done in 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.890
 the handle but not on what to untangle 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.190
 then to untangle myself that I have the 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.010
 Curly hair that you have already seen is 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.310
 wonderful is not not logical by nancy not 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.290
 because I think about it and then tell you 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.819
 a little that good and where you see it from 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.560
 read the information a little bit because if not 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.569
 go to review that is to say I bought myself a 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.970
 brush and I like it very much apart from 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.040
 that he only uses with conditioner 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.200
 here you put in the prospect the check you 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.720
 send that you can use it with 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.010
 conditioner and without conditioner yo 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.260
 I have used with 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:29.620
 but I did notice the 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.230
 difference with a normal brush 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.510
 Well, tell you that this has 440 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.510
 double-height barbs as you can see 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.709
 na 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.920
 and then it has a curvature that 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.200
 it takes better the shape of the head and that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.569
 his hands get spoiled with the museum he puts 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.250
 and that uses a special woman who 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:57.190
 llama its 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:00.250
 and 3 63 56 natural virgin and then the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.990
 shell is from bs natural virgin material 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.820
 trim that gives you a color 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:07.060
 intense that lasts in time thing 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.070
 that I liked the most, I am a 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.740
 little of saying things without conditions 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.750
 visit and this design I loved it and 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.200
 then the brightness that you have that is very 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.959
 nice that because he read those of the 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.200
 theme of the type of barbs and such because a 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.419
 I once read in a magazine article 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.800
 that the brushes it depends 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.510
 it depends on where you buy it super 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.310
 important with the material that are already 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.020
 made by this type of brushes the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.600
 typical that then if it becomes fashionable or 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.919
 because the prayer pretty good the 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.230
 Chinese for example I'm going to put 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.320
 copy it but it's not the same because 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.300
 the type of plastic 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.860
 you can better or worse in the hair that is 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.140
 brush yourself depending on the 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.970
 plastic in which it is made or you can go 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.280
 right or wrong not only because of the issue of 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.290
 that entangles that maybe it depends 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.880
 a little more of the design but because 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.370
 example in this case at the time that 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.820
 is in a tug fiber is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.160
 what does 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.550
 that they go as we fold then as 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.970
 that is removing what is going tangle 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.760
 unleashing what is well said by name at 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.320
 Brush that is of saca entangles it 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.510
 at once 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.760
 little by little then it's not the pull 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.520
 once and for the matter that 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.290
 depending a little on the subject of the 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.930
 plastic in which it is that can be 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.540
 which will open the cÃ¡pitas until it has 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.350
 the the little hair well, this is my 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.510
 review of be brush sap to me 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.510
 It cost 16 with something that I tried that I have 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.070
 here 16 with 90 and good to tell you that it has 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.230
 a promotion now without shipping costs 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.570
 I do not know if it 's because they're new 

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.390
 or something like that they also have another promotion 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.920
 I do not know if they still have it or to me 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.330
 it sounds like having seen it on facebook or 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.190
 that came out after I bought it 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.720
 I wanted to give you a gift too 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.250
 needy or something like that to me do not tell me 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.010
 They sent for the subject that I bought it 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:56.800
 before this came up but hey 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.480
 that since good that if you want to 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.100
 buy a special brush for the 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.410
 people who have hair 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.020
 Well, that's how I will have more tan 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.790
 vital is a pretty good alternative 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.740
 I have been happy at least 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.720
 buy the homework I did and I'm going to 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.360
 spend so much in a brush I'm going so 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.190
 Well, I say my printed my opinion 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.430
 Sincere is that it is worth it 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.230
 Well, nothing this my video to send is 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.030

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.200
 jce to my channel and we do not have in the 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:25.200
