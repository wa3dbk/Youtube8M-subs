down<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.240> just<00:05:20.930> tie<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:22.040> new<00:05:22.310> end<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:23.120> the<00:05:23.240> old

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
down and just tie the new end to the old

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.160 
down and just tie the new end to the old
end<00:05:24.100> later<00:05:25.100> on<00:05:25.430> I'll<00:05:25.790> weave<00:05:26.270> in<00:05:26.540> these<00:05:26.840> ends

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.170 
end later on I'll weave in these ends

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.140 
end later on I'll weave in these ends
