bit the differences between the two
devices<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:25.260> why<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.529> should<00:00:25.680> buy<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> LG<00:00:26.369> g3

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240

their difference in size of the device

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.190 
their difference in size of the device
itself<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.120> not<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.390> big<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.899> screens

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
itself is not that big but the screens

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.069 
itself is not that big but the screens
are<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.620> both<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.820> course<00:00:39.120> quite<00:00:39.420> different<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
are on both of course quite different in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
are on both of course quite different in
that<00:00:40.590> terms<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.309> size<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.550> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:42.090> go

that terms of size and if you just go

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.020 
that terms of size and if you just go
here<00:00:42.510> into<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.410> home<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.309> see<00:00:44.520> then

pistol cameras 16 megapixel camera and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.310 
pistol cameras 16 megapixel camera and
we<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:26.009> compare<00:01:26.400> both<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.810> so

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
we will just compare both right now so

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.310 
we will just compare both right now so
let's<00:01:28.590> check<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:30.570> camera<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.020> we<00:01:31.229> can

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
let's check that that camera so we can

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.440 
let's check that that camera so we can
hear<00:01:31.710> have<00:01:31.950> text<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.850> move<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
hear have text just move a little bit to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.510 
hear have text just move a little bit to
the<00:01:33.540> side<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.020> then<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.770> way<00:01:34.950> again<00:01:35.220> we<00:01:35.369> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
the side and then that way again we can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.469 
the side and then that way again we can
see<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.000> g3<00:01:36.990> seems<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.060> faster

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
see that the g3 seems to have the faster

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
see that the g3 seems to have the faster

just react faster the LG g3 so the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
just react faster the LG g3 so the
software's<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.360> better<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.320> terms<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
software's a lot better but in terms of

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.469 
software's a lot better but in terms of
a<00:01:58.800> wide<00:01:59.159> angle<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.640> are<00:01:59.760> about<00:02:00.120> the<00:02:00.300> same

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
a wide angle they are about the same

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.770 
a wide angle they are about the same
maybe<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.440> s5<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.250> little<00:02:02.460> bit<00:02:02.580> better<00:02:02.780> then

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
maybe the s5 is a little bit better then

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.550 
maybe the s5 is a little bit better then
we<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.050> here<00:02:05.630> as<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.380> phone

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
we have here as you can see the phone

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.499 
we have here as you can see the phone
camera<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.610> both<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.149> 2

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
camera where we have on both a 2

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.330 
camera where we have on both a 2
megapixel<00:02:09.600> camera<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.130> wide

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
megapixel camera but here the wide

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.100 
megapixel camera but here the wide
angles<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.970> bit<00:02:12.060> better<00:02:12.240> in<00:02:12.510> speed

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
angles a little bit better in speed

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.540 
angles a little bit better in speed
again<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.770> LG<00:02:14.400> g3<00:02:14.670> seems<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.600> be<00:02:15.690> faster<00:02:15.930> but

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
again the LG g3 seems to be faster but

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.060 
again the LG g3 seems to be faster but
the<00:02:17.550> quality<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.060> maybe<00:02:18.840> here<00:02:19.410> also<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.860> little

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the quality is maybe here also a little

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.949 
the quality is maybe here also a little
bit<00:02:20.220> better<00:02:20.400> here<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.820> back<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.209> course<00:02:21.750> on

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
bit better here on the back of course on

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.720 
bit better here on the back of course on
my<00:02:22.050> face<00:02:22.260> it's<00:02:22.560> I'm<00:02:22.830> both<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.310> same<00:02:23.520> but

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
my face it's I'm both the same but

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.130 
my face it's I'm both the same but
otherwise<00:02:23.940> have<00:02:24.480> quite<00:02:25.110> alright<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.390> this<00:02:27.900> was

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
otherwise have quite alright so this was

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.470 
otherwise have quite alright so this was
a<00:02:28.170> really<00:02:28.709> tiny<00:02:29.220> little<00:02:29.520> short<00:02:29.820> comparison<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
a really tiny little short comparison of

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.110 
a really tiny little short comparison of
course<00:02:30.750> this<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.320> not<00:02:31.350> waterproof<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.790> LG

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
course this is not waterproof and the LG

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
course this is not waterproof and the LG
