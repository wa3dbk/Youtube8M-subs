millimeter head bolt on this engine and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.380 
millimeter head bolt on this engine and
what<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.189> doing<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.640> we're<00:00:32.820> actually<00:00:32.910> going

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
to open it up for seven sixteenths

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.830 
to open it up for seven sixteenths
fourteen<00:00:36.719> head<00:00:37.410> bolts<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.390> the<00:00:39.390> nice<00:00:39.570> part

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
fourteen head bolts and the nice part

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.690 
fourteen head bolts and the nice part
about<00:00:39.899> this<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> fact<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.460> stock

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
about this is the fact that the stock

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.060 
about this is the fact that the stock
bolt<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.780> torques<00:00:43.200> down<00:00:43.379> about<00:00:43.559> thirty-five

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
bolt it torques down about thirty-five

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.150 
bolt it torques down about thirty-five
thirty-six<00:00:44.430> foot<00:00:44.820> pounds<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.469> seven

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
thirty-six foot pounds but the seven

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.529 
thirty-six foot pounds but the seven
sixteenths<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:47.789> actually<00:00:48.059> torque<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.420> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
sixteenths will actually torque down to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.290 
sixteenths will actually torque down to
65<00:00:49.079> foot-pounds<00:00:49.579> now<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.760> engine<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.180> going

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
65 foot-pounds now this engine is going

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.139 
65 foot-pounds now this engine is going
to<00:00:51.420> be<00:00:51.600> subjected<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.829> turbo<00:00:53.280> we<00:00:53.520> believe<00:00:53.879> so

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
to be subjected to a turbo we believe so

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.910 
to be subjected to a turbo we believe so
we<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> make<00:00:55.140> sure<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.710> blow

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
we want to make sure that we don't blow

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
we want to make sure that we don't blow

these nice larger bolts we'll be able to

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.979 
these nice larger bolts we'll be able to
torque<00:02:07.979> this<00:02:08.160> down<00:02:08.750> substantially<00:02:09.750> more<00:02:09.929> than
