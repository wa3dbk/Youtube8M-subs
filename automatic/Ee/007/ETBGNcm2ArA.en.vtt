00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
hey guys so today I'm going to be

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.100 
hey guys so today I'm going to be
talking<00:00:11.860> about<00:00:12.070> magic<00:00:12.700> origins<00:00:13.330> and<00:00:13.690> magic

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
talking about magic origins and magic

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.400 
talking about magic origins and magic
origins<00:00:14.559> as<00:00:14.740> it<00:00:15.639> relates<00:00:15.969> to<00:00:16.110> what<00:00:17.110> type<00:00:17.380> of

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
origins as it relates to what type of

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.620 
origins as it relates to what type of
mana<00:00:18.250> base<00:00:18.520> will<00:00:18.820> be<00:00:18.849> in<00:00:18.970> there<00:00:19.150> I'm<00:00:19.330> just

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
mana base will be in there I'm just

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.660 
mana base will be in there I'm just
going<00:00:19.750> to<00:00:19.779> make<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.170> crazy<00:00:20.710> prediction<00:00:21.640> that

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:21.670 
going to make the crazy prediction that

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.880 
going to make the crazy prediction that
the<00:00:21.910> mana<00:00:22.330> base<00:00:22.570> will<00:00:22.869> be<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.200> filter<00:00:23.680> lands

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
the mana base will be the filter lands

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.639 
the mana base will be the filter lands
here's<00:00:24.730> my<00:00:24.820> reasoning<00:00:25.419> on<00:00:25.570> filter<00:00:26.079> lanes<00:00:26.349> I

00:00:26.639 --> 00:00:26.649 
here's my reasoning on filter lanes I

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:28.589 
here's my reasoning on filter lanes I
don't<00:00:27.399> feel<00:00:27.550> like<00:00:27.700> it<00:00:27.849> will<00:00:27.939> be<00:00:28.000> designed<00:00:28.509> a

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
don't feel like it will be designed a

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.749 
don't feel like it will be designed a
car<00:00:28.810> fest<00:00:29.050> land<00:00:29.290> first<00:00:29.800> of<00:00:29.919> all<00:00:30.009> I<00:00:30.250> feel<00:00:30.640> like

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
car fest land first of all I feel like

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.120 
car fest land first of all I feel like
it<00:00:30.970> won't<00:00:31.149> be<00:00:31.419> a<00:00:32.340> manner<00:00:33.340> base<00:00:33.730> in<00:00:34.980> magic<00:00:35.980> or

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
it won't be a manner base in magic or

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.220 
it won't be a manner base in magic or
James<00:00:36.399> how<00:00:36.700> can<00:00:36.970> there<00:00:37.120> not<00:00:37.149> be<00:00:37.329> where<00:00:37.809> magic

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
James how can there not be where magic

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.790 
James how can there not be where magic
origins<00:00:38.620> is<00:00:38.890> pretty<00:00:39.190> much<00:00:39.430> i<00:00:40.440> mean<00:00:41.440> when<00:00:41.590> i<00:00:41.620> hit

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
origins is pretty much i mean when i hit

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.820 
origins is pretty much i mean when i hit
magic<00:00:42.250> origins<00:00:42.640> you<00:00:43.540> got<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.840> dual<00:00:44.020> lands<00:00:44.380> and

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
magic origins you got the dual lands and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.230 
magic origins you got the dual lands and
no<00:00:45.400> corset<00:00:46.030> has<00:00:46.300> always<00:00:46.780> had<00:00:47.080> lands<00:00:47.680> in<00:00:48.070> it

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
no corset has always had lands in it

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.880 
no corset has always had lands in it
sometimes<00:00:49.240> it's<00:00:49.480> had<00:00:49.690> 10<00:00:49.990> sometimes<00:00:50.620> it's

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
sometimes it's had 10 sometimes it's

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.310 
sometimes it's had 10 sometimes it's
high<00:00:51.100> five<00:00:51.400> but<00:00:52.180> it's<00:00:52.330> always<00:00:52.660> kind<00:00:53.020> of<00:00:53.110> had

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
high five but it's always kind of had

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.850 
high five but it's always kind of had
lambs<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:54.070> it<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:55.290> it<00:00:56.290> would<00:00:56.470> be<00:00:56.500> very

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
lambs in it and it would be very

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.810 
lambs in it and it would be very
surprising<00:00:57.340> if<00:00:57.670> somehow<00:00:58.000> it<00:00:58.660> did<00:00:58.900> not<00:00:59.110> right

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
surprising if somehow it did not right

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.569 
surprising if somehow it did not right
so<00:01:00.820> what<00:01:01.090> set<00:01:01.450> are<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:01.660> looking<00:01:02.140> at<00:01:02.579> shock

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
so what set are you looking at shock

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.910 
so what set are you looking at shock
lands<00:01:03.850> way<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.420> recent<00:01:05.049> of<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.229> reprint<00:01:05.650> for

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
lands way to recent of a reprint for

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.719 
lands way to recent of a reprint for
them<00:01:06.040> to<00:01:06.250> make<00:01:06.490> in<00:01:06.670> core<00:01:07.590> 2016<00:01:08.590> or<00:01:08.829> magic

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
them to make in core 2016 or magic

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.300 
them to make in core 2016 or magic
origins<00:01:10.149> so<00:01:10.659> you<00:01:10.720> can<00:01:10.930> cross<00:01:11.140> them<00:01:11.350> out<00:01:11.500> these

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
origins so you can cross them out these

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.520 
origins so you can cross them out these
any<00:01:12.610> Corvettes<00:01:13.180> lanes<00:01:13.420> I<00:01:13.600> feel<00:01:13.870> like<00:01:14.080> they<00:01:14.320> are

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
any Corvettes lanes I feel like they are

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.200 
any Corvettes lanes I feel like they are
not<00:01:15.070> really<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.030> mean<00:01:16.450> yeah<00:01:17.409> maybe<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.610> could<00:01:18.970> see

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
not really I mean yeah maybe I could see

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.899 
not really I mean yeah maybe I could see
it<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.600> can't<00:01:19.930> no<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:20.620> can't<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.340> being<00:01:21.700> in

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
it but I can't no I can't see being in

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.090 
it but I can't no I can't see being in
corset<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.570> then<00:01:22.870> being<00:01:23.110> in<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.350> block<00:01:23.710> half

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
corset and then being in a block half

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.120 
corset and then being in a block half
half<00:01:25.110> but<00:01:26.110> that's<00:01:26.229> kind<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.470> what's<00:01:26.710> going<00:01:26.979> to

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
half but that's kind of what's going to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.710 
half but that's kind of what's going to
happen<00:01:27.430> if<00:01:27.549> they're<00:01:27.790> in<00:01:27.909> modern<00:01:28.270> masters

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
happen if they're in modern masters

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.899 
happen if they're in modern masters
which<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.440> also<00:01:29.650> why<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:29.979> feel<00:01:30.280> like<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.610> will<00:01:30.700> be

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
which is also why I feel like it will be

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.820 
which is also why I feel like it will be
in<00:01:31.150> dragons<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.750> tar<00:01:31.990> care<00:01:32.229> because<00:01:32.620> that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
in dragons of tar care because that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.770 
in dragons of tar care because that
doesn't<00:01:33.010> make<00:01:33.159> sense<00:01:33.220> either<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:34.030> split<00:01:34.510> them

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
doesn't make sense either to split them

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.310 
doesn't make sense either to split them
across<00:01:35.740> different<00:01:36.340> products<00:01:36.850> like<00:01:37.659> that<00:01:38.020> when

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
across different products like that when

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.830 
across different products like that when
they<00:01:38.470> already<00:01:38.890> said<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.549> mean<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.270> they<00:01:40.420> imagine

they already said I mean as they imagine
