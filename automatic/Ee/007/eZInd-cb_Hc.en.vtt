think<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> happy<00:01:49.170> mins<00:01:49.350> he<00:01:49.470> has<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.799> be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
think the happy mins he has to be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
think the happy mins he has to be
quicker<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.549> opening<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.360> toes<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.899> VIN

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
quicker on opening up on toes and VIN

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.300 
quicker on opening up on toes and VIN
ruki<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.380> think<00:01:52.560> they<00:01:52.619> need<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.860> play<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.130> same

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
ruki I think they need to play the same

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.120 
ruki I think they need to play the same
game<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.850> speed<00:01:54.090> right<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.930> let<00:01:55.409> sort<00:01:56.009> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
game of speed right and let sort of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.840 
game of speed right and let sort of
defend<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.579> himself<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.210> solder<00:01:57.659> I

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
defend for himself and I think solder I

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.310 
defend for himself and I think solder I
mean<00:01:59.850> paying<00:02:00.090> suppression<00:02:00.600> versus<00:02:01.049> nature

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
mean paying suppression versus nature

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.690 
mean paying suppression versus nature
swiftness<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.070> armor<00:02:02.850> buffs<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:05.610> know

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
swiftness and armor buffs I I don't know

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
swiftness and armor buffs I I don't know
I<00:02:05.729> personally<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.840> maybe<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
I personally think that maybe the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.930 
I personally think that maybe the
priests<00:02:07.439> might<00:02:07.649> have<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.729> first

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
priests might have it for that first

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.020 
priests might have it for that first
instance<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.780> maybe<00:02:10.440> gge<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.550> need<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.760> open

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
instance so maybe gge you need to open

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.300 
instance so maybe gge you need to open
up<00:02:12.090> on<00:02:12.270> somebody<00:02:12.690> reals

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
up on somebody reals

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.000 
up on somebody reals
lock<00:02:14.580> him<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.900> keep<00:02:15.900> solder<00:02:16.200> alive<00:02:16.560> burn<00:02:16.980> a

lock him down keep solder alive burn a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.500 
lock him down keep solder alive burn a
pain<00:02:17.280> suppression<00:02:17.760> then<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> switch

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
pain suppression then get the switch

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.839 
pain suppression then get the switch
with<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:18.720> palm<00:02:18.989> but<00:02:19.920> certainly<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.819> know
