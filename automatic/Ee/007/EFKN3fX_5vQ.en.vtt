00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
reason chrome is faster is just because

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.740 
reason chrome is faster is just because
google's<00:03:19.590> done<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.800> better<00:03:19.980> job<00:03:20.099> of<00:03:20.310> optimizing

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
google's done a better job of optimizing

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.070 
google's done a better job of optimizing
rendering<00:03:21.750> speeds<00:03:22.080> and<00:03:22.319> things<00:03:22.500> like<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:23.030> so

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
rendering speeds and things like that so

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.479 
rendering speeds and things like that so
downloading<00:03:25.080> google<00:03:25.200> chrome<00:03:25.650> is<00:03:25.920> complete

downloading google chrome is complete

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.149 
downloading google chrome is complete

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:29.159 
and so at this point it's going to jump

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.350 
and so at this point it's going to jump
straight<00:03:29.400> into<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.670> installation

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
straight into the installation

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.229 
straight into the installation
installing<00:03:31.290> google<00:03:31.590> chrome<00:03:31.909> see<00:03:32.909> how<00:03:33.030> easy

will probably go faster or slower than

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.550 
will probably go faster or slower than
as<00:03:42.120> it<00:03:42.239> just<00:03:42.330> depends<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.810> your<00:03:42.870> system<00:03:43.349> so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
