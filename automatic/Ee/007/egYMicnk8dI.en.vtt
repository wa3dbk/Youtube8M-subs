00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.910 
some other genius had different type of
prints<00:01:47.120> that<00:01:47.210> I<00:01:47.330> just<00:01:47.570> didn't<00:01:47.840> want<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.590> carry

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
prints that I just didn't want to carry

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.530 
prints that I just didn't want to carry
into<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.490> full<00:01:49.820> width<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.240> would<00:01:50.360> have<00:01:50.450> been

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
into the full width it would have been

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.870 
into the full width it would have been
great<00:01:50.750> for<00:01:51.020> just<00:01:51.230> the<00:01:51.380> summer<00:01:51.650> so<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.340> just<00:01:52.700> got

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
great for just the summer so I just got

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.610 
great for just the summer so I just got
these<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.600> transition<00:01:54.080> into<00:01:54.470> the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
these is that the transition into the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.580 
these is that the transition into the
forwards<00:01:55.160> ok<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.090> I'm<00:01:56.330> yeah<00:01:56.780> let's<00:01:57.170> get<00:01:57.380> into

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
forwards ok so I'm yeah let's get into

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.370 
forwards ok so I'm yeah let's get into
the<00:01:57.830> items<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.280> I<00:01:58.400> got<00:01:58.780> you<00:01:59.780> get<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> receipt

and it basically shows you each item

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.830 
and it basically shows you each item
that<00:02:03.740> controls<00:02:04.190> how<00:02:04.460> much<00:02:04.670> they<00:02:05.090> are<00:02:05.330> in<00:02:05.660> the
