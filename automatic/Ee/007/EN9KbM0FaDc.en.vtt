is to him I see all this plan out and I

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.990 
is to him I see all this plan out and I
view<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.320> as<00:03:45.530> the<00:03:45.560> rock<00:03:45.950> just<00:03:46.220> responding<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:46.940> a

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
bunch of schoolyard style insults that

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.830 
bunch of schoolyard style insults that
seem<00:03:49.070> pretty<00:03:49.280> silly<00:03:49.610> to<00:03:49.760> him<00:03:49.940> while<00:03:50.450> Cena's

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
seem pretty silly to him while Cena's

seem pretty silly to him while Cena's
coming<00:03:51.110> off<00:03:51.200> more<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:51.560> a<00:03:51.590> petulant<00:03:51.890> child

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
coming off more like a petulant child

who got jilted by his man crush and then

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.680 
who got jilted by his man crush and then
there's<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.400> issue<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:56.000> rocks<00:03:56.299> sort<00:03:56.600> of

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
there's the issue of the rocks sort of

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.479 
there's the issue of the rocks sort of
seeming<00:03:56.959> like<00:03:57.049> a<00:03:57.110> hypocrite<00:03:57.440> because<00:03:57.950> he<00:03:58.310> says

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
seeming like a hypocrite because he says

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.520 
seeming like a hypocrite because he says
he<00:03:58.640> loves<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:58.970> WWE<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.900> yet<00:03:59.989> he<00:04:00.110> won't<00:04:00.290> stick

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
he loves that WWE and yet he won't stick

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.500 
he loves that WWE and yet he won't stick
around<00:04:00.830> he<00:04:01.160> says<00:04:01.400> he'll<00:04:01.580> never<00:04:01.610> leave<00:04:02.090> and

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
around he says he'll never leave and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.720 
around he says he'll never leave and
then<00:04:02.630> he<00:04:02.840> leaves<00:04:03.140> well<00:04:03.650> if<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.400> take<00:04:04.580> him

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
then he leaves well if you take him

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.340 
then he leaves well if you take him
literally<00:04:05.239> when<00:04:05.480> he<00:04:05.570> obviously<00:04:05.930> isn't

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
literally when he obviously isn't

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.320 
literally when he obviously isn't
speaking<00:04:06.739> literally<00:04:07.220> then<00:04:07.850> he<00:04:07.940> might<00:04:08.090> seem

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
speaking literally then he might seem

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.270 
speaking literally then he might seem
like<00:04:08.450> kind<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.690> a<00:04:08.780> hypocrite<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.410> get<00:04:09.650> that<00:04:09.830> but

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
like kind of a hypocrite I get that but

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.560 
like kind of a hypocrite I get that but
I<00:04:10.340> never<00:04:10.519> took<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.880> that<00:04:10.970> way<00:04:11.030> in<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.330> first

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
I never took it that way in the first

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.750 
I never took it that way in the first
place<00:04:11.720> and<00:04:12.080> as<00:04:12.500> for<00:04:12.680> why<00:04:12.860> the<00:04:12.920> rock<00:04:13.220> won't<00:04:13.519> stay

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.910 
place and as for why the rock won't stay
in<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:13.940> WWE<00:04:14.510> if<00:04:14.630> he<00:04:14.720> claims<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:15.110> love<00:04:15.260> at<00:04:15.440> WWE

in the WWE if he claims to love at WWE
so<00:04:16.220> much<00:04:17.530> probably<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.709> same<00:04:18.799> reason<00:04:19.040> why

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
so much probably for the same reason why

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.159
