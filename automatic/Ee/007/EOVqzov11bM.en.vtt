00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.700
 hello friends in this video I want 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.030
 share with you what is the type of 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.360
 sponge that has worked for me and the 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.510
 that I like more good look I buy 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.690
 this type of sponge comes like this and I already 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.070
 they split it in half so that 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.640
 there are two and 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.670
 to one he left it completely as well as the 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.520
 cut and the other you round is in 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:36.280
 the corners since at the time that a 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.950
 Sometimes I apply it I like more how it is 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.530
 this brand is this brand sponge is 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.199
 a health I really like the kind of 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.510
 sponge because it is very finite and apart it 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:48.809
 works very well at the time it applies 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.720
 one the skin is perfectly 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.410
 blurred what is the painting and good 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:01:00.260
 Well, this one is a brand I do not remember 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:04.739
 if you are or of the mont effects 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.800
 and well, the truth is I do not like it 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.450
 a lot because this is the high density 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:15.079
 and bring many chicks 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.049
 and I feel like he spends a lot of paint and 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.689
 so that brings to the time that you 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.300
 apply one as there is a little 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.450
 lined 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.180
 the painting then really this does not 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.890
 I liked it very much 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.560
 I have seen that many occupy it and 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.350
 it looks good to me it has not worked and I 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.799
 I would recommend them better to buy this 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.960
 who sell where they will buy their 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.119
 paintings right there 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.390
 there are some kits that even bring the 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.050
 sample of your sponge 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.770
 well we also use this kind of 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.369
 sponges they sell in the at any 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.710
 art shop sell these that also 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.790
 they are very practical especially to do 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.940
 designs of some when we're going to do 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.470
 some face or some center of some 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.209
 of some time and also deals 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.350
 I'm pretty much recommend them too 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:17.140
 and this one comes with an equal sponge 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.460
 similar to the texture of this from which 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.680
 I tell them that I like it 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.680
 and good are these other 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.909
 these 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.060
 to this I round you up what is this 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.010
 and good part because there are those who 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.659
 they fit very well to work with this 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.409
 Instead of using the brush they use 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.170
 this to work with this kind of 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:47.200
 painting 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.310
 with this type of split text because it comes 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.670
 of just the right size and well 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.220
 I prefer to use the brush but 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.260
 sometimes if it is common comfortable 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.660
 use is for example when you are going to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.330
 paint what is the spire land 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:09.320
 paint it white and it's easier than 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.620
 using it is easier with this 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.990
 with the good sponge and also sometimes 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.350
 we can use this kind of 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.900
 applicators this I bought it where 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.390
 they sell beauty cosmetics the 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.320
 sponge I do not know if it is to apply 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:30.230
 shadow or makeup but good this me 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:33.050
 I occupy it quite and it is very practical for us 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.030
 to apply as I told them what 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.340
 are the designs of the spiderman and nothing 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 more you 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.590
 I put the white paint and with this 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.040
 quickly because it is what the 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.920
 design or even to make them the design 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.450
 of the bunny as this form brings 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.120
 rounded up and nothing else we do 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.190
 well or this part like this and we have left 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.400
 the way and then it's much faster 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.959
 we only do so like this and so to the 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.250
 children, they like them more and more 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.390
 all to the little ones because they do not 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.170
 It bothers so much that we are 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.940
 touching the face and it's much faster 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.269
 that's how good it is because these are the 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.680
 three types of sponges that I 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:22.330
 I would recommend these in this also and 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.730
 Well this as a matter of that 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.540
 you try to see if it works 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:31.060
 possibly yes and well, I hope this 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.310
 video has served them give them an idea and 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.460
 see you in the next tutorial up 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.460
 then
