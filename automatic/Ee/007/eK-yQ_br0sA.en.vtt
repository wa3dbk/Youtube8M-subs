the paper which is what most of us this
is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:16.680> most<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.189> us<00:01:17.369> right<00:01:17.640> Oh

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
is the way most of us right Oh

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.810 
is the way most of us right Oh
in<00:01:19.970> the<00:01:21.770> 19th<00:01:22.770> century<00:01:24.710> they<00:01:25.710> held<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.369> pencil

in the 19th century they held the pencil

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.380 
in the 19th century they held the pencil
pretty<00:01:27.180> much<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> same<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.770> only<00:01:29.060> these<00:01:30.060> two

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
pretty much the same but only these two

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.300 
pretty much the same but only these two
fingers<00:01:30.689> were<00:01:31.140> allowed<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.500> write<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
fingers were allowed to write on the

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.359 
fingers were allowed to write on the
paper<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> had<00:01:33.960> whole<00:01:34.229> arm<00:01:34.650> movement<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
paper so you had whole arm movement and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.060 
paper so you had whole arm movement and
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.850> see<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.140> would<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.710> easy

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
you can see that it would be very easy

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.660 
you can see that it would be very easy
to<00:01:38.490> follow<00:01:39.170> those<00:01:40.170> ease<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:41.100> whole<00:01:41.340> arm

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
to follow those ease with whole arm

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.870 
to follow those ease with whole arm
movement<00:01:42.320> not<00:01:43.320> so<00:01:43.619> easy<00:01:43.860> when<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.430> down<00:01:44.640> like

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
movement not so easy when it's down like

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.359 
movement not so easy when it's down like
that<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.540> what<00:01:45.750> happens<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.979> you're

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
