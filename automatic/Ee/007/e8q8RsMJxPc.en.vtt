00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.690
This is a story about skydiving. You'll find
out how to do casual introductions, what it

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.260
means to say 'same here' and what sort of
weather 'comes in'.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.520
Today we are going for the skydiving thing.
I'm not sure I will jump, you know.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.050
I can't jump couple of stairs and now I'll
be jumping from 10,000 feet high.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:44.110
Oh my God. With no rope at all and a person
tied to me.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:54.960
That is going to be a good experience and
I don't know. I don't know.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:03.390
She says, "I will jump" and "I'll be jumping".
They mean the same thing - she will jump in

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:16.469
the future.

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:23.460
Notice that if you use 'be', you must use
the -ing form - will be jumping.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.280
Will jump, will be jumping. Listen again:

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.939
I'm not sure I will jump, you know. I can't
jump couple of stairs and now I'll be jumping

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.659
from 10,000 feet high.

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.729
When Preeti meets the man who will jump with
her, they introduce themselves casually, like

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:43.729
this:

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.679
Preeti is it. Yes, it is. I'm Adam. How you
going? Nice to meet you. I'm good. Same here.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.460
Preeti replies to 'nice to meet you' with
'same here'.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.474
Preeti is it? I'm Adam. How you going? Nice
to meet you. I'm good. Same here.

00:01:56.474 --> 00:02:04.900
You say 'same here' to agree.
In this exchange, 'same here' means 'nice

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.229
to meet you'.

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.539
Now listen to Adam explaining some things
about the dive.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.660
Now, we'll freefall for about 35 seconds.
Yes. And then I'll open the parachute. Okay.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.391
Now, I can't talk to you in freefall. We'll
be doing about 200 kilometres an hour. Alright,

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.720
so it's a bit noisy. Yes. So the only signals
you're going to get in freefall is a tap on

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.580
the shoulders, bring your arms out.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.350
He uses the word 'now' to emphasise that what
he is saying is important:

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.300
Now, we'll freefall for about 35 seconds.
Now, I can't talk to you in freefall. We'll

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.800
be doing about 200 kilometres an hour.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.800
So what can go wrong?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:56.110
Weather came in on us because there's a front
coming through. It's got lightning in it and

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.590
the cloud has come over and we're not allowed
to jump through cloud. So it's not safe so

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.920
we're bringing them back down.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.660
The weather can 'come in'. Weather that 'comes
in' is usually a storm.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.690
What do you say when storm clouds go away?

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.430
What happens now? Well, we can wait for the
weather. We'll probably go on a weather hold

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.780
now and wait until the weather clears.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:30.350
Wait until the weather clears. Clouds 'come
over' or 'come in' and then they 'clear'.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.090
So what happens when they clear?

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.040
It's too high, very, very high.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.650
Where's he?

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:52.180
He's gone. Oh my God.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.150
He's gone. Notice that he uses the past participle
of go, gone.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:09.140
Where's he?
He's gone. Oh my God.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:18.910
You use past participles such as gone with
'he's', which is a contraction of 'he is'

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.280
or 'he has'.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.531
We'll finish by finding out if Preeti will
jump or will be jumping:

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:34.450
Ready to go? Yes. Alright, a big smile for
the camera. No! Alright.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.180
It was just fraction of some seconds. He says,
"Put your left leg out," and I thought, "I'm

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.220
not prepared. No way leg out." And first thought,
I intend to stop myself and then I pushed

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:54.030
myself out so that I can jump.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:38.290
Oh my God! How was that Preeti? That was fantastic!
That 's good!
