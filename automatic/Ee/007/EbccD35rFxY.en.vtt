00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.010
 takeoff of a surveillance airplane 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.799
 in the natural park of located in nepal 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:17.750
 in this area of â€‹â€‹a thousand square kilometers 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.900
 live unique animals like tigers of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.179
 Bengal and rhino both species 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.449
 they are very threatened and in the sight of 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.449
 furtive 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 with the help of drones the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.109
 park caretakers want to monitor 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.109
 better the region 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.089
 with the help of drones we can detect 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.960
 suspicious activities on land and 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:41.960
 act immediately 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.840
 the drone and it incorporates a camera that makes 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.700
 photos and record videos since 2012 the 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.790
 world fund organization for 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.710
 Nature uses drones in Nepal 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.950
 park guards can control 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.450
 the device in a radius of 25 km 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.450
 that also has a preventive effect 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.360
 single 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.790
 the poachers are always ahead of us 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.480
 step and that's why operative is not enough 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.200
 conventional as patrols in addition 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:27.640
 the use of modern technologies 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.640
 I should intimidate them a little 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.380
 after the mission back to the base in 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.450
 its dependencies the foresters can 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.450
 directly evaluate the images 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.670
 after the drone landing we extract the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 chip and we upload the photos and videos in 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.300
 our computer 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.490
 if we detect irregular activities 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.490
 We send a patrol immediately 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.310
 and modern technology is successful in the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 after four years the population of 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:13.489
 tigers has grown by more than 60 per 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.489
 hundred of 121 to almost 200 copies 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.500
 opina links roars like the tiger that 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.500
 you are inside
