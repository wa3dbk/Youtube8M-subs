00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
first time which I'm not crazy about I

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.440 
first time which I'm not crazy about I
prefer<00:00:40.400> the<00:00:40.550> idea<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.970> they<00:00:41.060> don't<00:00:41.210> fight

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.450 
prefer the idea that they don't fight

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.230 
prefer the idea that they don't fight
until<00:00:41.750> a<00:00:41.780> Cloud<00:00:41.990> City<00:00:42.290> but<00:00:43.130> I<00:00:43.340> do<00:00:43.520> like<00:00:43.940> Vader

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.240 
until a Cloud City but I do like Vader

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.660 
until a Cloud City but I do like Vader
recognizing<00:00:44.990> his<00:00:45.080> old<00:00:45.260> lightsaber<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:45.950> see

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
recognizing his old lightsaber and see

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.040 
recognizing his old lightsaber and see
him<00:00:46.790> kind<00:00:47.060> of<00:00:47.180> start<00:00:47.450> to<00:00:47.540> put<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.840> pieces

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
him kind of start to put the pieces

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.340 
him kind of start to put the pieces
together<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:50.360> segues<00:00:50.780> perfectly<00:00:51.200> into

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
together and that segues perfectly into

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.500 
together and that segues perfectly into
Darth<00:00:51.500> Vader<00:00:51.710> number<00:00:51.980> one<00:00:52.190> as<00:00:52.430> he<00:00:52.970> continues

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
Darth Vader number one as he continues

his<00:00:53.540> investigation<00:00:54.400> we<00:00:55.400> also<00:00:55.550> get<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.850> kind<00:00:56.120> of

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
his investigation we also get to kind of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.790 
his investigation we also get to kind of
see<00:00:56.240> where<00:00:56.510> Vader<00:00:56.660> falls<00:00:57.020> into<00:00:57.290> imperial

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
see where Vader falls into imperial

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.100 
see where Vader falls into imperial
hierarchy<00:00:58.390> this<00:00:59.390> is<00:00:59.540> an<00:00:59.660> idea<00:00:59.900> that's

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
hierarchy this is an idea that's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.990 
hierarchy this is an idea that's
explored<00:01:00.470> in<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.650> Tarkin<00:01:01.010> novel<00:01:01.340> but<00:01:01.850> it's

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
explored in the Tarkin novel but it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.700 
explored in the Tarkin novel but it's
pretty<00:01:02.180> clear<00:01:02.420> that<00:01:02.450> Vader<00:01:02.750> is<00:01:02.960> more<00:01:03.200> an<00:01:03.530> agent

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
pretty clear that Vader is more an agent

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.770 
pretty clear that Vader is more an agent
of<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.189> Emperor<00:01:04.519> rather<00:01:05.059> than<00:01:05.299> just<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.539> member

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
of the Emperor rather than just a member

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.870 
of the Emperor rather than just a member
of<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.960> military<00:01:06.140> at<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:06.649> moment<00:01:06.950> issue
