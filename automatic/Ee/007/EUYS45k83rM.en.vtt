 each time each society each individual 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.740
 live under different paradigms be 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.800
 conscious or not his vision of the world his 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.130
 thought his actions are governed according to 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.710
 the predominant paradigm the term 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.019
 paradigm indicates the concept of scheme 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.390
 formal organization and can be 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:32.930
 used as a synonym of theoretical framework 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.910
 or set of theories of course the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.100
 world of work has its own 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.420
 paradigms and they are changing to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.850
 as they change the modes of 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.850
 get organized and the theoretical frameworks that 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.560
 they are generally supported by management 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.290
 of human resources in the world of 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.390
 work has always been considered a 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.670
 transaction in which the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.130
 Legal concept of the relationship is 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.920
 say the salary consideration for 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.530
 services in the workplace all 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.900
 revolved around these ideas and judgments 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.700
 of value within this framework of ideas 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.710
 there was talk of schedule tasks 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.079
 description of functions framing 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.179
 categories this vision and mode of 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.189
 work is the one that still prevails in the 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.469
 Most companies but no longer 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.020
 effective or sustainable what changed 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.749
 it was the world itself that was modified 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.270
 it was the paradigm of society the 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:28.929
 modern and hyper-communicated societies 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.070
 much faster than their own leaders 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.770
 the incorporation of new generations 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.289
 to the workplace changes in the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.329
 consumer behavior the 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.880
 phenomenon of globalization and 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.369
 Relationships dynamics conform 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.829
 in milestones that signal the beginning of a 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.899
 new era we talk then about a 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.450
 liquid society a society of 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.799
 constant movement with diffuse limits 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.219
 it is a new volatile world 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.939
 unpredictable 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.369
 uncertain ambiguous complex for 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.349
 synthesize we could say that this 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.840
 new society since the end of the century 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:09.319
 past is characterized by the following 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.870
 phenomena globality speed e 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.440
 immediacy personalization versus 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:19.790
 massive interconnection search 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.549
 welfare diversity people as axis 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.810
 key and how the change of 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.840
 paradigm in the world of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.879
 organizations in recent years in the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 world of work we begin to listen 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.250
 every 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.849
 more often talk about links 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.400
 emotions feelings commitment 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:43.099
 happiness and of course the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.769
 excellent places to work for 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.080
 the organizations that meant reviewing 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.260
 its values the style and model of 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.879
 leadership its processes and consequently 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.530
 his strategy more and more companies 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:00.799
 they begin to differentiate themselves by their capital 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.019
 human being it became evident that each one 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.690
 of the members of the company is a 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.700
 talent that can give their best and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.049
 boost the overall results of the 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.569
 organization 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.030
 therefore, human capital is perceived 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.640
 as fundamental and correlated with 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.790
 issues like productivity the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.319
 customer satisfaction innovation and 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.260
 the important reduction of 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.329
 conflictivity the leaders of a 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.549
 organization are responsible for 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.260
 guide the ship in this paradigm of 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.780
 liquid society 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.329
 and here the leaders come into play 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.599
 the excellent places to work are 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.239
 different have different vision adapt 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.030
 better the times have 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.940
 less hierarchical leadership style more 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.650
 horizontal less driver based 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.560
 strongly in interactions of 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.000
 Trust understand organizations 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.280
 as a succession of projects 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.140
 individual connecting expectations 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.720
 individual with objectives of the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.670
 organization select people 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.010
 of the team thinking not so much in the 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.769
 technical knowledge but in sharing 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.989
 values ​​and beliefs in great place to 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.269
 work we work side by side with the 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.129
 leaders and their teams to favor the 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.480
 development of human capital and 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:17.810
 contribute to build a society 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.000
 better habitually the companies we 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.430
 They comment on their problems and ask us 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.280
 how do they do the best and is then 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.889
 when we reinforce the concept that no 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.080
 it's about emulating political practices or 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.440
 benefits but to capture the essence 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.000
 of how they do it 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.550
 it's about thinking your own 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.640
 organization as a whole where the 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.410
 links is the most important thing and from what 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.140
 way to strengthen them constructively 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.930
 so that the company grows in everything 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:50.740
 sense the human capital is transformed 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.380
 then in the largest of the capitals and 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.620
 that's why the best companies for 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.450
 work they get relevant results 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:01.750
 they create value and make theirs 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:03.690
 sustainable business values ​​every time 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.270
 more important for shareholders 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.520
 client investors society and by 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.400
 course for the collaborators themselves 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.710
 it is these organizations that mark 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.210
 the way they lead the change 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.940
 towards the construction of environments 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.970
 work exemplary thus generating a 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:24.100
 positive impact on society are 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.230
 these organizations the best 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.620
 adapt to the new paradigm and live 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:32.080
 also under one's own we are one of the 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.440
 better places to work in the 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.440
 world
