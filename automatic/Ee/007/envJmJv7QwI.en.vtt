00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.510 
ones I didn't even want to say how long
they<00:03:53.290> took<00:03:53.470> I<00:03:53.620> can't<00:03:53.830> remember<00:03:54.040> but<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.430> was

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.000 
they took I can't remember but it was
like<00:03:54.640> ridiculous<00:03:54.850> I<00:03:55.690> was<00:03:55.840> like<00:03:55.990> this<00:03:56.140> is<00:03:56.200> so

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
like ridiculous I was like this is so

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.090 
like ridiculous I was like this is so
crazy<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.210> I<00:03:58.810> am<00:03:58.990> still<00:03:59.350> doing<00:03:59.440> my<00:03:59.650> hair<00:03:59.920> and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.290 
crazy that I am still doing my hair and
it's<00:04:00.220> like<00:04:00.400> days<00:04:00.610> later<00:04:00.940> or<00:04:01.180> whatever<00:04:01.270> um<00:04:03.270> so<00:04:04.270> I

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
it's like days later or whatever um so I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.720 
it's like days later or whatever um so I
might<00:04:04.540> do<00:04:04.660> that<00:04:04.980> probably<00:04:05.980> not<00:04:06.160> probably<00:04:06.400> just

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
might do that probably not probably just

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.160 
might do that probably not probably just

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
doing them I should know when they are

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.940 
doing them I should know when they are

but it's going to be before my diaper
bursary<00:04:57.370> date<00:04:57.580> so<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:59.010> was<00:05:00.010> wondering<00:05:00.040> what<00:05:00.580> I

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
bursary date so I was wondering what I

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.850 
bursary date so I was wondering what I
should<00:05:00.700> do<00:05:01.090> should<00:05:01.660> i<00:05:01.750> pick<00:05:01.930> it<00:05:02.110> out<00:05:02.230> still<00:05:02.590> or

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
should do should i pick it out still or

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.010 
should do should i pick it out still or
should<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.160> just<00:05:03.190> leave<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:03.970> a<00:05:04.420> bantu<00:05:04.840> knot

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
should I just leave it and a bantu knot

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.840 
should I just leave it and a bantu knot
out<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.380> just<00:05:05.530> show<00:05:05.740> you<00:05:05.800> how<00:05:06.070> long<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.310> is<00:05:06.490> I

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
out and just show you how long it is I

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.790 
out and just show you how long it is I
think<00:05:07.180> I<00:05:07.300> should<00:05:07.360> do<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:08.230> band<00:05:08.470> tune<00:05:08.650> up

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
think I should do the band tune up

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.380 
think I should do the band tune up
because<00:05:09.010> bantu<00:05:09.370> knots<00:05:09.550> take<00:05:09.760> out<00:05:09.910> take

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
because bantu knots take out take

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.410 
because bantu knots take out take
forever<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:11.260> dry<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:11.980> I<00:05:12.040> don't<00:05:12.190> want<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.430> i<00:05:12.670> need

forever to dry so I don't want to i need

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.600 
forever to dry so I don't want to i need
to<00:05:13.840> make<00:05:14.050> sure<00:05:14.080> have<00:05:14.320> enough<00:05:14.530> time<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:14.830> dry<00:05:15.550> it

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
to you hopefully you guys have some good

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.220 
to you hopefully you guys have some good
ideas<00:05:27.370> but<00:05:27.880> probably<00:05:28.660> going<00:05:28.840> to<00:05:28.900> do<00:05:28.990> cornrows

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
ideas but probably going to do cornrows

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.310 
ideas but probably going to do cornrows
that's<00:05:29.680> going<00:05:29.860> to<00:05:29.950> be<00:05:30.010> the<00:05:30.130> easiest<00:05:31.320> solution

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
that's going to be the easiest solution
