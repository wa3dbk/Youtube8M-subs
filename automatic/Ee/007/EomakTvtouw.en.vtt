 a man was arrested this weekend 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.550
 here in blumenau after trying to steal a 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.610
 a woman's vehicle had 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.509
 involved in an accident and he gave a 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 very strange explanation for this fact 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.130
 is to follow the details here comes with 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.240
 people to watch the band on the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.060
 screen 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.340
 luiz eduardo schefer , 30, was 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 arrested in flagrante by military police 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.380
 accused of robbery according to police luiz 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.020
 was arrested while trying to steal a car 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.820
 on this street right here in the center of blumenau 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.980
 the owner would have been involved in a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.070
 traffic accident and when leaving the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.870
 vehicle the defendant tried to steal it for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.570
 luck he was then arrested by 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.800
 here in the region who witnessed the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.140
 the whole scene 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.780
 Luiz has already had several 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 police between them for theft and 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 body injury he confesses he tried 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.059
 remove the car from the place but according to him 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 the situation did not characterize a robbery 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.140
 I did not test the Turkish gold lady who 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600
 I believed that at that moment that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.729
 lady who was driving the vehicle 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 was not able to take the car in the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.090
 front of the cafe house and then you went there and 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 I took rather because I have worked very 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.960
 time vehicles and the only vehicle could 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.400
 have a problem in the inertia valve 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.950
 so that the trucker would not run 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 from the front where near the taxi she 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.930
 could leave there with the wording 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.520
 necessary to leave because it was 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.120
 totally unbalanced was 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.860
 dominated 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.020
 simone something like that but no 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.550
 it would be interesting to ask for authorization 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 for this lady to be able to 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.200
 her car maybe the text would have 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 as radio was not working and not 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.400
 I had to become a connection 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.660
 Good, I just took it because I 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.390
 wanted to show that in the city people 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.160
 they would be fine without any problems right? 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.690
 I got ahead and I left 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.280
 then for the police to take 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.860
 where I stayed that a rest time 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.410
 I'm talking to the people who do it. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.800
 part of our confraternity is this 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.130
 example units the inertia valve a 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.130
 woman
