00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 where we cook shrimp as well as 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.030

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.960

 dry your own garden and need 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:39.230
 3-4 garlic cloves of chopped garlic 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.910
 and on 1 it is similar to ice cream 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.040
 shrimp should not be small need 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.920
 at least medium but if there are large 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:52.860
 also good 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 Lenin is essentially earthenware so we 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.760
 pour so we pour a little bit 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:07.430
 olive oil cottage suddenly desirable 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.799
 olive oil will not taste otherwise 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.890
 the one that throws it privately 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.880
 I throw the door because you are very 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 acute 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 but you like what you like 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 the more you throw, too, now depended on 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.840
 pepper 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.400
 well it depends but people love and very 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.060
 hot then depends on pepper and throw 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.079
 dry 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.000
 This dry parsley's eye 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:41.490
 rush to want then we take a spoon 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.549
 a little bit we'll fry it all a little bit 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.950
 need to fry for what to olive 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.950
 Butter took the taste of garlic 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.490
 this dish is cooked very quickly 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.810
 delicious 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.030
 any hostess option is not this because 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 guests will come and if you want something from 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.810
 to pamper 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:15.530
 Here is this exotic and tasty quickly and 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:20.489
 with a minimum of the product is tastier than shrimp 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.680
 garlic will not create anything cells 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:27.030
 no need to defrost just 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:35.120
 rushes here and now we will 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:38.360
 Stir a little and stop here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:42.739
 let's wait for example when in principle 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.769
 the preparation of this dish is already finished 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.900
 boiled for 3 minutes as you see it 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.900
 boils pretty and on a big fire 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.569
 3-4 minutes you will see when it boils 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.269
 and here's a little bit 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.349
 see how the shrimp are ready because u 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.299
 he will become much smaller than the second 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.019
 after 34 minutes 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:13.590
 shrimp will always be ready to eat with 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:15.570
 drank bread in Spain with beer but you 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.350
 you can drink it m year but the most delicious 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:25.160
 beer and so our dish is ready for it this 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.160
 literally 10 minutes here
