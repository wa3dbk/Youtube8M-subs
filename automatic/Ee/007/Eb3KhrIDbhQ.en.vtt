main changes inside of course you have
the<00:03:10.200> new<00:03:10.350> processor<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.460> the<00:03:11.910> chips<00:03:12.240> well<00:03:12.690> I'm

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
the new processor the the chips well I'm

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.330 
the new processor the the chips well I'm
not<00:03:13.410> going<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.740> into<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.100> right<00:03:14.250> now

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
not going to get into that right now

not going to get into that right now
I'll<00:03:14.550> get<00:03:14.670> into<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:14.910> in<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.180> review<00:03:15.570> but<00:03:16.350> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
I'll get into that in the review but you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.050 
I'll get into that in the review but you
have<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.710> whole<00:03:17.070> bunch<00:03:17.370> of<00:03:17.520> stuff<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.880> there

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
have a whole bunch of stuff in there

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.720 
have a whole bunch of stuff in there
that<00:03:18.770> make<00:03:19.770> it<00:03:19.920> much<00:03:20.040> faster<00:03:20.250> than<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
that make it much faster than the

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.910 
that make it much faster than the
previous<00:03:20.910> generation<00:03:21.270> and<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> was<00:03:22.710> a<00:03:22.740> quick

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
previous generation and that was a quick

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.100 
previous generation and that was a quick
comparison<00:03:23.100> in<00:03:23.520> case<00:03:23.700> any<00:03:23.880> of<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.210> would<00:03:25.050> like
