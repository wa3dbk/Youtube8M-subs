00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
well so if I go right up to this I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.280 
well so if I go right up to this I
messed<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:32.040> line<00:01:32.460> myself<00:01:32.700> properly<00:01:33.450> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
messed up a line myself properly it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.749 
messed up a line myself properly it
isn't<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> easiest<00:01:34.799> thing<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.340> do<00:01:35.490> but<00:01:35.700> just

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
isn't the easiest thing to do but just

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
isn't the easiest thing to do but just
oh<00:01:37.549> forgot<00:01:38.549> about<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.820> guy<00:01:39.150> but<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> flea

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
oh forgot about that guy but a flea

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.610 
oh forgot about that guy but a flea
ignore<00:01:40.560> him

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
ignore him

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.710 
ignore him
and<00:01:41.710> go<00:01:41.890> right<00:01:42.280> there<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:43.210> can<00:01:43.360> just<00:01:43.510> jump

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
and go right there you can just jump

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.020 
and go right there you can just jump
through<00:01:43.960> that<00:01:44.140> wall<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.650> well<00:01:44.890> so<00:01:45.730> that's<00:01:45.790> all

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
through that wall as well so that's all

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.880 
through that wall as well so that's all
the<00:01:46.150> ones<00:01:46.330> in<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.630> blue<00:01:46.960> section<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.830> do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
the ones in the blue section I do

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.410 
the ones in the blue section I do
believe<00:01:48.340> I<00:01:48.520> think<00:01:48.760> there's<00:01:48.940> one<00:01:49.000> like<00:01:49.240> right

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
believe I think there's one like right

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.710 
believe I think there's one like right
there<00:01:49.630> but<00:01:49.960> it's<00:01:50.140> kind<00:01:50.320> of<00:01:50.350> pointless<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.820> here

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
there but it's kind of pointless so here

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.950 
there but it's kind of pointless so here
you<00:01:53.200> can<00:01:53.230> hop<00:01:53.710> right<00:01:54.310> through<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:55.090> just<00:01:55.870> like

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
you can hop right through this just like

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.190 
you can hop right through this just like
that<00:01:56.260> that<00:01:57.190> one<00:01:57.550> isn't<00:01:57.820> as<00:01:58.180> useful<00:01:58.420> as<00:01:58.660> most<00:01:59.020> of

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
that that one isn't as useful as most of

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.830 
that that one isn't as useful as most of
the<00:01:59.320> other<00:01:59.500> ones<00:01:59.770> but<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.340> still<00:02:00.640> helps<00:02:00.880> now

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the other ones but it still helps now

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.230 
the other ones but it still helps now
you<00:02:01.900> can<00:02:02.200> hop<00:02:02.440> here<00:02:02.890> but<00:02:03.550> I've<00:02:03.790> never<00:02:04.060> been

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240
