00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
Oscar De La Hoya I thought it was damn

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.950 
Oscar De La Hoya I thought it was damn
near<00:01:07.110> draw<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.860> my<00:01:08.100> opinion<00:01:08.400> if<00:01:08.640> not<00:01:09.540> Floyd

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
near draw in my opinion if not Floyd

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.590 
near draw in my opinion if not Floyd
maybe<00:01:10.260> one<00:01:10.590> by<00:01:10.770> one<00:01:11.070> or<00:01:11.220> two<00:01:11.400> rounds<00:01:11.850> very

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
maybe one by one or two rounds very

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.990 
maybe one by one or two rounds very
close<00:01:12.900> um<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.869> at<00:01:15.869> 154<00:01:16.740> Floyd<00:01:17.670> doesn't

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
close um I think at 154 Floyd doesn't

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.780 
close um I think at 154 Floyd doesn't
perform<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.630> well<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:19.280> 147<00:01:20.750> Miguel<00:01:21.750> Cotto<00:01:22.790> he

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
perform as well as 147 Miguel Cotto he

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.620 
perform as well as 147 Miguel Cotto he
performs<00:01:24.270> very<00:01:24.479> well<00:01:24.540> at<00:01:24.990> 154<00:01:26.210> when<00:01:27.210> he<00:01:27.360> fought

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
performs very well at 154 when he fought

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.260 
performs very well at 154 when he fought
paki<00:01:28.020> out<00:01:28.320> he<00:01:28.619> didn't<00:01:28.829> performed<00:01:29.280> too<00:01:29.400> well<00:01:29.579> he

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
paki out he didn't performed too well he

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.620 
paki out he didn't performed too well he
seemed<00:01:30.600> very<00:01:30.630> weight<00:01:31.110> drain<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.420> now<00:01:33.420> he's

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
seemed very weight drain and now he's

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
seemed very weight drain and now he's
fighting<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> weight<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.770> he's<00:01:35.009> more

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
fighting out of weight that he's more

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.710 
fighting out of weight that he's more
comfortable<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.090> that's<00:01:36.390> what's<00:01:36.570> going

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
comfortable I think that's what's going

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
comfortable I think that's what's going
to<00:01:36.810> make<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.470> competitive<00:01:37.979> fight

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to make this more of a competitive fight

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.660 
to make this more of a competitive fight
but<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.560> end<00:01:40.710> i<00:01:40.890> still<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.369> floyd

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
but in the end i still think floyd

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.950 
but in the end i still think floyd
mayweather<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> win<00:01:42.659> i<00:01:42.869> think<00:01:42.899> uh

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
mayweather is going to win i think uh

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.240 
mayweather is going to win i think uh
miguel<00:01:45.960> cotto<00:01:46.490> does<00:01:47.490> not<00:01:47.820> have<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> tools<00:01:48.810> to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
miguel cotto does not have the tools to

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.139 
miguel cotto does not have the tools to
beat<00:01:50.250> floyd<00:01:50.880> mayweather<00:01:51.290> um<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.460> he

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
beat floyd mayweather um I think he

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.670 
beat floyd mayweather um I think he
would<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> match<00:01:54.720> him<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.110> hand<00:01:55.380> speed

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
would have to match him for hand speed

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850 
would have to match him for hand speed
and<00:01:55.979> foot<00:01:56.460> speed<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.750> don't<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.320> Miguel

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and foot speed which I don't see Miguel

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
and foot speed which I don't see Miguel
Cotto<00:01:59.159> doing<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> another<00:02:00.540> thing<00:02:00.630> is<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:00.960> just

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
Cotto doing and another thing is I just

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.440 
Cotto doing and another thing is I just
don't<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.530> Miguel<00:02:01.920> Cotto<00:02:02.100> tech<00:02:02.549> technical

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
don't think Miguel Cotto tech technical

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.830 
don't think Miguel Cotto tech technical
enough<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:04.439> deconstruct<00:02:05.009> Floyd's<00:02:05.840> defense

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
enough to deconstruct Floyd's defense

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
enough to deconstruct Floyd's defense
and<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.920> what<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.910> beat

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
and that's what we have to do to beat

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.199 
and that's what we have to do to beat
Floyd<00:02:09.360> Mayweather<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.879> what<00:02:11.879> does<00:02:12.030> he<00:02:12.060> bring

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
Floyd Mayweather and what does he bring

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.730 
Floyd Mayweather and what does he bring
to<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.720> table

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to the table

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.820 
to the table
I<00:02:13.830> think<00:02:14.580> he's<00:02:14.700> going<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:14.940> put<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.270> good<00:02:15.510> show

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I think he's going to put on a good show

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.280 
I think he's going to put on a good show
but<00:02:16.830> besides<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.460> he<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:17.970> brings<00:02:18.750> money<00:02:19.080> to

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
but besides that he just brings money to

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.290 
but besides that he just brings money to
the<00:02:19.410> table<00:02:19.560> and<00:02:20.430> that's<00:02:20.640> how<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.820> think<00:02:21.150> this

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
the table and that's how I think this

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.180 
the table and that's how I think this
fight<00:02:21.540> is<00:02:21.660> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.050> let<00:02:22.830> me<00:02:22.860> know<00:02:22.980> what

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
fight is going to go let me know what

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.740 
fight is going to go let me know what
you<00:02:23.310> think<00:02:23.540> Floyd<00:02:24.540> Mayweather<00:02:24.990> by<00:02:25.230> decision
