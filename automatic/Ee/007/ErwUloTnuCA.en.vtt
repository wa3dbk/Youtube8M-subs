00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
properly you're going to mess it up now

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
properly you're going to mess it up now
why<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.170> need<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.859> into<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.190> door

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
why would you need to get into a door

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.520 
why would you need to get into a door
panel<00:00:59.670> well<00:01:00.510> let's<00:01:00.719> take<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> look<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.350> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
require door panel removal now the nice

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.819 
require door panel removal now the nice
thing<00:01:32.220> about<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.579> w210<00:01:33.240> chassis<00:01:33.810> is<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.650> is

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
thing about the w210 chassis is it is

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.850 
thing about the w210 chassis is it is
fairly<00:01:35.310> simple<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.229> front<00:01:37.560> door

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
fairly simple to do and the front door

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.719 
fairly simple to do and the front door
is<00:01:38.360> very<00:01:39.360> slim<00:01:39.780> similar<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> rear<00:01:40.829> door<00:01:41.100> so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
is very slim similar to the rear door so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.539 
is very slim similar to the rear door so
once<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.540> process<00:01:42.950> then<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.280> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
once you know the process then in the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.859 
once you know the process then in the
future<00:01:44.970> you'll<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.210> able<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> take<00:01:45.689> these

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
future you'll be able to take these

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.319 
future you'll be able to take these
doors<00:01:46.259> off<00:01:46.560> no<00:01:46.770> problem<00:01:47.030> so<00:01:48.030> what<00:01:48.210> I've

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
doors off no problem so what I've

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.880 
doors off no problem so what I've
decided<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.490> a<00:01:51.380> manual<00:01:52.380> instead

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
decided to do is to do a manual instead

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.960 
decided to do is to do a manual instead
of<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.070> video<00:01:53.189> I'm<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.939> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
of a video I'm going to do a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
of a video I'm going to do a
step-by-step<00:01:54.329> manual<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.320> when<00:01:55.500> you're

now look at this door panel here here's

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.220 
now look at this door panel here here's
an<00:02:16.950> example<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.390> front<00:02:18.660> panel<00:02:19.050> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
an example this is the front panel and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.890 
an example this is the front panel and
when<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.770> took<00:02:19.860> it<00:02:20.160> off<00:02:20.310> these<00:02:20.760> two<00:02:21.090> clip

when I took it off these two clip

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.380 
when I took it off these two clip
assemblies<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.560> fell<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.000> onto<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.120> ground
