00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
on the plane to say you're doing with a

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.020 
on the plane to say you're doing with a
plane<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.549> take<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
plane what you do is you take it out of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.630 
plane what you do is you take it out of
the<00:01:45.329> hangar<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.840> then<00:01:46.500> swap<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.369> another

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the hangar and then swap to another

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.039 
the hangar and then swap to another
player<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:48.210> swap<00:01:48.420> back<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.930> you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
player and then swap back and then you

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.600 
player and then swap back and then you
should<00:01:49.229> have<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.380> duplicate<00:01:49.590> same<00:01:50.460> with

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
should have a duplicate same with

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.749 
should have a duplicate same with
helicopters<00:01:51.360> with<00:01:51.600> fighter<00:01:51.810> jets<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.759> all

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
helicopters with fighter jets and all

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.120 
helicopters with fighter jets and all
them<00:01:54.000> kind<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> flying<00:01:54.840> vehicles<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> that's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
them kind of flying vehicles and that's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.260 
them kind of flying vehicles and that's
pretty<00:01:56.219> much<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> that's<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> have<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.119> do

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
pretty much it that's all you have to do

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
pretty much it that's all you have to do
so<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> only<00:01:58.020> difference<00:01:58.110> between<00:01:58.530> doing<00:01:58.920> it

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so the only difference between doing it

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
so the only difference between doing it
with<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> car<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.000> whether<00:02:00.229> with<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> plane<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
with a car and whether with a plane is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.350 
with a car and whether with a plane is
you<00:02:02.100> don't<00:02:02.219> have<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.700> out<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.180> vehicle

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
you don't have to get out of the vehicle

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.539 
you don't have to get out of the vehicle
so<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.110> take<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.070> plane<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.520> of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so you can just take the plane out of

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.819 
so you can just take the plane out of
the<00:02:05.729> hangar<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.329> swap<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:07.049> swap<00:02:07.350> back<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
the hangar then swap then swap back and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.889 
the hangar then swap then swap back and
that's<00:02:08.069> pretty<00:02:08.220> much<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.300> anyway<00:02:09.780> guys

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
