guys welcome back to versus math club

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.910 
guys welcome back to versus math club
this<00:00:02.250> topic<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.909> percent<00:00:03.510> problems<00:00:04.020> and<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
this topic is percent problems and the

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.440 
this topic is percent problems and the
types<00:00:05.130> of<00:00:05.250> percent<00:00:05.609> problems<00:00:05.819> are<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> to

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
types of percent problems are going to

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.419 
types of percent problems are going to
be<00:00:06.540> doing<00:00:06.690> today<00:00:06.899> are<00:00:07.020> finding<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> percent

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
be doing today are finding the percent

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.120 
be doing today are finding the percent
problems<00:00:09.000> and<00:00:09.240> so<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.469> these<00:00:10.679> types<00:00:10.980> of

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
problems and so in these types of

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
problems and so in these types of
present<00:00:11.759> problem<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.210> basically<00:00:12.420> going<00:00:12.840> to<00:00:12.929> be

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
present problem is basically going to be

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.770 
present problem is basically going to be
finding<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> percent<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.610> number<00:00:14.780> let's

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
finding the percent of a number let's

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:26.620 
finding the percent of a number let's
say<00:00:15.900> for<00:00:16.170> example<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:19.880> 22<00:00:21.619> percent<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:25.400> 45

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
say for example we have 22 percent of 45

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.140 
say for example we have 22 percent of 45
so<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.890> solve<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.010> percent<00:00:29.490> problem<00:00:29.880> first

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
so to solve this percent problem first

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.560 
so to solve this percent problem first
you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> convert<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.500> percent<00:00:32.099> which<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
you have to convert the percent which is

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.250 
you have to convert the percent which is
22<00:00:33.570> percent<00:00:33.860> into<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:35.210> fraction<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.840> know<00:00:36.989> that

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
22 percent into a fraction we know that

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
22 percent into a fraction we know that
a<00:00:37.290> percent<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.950> number<00:00:38.340> out<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.670> 100<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.660> to

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
a percent is a number out of 100 so to

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.319 
a percent is a number out of 100 so to
convert<00:00:40.440> 22<00:00:41.100> percent<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> fraction<00:00:41.640> all<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
convert 22 percent to a fraction all you

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.049 
convert 22 percent to a fraction all you
have<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.570> do<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.809> put<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.140> over<00:00:43.350> 100<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.610> 22

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
have to do is put it over 100 so 22

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.979 
have to do is put it over 100 so 22
percent<00:00:45.450> becomes<00:00:45.840> 22<00:00:46.559> over<00:00:47.160> 100<00:00:47.820> now<00:00:48.570> since

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
percent becomes 22 over 100 now since

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
percent becomes 22 over 100 now since
it's<00:00:49.230> going<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> person<00:00:50.010> proportion<00:00:50.969> we

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
it's going to be a person proportion we

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.560 
it's going to be a person proportion we
I'm<00:00:51.660> gonna<00:00:51.809> add<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> equal<00:00:52.680> sign<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.420> now

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
I'm gonna add a equal sign and so now

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.900 
I'm gonna add a equal sign and so now
there's<00:00:54.840> basically<00:00:55.590> going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.579> finding

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
there's basically going to be finding

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.900 
there's basically going to be finding
the<00:00:56.969> 22<00:00:57.899> percent<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> 45<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.399> we<00:00:59.520> don't<00:00:59.699> know

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the 22 percent of 45 so we don't know

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.119 
the 22 percent of 45 so we don't know
that<00:01:00.180> person<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.020> let<00:01:01.109> me<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.500> 45<00:01:01.949> is

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that person so let me know that 45 is

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.429 
that person so let me know that 45 is
going<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.550> be<00:01:02.699> our<00:01:02.910> denominator<00:01:03.570> for<00:01:04.350> our

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
going to be our denominator for our

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to be our denominator for our
other<00:01:04.559> fraction<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:06.060> percent<00:01:07.020> we<00:01:07.110> don't

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
other fraction and the percent we don't

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.810 
other fraction and the percent we don't
know<00:01:07.380> about<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> be<00:01:08.310> can<00:01:08.700> be

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
know about is going to be can be

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.270 
know about is going to be can be
represented<00:01:09.299> by<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.479> variable<00:01:09.750> 8<00:01:10.290> so<00:01:11.040> we<00:01:11.159> have

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
represented by the variable 8 so we have

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.480 
represented by the variable 8 so we have
a<00:01:11.460> over<00:01:12.119> 45<00:01:12.720> now<00:01:13.439> we're<00:01:13.619> going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.799> be<00:01:14.130> using

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
a over 45 now we're going to be using

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
a over 45 now we're going to be using
cross<00:01:14.880> multiplication<00:01:15.350> we're<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
cross multiplication we're going to be

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.010 
cross multiplication we're going to be
cross<00:01:16.920> multiplying<00:01:17.540> 100<00:01:18.540> I'm<00:01:18.659> in<00:01:18.900> 22<00:01:19.380> by<00:01:19.950> 45

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
cross multiplying 100 I'm in 22 by 45

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.850 
cross multiplying 100 I'm in 22 by 45
and<00:01:22.020> then<00:01:22.170> we're<00:01:22.380> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.650> cross

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
and then we're going to be cross

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.260 
and then we're going to be cross
multiplying<00:01:24.590> 100<00:01:25.590> by<00:01:26.280> 8<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:28.369> 100<00:01:29.369> times<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
multiplying 100 by 8 so 100 times a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.859 
multiplying 100 by 8 so 100 times a
gives<00:01:31.170> us<00:01:31.439> 100<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.530> that<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.560> equal<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.869> now

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
gives us 100 a and that is equal to now

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.969 
gives us 100 a and that is equal to now
we<00:01:36.900> multiply<00:01:37.640> 22<00:01:38.640> times<00:01:39.060> 45<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.899> multiplying

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
we multiply 22 times 45 so multiplying

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.960 
we multiply 22 times 45 so multiplying
22<00:01:43.979> times<00:01:45.470> 45<00:01:46.490> let's<00:01:47.490> go<00:01:47.700> ahead<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.030> that

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
22 times 45 let's go ahead and do that

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.649 
22 times 45 let's go ahead and do that
45<00:01:50.970> times<00:01:51.420> 22<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.560> 2<00:01:52.619> times<00:01:53.130> 5<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.670> 10<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.479> bring

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
45 times 22 so 2 times 5 is 10 we bring

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.050 
45 times 22 so 2 times 5 is 10 we bring
put<00:01:55.259> 0<00:01:55.560> down<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:55.799> bring<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.520> one<00:01:56.670> over<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
put 0 down here bring that one over and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.800 
put 0 down here bring that one over and
2<00:01:57.810> times<00:01:58.049> 4<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.320> 8<00:01:58.530> plus<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.490> one<00:01:59.820> gives<00:02:00.180> us<00:02:00.420> 9

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
2 times 4 is 8 plus that one gives us 9

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.160 
2 times 4 is 8 plus that one gives us 9
now<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.680> move<00:02:02.130> down<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.759> add<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> 0<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.540> again

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
now we move down so we add a 0 and again

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.340 
now we move down so we add a 0 and again
2<00:02:04.590> times<00:02:04.770> 5<00:02:05.100> is<00:02:05.369> 10<00:02:05.460> put<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.390> 0<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.960> bring

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
2 times 5 is 10 put that 0 here bring

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.919 
2 times 5 is 10 put that 0 here bring
that<00:02:07.560> one<00:02:07.799> over<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.340> 2<00:02:09.119> times<00:02:09.360> 4<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.629> 8<00:02:09.810> plus

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
that one over and 2 times 4 is 8 plus

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.220 
that one over and 2 times 4 is 8 plus
I'd<00:02:10.500> 1<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:11.009> 9<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:12.270> go<00:02:12.450> ahead<00:02:12.629> and

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:25.780 
you get 990 okay let me scroll down here
so<00:02:19.049> now<00:02:19.170> we<00:02:19.890> have<00:02:20.400> again<00:02:20.909> we<00:02:21.390> have<00:02:23.450> 100<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.659> is

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
so now we have again we have 100 a is

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.949 
so now we have again we have 100 a is
equal<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:28.879> 990<00:02:29.879> so<00:02:30.420> what<00:02:30.569> we're<00:02:30.690> going<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> be

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
equal to 990 so what we're going to be

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.390 
equal to 990 so what we're going to be
doing<00:02:31.080> now<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.590> we're<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.160> solving

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
doing now so we're going to be solving

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.289 
doing now so we're going to be solving
for<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.480> variable<00:02:34.069> what<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.220> so<00:02:36.030> we're<00:02:36.180> going

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
for the variable what a so we're going

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.069 
for the variable what a so we're going
to<00:02:36.360> be<00:02:36.450> dividing<00:02:37.069> both<00:02:38.069> sides<00:02:38.129> by<00:02:38.790> 100<00:02:39.660> since

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
to be dividing both sides by 100 since

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.460 
to be dividing both sides by 100 since
you're<00:02:40.260> multiplying<00:02:40.680> by<00:02:41.040> 100<00:02:42.349> since<00:02:43.349> you're

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
you're multiplying by 100 since you're

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.850 
you're multiplying by 100 since you're
multiplying<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:44.040> by<00:02:44.250> 100<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.420> 1<00:02:45.660> divided<00:02:46.200> by<00:02:46.230> 100

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
multiplying a by 100 so 1 divided by 100

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.869 
multiplying a by 100 so 1 divided by 100
divided<00:02:47.340> by<00:02:47.370> 100<00:02:48.200> 100<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.230> 100<00:02:50.010> cancel<00:02:50.730> each

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
divided by 100 100 and 100 cancel each

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.670 
divided by 100 100 and 100 cancel each
other<00:02:51.000> out<00:02:51.150> so<00:02:52.019> we're<00:02:52.170> left<00:02:52.319> with<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
other out so we're left with the

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.180 
other out so we're left with the
variable<00:02:53.069> 8<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:54.060> we<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.680> 990<00:02:55.680> divided<00:02:56.099> by

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
variable 8 now we have 990 divided by

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.880 
variable 8 now we have 990 divided by
100<00:02:56.730> these<00:02:57.450> two<00:02:57.720> zeros<00:02:57.900> can<00:02:58.290> cancel<00:02:58.709> each

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
100 these two zeros can cancel each

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.430 
100 these two zeros can cancel each
other<00:02:59.010> out<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.760> we're<00:02:59.970> left<00:03:00.150> with<00:03:00.440> 99

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
other out so now we're left with 99

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.740 
other out so now we're left with 99
divided<00:03:02.280> by<00:03:02.370> 10<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:02.849> we<00:03:03.060> know<00:03:03.209> that<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.720> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
divided by 10 and we know that is a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.530 
divided by 10 and we know that is a
decimal<00:03:04.200> you'll<00:03:04.769> get<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.069> decimal<00:03:05.510> koushin

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
decimal you'll get the decimal koushin

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.759 
decimal you'll get the decimal koushin
of<00:03:06.660> nine<00:03:07.560> point<00:03:08.069> nine<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.209> is<00:03:09.750> equal<00:03:10.290> to<00:03:10.319> nine

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
of nine point nine so a is equal to nine

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.789 
of nine point nine so a is equal to nine
point<00:03:10.799> nine<00:03:11.400> so<00:03:12.359> now<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.569> know<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:13.079> we<00:03:13.650> come

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
point nine so now we know that we come

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.870 
point nine so now we know that we come
back<00:03:13.950> here<00:03:14.220> now<00:03:14.670> we<00:03:14.730> know<00:03:14.970> that<00:03:15.319> 22%<00:03:16.319> of<00:03:17.099> 45<00:03:17.910> is

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
back here now we know that 22% of 45 is

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.339 
back here now we know that 22% of 45 is
nine<00:03:20.900> point<00:03:21.900> nine<00:03:23.660> now<00:03:24.660> let's<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.109> another

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
nine point nine now let's do another

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.839 
nine point nine now let's do another
problem<00:03:26.060> so<00:03:27.060> now<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.269> have<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.870> problem

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
problem so now we have the problem

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:38.180 
problem so now we have the problem
50%<00:03:30.889> of<00:03:33.889> nine<00:03:35.690> so<00:03:36.690> do<00:03:36.870> um<00:03:37.079> solve<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:37.799> problem

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
50% of nine so do um solve this problem

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.449 
50% of nine so do um solve this problem
percent<00:03:39.030> problem<00:03:39.419> first<00:03:39.959> we<00:03:40.169> have<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.650> convert

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
percent problem first we have to convert

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.699 
percent problem first we have to convert
our<00:03:41.519> percent<00:03:42.150> which<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.480> 50<00:03:42.840> percent<00:03:42.870> into<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
our percent which is 50 percent into a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:44.449 
our percent which is 50 percent into a
fraction

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
fraction

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.030 
fraction
so<00:03:44.910> since<00:03:45.180> of<00:03:45.359> prefer<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:45.959> percent<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> number

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
so since of prefer a percent is a number

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.460 
so since of prefer a percent is a number
out<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.160> 100<00:03:47.880> so<00:03:48.359> 50<00:03:48.840> percent<00:03:49.230> will<00:03:49.440> be

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
out of 100 so 50 percent will be

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.089 
out of 100 so 50 percent will be
represented<00:03:50.160> as<00:03:50.310> 50<00:03:51.180> over<00:03:51.540> 100<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.470> fraction

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
represented as 50 over 100 as a fraction

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.420 
represented as 50 over 100 as a fraction
so<00:03:54.139> basically<00:03:55.139> right<00:03:55.829> now<00:03:55.859> we're<00:03:56.160> trying<00:03:56.310> to

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
so basically right now we're trying to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.970 
so basically right now we're trying to
find<00:03:56.579> half<00:03:57.120> of<00:03:57.419> nine<00:03:57.629> right<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:58.260> 50%<00:03:58.560> is

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
find half of nine right because 50% is

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.680 
find half of nine right because 50% is
half<00:03:59.190> so<00:03:59.489> we're<00:03:59.849> trying<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.150> find<00:04:00.299> half<00:04:00.540> of

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
half so we're trying to find half of

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.289 
half so we're trying to find half of
nine<00:04:00.870> so<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.489> proportion<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.209> I'm

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
nine so this is a proportion so I'm

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.470 
nine so this is a proportion so I'm
gonna<00:04:03.389> put<00:04:03.599> an<00:04:03.690> equal<00:04:03.989> sign<00:04:04.019> now<00:04:05.329> since<00:04:06.329> you're

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
gonna put an equal sign now since you're

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.940 
gonna put an equal sign now since you're
trying<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.989> find<00:04:07.139> half<00:04:07.319> of<00:04:07.470> nine<00:04:07.650> then<00:04:07.859> we

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
trying to find half of nine then we

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.979 
trying to find half of nine then we
don't<00:04:08.160> know<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.819> half<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.180> nine<00:04:09.389> we<00:04:09.810> can

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
don't know that half of nine we can

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.920 
don't know that half of nine we can
represent<00:04:10.169> that<00:04:10.650> as<00:04:10.889> a<00:04:11.310> variable<00:04:11.819> like<00:04:12.299> the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
represent that as a variable like the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.969 
represent that as a variable like the
variable<00:04:13.440> s<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.660> nine<00:04:16.079> will<00:04:16.380> become<00:04:16.739> our

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
variable s and a nine will become our

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.640 
variable s and a nine will become our
denominator<00:04:17.849> now<00:04:18.599> we<00:04:18.660> use<00:04:19.019> cross

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
denominator now we use cross

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.890 
denominator now we use cross
multiplication<00:04:20.209> so<00:04:21.209> we're<00:04:21.329> going<00:04:21.419> to<00:04:21.510> cross

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
multiplication so we're going to cross

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.340 
multiplication so we're going to cross
multiplying

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
multiplying

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.330 
multiplying
50<00:04:25.030> by<00:04:26.030> 9<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:26.720> then<00:04:27.590> we're<00:04:27.800> going<00:04:27.950> to<00:04:28.040> be<00:04:28.100> cross

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
50 by 9 and then we're going to be cross

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:36.400 
50 by 9 and then we're going to be cross
multiplying<00:04:30.010> 100<00:04:31.480> is<00:04:32.620> 100<00:04:33.620> times<00:04:34.280> s<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:35.230> 100<00:04:36.230> s

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
multiplying 100 is 100 times s is 100 s

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:45.820 
multiplying 100 is 100 times s is 100 s
and<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:38.630> is<00:04:38.990> equal<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:40.090> 50<00:04:41.090> times<00:04:41.660> 9<00:04:44.650> let's<00:04:45.650> go

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
and that is equal to 50 times 9 let's go

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.410 
and that is equal to 50 times 9 let's go
ahead<00:04:45.890> and<00:04:46.160> do<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.460> so<00:04:47.270> 50<00:04:47.960> times<00:04:48.940> 9<00:04:49.940> we<00:04:50.300> know

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
ahead and do that so 50 times 9 we know

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.870 
ahead and do that so 50 times 9 we know
that<00:04:50.660> 9<00:04:50.900> times<00:04:51.170> 0<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.800> 0<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.490> 9<00:04:53.330> times<00:04:53.630> 5<00:04:53.870> is<00:04:54.200> 45

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
that 9 times 0 is 0 and 9 times 5 is 45

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.680 
that 9 times 0 is 0 and 9 times 5 is 45
so<00:04:56.470> 450<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.890> their<00:04:58.280> answer<00:04:58.490> so<00:04:59.210> now<00:04:59.240> we<00:04:59.390> have

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
so 450 is their answer so now we have

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:09.160 
so 450 is their answer so now we have
again<00:05:00.550> yeah<00:05:01.570> 100<00:05:02.570> s<00:05:03.200> is<00:05:04.190> equal<00:05:04.790> to<00:05:06.160> 450<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:08.750> now

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.170 
again yeah 100 s is equal to 450 so now

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.170 
again yeah 100 s is equal to 450 so now
we're<00:05:09.350> going<00:05:09.470> to<00:05:09.530> divide<00:05:09.740> by<00:05:10.400> 100<00:05:10.640> on<00:05:10.970> both

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
we're going to divide by 100 on both

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.960 
we're going to divide by 100 on both
sides<00:05:11.480> since<00:05:11.780> we're<00:05:11.930> multiplying<00:05:12.260> s<00:05:12.740> by<00:05:13.250> 100

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
sides since we're multiplying s by 100

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.000 
sides since we're multiplying s by 100
okay<00:05:14.720> so<00:05:14.780> we're<00:05:15.080> going<00:05:15.170> to<00:05:15.260> go<00:05:15.440> ahead<00:05:15.560> and

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
okay so we're going to go ahead and

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.420 
okay so we're going to go ahead and
divide<00:05:16.970> by<00:05:17.300> 100<00:05:17.510> both<00:05:18.020> sides<00:05:18.290> so<00:05:18.890> divided<00:05:19.310> by

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
divide by 100 both sides so divided by

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.940 
divide by 100 both sides so divided by
100<00:05:20.060> divided<00:05:20.690> by<00:05:20.720> 100<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:21.830> we're<00:05:22.790> left<00:05:23.000> with<00:05:23.270> s

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
100 divided by 100 and we're left with s

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.920 
100 divided by 100 and we're left with s
because<00:05:24.950> 100<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:25.820> 100<00:05:26.210> cancel<00:05:26.660> each<00:05:26.780> other

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
because 100 and 100 cancel each other

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.490 
because 100 and 100 cancel each other
out<00:05:27.080> since<00:05:27.410> they're<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.710> same<00:05:27.860> numbers<00:05:29.500> okay

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
out since they're the same numbers okay

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.330 
out since they're the same numbers okay
so<00:05:30.560> we're<00:05:30.890> left<00:05:31.010> with<00:05:31.190> s<00:05:31.400> is<00:05:31.640> equal<00:05:32.450> to<00:05:32.630> now<00:05:33.340> 450

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
so we're left with s is equal to now 450

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.930 
so we're left with s is equal to now 450
divided<00:05:34.730> by<00:05:35.030> 100<00:05:35.750> these<00:05:36.560> two<00:05:36.860> zeros<00:05:37.040> can<00:05:37.670> we

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
divided by 100 these two zeros can we

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.520 
divided by 100 these two zeros can we
can<00:05:38.120> cancel<00:05:38.390> them<00:05:38.720> out<00:05:38.840> because<00:05:39.290> it's

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
can cancel them out because it's

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.460 
can cancel them out because it's
noticing<00:05:40.400> here<00:05:40.910> so<00:05:41.450> now<00:05:41.810> we<00:05:41.870> have<00:05:42.140> the

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
noticing here so now we have the

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.240 
noticing here so now we have the
fraction<00:05:42.770> for<00:05:43.250> 45<00:05:44.000> divided<00:05:44.420> by<00:05:44.600> 10<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.260> 45

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
fraction for 45 divided by 10 and 45

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:50.350 
fraction for 45 divided by 10 and 45
divided<00:05:46.550> by<00:05:46.640> 10<00:05:46.940> is<00:05:47.090> going<00:05:47.210> to<00:05:47.330> give<00:05:47.510> us<00:05:48.580> 4.5<00:05:49.580> so

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
divided by 10 is going to give us 4.5 so

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.640 
divided by 10 is going to give us 4.5 so
s<00:05:50.570> is<00:05:50.870> equal<00:05:51.260> to<00:05:51.350> 4.5<00:05:52.040> now<00:05:52.610> we<00:05:52.670> know<00:05:53.030> that<00:05:53.650> 50%

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
s is equal to 4.5 now we know that 50%

00:05:54.650 --> 00:06:01.510 
s is equal to 4.5 now we know that 50%
of<00:05:55.190> 9<00:05:55.610> is<00:05:56.180> going<00:05:56.480> to<00:05:56.690> be<00:05:58.540> 4.5<00:05:59.590> so<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:01.130> is<00:06:01.340> how

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
of 9 is going to be 4.5 so this is how

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.300 
of 9 is going to be 4.5 so this is how
you<00:06:01.580> do<00:06:02.540> finding<00:06:03.020> the<00:06:03.140> part<00:06:03.440> of<00:06:03.650> percent

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
you do finding the part of percent

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.190 
you do finding the part of percent
