00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.320
 but good afternoon 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.010
 today I come to present a program 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:12.470
 to make protect your files 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.129
 and it's a portal program you are not going to 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.519
 need to install anything 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.669
 in this program they do not have great weight not 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:24.619
 it's like I say install anything and I 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.500
 used to protect my files and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:31.470
 what partners are 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.870
 Well, it's very interesting for me 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.470
 and anyone who happens to the pc that 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 can not see the files that I have 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.850
 on the computer and can access 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.690
 them nor copy them good to download 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.230
 that program we go to the next 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.230
 web address 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.120
 with virus is reliable 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.540
 It's done 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.199
 more reliable 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.180
 who says start download 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.140
 come on, there's here, start lowering 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:13.500
 the program we hope this thing 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.500
 green appointment 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.619
 the course working the file 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.619
 is to govern 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.570
 we return to my safety 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.790
 and so it's ready we go down we set 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.790
 show in folder and here what I 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.340
 do cotarelo find the writing of ok 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 to put here and you can not rule out 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.410
 this new penalty 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.930
 once downloaded read what right 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.830
 extract here you have not merited 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.860
 install no 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.020
 programs or portals 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.310
 but this date here the lands is 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.710
 well they do not have mobile 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.270
 for greater deeds as announced 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.700
 normally but it is more has more 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.840
 credible a few functions run the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.840
 program as administrator 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.790
 a window will open 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:30.030
 what I hope please please 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.000
 it's a simple interface ok 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.540
 sixth 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.010
 this is all this part is for 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.700
 compress files and this is for 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.700
 unzip files 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.260
 which I am compressed here the 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.080
 mistrust 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.050
 or protects them decompress is protect 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.180
 the folder file 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.630
 that the folder that has returned a file 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.319
 to erase that because the bed already 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.209
 dry 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.340
 the first thing besides the steps to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.650
 protect for example from these images 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.599
 some images 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.060
 the elevated structures of a small 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:14.430
 tutorial so you know how to power the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.980
 Here we give you the folder 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.980
 folder to protect we are happy 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.590
 dialog box and it opens the window 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.819
 sore where is the path of prophets and 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.010
 I do not have you escaped from the desk 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.980
 Well can you look when you 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.680
 they want to be placed in libraries 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.209
 documents where the 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.190
 folders that you want to protect the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.410
 folder can have 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.020
 the acids that you want in the 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.910
 proteins 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.680
 then I will choose 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.160
 they have just died 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.290
 in the store 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.010
 the program I will be able to have these 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.530
 images with images said open 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.810
 if I get a message tejera the 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.659
 image folder let's enter a 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.260
 password 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:06.689
 1 2 3 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.189
 we tell you to protect leave folder and 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:14.120
 I hope please and here we create a 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:18.310
 file that is this folder images 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.010
 projects with extension point 22 80 8 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.790
 what is a folder protected by more than 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:26.560
 you want to access this problem 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.040
 there is this file that has 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.410
 images can do it 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.990
 to protect topics with password 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.370
 community of security will not be able 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.800
 none 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.620
 of your relatives or someone who knows 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:45.370
 much also of program one can 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.310
 do that because I 'm a level of 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.310
 much greater security this program does not 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:54.030
 I think they are capable 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.100
 and if you can say that I do not think well we 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.810
 is this extension extension point 20 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.760
 88 can even be erased in 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.700
 counterpart 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.480
 I play this image because the 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.080
 Compete is protected 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.030
 from this point in 88 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.040
 now to protect the folder is only 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.920
 say choose file for decompressed 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.500
 search on the desktop want 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:23.250
 we go with where is the star a 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.880
 point of this file is 120 88 more 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:29.370
 receives 120 238 we search for the file 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.550
 compressed 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.950
 protein folder 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:35.950
 and we choose the file we are going to open 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.330
 28 on the route 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.250
 let's enter the password of the 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.430
 user entering password that 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:55.490
 entered this part is known here 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.160
 protected not going to sandra in messages 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.680
 password and correct and here then 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.400
 supposedly create a folder but the 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.400
 truth there is nothing 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.400
 here I had a message but it does not come out 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.840
 nothing 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.240
 nor the images that they had 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.570
 that is, they will not be able to see their actions 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:21.669
 see your photos you can see the videos 

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:24.850
 will try to come out so called images 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.770
 but it's broken sack 'they are no longer seen 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:30.360
 nothing 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.639
 good if we enter about 3 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.669
 before protect files wait please 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:40.129
 and it opens us the folder is already protected 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:40.129
 with the images with the text that I had 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.150
 then we protect it in action 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.220
 we programmed it taught the pretty 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.970
 install it and you can can any 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.500
 file up for a point sector exe 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.080
 let's try to protect this folder 

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:06.750
 two let's choose folder for 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.150
 protect the folder two coats with the 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.040
 folder against teaching up the friend 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:14.280
 of linux water folder that will create us 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.590
 nation point 20 88 we can erase that 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.690
 folder and nobody will be able to access this 

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.800
 file only with the program and as a 

00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:24.840
 password 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.870
 it is not protect files 3 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.490
 but we must choose the file to 

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:35.340
 splitter who folder 2 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:39.000
 it is later file and in the folder 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:41.490
 two with the point is anything 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.370
 protect any folder with its 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:45.720
 records 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.169
 we enter a password that of the 

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:51.630
 Corrupt men in the wrong way 

00:07:48.169 --> 00:07:55.460
 completed the file despite 0 

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.460
 kilowatts that is not working 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:01.600
 the program will be a nice description 

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.680
 of the information video show more 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.300
 appears the link where the blog appears 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:10.250
 to download this file 

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.250
 any success comment 

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.050
 this program did not have it for 20 two of 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.470
 the compact three room something that they have 

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.470
 good day
