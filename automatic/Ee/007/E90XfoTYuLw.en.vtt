00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.210 
think there was like both the high 50s
and<00:01:03.879> like<00:01:04.720> that's<00:01:05.110> that's<00:01:05.560> really<00:01:05.830> good<00:01:06.009> when

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
and like that's that's really good when

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.100 
and like that's that's really good when
they're<00:01:06.310> like<00:01:06.490> low<00:01:06.670> 30s<00:01:07.149> you<00:01:07.240> know<00:01:07.360> probably

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110
