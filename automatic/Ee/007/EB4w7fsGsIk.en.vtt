00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.360
 This is Santa Claus today, but why 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.740
 he seems so sad to find out 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.140
 go back a few days 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 precisely to the day when a beautiful one 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.740
 morning is Christmas 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.160
 his desire like every year is that 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.010
 to pass everyone a sweet Christmas 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.430
 but maybe this year because of 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.430
 small crisis will be a bit difficult 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.430
 indeed 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
 but still it doesn't matter for the sake of 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.830
 every single child 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:45.870
 a solution must be found yes 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.870
 panda selling it is a great idea 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.350
 but luck does not always turn from 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.090
 same part 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.320
 in fact, just as the Santa Claus 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.930
 part with his band you understand 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 this time you are a mistake 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 old 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.879
 hopefully i'm touring the foundation 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.879
 the action 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.909
 well it goes well 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.200
 and now that you live without the panda 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:55.790
 it is impossible to buy gifts without 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.790
 gifts that christmas would be 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.490
 so he decides to find some work but 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.490
 not all jobs are simple 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.660
 aimar 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.230
 and here it is our Santa Claus in 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.230
 crisis according to him has disappointed everyone 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.470
 even under the darkest thunderstorm a 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:27.780
 smile never stops smiling is 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.759
 only then did Santa Claus head to that 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.160
 world do not need lawyers for Christmas 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.540
 best just a little hug a 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.860
 simple smile 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.860
 to improve each of you 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.230
