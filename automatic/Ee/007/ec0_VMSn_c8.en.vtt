00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.120 

I<00:00:16.820> took<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.090> class<00:00:18.449> at<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> Penland<00:00:19.680> school<00:00:19.980> in

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
I took a class at the Penland school in

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130 
I took a class at the Penland school in
North<00:00:20.310> Carolina<00:00:20.850> when<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:21.810> started

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
North Carolina when I first started

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.529 
North Carolina when I first started
making<00:00:22.439> paper<00:00:23.029> and<00:00:24.029> it<00:00:24.210> was<00:00:24.300> called

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
making paper and it was called

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.109 
making paper and it was called
sculptural<00:00:25.289> paper<00:00:25.529> making<00:00:25.859> we<00:00:26.430> embedded<00:00:26.730> wire

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
sculptural paper making we embedded wire

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.750 
sculptural paper making we embedded wire
in<00:00:27.480> between<00:00:27.810> two<00:00:27.990> sheets<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> paper<00:00:28.529> and<00:00:29.340> we

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
in between two sheets of paper and we

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.139 
in between two sheets of paper and we
let<00:00:29.939> it<00:00:29.970> air<00:00:30.240> dry<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.250> was<00:00:32.369> amazing<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> me

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
let it air dry and it was amazing to me

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.990 
let it air dry and it was amazing to me
to<00:00:33.300> see<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.399> flat<00:00:35.399> sheet<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> paper

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
to see that this flat sheet of paper

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.510 
to see that this flat sheet of paper
that<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.329> made<00:00:36.660> with<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> piece<00:00:37.710> or<00:00:37.950> two<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.160> wire

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
that I made with a piece or two of wire

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.150 
that I made with a piece or two of wire
embedded<00:00:39.180> when<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.079> came<00:00:40.200> back<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.829> next<00:00:40.860> day

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
embedded when I came back the next day

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.090 
embedded when I came back the next day
and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.790> had<00:00:42.090> dried<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.870> had<00:00:43.050> totally<00:00:43.710> curled

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and it had dried it had totally curled

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.729 
and it had dried it had totally curled
up<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.300> paper<00:00:45.539> not<00:00:46.050> only<00:00:46.230> had<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.469> paper

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
up so the paper not only had the paper

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.139 
up so the paper not only had the paper
shrunk<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.629> wire<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.530> wire<00:00:50.149> reacted

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
shrunk but the the wire the wire reacted

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.560 
shrunk but the the wire the wire reacted
to<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> paper<00:00:52.640> and<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:55.460> amazed<00:00:56.570> but

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to the paper and I just was amazed but

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.170 
to the paper and I just was amazed but
this<00:00:57.719> flat<00:00:58.020> thing<00:00:58.050> could<00:00:58.590> become<00:00:59.180> totally

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
this flat thing could become totally

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060 
this flat thing could become totally
three-dimensional<00:01:00.989> that's<00:01:01.649> what<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.039> been

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
three-dimensional that's what I've been

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
three-dimensional that's what I've been
experimenting<00:01:03.000> with<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> last<00:01:03.719> 15<00:01:04.260> years

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
experimenting with for the last 15 years

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.670 
experimenting with for the last 15 years
really<00:01:05.450> putting<00:01:06.450> string<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.170> between<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
really putting string in between the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.899 
really putting string in between the
sheets<00:01:07.890> different<00:01:08.400> things<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.729> have

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
sheets different things that have

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.210 
sheets different things that have
different<00:01:09.119> amount<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> tension<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:10.979> see

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
different amount of tension to just see

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:30.200 
different amount of tension to just see
what<00:01:11.430> would<00:01:11.520> happen

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.910 

often<00:01:31.210> I<00:01:31.420> would<00:01:31.479> make<00:01:31.810> these<00:01:32.080> things<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.860> I

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
often I would make these things and I

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.399 
often I would make these things and I
would<00:01:33.070> leave<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:33.430> studio<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.210> I'd<00:01:35.170> have

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
would leave this studio and I'd have

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.080 
would leave this studio and I'd have
them<00:01:35.590> sitting<00:01:35.979> all<00:01:36.220> around<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.640> studio<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
them sitting all around the studio and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.130 
them sitting all around the studio and
that<00:01:37.119> come<00:01:37.420> back<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:38.590> next<00:01:38.619> day<00:01:38.979> and<00:01:39.479> see<00:01:40.479> how

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
that come back the next day and see how

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.280 
that come back the next day and see how
they<00:01:41.320> transformed<00:01:42.090> from<00:01:43.090> flat<00:01:43.330> sheets<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.110> to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
they transformed from flat sheets and to

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.170 
they transformed from flat sheets and to
sort<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.210> relief<00:01:46.210> sculptural<00:01:47.200> objects<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
sort of relief sculptural objects this

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.660 
sort of relief sculptural objects this
is<00:01:49.240> when<00:01:49.540> the<00:01:49.659> art<00:01:49.840> was<00:01:50.020> being<00:01:50.320> made<00:01:50.560> like<00:01:51.340> I

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
is when the art was being made like I

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.450 
is when the art was being made like I
wasn't<00:01:52.240> here<00:01:52.570> I<00:01:52.720> set<00:01:53.290> something<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.830> motion<00:01:53.890> I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
wasn't here I set something in motion I

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.060 
wasn't here I set something in motion I
did<00:01:55.149> something<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.399> paper<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:58.030> then

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
did something to to the paper and then

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.840 
did something to to the paper and then
it<00:02:00.070> reacted<00:02:00.700> to<00:02:01.090> what<00:02:01.270> I<00:02:01.300> did<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:02.220> it<00:02:03.220> did<00:02:03.580> that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
it reacted to what I did and it did that

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.320 
it reacted to what I did and it did that
when<00:02:04.630> I<00:02:04.660> wasn't<00:02:05.020> watching
