00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
in one month or something like that so I

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.130 
in one month or something like that so I
do<00:03:45.670> sometimes<00:03:46.209> like<00:03:46.390> H&amp;M<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.840> little<00:03:47.020> bit

do sometimes like H&amp;M a little bit
better<00:03:47.290> I<00:03:47.410> guess<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.740> just<00:03:47.770> depends<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.600> I

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
better I guess it just depends and so I

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.170 
better I guess it just depends and so I
thought<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:50.080> was<00:03:50.170> pretty<00:03:50.410> cute<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.280> then
