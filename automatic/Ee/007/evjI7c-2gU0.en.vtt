and we would add all these ingredients
along<00:01:46.649> with<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.070> juice<00:01:47.310> into<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.820> glass<00:01:47.970> so

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
along with the juice into the glass so

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.270 
along with the juice into the glass so

all<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.360> juice<00:01:54.570> extracted<00:01:55.219> so<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.430> we<00:01:57.180> would

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
all the juice extracted so now we would

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.380 
all the juice extracted so now we would
add<00:01:57.649> some<00:01:58.649> pomegranate<00:01:58.890> juice<00:01:59.280> just<00:02:00.000> top<00:02:00.360> it

after adding pomegranate juice we would

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.080 
after adding pomegranate juice we would
just<00:02:06.690> quickly<00:02:07.140> mix<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.620> and<00:02:07.770> now<00:02:08.399> we<00:02:08.789> would<00:02:08.940> add

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
just quickly mix it and now we would add
