00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it's not fully perverted I just make

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760 
it's not fully perverted I just make
sure<00:00:37.920> my<00:00:38.250> hair<00:00:38.780> wrapped<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:40.079> especially

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
sure my hair wrapped up especially

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.030 
sure my hair wrapped up especially
around<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.690> sides<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.440> did<00:00:43.620> not<00:00:43.770> remove

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
around the sides and I did not remove

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.000 
around the sides and I did not remove
the<00:00:44.250> scarf<00:00:44.610> until<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:46.020> completely<00:00:46.469> dry

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the scarf until it's completely dry

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.100 
the scarf until it's completely dry
used<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:48.030> combination<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> banding<00:00:51.420> method

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
used a combination of the banding method

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
used a combination of the banding method
and<00:00:52.550> African<00:00:53.550> threading<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:55.890> did<00:00:56.129> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
and African threading so I did the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.410 
and African threading so I did the
banding<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.170> majority<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.649> my<00:00:58.859> hair<00:00:59.219> and

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
banding for the majority of my hair and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.509 
banding for the majority of my hair and
African<00:01:00.420> threading<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:01.050> did<00:01:01.350> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.039> ends

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
African threading I did on the very ends

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.330 
African threading I did on the very ends
the<00:01:05.519> bending<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.390> threading<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.770> allows

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
the bending and threading really allows

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
the bending and threading really allows
my<00:01:08.640> hair<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> good<00:01:09.540> stretch<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
my hair to get a good stretch the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.620 
my hair to get a good stretch the
threading<00:01:11.130> allows<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.090> get<00:01:12.360> straight

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
threading allows it to get straight

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.710 
threading allows it to get straight
banding<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.659> hair<00:01:15.990> gives<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.650> hair<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
banding the hair gives the hair a

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.649 
banding the hair gives the hair a
stretch<00:01:18.720> rather<00:01:19.619> than<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.659> straightened

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
stretch rather than a straightened

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.850 
stretch rather than a straightened
effect<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.580> see<00:01:23.850> here<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.780> pattern<00:01:25.500> and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
effect but you see here the pattern and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.740 
effect but you see here the pattern and
texture<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.610> gave<00:01:26.820> which<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.450> easily

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
texture that it gave which could easily

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.730 
texture that it gave which could easily
be<00:01:28.049> worn<00:01:28.909> out<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.810> was<00:01:31.049> using<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
be worn out but I was using this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.340 
be worn out but I was using this
technique<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:33.150> purpose<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> stretching

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350

you're<00:02:33.430> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.910> use<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.570> thread<00:02:35.020> which<00:02:35.260> is

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you're going to use the thread which is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.350 
you're going to use the thread which is
the<00:02:35.500> same<00:02:35.709> thread<00:02:36.100> used<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.880> do<00:02:37.810> so<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.260> weaves

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
the same thread used to do so and weaves

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.860 
the same thread used to do so and weaves
out<00:02:40.360> for<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.050> more<00:02:41.230> expensive<00:02:41.700> silkier

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
out for the more expensive silkier

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.050 
out for the more expensive silkier
option<00:02:43.870> there's<00:02:44.410> some<00:02:45.220> that<00:02:45.430> I<00:02:45.489> believe<00:02:45.790> might

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
option there's some that I believe might

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.490 
option there's some that I believe might
be<00:02:46.209> made<00:02:46.420> of<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:47.700> cotton<00:02:48.700> thread<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.540> some<00:02:49.840> is<00:02:50.140> a

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
be made of a cotton thread and some is a

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.050 
be made of a cotton thread and some is a
little<00:02:50.860> bit<00:02:50.950> silkier<00:02:51.459> I<00:02:51.520> don't<00:02:51.700> know<00:02:51.820> if<00:02:51.940> it's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
little bit silkier I don't know if it's

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.360 
little bit silkier I don't know if it's
a<00:02:54.720> polyester<00:02:55.720> or<00:02:55.780> rayon<00:02:56.380> I<00:02:56.770> don't<00:02:56.950> know<00:02:57.100> what

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
a polyester or rayon I don't know what

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.190 
a polyester or rayon I don't know what
it<00:02:57.489> is<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:59.020> had<00:02:59.890> two<00:03:00.390> spools<00:03:01.390> one<00:03:01.930> was<00:03:02.170> a

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
it is but I had two spools one was a

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.840 
it is but I had two spools one was a
silkier<00:03:02.739> one<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.220> found<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> was

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
silkier one and I found that that was

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.420 
silkier one and I found that that was
easier<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.330> release<00:03:04.750> for<00:03:05.019> my<00:03:05.200> hair<00:03:05.470> versus<00:03:06.280> the
