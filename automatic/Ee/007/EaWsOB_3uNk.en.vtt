00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.030 

here's<00:00:17.570> how<00:00:17.780> I<00:00:17.810> made<00:00:18.170> my<00:00:18.350> full<00:00:18.710> stainless

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
here's how I made my full stainless

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.800 
here's how I made my full stainless
steel<00:00:19.400> countertop<00:00:20.030> I<00:00:20.300> cut<00:00:20.540> a<00:00:20.570> piece<00:00:20.630> of

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
steel countertop I cut a piece of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.400 
steel countertop I cut a piece of
plywood<00:00:21.140> gave<00:00:21.770> it<00:00:21.890> three<00:00:22.130> coats<00:00:22.400> of<00:00:22.550> oil-based

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
plywood gave it three coats of oil-based

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.930 
plywood gave it three coats of oil-based
primer<00:00:24.410> because<00:00:25.070> it's<00:00:25.220> going<00:00:25.340> in<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:25.580> laundry

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:25.940 
primer because it's going in the laundry

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.720 
primer because it's going in the laundry
room<00:00:26.000> then<00:00:26.360> I<00:00:26.480> coated<00:00:26.779> it<00:00:27.050> with<00:00:27.730> stainless

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
room then I coated it with stainless

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.940 
room then I coated it with stainless
steel<00:00:28.970> paint<00:00:29.420> actually<00:00:30.020> has<00:00:30.200> stainless<00:00:30.680> steel

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:30.950 
steel paint actually has stainless steel

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.580 
steel paint actually has stainless steel
in<00:00:31.250> it<00:00:31.460> then<00:00:31.820> I<00:00:31.970> wanted<00:00:32.270> to<00:00:32.360> make<00:00:32.510> a<00:00:32.540> design<00:00:33.050> so

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
in it then I wanted to make a design so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.119 
in it then I wanted to make a design so
I<00:00:33.620> made<00:00:34.010> three<00:00:34.370> circles<00:00:34.940> and<00:00:35.770> cut<00:00:36.770> out<00:00:36.920> the

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
I made three circles and cut out the

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.820 
I made three circles and cut out the
shape<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.550> a<00:00:37.970> petal<00:00:38.480> and<00:00:39.940> copied<00:00:40.989> made<00:00:41.989> designs

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
shape of a petal and copied made designs

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.400 
shape of a petal and copied made designs
of<00:00:43.040> petals<00:00:43.580> to<00:00:43.820> make<00:00:43.850> flowers<00:00:44.510> and<00:00:44.900> then<00:00:45.379> I

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
of petals to make flowers and then I

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.170 
of petals to make flowers and then I
took<00:00:46.690> wood<00:00:47.690> glue<00:00:48.080> and<00:00:48.890> just<00:00:48.920> made<00:00:49.580> little<00:00:49.850> dots

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
took wood glue and just made little dots

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.540 
took wood glue and just made little dots
along<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.650> design<00:00:52.129> at<00:00:52.970> first<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.449> had<00:00:53.600> used

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
along the design at first I had used

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.549 
along the design at first I had used
gorilla<00:00:55.550> glue<00:00:55.879> and<00:00:56.180> that<00:00:56.960> did<00:00:57.140> not<00:00:57.170> work<00:00:57.320> at

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
gorilla glue and that did not work at

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.670 
gorilla glue and that did not work at
all<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:57.979> swelled<00:00:58.879> up<00:00:59.120> and<00:00:59.420> made<00:00:59.870> horrible

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
all it swelled up and made horrible

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.200 
all it swelled up and made horrible
bubbles<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.400> thought<00:01:02.210> of<00:01:02.330> using<00:01:02.479> hot<00:01:02.989> glue<00:01:03.019> but

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
bubbles I thought of using hot glue but

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.590 
bubbles I thought of using hot glue but
very<00:01:05.210> difficult<00:01:05.930> to<00:01:06.080> get<00:01:06.290> any<00:01:07.780> define

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
very difficult to get any define

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.480 
very difficult to get any define
dots<00:01:10.990> with<00:01:11.350> hot<00:01:11.620> glue<00:01:11.860> oh<00:01:11.950> you're<00:01:12.190> gonna<00:01:12.310> make

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
dots with hot glue oh you're gonna make

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.610 
dots with hot glue oh you're gonna make
a<00:01:12.550> huge<00:01:13.270> mess<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.750> burn<00:01:13.990> yourself<00:01:14.380> in<00:01:14.530> the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
a huge mess and burn yourself in the

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.070 
a huge mess and burn yourself in the
process<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.310> wood<00:01:16.060> glue<00:01:16.330> turned<00:01:16.660> out<00:01:16.810> to<00:01:16.960> be

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
process so wood glue turned out to be

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.300 
process so wood glue turned out to be
the<00:01:17.230> best<00:01:17.410> solution<00:01:18.010> then<00:01:18.640> after<00:01:19.030> it<00:01:19.360> dried<00:01:19.840> I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the best solution then after it dried I

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.430 
the best solution then after it dried I
painted<00:01:21.310> it<00:01:21.490> again<00:01:22.030> with<00:01:22.900> a<00:01:22.930> stainless<00:01:23.410> steel

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
painted it again with a stainless steel

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.210 
painted it again with a stainless steel
paint<00:01:24.040> and<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.480> looks<00:01:25.690> really<00:01:26.110> cool<00:01:26.320> people

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
paint and it looks really cool people

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.610 
paint and it looks really cool people
come<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.670> done<00:01:27.820> it<00:01:28.000> all<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.390> time<00:01:28.630> then<00:01:29.590> I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
come and done it all the time then I

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.190 
come and done it all the time then I
made<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:32.320> supports<00:01:33.479> screwed<00:01:34.479> right<00:01:34.780> into

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
made the the supports screwed right into

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
made the the supports screwed right into
the<00:01:35.530> two<00:01:35.710> by<00:01:35.890> fours<00:01:36.160> along<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.670> wall<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the two by fours along the wall and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.490 
the two by fours along the wall and
after<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.729> got<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.120> leveled<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.490> fit<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
after I got it leveled and to fit the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.210 
after I got it leveled and to fit the
cord<00:01:44.500> from<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.830> washer<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.430> drilled<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.000> hole

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.980 

that<00:01:49.640> goes<00:01:49.880> against<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.420> wall<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:50.870> you<00:01:50.930> can

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
that goes against the wall and you can

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.340 
that goes against the wall and you can
just<00:01:51.290> pull<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.500> cord<00:01:51.740> up<00:01:52.010> through<00:01:52.310> that<00:01:53.350> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
just pull the cord up through that and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.230 
just pull the cord up through that and
that<00:01:54.650> is<00:01:54.890> pretty<00:01:55.250> much<00:01:55.460> how<00:01:55.700> I<00:01:55.730> made<00:01:56.030> my

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
that is pretty much how I made my

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.750 
that is pretty much how I made my
Sting's<00:01:56.570> stainless<00:01:57.380> steel<00:01:57.560> countertop<00:01:58.190> and

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
Sting's stainless steel countertop and

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.540 
Sting's stainless steel countertop and
you<00:01:58.910> can<00:01:59.120> do<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.360> too
