out comfortably I still feel there's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.580 
out comfortably I still feel there's
more<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.810> come<00:01:48.990> from<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> team<00:01:49.409> I'm

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
more to come from the team I'm

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.899 
more to come from the team I'm
absolutely<00:01:49.799> delighted<00:01:50.009> without<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.549> plan<00:01:50.759> at

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
absolutely delighted without a plan at

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.359 
absolutely delighted without a plan at
the<00:01:50.970> moment<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.869> confidence<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.649> gaining

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the moment the confidence is gaining

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.170 
the moment the confidence is gaining
every<00:01:53.640> week<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:55.130> you<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.310> lose<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
every week but you can lose in this

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.270 
every week but you can lose in this
league<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:58.229> easily<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.130> make

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
league very easily so we have to make

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.709 
league very easily so we have to make
sure<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.579> remain<00:01:59.820> focused<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.479> move<00:02:00.600> on<00:02:00.689> to

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
sure we remain focused and move on to

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.959 
sure we remain focused and move on to
Yeovil<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.100> almost<00:02:02.310> ludicrous<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.850> say

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
Yeovil and it's almost ludicrous to say

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.039 
Yeovil and it's almost ludicrous to say
that<00:02:03.119> you've<00:02:03.210> just<00:02:03.329> played<00:02:03.509> off<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> Parker

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that you've just played off the Parker

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.179 
that you've just played off the Parker
team<00:02:04.229> you're<00:02:04.380> in<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.560> premier<00:02:04.860> league<00:02:04.890> last

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
team you're in the premier league last

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.850 
team you're in the premier league last
season<00:02:05.540> yeah<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.899> thought<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.229> did<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.619> in

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
season yeah but I thought we did that in

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.389 
season yeah but I thought we did that in
spells<00:02:08.129> in<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.429> away<00:02:08.580> game<00:02:08.759> as<00:02:08.940> well

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
spells in the away game as well

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.220 
spells in the away game as well
to<00:02:10.060> giving<00:02:10.299> it's<00:02:10.479> ready<00:02:10.629> we<00:02:10.750> perform<00:02:11.079> very

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
to giving it's ready we perform very

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.770 
to giving it's ready we perform very
well<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.879> they<00:02:13.000> won't<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.239> surprised<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.689> see

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
well so they won't be surprised to see

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.429 
well so they won't be surprised to see
us<00:02:13.900> on<00:02:14.230> our<00:02:14.709> charge<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.849> league<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.290> other

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
us on our charge up the league and other

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:19.380 
us on our charge up the league and other
side's<00:02:17.709> perhaps<00:02:18.159> more<00:02:18.459> so<00:02:18.640> surprised<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:19.329> how

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
side's perhaps more so surprised at how

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.059 
side's perhaps more so surprised at how
well<00:02:19.420> we're<00:02:19.689> doing<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.079> we<00:02:20.709> just<00:02:20.829> want<00:02:20.950> to

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.500 
think throughout my time as manager I
think<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.250> team<00:02:39.430> will<00:02:39.459> always<00:02:39.730> proved<00:02:40.000> I've

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.550 
concerned to see Lewis Grabban just
hobbling<00:03:49.510> off<00:03:49.599> was<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.840> was<00:03:50.079> a<00:03:50.139> bit<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.379> cramp

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
hobbling off was that was a bit of cramp

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.899 
hobbling off was that was a bit of cramp
or<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.799> result<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.159> his<00:03:51.250> always<00:03:51.519> work<00:03:51.669> of<00:03:51.819> the

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
before the run thought that we would

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.340
