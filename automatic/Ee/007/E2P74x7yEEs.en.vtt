going to look right now you might still
be<00:01:34.560> facing<00:01:35.009> 45<00:01:35.759> degrees<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.900> get<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.380> more

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
be facing 45 degrees to get even more

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.390 
be facing 45 degrees to get even more
wound<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:39.200> just<00:01:40.200> try<00:01:40.409> facing<00:01:40.860> forward<00:01:41.310> a

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
wound up just try facing forward a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.539 
wound up just try facing forward a
little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:42.259> step<00:01:43.259> 2

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
little bit step 2

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.109 
little bit step 2
so<00:01:44.790> we<00:01:44.909> need<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.240> go<00:01:45.390> from<00:01:46.820> this<00:01:47.820> position

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
so we need to go from this position

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.280 
so we need to go from this position
where<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:48.930> facing<00:01:49.409> forward<00:01:50.899> to<00:01:51.899> this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
where I'm facing forward to this

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the foot it doesn't matter what you

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.550 
the foot it doesn't matter what you
don't<00:02:49.489> want<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> do<00:02:49.940> is<00:02:50.239> keep<00:02:51.049> the<00:02:51.230> feet<00:02:51.410> in

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:03.270 
don't want to do is keep the feet in
place<00:02:52.690> because<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.810> then<00:02:53.959> you<00:02:54.110> only<00:02:54.290> get<00:02:54.500> that

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.770 

so<00:03:04.280> what<00:03:04.459> are<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> counts<00:03:05.060> for<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.299> lot<00:03:05.540> turn

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
so what are the counts for the lot turn

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.530 
so what are the counts for the lot turn
let's<00:03:06.500> just<00:03:06.799> say<00:03:06.980> that<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.519> lock<00:03:07.970> thing

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
let's just say that this lock thing

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.509 
let's just say that this lock thing
where<00:03:09.049> you<00:03:09.170> jump<00:03:09.590> into<00:03:09.830> that<00:03:09.980> lock<00:03:10.280> position

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
where you jump into that lock position

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.170 
where you jump into that lock position
happens<00:03:11.209> on<00:03:11.420> five<00:03:11.900> five<00:03:12.530> out<00:03:12.739> of<00:03:12.769> eight<00:03:13.220> six

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
happens on five five out of eight six

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.710 
happens on five five out of eight six
seven<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.750> eight<00:03:14.959> are<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.820> unwinding<00:03:16.820> so<00:03:17.480> if

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
seven and eight are the unwinding so if

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.300 
seven and eight are the unwinding so if
I<00:03:17.870> go<00:03:18.019> one<00:03:18.320> two<00:03:18.829> three<00:03:19.160> four<00:03:20.150> five<00:03:20.959> five<00:03:21.310> six

to<00:03:42.849> companies<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.019> here's<00:03:44.319> my<00:03:44.530> simple

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
to companies so here's my simple

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.920 
to companies so here's my simple
explanation<00:03:45.610> for<00:03:46.000> what<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.480> do<00:03:46.599> this<00:03:46.659> would<00:03:46.810> be

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
explanation for what to do this would be

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.839 
explanation for what to do this would be
really<00:03:47.170> fast<00:03:47.409> we're<00:03:48.340> going<00:03:48.430> to<00:03:48.549> take<00:03:48.700> your

really fast we're going to take your

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.970 
really fast we're going to take your
right<00:03:48.970> leg<00:03:49.000> sweep<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:49.959> in<00:03:50.049> front<00:03:50.579> one<00:03:51.579> two

three four right left three four that's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.920 
three four right left three four that's
two<00:03:59.769> distinct<00:04:00.129> set<00:04:00.430> steps<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.450> we'll<00:04:01.599> try<00:04:01.780> them

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
two distinct set steps so we'll try them

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.360 
two distinct set steps so we'll try them
again<00:04:02.010> one<00:04:03.010> two<00:04:03.549> three<00:04:04.299> four<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.290> then<00:04:05.319> we<00:04:06.190> do
