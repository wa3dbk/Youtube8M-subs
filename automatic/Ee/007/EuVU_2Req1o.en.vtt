00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
it's just lace through on a piece of

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.760 
it's just lace through on a piece of
fish<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> screen<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.960> then<00:01:58.080> we<00:01:58.110> attach<00:01:58.470> these

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
fish you screen and then we attach these
to<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.130> top<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> foil<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.080> this

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
to the top and then this foil and this

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.590 
to the top and then this foil and this
will<00:02:01.920> last<00:02:02.100> till<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.729> are<00:02:02.940> sick<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.240> looking

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
will last till you are sick of looking

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.290 
will last till you are sick of looking
at<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:05.010> don't<00:02:05.160> need<00:02:05.280> any<00:02:05.670> poles<00:02:06.060> you

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
at it but you don't need any poles you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.730 
at it but you don't need any poles you
don't<00:02:06.450> need<00:02:06.540> any<00:02:06.690> basis<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.410> don't<00:02:07.619> need

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
don't need any basis and you don't need

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.280 
don't need any basis and you don't need
any<00:02:07.920> helium<00:02:08.490> now<00:02:09.000> actually<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.570> top<00:02:09.780> loop<00:02:10.050> is

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
any helium now actually the top loop is

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.420 
any helium now actually the top loop is
so<00:02:10.500> cool<00:02:10.739> have<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:10.920> seen<00:02:11.130> these<00:02:11.280> they're

singing balloons if you push the bottom
they'll<00:02:13.410> see<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.760> result<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.269> I<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.570> hit<00:02:15.720> it

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
they'll see the result and I can hit it

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.390 
they'll see the result and I can hit it
but<00:02:15.989> I<00:02:16.140> don't<00:02:16.290> think<00:02:16.440> here's<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.010> noisy

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400

still<00:02:53.870> things<00:02:54.049> up<00:02:54.200> as<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.349> new<00:02:54.590> pill<00:02:54.910> here<00:02:55.910> they

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
still things up as a new pill here they

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.530 
still things up as a new pill here they
come

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
come

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.589 
come
okay<00:02:57.470> mini<00:02:58.190> is<00:02:58.489> kind<00:02:58.700> of<00:02:58.760> cool<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.359> same

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
okay mini is kind of cool it's the same

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.390 
okay mini is kind of cool it's the same
theory<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:00.560> see<00:03:00.739> this<00:03:00.859> balloons<00:03:01.190> in<00:03:01.370> the

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
theory but see this balloons in the

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.970 
theory but see this balloons in the
shape<00:03:01.640> of<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.879> flower<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:03.230> I<00:03:03.260> thought<00:03:03.739> well

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
shape of a flower so I thought well

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.009 
shape of a flower so I thought well
let's<00:03:04.489> make<00:03:04.790> our<00:03:05.030> quads<00:03:05.390> thought<00:03:05.840> when<00:03:05.989> we

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
let's make our quads thought when we

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.440 
let's make our quads thought when we
were<00:03:06.200> making<00:03:06.349> like<00:03:07.159> this<00:03:07.400> is<00:03:07.549> the<00:03:07.700> green<00:03:07.970> stem

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
were making like this is the green stem

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.289 
were making like this is the green stem
and<00:03:08.989> I<00:03:09.109> made<00:03:09.290> this<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.620> match<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:10.010> petals<00:03:10.430> but

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
and I made this to match the petals but

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.030 
and I made this to match the petals but
this<00:03:11.450> one<00:03:11.629> I<00:03:11.659> actually<00:03:11.840> did<00:03:12.170> five<00:03:12.470> instead<00:03:12.980> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
this one I actually did five instead of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.640 
this one I actually did five instead of
four<00:03:13.129> and<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.730> stacked<00:03:14.090> them<00:03:14.269> on<00:03:14.390> top<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:15.500> then

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
four and I stacked them on top and then

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.960 
four and I stacked them on top and then
I<00:03:15.680> used<00:03:15.890> the<00:03:16.010> yellow<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.519> tie<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:16.760> all<00:03:16.940> in

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
I used the yellow to tie it all in

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.369 
I used the yellow to tie it all in
because<00:03:17.299> it<00:03:17.390> matches<00:03:17.569> to<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> balloon<00:03:18.109> and

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
because it matches to the balloon and

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:19.839 
because it matches to the balloon and
then<00:03:18.560> again<00:03:18.829> we<00:03:19.010> just<00:03:19.129> used<00:03:19.400> those<00:03:19.549> weights

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
then again we just used those weights

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:21.880 
then again we just used those weights
from<00:03:20.150> Party<00:03:20.750> City<00:03:20.780> in<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.200> Tridion<00:03:21.620> and

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
from Party City in the Tridion and

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.890 
from Party City in the Tridion and
attached<00:03:22.159> it<00:03:22.430> you've<00:03:22.670> got<00:03:22.819> a<00:03:22.849> nice<00:03:23.120> cute<00:03:23.660> easy

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
attached it you've got a nice cute easy

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.750 
attached it you've got a nice cute easy
centerpiece<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.769> can<00:03:25.010> also<00:03:25.160> use<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.549> like

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
centerpiece you can also use this like

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.640 
centerpiece you can also use this like
for<00:03:25.970> spring<00:03:26.329> if<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.660> wanted<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.200> do<00:03:27.349> about<00:03:27.590> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
for spring if you wanted to do about a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.159 
for spring if you wanted to do about a
little<00:03:28.040> summer<00:03:28.250> spring<00:03:29.000> theme<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.019> don't

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
little summer spring theme and you don't

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.750 
little summer spring theme and you don't
have<00:03:30.319> to<00:03:30.410> use<00:03:30.560> all<00:03:30.799> the<00:03:31.010> same<00:03:31.220> colors<00:03:31.609> of<00:03:31.639> the

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
have to use all the same colors of the

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.370 
have to use all the same colors of the
balloons<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.750> just<00:03:32.930> thought<00:03:33.079> those<00:03:33.290> looked

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
balloons but I just thought those looked

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.280 
balloons but I just thought those looked
well<00:03:33.769> like<00:03:34.400> this<00:03:34.549> would<00:03:34.730> work<00:03:34.760> as<00:03:35.060> well<00:03:35.090> with<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
well like this would work as well with a

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:48.860 
well like this would work as well with a
lavender

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.900 

and<00:03:49.379> here<00:03:49.530> we<00:03:49.620> have<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.860> same<00:03:50.099> thing<00:03:50.400> again

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
and here we have the same thing again

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.110 
and here we have the same thing again
but<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:51.900> time<00:03:52.140> we<00:03:52.260> use<00:03:52.410> pink<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.120> purple
