00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.519
 architecture that is either 64 32 well 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.559
 we go to the official website of win rar 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.210
 the links in the videos in the releases 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.640
 I'll leave them here in the description of 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.980
 file we will go first on the page 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.630
 officer of win rush ok here look a 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.720
 thing that says download recommended 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.610
 are you click here so that 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.920
 download the version that is most 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.320
 adjustment to your computer here are the 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.880
 winrar will automatically detect the 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.950
 properties of your computer and 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.380
 download to the most appropriate version well 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.270
 because I'll give you cancel because 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.220
 I have it if you do not want this 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.960
 for example here it says in English you can 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.360
 also put version 5 point days 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.460
 for windows in Spanish and they can put 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.280
 this also if you want to download it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.010
 example in examples and so also the 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.920
 language true well also cancel it 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.860
 because I already have these 7 open a 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.990
 new tab 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.690
 and they will have one more or less file 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.500
 like that right click and execute as 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.710
 administrator and install and you look 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.750
 that's all right now it continues to crack what 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.670
 activate it or how you want it 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.830
 to say is that I'm going to give ok 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.470
 will appear after giving you done 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.290
 a tab where a rap will be this is not 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.110
 we close it down we minimize it we'll go 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.440
 I leave the files 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.420
 of the crack one is for chalets and other 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.070
 by mediafire anyway I will put 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.730
 both for you to see how it 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.730
 download one 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.390
 remember that in force you have 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.250
 have to be registered to be able 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 download something and a page appears 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:55.240
 of ads this way we skip advertising 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:02:00.009
 here it says let's wait 5 seconds 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.720
 we hope it well here I will be you 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.490
 they have to register to be able to 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.020
 download something I recommend you to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.420
 register because many I tuberos 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.239
 tend to upload files to this page 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.840
 because it is very good and very fast this and 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.819
 I recommend and once you subscribe 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.349
 so they give you more priority they lived here 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.870
 to download we only go to whom 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.870
 download we close this tab 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.360
 and this will start the download time and 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.220
 Free download 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.560
 to you I believe them appear 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.780
 file live here that they expect so many 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.030
 I already have it right and now I'm going 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 they can mediafire and it's the same and a half 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.690
 missing the only thing we have to do 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.690
 here is download 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.540
 and ready friends the way you guys 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.180
 they can download it well I'm going to 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.750
 close this because I already have the crack and 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.300
 it's this weird weird red dot that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.610
 we click and we right click and 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.540
 we copy or select that control 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.640
 more than that is to copy well now the 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.910
 tab that I told them not to close 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.880
 here on the page of win back 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.440
 For example, if I open it, it seems to me 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.890
 Windows application I'm going to close it 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.170
 here in a weird link says shortcut 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.390
 we will give right click and open the 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.760
 location of the file and here where 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.250
 is the location of the file this is 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.890
 delete the application I open it and the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.760
 application we paste the 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.800
 the rav 3.6 here let's replace the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.890
 destination file because this is already the 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.150
 crack well let's continue and ready 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.390
 friends we have our winrar 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.510
 broken here we will not see anything 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.280
 what 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.220
 there are so many days of testing already 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.560

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.040
 a super fast video to have it 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.810
 it works in windows 7 windows 8 8.1 the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.060

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.799
