 put where the lid is on the 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.880
 container of the lid and in fact it has 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.549
 the coast so you can put it like that and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.110
 all that then we're going to put and we're going 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.470
 to put or be instead of putting it in the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.659
 place under the lid that best 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.910

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.060

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.430
 lipstick that is but that is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.670
 and also let's use let's put 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.270
 the pan I was here was removing the 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.819
 because it can not be removed is already very 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.920
 but we will not treat the draft 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.920
 this crayola and we are going to split in half 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.040
 let's cut the bit and I occupy the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.060
 half the street 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.480
 after this 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.270
 the cup with the transparent lipstick and 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.050
 the coconut oil and he thought we're going 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.330
 to put for about 3 minutes 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:00.250
 have to be 3 minutes and well let's 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:04.890
 wait there for the 3 minutes to start 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:09.790
 then we will take out in the 51st minute 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:13.450
 minutes we're not going to put and we're going to 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:17.310
 stir a little and good after 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:21.870
 let's put it back here 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.870
 Well, everything is not there 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:39.680
 let's stir at 3 minutes we are going to 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.930
 stir everything so that to fill 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.760
 the vomiting and that since you're 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 completely sure that there is no longer 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.120
 nothing of snaith group or let's put 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.360
 the crayon mix and that we're going to put 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.200
 in them for good we are going to put 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.200
 just as I could 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.459
 we are going to put him father 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.120
 and well after that, we are careful 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.430
 go to the fridge we will put it when referring 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.500
 for half an hour I put him during 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:20.680
 half an hour and if full 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.680
 in the freezer for half an hour 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.730
 then take off after the average 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:36.529
 take out the good little boat since 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.599
 far and good let's see what 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.770
 and good since we are like this we are going to 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:44.860
 remove where it was on the lid 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:47.970
 and we are going to introduce it but we are going to 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.800
 put it down or I do not know if I explain 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.860
 but we're going to put it down and we're going to 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.889
 tighten too strong for him to stay 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:01.090
 well stuck they understand 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.680
 I do not know if I am explaining myself at the stage 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.650
 and we're going to put it somewhere else 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.680
 they understand and they will be calm because 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:12.159
 seriously take off afterwards and well let's go 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.770
 to put there and let's start squeezing 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:18.210
 very strong forgiveness is that I was mix 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.520
 wait I did not know how to be able like this 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:25.319
 put that but I realized we have 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.319
 to press very hard 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.870
 and well this one right now and I'm there 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.710
 squeezing really hard since it 's like this 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:37.879
 let's tighten a little bit and it 's very 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:41.319
 I do not try to squeeze it a thousand 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:45.310
 times until finally God gave me 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:45.310
 press it hard and it's already squeezed 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.330
 best 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:02.699
 good 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.840
 It's super easy 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:22.400
 the point is that we did this for 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:25.760
 compression and it's amazing them there 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.020
 really liked this video and how they were 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.020
 my lips 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.830
 some balls here 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:40.030
 create some balls 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:46.230
 but 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.230
 Well, we are going to use it and little 

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.500
 coconut oil 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.490
 because for already bored of 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.180
 What is normal is that they are 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.180
 transparent 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.200
 of colors 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.430
 bye
