 muscular and aggressive temperament 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.710
 characterizes this suv coupe that nissan 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.530
 also defines as a car of 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 Rally for the urban jungle 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 cut over two mounted on stilts 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 takes advantage of a turbo petrol engine 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.450
 and can equip itself with a transmission 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.399
 Integral developed and designed in part 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.509
 in brazil could quickly and be 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.040
 declined in series 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.930
 hope they cross then 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.880
 Atlantic as the youngest of the look 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.399
 would have its place in Europe among 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.130
 the peugeot 2008 renault clio suv and 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.350
 other q2 the 17th Grand Prix of the 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.360
 season of Formula 1 2012 is played this 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.100
 weekend in India a route that promises 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.409
 show with its varied turns and 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.850
 selective 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.129
 so what kind of car does it take for 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.230
 get to you from the circuit of buddh jean 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.849
 louis moncet then enlighten us 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.739
 first thing you have to talk about tires 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.540
 Pirelli does its best because we have 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.709
 the most toughest hard tires 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.180
 in the hardest hardest among 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 soft because the coating is very 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.019
 abrasive and the circuit requires a lot 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.030
 of energy to the tires the second thing he 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.299
 would need a car with a height at 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.890
 very very low soil to have a very 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.629
 good road holding a grip in 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.950
 the big curves and finally it takes a 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.140
 very hard suspension because there is everything 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.629
 a series of turns this one but 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.519
 all this part there see with that where 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.890
 you really need changes of course 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.870
 violent so it takes a suspension 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.060
 before very very hard to have precisely 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.190
 these very responsive course changes we 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.489
 will also put a lot of front wing 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.769
 because you have to have rain 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.660
 naturally and avoid understeer 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.329
 and in this case it's good 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.489
 tracks quite difficult we can not 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.079
 to really have a lame duck on this 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.940
 kind of circuit to finish a small 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.069
 advertising that you may already have 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.980
 seen to promote the lack of amount 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.569
 central of the ford b max and communicating from 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.160
 following in the ideas since they make 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.920
 here dive a man through 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:20.660
 the vehicle interior position at the 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.459
 perpendicular to the diving board then are 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.500
 they really curious to know 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.669
 let's move to the other side of the camera 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.230
 magic of cinema 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.090
 but at the risk maybe of you 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.709
 disappoint the stuntman did not risk his 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.359
 life for the purposes of advertising and 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.880
 sequences of a dive without cars 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.220
 were immortalized before he was 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.049
 suspended by the feet to achieve the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.540
 Passage sequence of the passenger compartment 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.889
 an impressive achievement 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.889
 that insolite then
