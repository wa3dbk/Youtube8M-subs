thousand<00:00:44.969> votes<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> started<00:00:46.260> off

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
thousand votes and when I started off

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
thousand votes and when I started off
king<00:00:46.649> of<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.860> web<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.219> was<00:00:47.579> hoping<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
king of the web I was hoping to get in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.529 
king of the web I was hoping to get in
top<00:00:48.510> three<00:00:48.780> gaming<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.489> top<00:00:50.489> ten<00:00:50.820> overall<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
top three gaming and top ten overall and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.720 
top three gaming and top ten overall and
that<00:00:51.660> looked<00:00:51.899> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.489> possible<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.610> be

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
that looked kind of possible to be

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.950 
that looked kind of possible to be
honest<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.120> getting<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> good<00:00:54.600> amount<00:00:54.629> of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
honest I was getting a good amount of

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.869 
honest I was getting a good amount of
votes<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.559> they<00:00:55.710> really<00:00:55.920> slowed<00:00:56.250> up<00:00:56.430> despite

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
votes but they really slowed up despite

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.060 
votes but they really slowed up despite
that<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.329> advertising<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.500> Twitter<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that I was advertising on Twitter and so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.760 
that I was advertising on Twitter and so
on<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.539> now<00:01:00.539> at<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> moment<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.469> into<00:01:01.620> top

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
on so now at the moment to get into top

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.789 
on so now at the moment to get into top
ten<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.309> 70<00:01:02.940> odd<00:01:03.270> thousand<00:01:04.019> votes<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.710> I'm

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
ten I need 70 odd thousand votes and I'm

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.030 
ten I need 70 odd thousand votes and I'm
on<00:01:04.949> 30<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.880> get<00:01:06.030> into<00:01:06.299> top<00:01:06.869> three<00:01:07.229> gaming<00:01:07.830> I

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
on 30 and to get into top three gaming I

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
on 30 and to get into top three gaming I
need<00:01:08.280> about<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> hundred<00:01:08.970> thousand<00:01:09.689> odd<00:01:09.869> vote

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
need about a hundred thousand odd vote

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
need about a hundred thousand odd vote
so<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.409> doesn't<00:01:10.619> look<00:01:10.680> likely<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:12.000> what<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> did

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
so it doesn't look likely but what I did

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.570 
so it doesn't look likely but what I did
say<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.530> encourage<00:01:13.740> people<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.159> vote<00:01:14.369> as

be my thing to do for getting a certain
amount<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> king<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> web

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
amount a lot of the king of the web

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
amount a lot of the king of the web
people<00:01:25.590> tend<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.830> do<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.340> they<00:01:27.150> reach

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
people tend to do that when they reach

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270 
people tend to do that when they reach
certain<00:01:27.630> goals<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.740> looks<00:01:28.920> obviously

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
certain goals then that looks obviously

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.980 
certain goals then that looks obviously
more<00:01:29.460> unlikely<00:01:29.880> as<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> day's<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
more unlikely as the day's going on so a

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.600 
more unlikely as the day's going on so a
couple<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.380> days<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.860> on<00:01:31.979> else<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.340> twitter

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
help and it's horrible disease to have

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.460 
help and it's horrible disease to have
Parkinson's<00:03:14.520> before<00:03:15.510> no<00:03:15.720> more<00:03:15.960> information

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
on it that you can go to the Parkinson's

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.550 
on it that you can go to the Parkinson's
website<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.510> linked<00:03:18.810> in<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.410> description

website that linked in the description
but<00:03:20.220> it's<00:03:20.610> just<00:03:20.880> not<00:03:20.940> a<00:03:21.150> nice<00:03:21.450> thing<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.750> have

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
but it's just not a nice thing to have

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.370 
but it's just not a nice thing to have
and<00:03:22.290> there's<00:03:22.590> no<00:03:22.740> real<00:03:22.980> cure<00:03:24.110> and<00:03:25.110> so<00:03:25.350> I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
and there's no real cure and so I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.200 
and there's no real cure and so I
thought<00:03:25.620> it<00:03:25.800> would<00:03:25.830> be<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> nice<00:03:26.220> gesture<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.030> we

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
thought it would be a nice gesture so we

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.870 
thought it would be a nice gesture so we
could<00:03:27.390> do<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.720> next<00:03:27.900> charity<00:03:28.470> livestream<00:03:28.880> in

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.600 
could do the next charity livestream in
