to the fact that YouTube sort of
butchers<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> quality<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.690> these<00:00:15.900> videos<00:00:16.109> i

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
better idea of the quality of what these

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
better idea of the quality of what these
two<00:00:30.179> devices<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.779> produce<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.980> probably

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
two devices can produce it probably

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.700 
two devices can produce it probably
won't<00:00:32.520> be<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.690> massive<00:00:34.230> long<00:00:34.440> clip

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
won't be this this massive long clip

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
won't be this this massive long clip
that<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.070> show<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.370> YouTube

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
that I'm going to show you on YouTube

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549 
that I'm going to show you on YouTube
but<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.149> be<00:00:36.329> some<00:00:36.660> segments<00:00:37.140> from<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
but it will be some segments from that

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.750 
but it will be some segments from that
so<00:00:37.860> yeah<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> autofocus<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:41.070> set<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.460> on

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
so yeah the autofocus is set to on on

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.190 
so yeah the autofocus is set to on on
both<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.090> devices<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.719> I'm<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.930> touching

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
both these devices so I'm not touching

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.500 
both these devices so I'm not touching
the<00:00:43.410> screen<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.770> focus<00:00:44.100> we'll<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.239> fast

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the screen to focus we'll see how fast

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.270 
the screen to focus we'll see how fast
they<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.809> both<00:00:45.989> autofocus

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.610 

in<00:00:54.879> terms<00:00:55.120> of<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.329> specs<00:00:55.629> the<00:00:55.809> Nexus<00:00:56.140> 5<00:00:56.320> has<00:00:56.500> an

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
in terms of the specs the Nexus 5 has an

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.150 
in terms of the specs the Nexus 5 has an
8-megapixel<00:00:56.800> camera<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.940> HTC<00:00:58.539> m8<00:00:58.899> has<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.500> 4

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
8-megapixel camera the HTC m8 has a 4

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.340 
8-megapixel camera the HTC m8 has a 4
megapixel<00:01:00.340> for<00:01:01.149> ultrapixel<00:01:01.870> camera<00:01:01.899> so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
megapixel for ultrapixel camera so

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.209 
megapixel for ultrapixel camera so
they're<00:01:02.469> using<00:01:02.769> pretty<00:01:03.040> different

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
they're using pretty different

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.039 
they're using pretty different
technology<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:04.239> will<00:01:04.720> be<00:01:04.839> quite

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
technology there will be quite

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.270 
technology there will be quite
interesting<00:01:05.590> to<00:01:05.740> see<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.130> difference<00:01:08.280> as

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
interesting to see the difference as

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.980 
interesting to see the difference as
always<00:01:09.670> with<00:01:09.820> these<00:01:09.940> videos<00:01:10.240> guys<00:01:10.479> you<00:01:10.840> will

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
always with these videos guys you will

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.540 
always with these videos guys you will
get<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.170> better<00:01:11.500> comparison<00:01:11.950> than<00:01:12.310> what<00:01:12.399> I'm

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
get a better comparison than what I'm

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.920 
get a better comparison than what I'm
seeing<00:01:12.880> on<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.090> screens<00:01:13.390> because<00:01:13.600> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
seeing on the screens because the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.139 
seeing on the screens because the
screens<00:01:14.259> are<00:01:14.830> calibrated<00:01:15.580> differently<00:01:15.610> and

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
screens are calibrated differently and

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.850 
screens are calibrated differently and
you<00:01:16.390> guys<00:01:16.540> can<00:01:16.780> see<00:01:16.810> it<00:01:17.020> all<00:01:17.140> on<00:01:17.170> one<00:01:17.470> display

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
you guys can see it all on one display

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.660 
you guys can see it all on one display
which<00:01:18.040> is<00:01:18.190> a<00:01:18.220> better<00:01:18.880> way<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.060> do<00:01:19.330> it<00:01:23.549> from<00:01:24.549> what

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
which is a better way to do it from what

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.070 
which is a better way to do it from what
I<00:01:24.700> can<00:01:24.820> see<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.509> screens<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.930> can

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
I can see on the screens you can

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.230 
I can see on the screens you can
definitely<00:01:26.289> tell<00:01:26.679> that<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:27.009> HTC<00:01:27.729> m8<00:01:28.000> has<00:01:28.210> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
definitely tell that the HTC m8 has a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.600 
definitely tell that the HTC m8 has a
more<00:01:28.509> saturated<00:01:28.990> display<00:01:29.410> looks<00:01:30.399> a<00:01:30.520> little

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
more saturated display looks a little

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
more saturated display looks a little
bit<00:01:30.789> sharper<00:01:31.240> as<00:01:31.330> well<00:01:31.509> from<00:01:31.750> what<00:01:31.899> I'm<00:01:32.050> seeing

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
bit sharper as well from what I'm seeing

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.469 
bit sharper as well from what I'm seeing
but<00:01:33.100> again<00:01:33.490> I<00:01:33.520> do<00:01:33.640> think<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.000> is<00:01:34.179> just<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
but again I do think that is just the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.169 
but again I do think that is just the
display<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:36.159> a<00:01:36.190> really<00:01:36.460> nice<00:01:36.670> display<00:01:36.970> on

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:37.179 
display it's a really nice display on

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:50.630 
display it's a really nice display on
the<00:01:37.270> HTC<00:01:37.570> m8

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.030 

Nexus<00:01:51.479> 5<00:01:51.659> has<00:01:51.900> optical<00:01:52.229> image<00:01:52.590> stabilization

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Nexus 5 has optical image stabilization

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.010 
Nexus 5 has optical image stabilization
the<00:01:53.520> m8<00:01:53.880> does<00:01:54.150> not<00:01:54.420> so<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:54.780> going<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:54.960> be

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
the m8 does not so that's going to be

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.219 
the m8 does not so that's going to be
again<00:01:55.409> an<00:01:55.590> interesting<00:01:56.220> comparison<00:01:57.140> see<00:01:58.140> if

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
again an interesting comparison see if

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:21.520 
again an interesting comparison see if
you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.440> see<00:01:58.560> a<00:01:58.590> difference<00:01:58.800> there

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.320 

nexus5<00:03:50.830> did<00:03:51.160> look<00:03:51.310> like<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.519> was<00:03:51.760> stammering<00:03:52.180> a

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
nexus5 did look like it was stammering a

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.839 
nexus5 did look like it was stammering a
little<00:03:52.629> bit<00:03:52.720> more<00:03:52.900> than<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.349> HTC<00:03:53.980> One<00:03:54.220> but

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
little bit more than the HTC One but

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.100 
little bit more than the HTC One but
we'll<00:03:54.970> have<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.269> if<00:03:55.420> that<00:03:55.629> actually<00:03:55.660> comes

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
we'll have to see if that actually comes

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.520 
we'll have to see if that actually comes
through<00:03:56.410> on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.890> on<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:58.080> on<00:03:59.080> the<00:03:59.140> video

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
through on the on the on the video

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:16.250 
through on the on the on the video
recording<00:03:59.950> itself

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.470 

again<00:04:17.260> I'll<00:04:17.410> just<00:04:17.590> say<00:04:17.770> the<00:04:18.010> screen<00:04:18.400> on<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.880> m8

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:19.480 
again I'll just say the screen on the m8

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.570 
again I'll just say the screen on the m8
just<00:04:19.750> makes<00:04:19.990> the<00:04:20.230> image<00:04:20.440> look<00:04:20.890> better<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.459> it

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
just makes the image look better so it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.700 
just makes the image look better so it
looks<00:04:21.610> like<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.210> video<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:22.840> better<00:04:23.050> on<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.440> m8

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
looks like the video is better on the m8

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.580 
looks like the video is better on the m8
but<00:04:24.400> I'm<00:04:24.490> pretty<00:04:24.670> sure<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:26.050> is<00:04:26.200> just<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
but I'm pretty sure that is just the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.860 
but I'm pretty sure that is just the
screen<00:04:26.920> so<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.910> guys<00:04:28.090> will<00:04:28.270> have<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.450> tell<00:04:28.750> me
