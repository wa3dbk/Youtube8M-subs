you have to do when someone throws you
the<00:01:59.040> ball<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.520> worry<00:02:00.450> about<00:02:00.509> tucking<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the ball is just worry about tucking it

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.209 
the ball is just worry about tucking it
away<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.380> don't<00:02:01.530> even<00:02:01.710> have<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> worry<00:02:02.130> about

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
away you don't even have to worry about

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.539 
away you don't even have to worry about
catching<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.219> once<00:02:05.219> it<00:02:05.399> hits

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
catching it because and once it hits

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.550 
catching it because and once it hits
those<00:02:05.790> gloves<00:02:06.210> let's<00:02:06.810> say<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.079> caught<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
those gloves let's say you caught it

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.690 
those gloves let's say you caught it
about<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.459> these<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.270> not

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
about with these it's not

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.240 
about with these it's not
sticky<00:02:10.300> but<00:02:10.539> I<00:02:10.810> think<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.560> grip<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:11.980> better

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
sticky but I think the grip is better

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.449 
sticky but I think the grip is better
and<00:02:12.640> it'll<00:02:13.030> last<00:02:13.209> longer<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.160> it's<00:02:15.160> not<00:02:15.250> like

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
and it'll last longer so it's not like

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.420 
and it'll last longer so it's not like
