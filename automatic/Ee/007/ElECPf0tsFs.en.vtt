00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
anyway so I got them here and I thought

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.500 
anyway so I got them here and I thought
I<00:01:16.810> would<00:01:16.870> that<00:01:17.770> see<00:01:18.190> they<00:01:18.430> they<00:01:18.850> have<00:01:19.120> they

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
I would that see they they have they

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.670 
I would that see they they have they
shoot<00:01:20.080> stuff<00:01:20.410> because<00:01:20.890> their<00:01:21.040> turrets<00:01:21.400> so<00:01:22.300> I

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
shoot stuff because their turrets so I

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090 
shoot stuff because their turrets so I
decided<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:23.980> was<00:01:24.190> going<00:01:24.670> to<00:01:24.880> put<00:01:25.090> like<00:01:25.650> mobs<00:01:26.650> in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
decided I was going to put like mobs in

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.360 
decided I was going to put like mobs in
here<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.910> see<00:01:28.150> if<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:29.410> turrets<00:01:29.740> will<00:01:29.979> attack

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
here and see if the turrets will attack

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.540 
here and see if the turrets will attack
them<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:31.080> then<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.290> got<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:32.680> idea<00:01:32.710> what<00:01:33.310> if<00:01:33.340> I

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
them and then I got the idea what if I

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.120 
them and then I got the idea what if I
put<00:01:33.760> them<00:01:33.970> against<00:01:34.450> up<00:01:35.020> against<00:01:35.560> an<00:01:35.740> ender

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
put them against up against an ender

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.719 
put them against up against an ender
dragon

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
dragon

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.520 
dragon
so<00:01:37.360> that's<00:01:37.630> what<00:01:37.780> I'm<00:01:37.869> gonna<00:01:38.020> do<00:01:38.260> in<00:01:38.380> this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
so that's what I'm gonna do in this

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.719 
so that's what I'm gonna do in this
video<00:01:38.860> I'm<00:01:39.700> gonna<00:01:39.940> see<00:01:40.800> what<00:01:41.800> they<00:01:41.979> can<00:01:42.160> do<00:01:42.310> to

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
video I'm gonna see what they can do to

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.770 
video I'm gonna see what they can do to
the<00:01:43.330> ender<00:01:43.660> dragon<00:01:44.140> and<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:48.150> while<00:01:49.150> ago<00:01:49.540> they

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
the ender dragon and a while ago they

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.570 
the ender dragon and a while ago they
were<00:01:49.840> shooting<00:01:50.590> those<00:01:50.920> slimes<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:54.010> hate

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
were shooting those slimes and I hate

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.200 
were shooting those slimes and I hate
slimes<00:01:55.000> so<00:01:55.450> I<00:01:56.100> guess<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.400> could<00:01:57.640> use<00:01:57.670> them<00:01:58.060> as

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
slimes so I guess I could use them as

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.359 
slimes so I guess I could use them as
like<00:01:58.570> a<00:01:58.600> defense<00:01:59.880> but<00:02:00.880> anyway<00:02:02.009> here<00:02:03.009> we<00:02:03.160> go

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
we're gonna spawn an ender dragon and

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.790 
we're gonna spawn an ender dragon and
