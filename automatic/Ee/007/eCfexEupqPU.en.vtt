00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
roundup for the fifth generation iphone
supposedly<00:00:11.790> being<00:00:12.059> called<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.450> iphone<00:00:12.960> 4s

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
supposedly being called the iphone 4s

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.310 
supposedly being called the iphone 4s
now<00:00:14.400> why<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:14.940> being<00:00:15.240> called<00:00:15.420> an<00:00:15.570> iphone<00:00:15.900> 4s

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
now why is being called an iphone 4s

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.380 
now why is being called an iphone 4s
possibly<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.580> actually<00:00:17.970> just<00:00:18.150> came<00:00:18.270> out

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
possibly this actually just came out

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.359 
possibly this actually just came out
today<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.690> developers<00:00:19.590> are<00:00:19.800> getting<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
today that developers are getting the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.269 
today that developers are getting the
iphone<00:00:21.020> 4s<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.619> they're<00:00:22.769> referring<00:00:22.920> to

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
iphone 4s is what they're referring to

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.880 
iphone 4s is what they're referring to
it<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:24.300> got<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.689> a5<00:00:25.109> processor<00:00:25.350> in

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
it as and it's got the a5 processor in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.470 
it as and it's got the a5 processor in
it<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.130> it's<00:00:26.250> actually<00:00:26.369> just<00:00:26.730> essentially<00:00:27.390> an

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it so it's actually just essentially an

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.410 
it so it's actually just essentially an
iphone<00:00:27.750> 4<00:00:28.070> same<00:00:29.070> design<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> everything<00:00:29.820> with

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
iphone 4 same design and everything with

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.179 
iphone 4 same design and everything with
a<00:00:30.449> faster<00:00:30.960> chip<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> can't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
a faster chip in it so it you can't

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
a faster chip in it so it you can't
really<00:00:32.309> tell<00:00:32.640> if<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:32.940> but<00:00:33.870> supposedly

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
really tell if it is but supposedly

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.450 
really tell if it is but supposedly
developers<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:34.950> already<00:00:35.309> developing

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
developers are already developing

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.209 
developers are already developing
applications<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.719> run<00:00:36.750> with<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> a5

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
applications to run with the a5

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
applications to run with the a5
processor<00:00:38.480> to<00:00:39.480> better<00:00:39.809> perform<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.500> it

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
processor to better perform on it

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.380 
processor to better perform on it
because<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.340> supposedly<00:00:41.760> nine<00:00:42.059> times

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
because it's supposedly nine times

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.910 
because it's supposedly nine times
faster<00:00:42.480> graphics<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.530> it's<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.800> an

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
faster graphics and it's just an

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.860 
faster graphics and it's just an
all-around<00:00:44.100> better<00:00:44.610> processor<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.690> whether

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
all-around better processor so whether

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.420 
all-around better processor so whether
that's<00:00:45.989> true<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.620> we<00:00:46.950> don't<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.160> one

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
that's true or not we don't know one

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.910 
that's true or not we don't know one
hundred<00:00:47.760> percent<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.079> is<00:00:49.289> pretty<00:00:49.530> certain

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
hundred percent but it is pretty certain

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
hundred percent but it is pretty certain
that<00:00:50.100> apple<00:00:50.640> will<00:00:50.760> integrate<00:00:51.030> a5<00:00:51.600> processor

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that apple will integrate a5 processor

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470 
that apple will integrate a5 processor
into<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> iphone<00:00:52.980> 5<00:00:53.250> which<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> same<00:00:54.300> one

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
into the iphone 5 which is the same one

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.810 
into the iphone 5 which is the same one
that<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> ipad<00:00:55.469> 2<00:00:55.739> if<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.489> didn't<00:00:56.730> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that is in the ipad 2 if you didn't know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.729 
that is in the ipad 2 if you didn't know
the<00:00:57.360> next<00:00:57.510> thing<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.199> Apple<00:00:58.559> may

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the next thing is that Apple may

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.069 
the next thing is that Apple may
integrate<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.489> bigger<00:00:59.940> screen<00:01:00.300> supposedly<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
integrate a bigger screen supposedly a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.319 
integrate a bigger screen supposedly a
4-inch<00:01:01.590> screen<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:02.640> rumor<00:01:02.879> doesn't<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
4-inch screen this rumor doesn't have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.820 
4-inch screen this rumor doesn't have
too<00:01:03.600> much<00:01:03.780> weight<00:01:04.019> behind<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.530> don't<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
too much weight behind it I don't really

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.490 
too much weight behind it I don't really
agree<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.580> myself<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.720> don't<00:01:06.869> think<00:01:06.930> Apple

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
agree with it myself I don't think Apple

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.899 
agree with it myself I don't think Apple
wants<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.799> change<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> screen<00:01:08.369> size<00:01:08.610> right

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
wants to change the screen size right

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.429 
wants to change the screen size right
now<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.869> they're<00:01:09.990> happy<00:01:10.229> with<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
now I think they're happy with the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.719 
now I think they're happy with the
screen<00:01:10.680> size<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:11.040> have<00:01:11.070> plus<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.610> would

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
screen size they have plus that would

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
screen size they have plus that would
mean<00:01:11.850> developers<00:01:12.360> having<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.930> change<00:01:13.920> every

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
mean developers having to change every

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
mean developers having to change every
one<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.610> their<00:01:14.700> apps<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.090> fit<00:01:15.270> off<00:01:15.450> from<00:01:15.689> 5

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
one of their apps to fit off from 5

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.310 
one of their apps to fit off from 5
iPhone<00:01:17.040> 4s<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.270> they<00:01:18.479> may<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.810> come<00:01:19.170> out

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
iPhone 4s and they may actually come out

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.660 
iPhone 4s and they may actually come out
with<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.530> better<00:01:19.740> resolution<00:01:19.950> screen<00:01:20.520> which

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
with a better resolution screen which

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.980 
with a better resolution screen which
would<00:01:20.790> make<00:01:20.880> sense<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.689> running

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
would make sense because it is running

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.710 
would make sense because it is running
the<00:01:22.080> a5<00:01:22.350> processor<00:01:22.729> has<00:01:23.729> capabilities<00:01:24.540> to

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
the a5 processor has capabilities to

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200 
the a5 processor has capabilities to
have<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> better<00:01:25.140> screen<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.549> may<00:01:26.759> do<00:01:26.820> that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
have a better screen so they may do that

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.270 
have a better screen so they may do that
but<00:01:28.020> I'm<00:01:28.170> happy<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> retina<00:01:28.860> display<00:01:29.159> we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
but I'm happy of the retina display we

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.510 
but I'm happy of the retina display we
have<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.030> looks<00:01:30.210> fantastic<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
have now I think it looks fantastic and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.969 
have now I think it looks fantastic and
I'm<00:01:32.520> not<00:01:32.909> expecting<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.960> better<00:01:34.140> screen<00:01:34.470> now

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I'm not expecting a better screen now

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.590 
I'm not expecting a better screen now
remember<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.430> does<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> lot<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.390> weight

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
remember that does have a lot of weight

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.850 
remember that does have a lot of weight
behind<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.170> they're<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> be

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
behind it is that they're going to be

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.740 
behind it is that they're going to be

an 8 megapixel sony camera supposedly a

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
an 8 megapixel sony camera supposedly a

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
the sony president or whatever came out

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.510 
the sony president or whatever came out
and<00:01:46.110> accidentally<00:01:47.009> said<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.340> an<00:01:47.430> interview

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and accidentally said in an interview

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
and accidentally said in an interview
that<00:01:47.939> they're<00:01:48.119> working<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.570> camera<00:01:48.810> for<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that they're working on a camera for the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.889 
that they're working on a camera for the
iphone<00:01:49.950> 5<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.549> they're<00:01:51.149> working<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.540> 8

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
iphone 5 and they're working with 8

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.289 
iphone 5 and they're working with 8
megapixel<00:01:52.439> cameras<00:01:52.799> now<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:54.210> probably

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
megapixel cameras now so it's probably

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.760 
megapixel cameras now so it's probably
going<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.750> happen<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.470> going<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> be<00:01:55.740> a

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
going to happen it's going to be a

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
going to happen it's going to be a
better<00:01:55.920> camera<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.909> iphone<00:01:57.180> 5<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:57.840> it's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
better camera in the iphone 5 so if it's

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.620 
better camera in the iphone 5 so if it's
a<00:01:58.020> mega<00:01:58.259> pixels<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.890> may<00:01:59.219> feature<00:01:59.610> 1080p<00:02:00.360> video

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630

developers<00:02:19.530> haven't<00:02:19.830> gotten<00:02:20.040> their<00:02:20.190> hands<00:02:20.370> on

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
developers haven't gotten their hands on

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.110 
developers haven't gotten their hands on
the<00:02:20.700> iphone<00:02:21.030> 4s<00:02:21.510> again<00:02:22.410> this<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.709> a<00:02:22.739> prototype

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the iphone 4s again this is a prototype

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.840 
the iphone 4s again this is a prototype
but<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.840> does<00:02:25.050> kind<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.709> go<00:02:25.830> along<00:02:25.980> with<00:02:26.370> some

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
but it does kind of go along with some

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.520 
but it does kind of go along with some
of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> rumors<00:02:27.209> saying<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.720> did<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.110> device

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
of the rumors saying that did the device

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.990 
of the rumors saying that did the device
were<00:02:28.709> actually<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.190> same<00:02:29.400> design<00:02:29.760> as

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
were actually have the same design as

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.330 
were actually have the same design as
the<00:02:30.090> iphone<00:02:30.989> 4<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> design<00:02:31.709> probably

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
the iphone 4 so the design probably

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.430 
the iphone 4 so the design probably
isn't<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.030> change<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.660> agree<00:02:34.290> with<00:02:34.410> that

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
isn't going to change I agree with that

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110 
isn't going to change I agree with that
I<00:02:34.830> think<00:02:35.190> you're<00:02:35.310> kind<00:02:35.489> of<00:02:35.520> going<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.819> do<00:02:35.910> like

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
I think you're kind of going to do like

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.780 
I think you're kind of going to do like
an<00:02:36.269> iphone<00:02:36.600> 3g<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.560> 3gs<00:02:37.590> upgrade<00:02:38.489> kind<00:02:38.700> of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
an iphone 3g to 3gs upgrade kind of

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.759 
an iphone 3g to 3gs upgrade kind of
thing<00:02:38.940> where<00:02:39.060> it's<00:02:39.209> just<00:02:39.269> like<00:02:39.530> specs<00:02:40.530> and

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
thing where it's just like specs and

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.229 
thing where it's just like specs and
they<00:02:40.830> make<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.099> faster<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.670> more<00:02:42.180> powerful

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
they make it faster and more powerful

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.270 
they make it faster and more powerful
and<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.230> think<00:02:43.440> that's<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:43.920> apples

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
and I think that's going to be apples

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.600 
and I think that's going to be apples
selling<00:02:45.150> points<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.810> iphone<00:02:46.110> 5<00:02:46.350> iphone<00:02:46.950> 4s

what<00:02:47.819> everyone<00:02:48.120> refer<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.720> now<00:02:49.110> if<00:02:49.260> they

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
what everyone refer to it as now if they

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.900 
what everyone refer to it as now if they
don't<00:02:49.560> change<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:49.920> design<00:02:50.069> hopefully<00:02:50.760> they

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
don't change the design hopefully they

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.509 
don't change the design hopefully they
will<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.630> something<00:02:52.080> better<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.620> fix<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
will do something better to fix the the

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.180 
will do something better to fix the the
signal<00:02:54.000> on<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.299> iphone<00:02:55.080> 5<00:02:55.319> they<00:02:55.769> did<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> little

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
signal on the iphone 5 they did a little

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.539 
signal on the iphone 5 they did a little
bit<00:02:56.370> only<00:02:56.819> verizon<00:02:57.299> iphone<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.250> they<00:02:59.250> didn't

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
bit only verizon iphone but they didn't

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.970 
bit only verizon iphone but they didn't
fix<00:02:59.819> it<00:03:00.000> completely<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.780> antennas<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.410> on

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
fix it completely so the antennas out on

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.229 
fix it completely so the antennas out on
the<00:03:02.069> side<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.430> phones<00:03:02.640> hopefully<00:03:03.060> they

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
the side of the phones hopefully they

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.270 
the side of the phones hopefully they
can<00:03:03.299> do<00:03:03.480> something<00:03:03.510> to<00:03:04.080> fix<00:03:04.110> that<00:03:04.530> I'm<00:03:05.069> sure

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
can do something to fix that I'm sure

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.100 
can do something to fix that I'm sure
they've<00:03:05.519> been<00:03:05.700> working<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.540> fix<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.900> so

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
they've been working to fix that so

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.509 
they've been working to fix that so
hopefully<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.620> will<00:03:07.769> be<00:03:07.830> integrated<00:03:08.459> in

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
hopefully that will be integrated in

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.820 
hopefully that will be integrated in
iphone<00:03:08.850> 5<00:03:09.090> and<00:03:09.330> 4<00:03:09.810> you<00:03:09.900> dorks<00:03:10.319> it<00:03:10.530> waited

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
iphone 5 and 4 you dorks it waited

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.340 
iphone 5 and 4 you dorks it waited
forever<00:03:11.040> for<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.519> iphone<00:03:11.819> 4<00:03:12.060> white<00:03:12.450> they

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
forever for the iphone 4 white they

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.099 
forever for the iphone 4 white they
probably<00:03:13.650> will<00:03:13.950> have<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.340> iphone<00:03:15.090> 5<00:03:15.450> white<00:03:15.780> at

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
probably will have a iphone 5 white at

don't have to wait like forever to get
it<00:03:20.850> just<00:03:21.540> because<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.989> color<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.530> it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
it just because it's a color and it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.650 
it just because it's a color and it's
pretty<00:03:23.190> certain<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.579> they<00:03:23.760> will<00:03:23.940> do<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.269> cdma

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
pretty certain that they will do is cdma

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
on ATT and Verizon I don't see why they

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.979 
on ATT and Verizon I don't see why they
would<00:03:29.070> leave<00:03:29.400> out<00:03:29.609> the<00:03:30.090> verizon<00:03:30.450> iphone<00:03:30.570> in

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
would leave out the verizon iphone in

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.710 
would leave out the verizon iphone in
the<00:03:31.079> dust<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.590> let<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.280> TV<00:03:32.970> so<00:03:33.150> far<00:03:33.420> ahead<00:03:33.480> of

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
them so did it's pretty certain that

them so did it's pretty certain that
they<00:03:35.700> will<00:03:35.880> come<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.239> for<00:03:36.959> both<00:03:37.109> carriers<00:03:37.530> now

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
highly doubt it right now just because

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.259 
highly doubt it right now just because
the<00:03:44.459> 4g<00:03:45.090> networks<00:03:45.750> are<00:03:45.989> some<00:03:46.230> new<00:03:46.440> an<00:03:46.850> AT&amp;T<00:03:47.850> is

fast<00:03:51.930> but<00:03:52.620> i<00:03:52.680> just<00:03:53.130> don't<00:03:53.250> think<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.549> it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
fast but i just don't think that it's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.520 
fast but i just don't think that it's
ready<00:03:54.000> yet<00:03:54.269> maybe<00:03:54.540> for<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.870> iphone<00:03:55.260> 6

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530

generation<00:03:56.930> that<00:03:57.930> sounds<00:03:58.440> good<00:03:58.859> but<00:03:59.310> i<00:03:59.640> highly

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
generation that sounds good but i highly

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.330 
generation that sounds good but i highly
doubt<00:04:00.420> it's<00:04:00.720> gonna<00:04:00.870> be<00:04:00.989> ready<00:04:01.200> for<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.010> iphone

I've been hearing a lot about is that

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.530 
I've been hearing a lot about is that
they<00:04:08.400> are<00:04:08.459> working<00:04:08.670> on<00:04:09.000> better<00:04:09.209> voice

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
they are working on better voice

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.840 
they are working on better voice
controls<00:04:10.049> for<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.290> iphone<00:04:10.650> so<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.639> will

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
controls for the iphone so that it will

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.640 
controls for the iphone so that it will
actually<00:04:12.030> you<00:04:12.810> actually<00:04:13.200> be<00:04:13.319> able<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.470> use

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
actually you actually be able to use

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.890 
actually you actually be able to use
your<00:04:13.680> your<00:04:14.430> voice<00:04:14.970> controls<00:04:15.180> with<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.720> like

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
your your voice controls with it like

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.960 
your your voice controls with it like
right<00:04:16.049> now<00:04:16.229> they're<00:04:16.739> not<00:04:16.889> that<00:04:17.039> great<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.820> it

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
right now they're not that great so it

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.319 
right now they're not that great so it
would<00:04:18.120> be<00:04:18.239> cool<00:04:18.419> if<00:04:18.450> they<00:04:18.720> added<00:04:19.019> some

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
would be cool if they added some

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:20.849 
would be cool if they added some
I<00:04:19.389> don't<00:04:19.780> really<00:04:19.900> use<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.169> feature<00:04:20.500> very

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
I don't really use that feature very

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.290 
I don't really use that feature very
much<00:04:21.069> though<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:21.459> even<00:04:21.519> if<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:21.819> was<00:04:21.970> better<00:04:22.180> I

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
much though and even if it was better I

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.520 
much though and even if it was better I
probably<00:04:22.629> wouldn't<00:04:22.930> use<00:04:23.020> it<00:04:23.050> just<00:04:23.289> because

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
probably wouldn't use it just because

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.129 
probably wouldn't use it just because
I'm<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.669> that<00:04:24.879> lazy<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.389> just<00:04:25.629> say<00:04:25.810> something

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
I'm not that lazy to just say something

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.719 
I'm not that lazy to just say something
instead<00:04:26.470> of<00:04:26.530> just<00:04:26.620> tapping<00:04:26.919> on<00:04:27.129> my<00:04:27.220> phone<00:04:27.460> it's

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
instead of just tapping on my phone it's

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.279 
instead of just tapping on my phone it's
not<00:04:27.879> that<00:04:28.000> big<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.330> deal<00:04:28.479> and<00:04:28.719> I'm<00:04:28.930> guessing

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
not that big of a deal and I'm guessing

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.559 
not that big of a deal and I'm guessing
that<00:04:29.319> they're<00:04:29.590> wide<00:04:29.889> hdmi<00:04:30.699> out<00:04:30.939> support<00:04:31.419> for

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
that they're wide hdmi out support for

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.200 
that they're wide hdmi out support for
their<00:04:31.689> little<00:04:31.870> AV<00:04:32.430> digital<00:04:33.430> adapter<00:04:33.789> cable

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
their little AV digital adapter cable

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.059 
their little AV digital adapter cable
you<00:04:34.840> can<00:04:34.870> actually<00:04:35.080> do<00:04:35.349> it<00:04:35.469> on<00:04:35.560> my<00:04:35.680> phone<00:04:35.710> for

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:36.069 
you can actually do it on my phone for

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.399 
you can actually do it on my phone for
with<00:04:36.219> a<00:04:36.280> little<00:04:36.430> jailbreak<00:04:36.879> tweak<00:04:37.210> but<00:04:37.509> I'm

00:04:38.399 --> 00:04:38.409 
with a little jailbreak tweak but I'm

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.200 
with a little jailbreak tweak but I'm
sure<00:04:38.650> though<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.860> added<00:04:39.099> just<00:04:39.159> because<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:39.879> died

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
sure though I added just because it died

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.670 
sure though I added just because it died
back<00:04:40.449> to<00:04:40.599> can<00:04:40.810> do<00:04:40.900> it<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.199> i'm<00:04:41.349> sure<00:04:41.379> that

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
back to can do it so i'm sure that

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.679 
back to can do it so i'm sure that
iphone<00:04:41.949> 4s<00:04:42.370> will<00:04:42.580> be<00:04:42.669> able<00:04:42.759> to<00:04:42.879> do<00:04:42.939> it<00:04:42.969> i'm

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
iphone 4s will be able to do it i'm

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.409 
iphone 4s will be able to do it i'm
guessing<00:04:43.930> it<00:04:44.199> will<00:04:44.319> launch<00:04:44.530> with<00:04:44.770> iOS<00:04:45.129> 5<00:04:45.419> when

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
guessing it will launch with iOS 5 when

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.200 
guessing it will launch with iOS 5 when
iphone<00:04:46.870> 5<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.259> ours<00:04:47.469> I<00:04:48.250> don't<00:04:48.759> really<00:04:48.879> know<00:04:49.030> any

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
iphone 5 is ours I don't really know any
