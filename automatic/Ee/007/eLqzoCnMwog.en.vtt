and this one is I guess for inserting
the<00:03:03.790> SIM<00:03:04.000> card<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.290> one<00:03:05.560> does<00:03:05.770> not<00:03:05.920> have

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
the SIM card but this one does not have

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.650 
the SIM card but this one does not have
any<00:03:08.700> interface<00:03:09.700> look<00:03:09.910> like<00:03:10.120> as<00:03:10.269> you<00:03:10.360> can<00:03:10.510> see

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
any interface look like as you can see

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.300 
any interface look like as you can see
we<00:03:10.810> have<00:03:10.989> touched<00:03:11.230> active<00:03:11.739> screen<00:03:11.950> over<00:03:12.190> there

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
we have touched active screen over there

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.460 
we have touched active screen over there
and<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.910> can<00:03:13.120> directly<00:03:13.780> go<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.140> desktop

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
and I can directly go to the desktop

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.860 
and I can directly go to the desktop
from<00:03:14.830> here<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.310> show<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.580> what<00:03:16.390> all<00:03:16.540> we<00:03:16.840> have

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
from here to show you what all we have

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.500 
from here to show you what all we have
as<00:03:17.560> far<00:03:17.620> as<00:03:17.920> hardware<00:03:18.340> configuration<00:03:18.850> goes<00:03:19.030> so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
as far as hardware configuration goes so

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.030 
as far as hardware configuration goes so
let's<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:19.930> go<00:03:20.050> into<00:03:20.260> properties<00:03:20.470> for<00:03:20.920> this

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
let's just go into properties for this

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.650 
let's just go into properties for this
one<00:03:21.250> and<00:03:21.880> I<00:03:21.940> can<00:03:22.120> show<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.510> configuration

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
one and I can show you the configuration

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.210 
one and I can show you the configuration
so<00:03:23.560> it<00:03:23.620> comes<00:03:23.830> with<00:03:23.920> Intel<00:03:24.340> items<00:03:24.640> jet<00:03:25.050> 370

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
so it comes with Intel items jet 370

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.520

designed we have we have the loudspeaker
over<00:04:15.340> there<00:04:15.550> okay

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
over there okay

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.840 
over there okay
loudspeaker<00:04:17.049> or<00:04:17.410> not<00:04:17.590> here<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:18.040> get<00:04:18.430> okay<00:04:18.670> loud

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
speaker actually it is at the backside

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.260 
speaker actually it is at the backside
so<00:04:20.950> there<00:04:21.370> is<00:04:21.459> no<00:04:21.640> blockage<00:04:22.060> for<00:04:22.210> the

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
so there is no blockage for the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.420 
so there is no blockage for the
loudspeaker<00:04:22.750> as<00:04:22.870> well<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.410> case<00:04:23.710> you<00:04:23.950> actually

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
loudspeaker as well in case you actually

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.620 
loudspeaker as well in case you actually
mounted<00:04:24.880> like<00:04:25.810> this<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.820> is<00:04:27.850> a<00:04:27.970> magnetic<00:04:28.300> mount

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
mounted like this it is a magnetic mount

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.840 
mounted like this it is a magnetic mount
it<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:28.930> not<00:04:29.140> going<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.560> slip<00:04:29.800> but<00:04:30.310> don't<00:04:30.610> shake

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
it is not going to slip but don't shake

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:31.020 
it is not going to slip but don't shake
it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.200 
it
they<00:04:31.330> might<00:04:31.630> get<00:04:31.840> actually<00:04:32.760> detached<00:04:33.760> in<00:04:34.030> that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
they might get actually detached in that

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.880 
they might get actually detached in that
case<00:04:34.420> so<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.020> is<00:04:35.140> how<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:35.290> can<00:04:35.500> carry<00:04:35.680> it

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
case so this is how you can carry it

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.890 
case so this is how you can carry it
like<00:04:36.070> a<00:04:36.100> book<00:04:36.370> this<00:04:37.000> lift<00:04:37.210> cover<00:04:37.450> over<00:04:37.720> there

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
like a book this lift cover over there

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.830 
like a book this lift cover over there
is<00:04:38.290> kind<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.490> nicely<00:04:40.150> designed<00:04:40.270> fill<00:04:40.600> cover

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
is kind of a nicely designed fill cover

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.110 
is kind of a nicely designed fill cover
this<00:04:41.050> can<00:04:41.470> actually<00:04:41.620> fold<00:04:42.040> it<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.340> this<00:04:42.400> so

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
this can actually fold it like this so

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.960 
this can actually fold it like this so
you<00:04:43.210> can<00:04:43.390> actually<00:04:43.510> use<00:04:43.750> it<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.580> as<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:45.820> can

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
you can actually use it so as you can

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.730 
you can actually use it so as you can
see<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.510> how<00:04:46.660> we<00:04:46.720> can<00:04:46.990> actually<00:04:47.020> use<00:04:47.530> this

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
see this is how we can actually use this

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.490 
see this is how we can actually use this
tablet<00:04:48.160> like<00:04:48.640> a<00:04:48.670> laptop<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.990> can<00:04:50.230> show<00:04:50.440> you

tablet like a laptop and I can show you

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.250 
tablet like a laptop and I can show you
that<00:04:50.740> again<00:04:51.070> I<00:04:51.400> just<00:04:51.700> need<00:04:52.120> to<00:04:52.420> flip<00:04:52.750> this<00:04:52.990> part

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
that again I just need to flip this part

00:04:53.260 --> 00:05:02.850 
that again I just need to flip this part
like<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.950> and<00:04:54.220> then<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.110> hold<00:04:56.110> it<00:05:01.860> stack

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
like this and then you hold it stack

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.830 
like this and then you hold it stack
which<00:05:03.250> the<00:05:03.430> edge<00:05:03.520> with<00:05:03.669> that<00:05:03.790> side<00:05:04.030> and<00:05:04.600> first

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
which the edge with that side and first

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.990 
which the edge with that side and first
you<00:05:04.960> have<00:05:05.140> done<00:05:05.320> that<00:05:05.580> now<00:05:06.580> you<00:05:06.640> can<00:05:06.880> actually

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.570 
you have done that now you can actually
use<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.600> like<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> laptop<00:05:08.380> so<00:05:09.220> we<00:05:09.340> have<00:05:09.550> a
