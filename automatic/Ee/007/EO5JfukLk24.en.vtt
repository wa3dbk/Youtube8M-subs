wiggle<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.720> get<00:03:59.870> the<00:03:59.960> bees<00:04:00.140> to<00:04:00.350> move<00:04:00.500> out<00:04:00.620> of

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
wiggle it to get the bees to move out of

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.290 
wiggle it to get the bees to move out of
the<00:04:00.770> way<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.220> don't<00:04:01.280> smash<00:04:01.730> as<00:04:01.940> many<00:04:02.120> when<00:04:02.270> I

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
the way so I don't smash as many when I

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:08.410 
the way so I don't smash as many when I
put<00:04:02.900> the<00:04:02.990> quilt<00:04:03.140> box<00:04:03.410> on<00:04:05.950> so<00:04:06.950> this<00:04:07.100> one<00:04:07.420> we've

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
put the quilt box on so this one we've

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.180 
put the quilt box on so this one we've
cut<00:04:08.570> this<00:04:08.690> little<00:04:08.840> flap<00:04:09.140> so<00:04:09.410> we<00:04:09.530> can<00:04:09.650> set<00:04:09.860> a<00:04:09.890> jar

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
cut this little flap so we can set a jar

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.220 
cut this little flap so we can set a jar
feeder<00:04:10.430> on<00:04:10.520> top<00:04:10.640> or<00:04:11.390> you<00:04:11.570> can<00:04:11.720> use<00:04:11.900> a<00:04:11.930> double

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
feeder on top or you can use a double

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:20.210 
feeder on top or you can use a double
jar<00:04:12.560> feeder<00:04:12.800> which<00:04:13.370> takes<00:04:13.850> two<00:04:14.060> jars

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.069 

this<00:04:20.880> type<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.090> feeder<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.630> has<00:04:21.750> some<00:04:21.930> holes

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
this type of feeder just has some holes

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.860 
this type of feeder just has some holes
in<00:04:22.350> its<00:04:22.500> lid<00:04:23.000> it's<00:04:24.000> just<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.300> mason<00:04:24.660> jar<00:04:24.690> with

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
in its lid it's just a mason jar with

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.630 
in its lid it's just a mason jar with
holes<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.530> then<00:04:25.620> one<00:04:25.800> part<00:04:25.950> sugar<00:04:26.190> one<00:04:26.610> part

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
holes and then one part sugar one part

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.840 
holes and then one part sugar one part
water<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.240> then<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.800> can<00:04:28.830> upturn<00:04:29.340> it<00:04:29.490> outside

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
water and then you can upturn it outside

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.800 
water and then you can upturn it outside
the<00:04:30.270> hive<00:04:30.450> let<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.470> drip<00:04:31.650> for<00:04:31.680> a<00:04:31.890> second<00:04:32.220> and

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
the hive let it drip for a second and

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.580 
the hive let it drip for a second and
then<00:04:33.810> it<00:04:33.930> should<00:04:34.080> stop<00:04:34.260> dripping<00:04:34.500> eventually

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
then it should stop dripping eventually

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.650 
then it should stop dripping eventually
and<00:04:37.590> at<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:38.580> point<00:04:38.820> I'm<00:04:38.970> going<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.210> slide

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
and at this point I'm going to slide

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.650 
and at this point I'm going to slide
this<00:04:39.810> over<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.140> little<00:04:40.970> to<00:04:41.970> cover<00:04:42.210> up<00:04:42.390> some<00:04:42.630> of

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
this over a little to cover up some of

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.110 
this over a little to cover up some of
that<00:04:42.780> and<00:04:43.710> I'm<00:04:43.830> just<00:04:43.980> going<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> kind<00:04:44.370> of<00:04:44.430> leave

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
that and I'm just going to kind of leave

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.620 
that and I'm just going to kind of leave
that<00:04:45.300> be<00:04:45.450> out<00:04:45.540> of<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.690> way<00:04:45.810> and<00:04:46.080> set<00:04:46.890> it<00:04:46.980> on<00:04:47.630> the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
that be out of the way and set it on the

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.790 
that be out of the way and set it on the
bees<00:04:48.780> can<00:04:48.960> come<00:04:49.110> up<00:04:49.230> and<00:04:49.380> feed<00:04:49.500> through<00:04:49.650> those

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
bees can come up and feed through those

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.260 
bees can come up and feed through those
holes<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.310> then<00:04:51.030> we<00:04:51.120> can<00:04:51.270> take<00:04:51.450> an<00:04:51.570> extra<00:04:51.750> box

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
holes and then we can take an extra box

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.520 
holes and then we can take an extra box
again<00:04:54.270> try<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.750> wiggle<00:04:55.200> it<00:04:55.260> when<00:04:55.410> you're

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
again try and wiggle it when you're

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.440 
again try and wiggle it when you're
setting<00:04:55.800> it<00:04:55.860> on<00:04:55.980> so<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:56.370> don't<00:04:56.550> crush<00:04:57.090> as<00:04:57.240> many

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
setting it on so you don't crush as many

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.600 
setting it on so you don't crush as many
bees<00:04:58.130> we<00:04:59.130> will<00:04:59.340> kill<00:04:59.520> these

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.550 

at<00:05:03.509> this<00:05:03.629> point<00:05:03.810> we<00:05:03.990> can<00:05:04.110> put<00:05:04.229> our<00:05:04.319> quilt

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
at this point we can put our quilt

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:11.970 
at this point we can put our quilt
blocks<00:05:04.740> on<00:05:04.889> top

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.820 

and<00:05:12.400> we<00:05:12.580> can<00:05:12.760> replace<00:05:13.090> our<00:05:13.330> roof

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.969

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
and then we wait these that remain in

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.320 
and then we wait these that remain in
the<00:05:22.009> package<00:05:22.400> they<00:05:22.580> should<00:05:22.849> walk<00:05:23.090> their<00:05:23.300> way

then in two or three days we're going to

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.469 
then in two or three days we're going to
want<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.460> go<00:05:28.610> in<00:05:28.789> and<00:05:28.940> look<00:05:29.030> at<00:05:29.180> that<00:05:29.300> queen
