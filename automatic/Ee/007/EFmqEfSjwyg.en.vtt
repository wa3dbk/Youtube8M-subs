00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
your fingers like gloves if you guys

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.310 
your fingers like gloves if you guys
know<00:02:52.180> what<00:02:52.240> I'm<00:02:52.480> talking<00:02:52.870> about<00:02:52.900> have<00:02:53.170> you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
know what I'm talking about have you

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.120 
know what I'm talking about have you
done<00:02:53.500> this<00:02:53.650> before

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.210 

then<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.520> coat<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:59.140> could<00:02:59.380> put<00:02:59.710> this<00:02:59.950> in

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
then just coat it you could put this in

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430 
then just coat it you could put this in
a<00:03:00.280> little<00:03:00.580> baggie<00:03:01.180> and<00:03:01.720> then<00:03:01.930> just<00:03:02.230> shake<00:03:02.380> it

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
a little baggie and then just shake it

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.270 
a little baggie and then just shake it
as<00:03:02.740> well<00:03:03.070> but<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.640> find<00:03:04.240> that<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.950> do<00:03:06.130> this

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
as well but I find that when you do this

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.710 
as well but I find that when you do this
manually<00:03:07.150> you<00:03:07.420> get<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.950> crunch<00:03:09.340> in<00:03:09.730> every

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
manually you get the crunch in every

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.740 
manually you get the crunch in every
crack<00:03:14.070> then<00:03:15.070> just<00:03:15.370> Pat<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.670> lightly

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
crack then just Pat it lightly

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.730 
crack then just Pat it lightly
so<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.680> sticks

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:32.260 

I'll<00:03:24.460> have<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.910> oil<00:03:25.150> in<00:03:25.920> 325

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:40.150 

and<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.230> endless<00:03:35.800> pain<00:03:36.800> this<00:03:37.100> as<00:03:37.430> well<00:03:39.160> you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
and the endless pain this as well you

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.490 
and the endless pain this as well you
can't<00:03:40.400> put<00:03:40.640> in<00:03:40.790> more<00:03:41.180> than<00:03:41.240> one<00:03:41.750> at<00:03:41.870> a<00:03:41.900> time<00:03:42.200> but

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
can't put in more than one at a time but

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.110 
can't put in more than one at a time but
I'm<00:03:42.650> just<00:03:42.860> going<00:03:43.040> to<00:03:43.070> do<00:03:43.220> what<00:03:43.400> at<00:03:43.550> a<00:03:43.580> time<00:03:43.880> just

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
good too but this one is just really

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.550 
good too but this one is just really
tiny<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.639> it's<00:04:56.789> just<00:04:56.999> exactly<00:04:57.360> where<00:04:58.229> as<00:04:58.289> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
tiny so it's just exactly where as the

tiny so it's just exactly where as the
door<00:04:58.800> I'd<00:04:58.979> probably<00:04:59.219> have<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.490> cut<00:04:59.819> it<00:04:59.939> just

door I'd probably have to cut it just

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.530 
door I'd probably have to cut it just
drop<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.080> chicken<00:05:01.289> bullion<00:05:01.770> cubes

let's go ahead and let it boil for a
little<00:05:06.570> bit<00:05:06.750> okay<00:05:07.470> now<00:05:08.390> you<00:05:09.390> can<00:05:09.420> mix<00:05:09.870> this

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
little bit okay now you can mix this

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:17.890 
little bit okay now you can mix this
ahead<00:05:12.290> then<00:05:13.290> one<00:05:13.560> that's<00:05:14.040> a<00:05:14.310> little<00:05:14.730> bit

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.379 

make<00:05:18.260> sure<00:05:18.560> we<00:05:18.680> made<00:05:18.889> earlier<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:19.820> give<00:05:20.210> it<00:05:20.330> a

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
make sure we made earlier and give it a

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.570 
make sure we made earlier and give it a
face
