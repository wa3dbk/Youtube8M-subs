00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:35.760
 the turkey is very new to the mountain 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.059
 colossal in these by cuzco a machu picchu 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.019
 It's the Amazonas kaka team. We did it. 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.129
 a very radical thing that went from the jungle 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.860
 to the sacred valley machu picchu is that it is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.589
 the most famous tourist destination is the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.129
 turkey that we went to the amazon marcel 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:01:03.030
 It's between what people know and then we 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.430
 we were staying in the nice branch of cabo 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.400
 clean is the most beautiful beyond 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.130
 The sacred valley is beautiful, it's an hour from 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.130
 opening the place where you are 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.299
 the sea is the hotel is wonderful has a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.190
 Incredible space has a pool 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.590
 wonderful with a pool that is half 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.479
 closed half open and legal that is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.050
 in the middle of the valley just in the place 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.850
 full of mountains and seemingly well 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:40.080
 cold but the pool is more or less 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.080
 heated very heated demand 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
 we had a good experience 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.490
 interesting in another hotel in the valley 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.550
 sacred called honest inn and the falls 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:54.850
 it's a bike is the bar wind 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.490
 monastery is actually a hint of a 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 We further note that the tango linka 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.570
 but a very nice food experience 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.530
 It's very good too. 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.709
 and then the one before us to macho picchu 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.940
 is that the best preserved Inca city in 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.900
 one of the seven wonders of the world to us 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.500
 went to another Inca ruin that the 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.500
 ollantaytambo 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.930
 in fact it was an Inca fortress is a 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.930
 ruin very interesting so for who 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.489
 of course you are interested in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.730
 Inca culture 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.120
 so the last agriculture the last 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.459
 great empire that I have and turkey knot 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.299
 culture included last great cultures 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.610
 that it was companies that need it 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.620
 Incan culture and especially 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.870
 if this support we have now gained 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.269
 culture bin al there is not wanders in 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:59.500
 Cuzco for now we are the one you have 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:02.640
 museum there were books in these cases 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.620
 we have a volume of water 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:09.390
 we have traditional fights in the language 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.390
 I would have had a blowjob I always had 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.799
 One thing I did not know is that I found 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.590
 curious is that irã bié was born in 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.780
 honolulu and interesting avaiano reading right 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:33.519
 and is recent and has not been discovered either 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.519
 in 1911 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.870
 chop till we got back the 3 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:46.959
 just that it has the name of the discoverer 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.640
 is roth asked is ryan bingham is the 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:56.159
 more luxurious service with a turkey rail 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.079
 dinner aboard the train with and jean 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:09.310
 even had a very lively party at the 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:11.910
 noise Cusco is sensational is was the 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.340
 capital of the Inca empire during 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.979
 basically all 30 Inca and is 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.160
 awesome very beautiful, huh? 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.820
 we stayed at the hotel next to a place 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.360
 tourist destination called ki kant to which 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.210
 very interesting for me is a place 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.210
 more interesting than cuzco as a museum 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.229
 Now one thing I found incredible is that 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.169
 you just see that the 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:42.960
 Spanish networks built a church 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.960
 catholic church on top of the Inca walls 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:49.680
 I loved course that gives us momentum 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:54.370
 also had a gastronomic experience 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.190
 in the census find cariri mec that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.770
 works with virgílio martins do 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:04.120
 INEMA center and mark as three 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.760
 hot spots cuzco she goes and israel and 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.530
 we try to use the products of these regions 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.810
 that we have to be gray 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.419
 We are very proud of your culture. 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.580
 Inca because this day and I did not know the 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:19.539
 preserve there think everything was keeping 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.409
 its influence the administrations of the saints 49 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.039
 a story 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:24.039
 and us 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:32.380
 and the Incas in Brazil were king and queen 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.259
 rest of the great population the Indians 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.810
 many say that there were saints who 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:39.460
 are direct descendants 25 did not pass 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.069
 So many dreams that we do not know is one 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.830
 Shame, what is it because I was not going to 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:49.419

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:51.460
 and a way he did not know if he recovered 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:59.710
 then it's a lot of people who feel 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:01.630
 China and China .
