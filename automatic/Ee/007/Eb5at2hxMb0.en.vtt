00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280

although one of the things you are
brilliant<00:02:35.900> at<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.470> it's<00:02:36.829> not<00:02:37.010> really<00:02:37.250> giving

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
brilliant at is it's not really giving

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.400 
brilliant at is it's not really giving
an<00:02:37.640> opinion<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.209> simply<00:02:38.540> both<00:02:38.720> questions<00:02:39.200> I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
an opinion you simply both questions I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.800 
an opinion you simply both questions I
think<00:02:39.680> sometimes<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.310> your<00:02:40.340> shows<00:02:40.670> one<00:02:41.630> can

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
think sometimes in your shows one can

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.270 
think sometimes in your shows one can
work<00:02:41.959> out<00:02:42.140> where<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.440> stand<00:02:42.470> on<00:02:42.859> the<00:02:42.950> topic

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
work out where you stand on the topic

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.979 
work out where you stand on the topic
but<00:02:43.430> you<00:02:43.549> don't<00:02:43.700> see<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:43.910> is<00:02:44.000> your<00:02:44.180> job<00:02:44.450> you

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
but you don't see it is your job you

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.539 
but you don't see it is your job you
know<00:02:45.260> interesting<00:02:45.680> making<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:45.980> polemic<00:02:46.430> and

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:46.549 
know interesting making a polemic and

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:47.920 
know interesting making a polemic and
you're<00:02:46.639> not<00:02:46.790> interested<00:02:47.569> really<00:02:47.630> and<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> think

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
you're not interested really and I think

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.800 
you're not interested really and I think
giving<00:02:48.410> your<00:02:48.530> opinion<00:02:48.950> but<00:02:49.609> as<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:50.299> view<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.720> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
giving your opinion but as a view of the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.960 
giving your opinion but as a view of the
conclusion<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.380> draw<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:52.069> think<00:02:52.670> at<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.850> end

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
conclusion you draw I think at the end

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.640 
conclusion you draw I think at the end
of<00:02:53.120> this<00:02:53.209> program<00:02:53.630> is<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.440> those

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
of this program is that those

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.370 
of this program is that those
ultra-nationalist<00:02:55.489> those<00:02:55.840> Jewish<00:02:56.840> settlers

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
ultra-nationalist those Jewish settlers

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:58.690 
ultra-nationalist those Jewish settlers
who<00:02:57.500> are<00:02:57.620> taking<00:02:58.069> land<00:02:58.250> from<00:02:58.579> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
who are taking land from the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.129 
who are taking land from the
Palestinians<00:02:58.730> on<00:02:59.359> the<00:02:59.450> basis<00:02:59.810> of<00:02:59.930> something

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:00.139 
Palestinians on the basis of something

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.590 
Palestinians on the basis of something
that<00:03:00.319> was<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:00.560> Genesis<00:03:01.280> what<00:03:02.150> they're<00:03:02.299> doing

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
that was in Genesis what they're doing

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.020 
that was in Genesis what they're doing
isn't<00:03:02.870> helpful<00:03:03.170> right<00:03:04.130> yes<00:03:04.579> yeah<00:03:04.819> and<00:03:04.850> they're

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
isn't helpful right yes yeah and they're

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.990 
isn't helpful right yes yeah and they're
probably<00:03:05.959> be<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> backlash<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.639> program

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
probably be a backlash to the program

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.530 
probably be a backlash to the program
because<00:03:08.569> of<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.840> backlash<00:03:09.769> from<00:03:10.160> who<00:03:10.940> some

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
because of that backlash from who some

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.539 
because of that backlash from who some
of<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.690> people<00:03:11.989> some<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.769> as<00:03:13.250> opposed<00:03:13.489> to

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.800 
their point of view I think you may well
be<00:03:20.030> right<00:03:20.060> I<00:03:20.420> mean<00:03:20.769> it's<00:03:21.769> such<00:03:22.519> a<00:03:22.549> divisive<00:03:23.269> and

I<00:04:31.820> felt<00:04:32.240> well<00:04:33.110> this<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.500> fringe<00:04:33.979> of<00:04:34.039> a<00:04:34.130> fringe

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
I felt well this is a fringe of a fringe

I felt well this is a fringe of a fringe
and<00:04:34.580> actually<00:04:35.210> would<00:04:35.330> be<00:04:35.419> helpful<00:04:35.720> to<00:04:35.930> see<00:04:36.710> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
and actually would be helpful to see the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.640 
and actually would be helpful to see the
Israeli<00:04:37.699> army<00:04:38.500> dismantling<00:04:39.500> these

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
settlements which I knew did that does

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.420 
settlements which I knew did that does
happen<00:04:42.229> and<00:04:42.440> that's<00:04:42.770> great<00:04:43.070> because<00:04:43.160> then

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
happen and that's great because then

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.850 
happen and that's great because then
we'll<00:04:43.580> see<00:04:43.760> both<00:04:43.940> sort<00:04:44.780> of<00:04:44.840> the<00:04:45.199> most<00:04:45.470> extreme

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
we'll see both sort of the most extreme

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.070 
we'll see both sort of the most extreme
side<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.210> Israeli<00:04:47.210> national<00:04:47.510> community<00:04:47.960> but

going<00:04:54.350> out<00:04:54.590> there<00:04:54.860> I<00:04:55.190> would<00:04:55.550> surprised<00:04:56.000> how

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
going out there I would surprised how

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.140 
going out there I would surprised how
actually<00:04:56.630> the<00:04:57.080> Israeli<00:04:57.500> army<00:04:57.830> is<00:04:58.039> in<00:04:58.940> many
