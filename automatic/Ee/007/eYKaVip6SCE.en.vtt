00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.529
 gentlemen, I am preparing to enter 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:07.930
 to the plant where all the 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.789
 harvest I have to place a 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.950
 Special attachment in the ears for 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.749
 that I did not hurt the sound there 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.840
 inside we have to put on a cap 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:18.550
 some lenses and also our helmet and 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.560
 well let's go into this precise 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.810
 moment so they know how they are made 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.580
 the dehydrated blueberries and also 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.180
 how it takes the whole procedure to 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.180
 make the juices 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.730
 there they come to the boxes that 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.950
 we just saw with the blueberries for 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.140
 that since they are clean they can 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:51.140
 use them to make the juice and also 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.140
 to dehydrate them justly 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.190
 he had the blueberries 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.130
 This is the vibrating machine that allows 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200
 correctly separating the 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.530
 blueberries and empowers the next 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.530
 process 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.470
 it was the hand as we saw it a while ago 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.420
 fell with pieces in different processes 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.090
 it takes hours and a half to get to these 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.729
 Special machines and it takes six hours 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.360
 to be able to dry to be part 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.390
 the sea is not dehydrated this already 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.850
 it would be the dehydrated blueberry has already happened 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.979
 by a procedure that his secret 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.860
 manufacturing and technology scientist 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.560
 applied cranberry to dehydrate what 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.929
 here we have it, I'm going to place the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.000
 same game that was extracted projected 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.770
 as a dehydrator so it's 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.130
 easier to consume an easier 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.630
 transport it here we have it like this 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.270
 just out has a procedure 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.460
 quite extensive and very scientific and 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:09.350
 Professional the cranberry is hot 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.350
 richer because it's warm 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.580
 here is a specialized robot that goes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.070
 placing each of the bags in the 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.780
 box analyzes the weight and distributes it 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.500
 the correct way so that it was already sent to 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.500
 the other countries 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.700
 that's how the weapon looks, not 100% 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.519
 dehydrated of a fresh consistency 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.530
 and it's not sticky about that either 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.450
 all the technology applied so that 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.549
 we have to walk with the properties 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.220
 whole but in a simpler way 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.230
 to transport and a dismissal sun tabata 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.709
 Jalil I hope you liked it and that 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.709
 come joy
