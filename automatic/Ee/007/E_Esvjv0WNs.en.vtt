00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
of my friends are actually artists and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.010 
of my friends are actually artists and
musicians<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.580> they<00:01:14.970> wear<00:01:15.240> my<00:01:15.450> stuff<00:01:15.720> out<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
musicians and they wear my stuff out and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
musicians and they wear my stuff out and
about<00:01:16.259> which<00:01:16.500> is<00:01:16.710> amazing<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.700> have

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
about which is amazing because they have

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.240 
about which is amazing because they have
great<00:01:18.030> style<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.750> they<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:20.009> out<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

think it's important for musicians to

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.580 
think it's important for musicians to
kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.420> their<00:01:24.570> own<00:01:24.659> style<00:01:25.080> because

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
people look at them more than just music

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.560 
people look at them more than just music
they're<00:01:29.040> entertainers<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> people<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
they're entertainers and people want to

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.270
