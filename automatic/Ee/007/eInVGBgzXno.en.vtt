00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.149
 the departure of the field towards nor the professional style of the designer the leader 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.480
 good that suits better to customers who want to use tractor 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.150
 we asked the Spanish legend of Beijing the director cristian artist 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.670
 varela to know how this product behaves with existing equipment 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.180
 in the clubs I usually always start other pdj 2000 the bjm 2000 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.859
 and always tennis dishes for 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.489
 For the tractor or vinyl we usually use it for all 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.329
 the millions that are in our agency or not these or of friends and I that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.489
 It is also international so they can try the new cloth tables 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.590
 black the new cdj 2000 then basically 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.450
 the team that we have in the studio is a plate pecnik xunta also left a 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.990
 cd j 2000 and of course the bjm 2000 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 We work with Qatar to integrate the appearance of the software but keeping 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.440
 The characteristics and design of Spain 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.140
 yes you notice that you are using a payan product him because he has the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.630
 same technology the same components 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.880
 and you feel at home is not like a product more than payán 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.240
 I think it's a product that is very well organized because you have everything 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.909
 together but it's very well determined where it has the effects - he did not use the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:39.590
 table 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.670
 is everything very well organized the leader or not is not just a great 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.000
 Tree is also your gateway to the use of equipment 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.390
 professionals for the club 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 I think it's very important that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.730
 e the team that uses the people who will then dedicate themselves professionally 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.430
 it was talked about more like possible to what they will then find in a booth 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.770
 professional 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.350
 Well I especially recommend this product for people who want 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.030
 start at home and then dedicate to professionally DJing 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.810
 All other market controllers include the basic character to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.150
 for what remains is to update the software however the gib and that there 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.620
 that still does not include the Spanish theater they say allows you to use the functions 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.219
 typical death was 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:21.219
 recording four channels and is generated in this sector 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.179
 of the Payanian controller what you have that you can click with four 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:27.689
 dishes you can use a lot of flaws 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.029
 the loyal controllers what they have are all very basic just used 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.709
 two channels you can not use almost effects 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.139
 I think it's a step above 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.279
 talking about gestures this is one the tractor's strengths 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.659
 and we have included the most popular effects that can be chained and 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.629
 use in creative combinations 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.370
 I generally like to use see in the chain of effects because for example the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.719
 filter to then go giving you revealed a little money you are making everything grow and 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:55.989
 then when you take it off 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.059
 everything goes back and it's perfect 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:02.600
 Well I also like the combination of the bid plus cercone the noise door 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.450
 and with the change because you can go picking the flan miller 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.150
 taking what the bigmat would be 100 from the strait and then you can go 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.879
 combining it with the noise door with which is a kind of magnifying glass very 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.550
 very handsome good what I want to do is a demonstration of how to use 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.989
 all the effects in a single performance in which pumas getting one more effect 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.300
 adding adding until he finishes his painting all the effects 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:37.719
 so much 

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.029
 p 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.129
 do not 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.349
 finish 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.349
 First 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.929
 finish 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:09.429
 finish 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.269
 10 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
 10 

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:28.180
 I think I'll be fine but it does not have connections with the lodge in the afternoon 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.620
 months to connect to the teams that fight 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.080
 and another exit r is to connect to the ville monitors well I think that 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.819
 it's the easiest because you only have to take the controller and you 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.169
 You can party your house or even make 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:43.479
 a party anywhere 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.389
 Well, I think it's a controller 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:49.050
 one that you can use for all styles in general but I see it more 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.689
 focused on lte not housed the roof are minimal 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:53.880
 I hope you do not have 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.470
 a space where to locate the keyboard of the laptop and through the controls 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.190
 you can browse the folders in your library and the laptop screen 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.020
 it becomes an extension of its controller located in the center of the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:06.749
 scene 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:10.509
 returning to the effects you can use the functions of the pimpi picas de 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:11.229
 payán 

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.020
 tell us the tractor style with the self-employed 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.199
 well what I'm going to do is a demonstration of how to use the car 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:17.639
 lu 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.900
 and how can you go 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.460
 narrowing the amount of lives in the place until you get to a very 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.530
 small I want to use the filter and the network to see how everything works together 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.009
 porsche 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.710
 part of the freelancers there is one thing that is very good that is that you can move the 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.810
 place within the track and at the same time be able to express it and erviti moving at the same time 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:57.809
 which is spectacular 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.949
 Fashion needle search attention that gives direct access to any point 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:24.889
 track 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:28.659
 and pressing on falsean we can configure additional controls of the 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:29.430
 tractor 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.500
 the most important 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:34.230
 belanova technologies that you can combine the controller those that left 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.830
 all 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.910
 everything makes it like a kind of performance and 

00:06:39.369 --> 00:06:42.369
 that one 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:29.979
 the leader of a match in the interface to treat like no other 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:31.089
 controller 

00:07:31.089 --> 00:07:34.729
 it's like you're using a villa team it's real because it's got 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.110
 with the same mechanics that you need and villa and jeans 

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.590
 appreciating excellent operability and durability 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:46.169
 Well, I think that so little is a very expensive product because actually 

00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:46.520
 s 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.520
 the product with the controller erection failures is absolutely everything 

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.050
 what you need in a cabin 

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:56.059
 the table the plates the effects and now it is a lot of money in the markets
