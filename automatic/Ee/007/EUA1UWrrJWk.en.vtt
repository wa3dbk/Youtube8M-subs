00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
embarrassment I don't think so I think

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.319

the being embarrassed is showing it I

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.789 
the being embarrassed is showing it I
think<00:04:20.780> if<00:04:20.870> you<00:04:21.019> if<00:04:21.199> you<00:04:21.320> say<00:04:21.500> you're<00:04:21.650> not
