00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
and maybe I have a question myself about

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.400 
and maybe I have a question myself about
it<00:00:37.739> actually<00:00:38.570> when<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.600> acquired<00:00:39.960> it<00:00:40.230> but

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
it actually when I acquired it but

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.560 
it actually when I acquired it but
anyways<00:00:40.710> here's<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.100> box<00:00:41.309> for<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.640> XR<00:00:42.000> 1890

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
anyways here's the box for the XR 1890

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.900 
anyways here's the box for the XR 1890
and<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.840> one<00:00:43.050> difference<00:00:43.920> is<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> face

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
and this one difference is that the face

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.990 
and this one difference is that the face
play<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> different<00:00:45.450> got<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> large<00:00:46.170> display<00:00:47.000> 35

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
play is different got a large display 35

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.590 
play is different got a large display 35
watts<00:00:48.270> times<00:00:48.840> 4<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.940> I<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:51.510> about

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
watts times 4 and I think that's about

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.279 
watts times 4 and I think that's about
it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.740 
it
the<00:00:52.680> XR<00:00:53.280> 150<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.570> has<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the XR 150 that I have here has a

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.720 
the XR 150 that I have here has a
smaller<00:00:55.079> display<00:00:55.500> different<00:00:56.129> layout<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
smaller display different layout and

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.209 
smaller display different layout and
it's<00:00:57.239> only<00:00:57.390> 25<00:00:57.809> watts<00:00:58.170> per<00:00:58.680> channel<00:00:58.710> times<00:00:59.550> 4

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
it's only 25 watts per channel times 4

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's only 25 watts per channel times 4
so<00:01:02.219> anyways<00:01:02.520> moving<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.940> box<00:01:03.120> away<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> do<00:01:03.539> also

hook<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.509> up<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.369> obviously<00:01:47.369> here's<00:01:47.640> your

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hook it up to that obviously here's your

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.780 
hook it up to that obviously here's your
display<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.860> do<00:01:49.979> have<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:50.220> volume<00:01:50.399> here

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
display and you do have your volume here

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.969 
display and you do have your volume here
mute<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.540> couple<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:52.049> settings<00:01:52.500> like<00:01:52.619> Dolby

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mute and a couple of settings like Dolby

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.789 
mute and a couple of settings like Dolby
Digital<00:01:53.149> sound<00:01:54.149> settings<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:55.619> thing

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
Digital sound settings and the thing

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.889 
Digital sound settings and the thing
with<00:01:55.979> cool<00:01:56.280> without<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.450> at<00:01:57.719> that

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
with cool without this is that at that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.179 
with cool without this is that at that
time<00:01:58.110> they<00:01:58.259> actually<00:01:58.560> did<00:01:58.710> have<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> removable

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
time they actually did have a removable

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.880 
time they actually did have a removable
faceplate<00:02:00.079> just<00:02:01.079> press<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> release<00:02:01.740> button

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
faceplate just press the release button

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
faceplate just press the release button
right<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.700> pops

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
right here and it pops

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.589 
right here and it pops
and<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.899> comes<00:02:08.410> out<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.890> faceplate<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:09.729> but

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
and so comes out the faceplate and but

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.449 
and so comes out the faceplate and but
yeah<00:02:10.780> like<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.080> said<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.500> haven't<00:02:11.860> been<00:02:12.069> able<00:02:12.280> to

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
yeah like I said I haven't been able to

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.970 
yeah like I said I haven't been able to
actually<00:02:12.940> get<00:02:13.510> it<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.660> power<00:02:14.140> up<00:02:14.349> because<00:02:14.830> of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
actually get it to power up because of

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.150 
actually get it to power up because of
the<00:02:15.099> wiring<00:02:15.700> harness<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:17.530> I'm<00:02:17.770> gonna<00:02:17.920> have<00:02:18.040> to

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
the wiring harness so I'm gonna have to

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.860 
the wiring harness so I'm gonna have to
take<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> look<00:02:18.430> at<00:02:18.550> it<00:02:18.670> later<00:02:18.790> and<00:02:19.239> maybe<00:02:19.599> gonna

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
take a look at it later and maybe gonna

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.690 
take a look at it later and maybe gonna
get<00:02:20.680> some<00:02:20.830> help<00:02:21.040> from<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.280> couple<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.640> you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
get some help from a couple of you

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.130 
get some help from a couple of you
alright<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.569> sticker<00:02:22.840> on

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
alright and that's just the sticker on

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.660 
alright and that's just the sticker on
top<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> head<00:02:23.769> unit<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.370> see<00:02:24.519> it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
top of the head unit as you can see it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.910 
top of the head unit as you can see it's
me<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:24.940> Japan<00:02:25.209> not<00:02:25.480> in<00:02:25.630> China<00:02:25.810> so<00:02:26.170> it's<00:02:26.769> pretty

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
me and Japan not in China so it's pretty

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.040 
me and Japan not in China so it's pretty
good<00:02:27.099> stuff<00:02:27.310> I<00:02:27.430> think<00:02:27.489> in<00:02:27.970> my<00:02:28.150> art<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.599> on<00:02:28.810> the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
good stuff I think in my art and on the

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.809 
good stuff I think in my art and on the
rear<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.709> head<00:02:29.950> unit<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.370> got<00:02:30.550> your

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
rear of the head unit you got your

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.240 
rear of the head unit you got your
wiring<00:02:31.390> harness<00:02:32.019> where<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.349> goes

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
wiring harness where it goes

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.370 
wiring harness where it goes
leave<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.300> for<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.569> antenna<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.170> then

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
leave this is for the antenna and then

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.830 
leave this is for the antenna and then
you<00:02:35.560> do<00:02:35.680> have<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.980> uni<00:02:36.430> link<00:02:36.640> in<00:02:37.030> audio<00:02:37.810> I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
you do have a uni link in audio I

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.720 
you do have a uni link in audio I
believe<00:02:38.140> which<00:02:38.319> is<00:02:38.350> for<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.709> CD<00:02:38.950> changer<00:02:39.010> I'm

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
believe which is for the CD changer I'm

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.390 
believe which is for the CD changer I'm
just<00:02:40.510> curious<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.350> could<00:02:41.739> actually<00:02:41.920> plug<00:02:42.370> in

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
just curious if I could actually plug in

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.570 
just curious if I could actually plug in
a<00:02:42.790> auxilary<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.989> that<00:02:44.170> with<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> Y<00:02:45.250> splitter

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
a auxilary to that with the Y splitter

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.460 
a auxilary to that with the Y splitter
of<00:02:45.790> course<00:02:46.030> but<00:02:46.299> um<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:47.049> know<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.170> can't

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
of course but um I don't know I can't

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.500 
of course but um I don't know I can't
try<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.680> until<00:02:47.890> I<00:02:47.950> power<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.489> thing<00:02:48.549> on<00:02:48.819> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
try to until I power this thing on and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.920 
try to until I power this thing on and
of<00:02:49.959> course<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.260> do<00:02:50.349> have<00:02:50.590> a<00:02:50.739> line<00:02:50.950> out<00:02:51.250> rear

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
of course you do have a line out rear

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.630 
of course you do have a line out rear
which<00:02:53.670> I'm<00:02:54.670> unsure<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.569> think<00:02:55.989> that's<00:02:56.170> for

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
which I'm unsure I think that's for

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.520 
which I'm unsure I think that's for
maybe<00:02:57.640> an<00:02:57.849> amplifier<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:59.260> if<00:02:59.349> you<00:02:59.440> were

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
maybe an amplifier you know if you were

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.140 
maybe an amplifier you know if you were
to<00:02:59.650> power<00:02:59.920> up<00:03:00.130> six<00:03:00.430> by<00:03:00.640> nine<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:00.940> that's<00:03:01.000> what

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
to power up six by nine so that's what

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.430 
to power up six by nine so that's what
I'm<00:03:01.239> thinking<00:03:01.510> I'm<00:03:01.750> not<00:03:01.810> exactly<00:03:02.049> sure<00:03:02.200> though

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
I'm thinking I'm not exactly sure though

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.229 
I'm thinking I'm not exactly sure though
if<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.340> can't<00:03:03.519> just<00:03:03.640> let<00:03:03.880> me<00:03:03.910> know<00:03:04.000> I'd<00:03:04.150> be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
guys if you do know here's a wiring

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.319 
guys if you do know here's a wiring
harness<00:03:11.350> that<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.829> came<00:03:12.040> with<00:03:12.070> in<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.880> box

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
harness that it came with in the box

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:14.940 
harness that it came with in the box
I<00:03:13.480> don't<00:03:13.930> know<00:03:14.109> if<00:03:14.230> it's<00:03:14.320> the<00:03:14.470> original<00:03:14.500> for

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I don't know if it's the original for

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.920 
I don't know if it's the original for
this<00:03:15.070> one<00:03:15.220> but<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.519> does<00:03:15.730> sure<00:03:16.120> fit<00:03:16.600> in<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
this one but it does sure fit in the

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:17.880 
this one but it does sure fit in the
rear<00:03:17.109> that's<00:03:17.350> for<00:03:17.530> sure

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
rear that's for sure

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.809 
rear that's for sure
plugged<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.670> in<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.819> it<00:03:19.569> does<00:03:19.930> fit<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.819> the

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
plugged it in and it does fit so the

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.300 
plugged it in and it does fit so the
question<00:03:22.269> is<00:03:22.390> I<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.989> have<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.739> don't<00:03:24.130> know

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
question is I and I have is I don't know

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.520 
question is I and I have is I don't know
which<00:03:24.549> ones<00:03:25.590> like<00:03:27.540> why<00:03:28.540> I'm<00:03:28.720> that<00:03:28.900> like<00:03:29.200> I

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
which ones like why I'm that like I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.949 
which ones like why I'm that like I
don't<00:03:29.890> know<00:03:30.069> too<00:03:30.130> much<00:03:30.430> but<00:03:30.670> there's<00:03:31.180> a<00:03:31.390> 15<00:03:31.810> a

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
don't know too much but there's a 15 a

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.039 
don't know too much but there's a 15 a
fuse<00:03:32.319> in<00:03:32.470> here<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:32.769> it's<00:03:33.400> just<00:03:33.519> 15<00:03:33.819> a<00:03:34.049> yeah

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
fuse in here I think it's just 15 a yeah

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.099 
fuse in here I think it's just 15 a yeah
there's<00:03:35.829> a<00:03:35.859> fuse<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.220> here<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:37.269> was

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
there's a fuse in here and I was

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.410 
there's a fuse in here and I was
thinking<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.500> was<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.709> power<00:03:39.010> but<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:39.850> don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
thinking this was the power but I don't

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.150 
thinking this was the power but I don't
think<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.720> is<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.500> thought<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.739> black<00:03:41.950> was

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
think it is and I thought the black was

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.759 
think it is and I thought the black was
a<00:03:42.190> ground<00:03:42.519> but<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:43.540> play<00:03:43.720> isn't<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.560> then

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
a ground but it's play isn't and then

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:47.009 
a ground but it's play isn't and then
there<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.069> another<00:03:45.280> red<00:03:45.970> cable<00:03:46.480> over<00:03:46.600> here

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
there is another red cable over here

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.080 
there is another red cable over here
with<00:03:47.200> another<00:03:47.500> fuse<00:03:47.920> is<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.579> what<00:03:48.700> at<00:03:48.790> three

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
with another fuse is that what at three

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.190 
with another fuse is that what at three
a<00:03:49.120> fuse<00:03:49.630> I<00:03:50.280> said<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.400> open<00:03:51.609> that<00:03:51.730> I<00:03:52.200> don't

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200
