00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.550
 Recently, check one of the pattern plates 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.990
 important day for sven stein 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.910
 For months, the landshuter has proceedings 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 engineer a new plastic 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.449
 developed with the new composition 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.910
 maybe he has one more 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.500
 more economical basis for future 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.500
 vehicle series found 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.760
 The practical implementation will be today 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 on an instrument panel carrier 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.649
 took off from his work marc sven stein 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.719
 especially the variety 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.090
 I have a new theme every two years 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.710
 a new component the challenge 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.550
 the materials are always new 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.690
 mostly new materials are different 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.520
 always come back into it 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.870
 thinking and of course the cooperation 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.090
 with the colleagues makes the most fun 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.489
 before the first near-series components in 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.770
 Sven Stein im 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.619
 Lab from the samples plates sample bars 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.909
 counter 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.810
 they will be on their mechanical 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.420
 properties 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.820
 especially important is the train test good 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.320
 values ​​guarantee that the component is in 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 vehicle later also at 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.400
 extreme temperatures no columns or 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.549
 Defective gets the new material shows 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.110
 actually a very good value and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.170
 currently also corresponds to the current 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.000
 series of the 5 s now around but the 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.920
 mature to be able to fully evaluate 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.350
 Now in a big trial loop 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.350
 the large parts created and to the 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.600
 submitted to future component inspection 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.180
 at the large injection molding plant there 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.310
 sven stein the responsible colleague the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.690
 Parameters for the new plastic 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 Mixture produced by immediately the 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:06.119
 the first trial parts 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.799
 For 20 years the plastic body still weighed 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.819
 around 35 kilograms 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.280
 Today it is just two kilos 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.900
 besides, it costs only half 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.270
 with a colleague from the department for 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:31.080
 Injection molding takes Sven Stein 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:32.220
 the component quality from after the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.640
 completion sees the 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.350
 instrument panel carrier then look like this 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.700
 but agree with the new plastic 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.840
 composition also still the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.150
 material properties that interests 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.489
 also the development partner from munich 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.330
 a row of airbag shots is supposed to 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.880
 to ensure 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.610
 sven stein is also looking forward to the 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.620
 Shot is because he is very much 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.720
 unpredictable is in its own way 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.630
 for me always the moment where you say 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.769
 that the interesting and the result 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.930
 Of course, that too is sudden 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.180
 result then what I have for a moment 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.989
 get and say it works or 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.989
 it does not work 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.370
 the airbag shot is one of the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.430
 Main component exams of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.480
 legislators and the even more stringent 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.150
 Group internal specifications leave here 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.890
 no restrictions on the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.820
 subsequent assessment is also a 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.350
 airbag expert from landshut doing the 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.060
 vig shot poses for the plastic 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.800
 actually the maximum load 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.810
 we would fail like that now 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.910
 recognize that parts break away that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.650
 Particle flight is what we do 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.430
 Now here at this system see nothing 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.260
 could have a good result yet 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.860
 Numerous further tests will be 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.620
 consequences 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.930
 a small piece, however, is sven 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.530
 stone of mass production already today 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.530
 come closer
