00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.319
 very good my name of daniela bondes de 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.479
 musicalize you are among those who think that 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.879
 the income of an artist has been 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.219
 minimized in recent years 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.080
 you've come across a positive of life and you 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.969
 I'm going to show that today you have 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.170
 excellent opportunities to open 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:22.619
 new income streams an artist 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:25.539
 You can currently earn income 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.269
 authors if you are a composer and what 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.250
 which makes up a certain journey another 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.090
 another second income life can be 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.750
 the concerts although yes that this sector 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.020
 is at least here in Spain 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.920
 in low hours caused by the bubble 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.540
 real estate and the loss of contracts 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.680
 by municipalities and so on 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 Etcetera is the time to offer 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.590
 concerts with valuable content without going 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.470
 further away recently I spoke with a 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.850
 friend that good is a musician of certain 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.960
 quality 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 which runs of alternative circuits and 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.619
 talking to him came the idea of ​​power 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.409
 offer in his concert at the same time 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.360
 acts then an exhibition of painting in 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.700
 every city where he acts will negotiate 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.780
 you will find some freelance artist 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.110
 the painting that sure there are and good 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.600
 and they are going to come to an agreement they are going to do 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.409
 medium for media partner in this way 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.240
 the artist's boy or the artist's 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.940
 pictures will benefit from this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.550
 great babel showcase of the picture and he's going 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.070
 to offer added value and will charge 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.950
 also a commission for it also in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.409
 another way of income is the concept 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.790
 of royalties that depending on the agreement 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.830
 that you have with the company or if not 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.259
 you have company what generates the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.240
 sale of your product because it will be more or 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:58.050
 less is also a sector that is very 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.479
 punished for the changes that he has 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:04.259
 caused internet and by the consumption of 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.200
 stream another source of income is the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.009
 air 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.349
 this association embraces any 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.800
 artist or musician that does not have to be the 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.400
 composer 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.740
 that helps generate movement of some 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.400
 way in the music industry is 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.620
 interesting that you resort to this 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.870
 association from the altar and be part 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.570
 from her because you can also get 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.600
 another a new income route the 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:36.860
 streaming this are already passive income 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:41.160
 emerging revenues and streaming 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.440
 with youtube spotify deezer and the 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.710
 recently released yes fm from here 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.050
 in Spain because it is an injection of 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.569
 fresh air for the income of a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.810
 artist 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:56.420
 without going further I was also the 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.760
 example does barely a week 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.950
 I spoke with an artist friend artist 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:06.049
 humble worker a worker of the 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.250
 music that was quite excited 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.019
 because with his new video there was 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.040
 achieved in a short time three million 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.920
 of visits on youtube 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.750
 I told him later he knows how much 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.569
 you have to enter youtube apart from what 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 you have with an intermediary, not what 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.590
 we order clearly, well, more or less the 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.180
 comment then you will perceive some 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.099
 six thousand euros 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.469
 and he was quite happy is a 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.099
 interesting business not like to live 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:35.730
 of him but he is source of income every 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:38.939

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:50.159
