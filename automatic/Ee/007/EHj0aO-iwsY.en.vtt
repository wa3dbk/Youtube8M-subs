00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.640
 hello for the members of the assault 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.240
 a guitar accompaniment for the title 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.290
 born somewhere from maxim the forester 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:15.210
 this time we are just interested 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.740
 to couples and barrels the difficulty one 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.800
 will see a moment ago the establishment 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.300
 chords on rhythm and we're going 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.800
 do as usual ie have the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.570
 version on lowest music costs 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.680
 and detailed guitar accompaniment 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.680
 just after 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.410
 choose your family 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:03.030
 chosen of love 2010 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:06.330
 the hostage respond to it I saw 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.330
 somewhat 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 so we can say somehow 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.049
 that here we have an accompaniment that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.729
 works with a game overlay 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.409
 bass on acute chords the 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.409
 difficulty I said it just now 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.570
 will be to place correctly in terms of 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.979
 rhythm so that's okay start and for 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.960
 that it feels less difficult 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.310
 we will start here with the basic game 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:00.450
 in question then we will be interested in 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.729
 first two times to start and one 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.470
 will see how we do 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.869
 what are we going to play so in term 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.950
 basic on these first two times 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.800
 will always announce the same it will be the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.850
 sixth string 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.170
 it's still the life of so the name and 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.239
 half with the thumb as steam then in 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.640
 terms of rhythm on each time one 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.269
 so associates them there it is for the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:29.820
 first time and we will repeat that on the 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:39.690
 second and so has the figure on a 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:42.500
 time if I repeat for both times to 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.500
 again gently 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:59.450
 again one so once the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.900
 back of bass with his figure of 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.879
 pace to rest and place the agreements 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.890
 then you will find some form of agreement 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:11.120
 on the tablature first agreement will be a 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.459
 minor here and so we will be interested in 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 first of all simply the first 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.459
 agreement will be placed on the beginning of the 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.680
 first time ie in fact the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.510
 first abbas of the first time we saw 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.690
 that the base of olhain on the first 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.190
 time was doing so if we classify the agreement 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:41.079
 on the first one go this will give this to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:41.079
 again again more gently 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.930
 so that's not too much trouble for 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.750
 the first agreement it'll be a little bit more 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.880
 of difference on the second agreement here back 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.299
 is major all rounds and paris the form 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.049
 on the table since he will be placed in 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:04.849
 done on the third and therefore last 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:06.889
 bass of this second time so we get 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:09.170
 recalls that on the second being 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:12.290
 moreover as the first the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.150
 faith bases of these and here we go 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.799
 classify the agreement on the last base 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.799
 besides the third what will give 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.109
 anew 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:34.140
 then there to go out must be 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.140
 repeated this time a little bit like that 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.130
 here 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:42.930
 you wanted his three years of reign hours 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:59.070
 story to give you time to 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:05:03.030
 their place and so then again at 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.430
 caire was to associate these two so 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.990
 it's in just first 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:20.940
 time I remember that the federation and say 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:29.540
 but you have to associate the two with 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:29.540
 new more gently 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.840
 ok and here we have the beginning so dollar and 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.270
 mika question ie globally 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.340
 the first two times though here in 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.880
 the second chord and in a little bit more 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.980
 far than the 2nd beat so we'll fill 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.840
 in fact with the bass the measure went 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:55.760
 go to the 4th time simply 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.470
 with the bass so it'll give 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:03.050
 this this time on the four times 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:12.920
 first I 'm going to do that bass so 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:14.060
 for the four times so we add to 

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:19.880
 what we did earlier we had 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:22.700
 the first time the second one was typing 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:27.350
 the 3 comes from fries at the end of the iii a 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:32.740
 little bass and then basic on the 4 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.740
 so in fact if I do from 3 3 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:40.360
 3 from the beginning 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:55.340
 again more gently ok what 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.340
 will give you hold with the agreements 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.580
 once again 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:31.400
 here and there you actually have the 

00:07:27.979 --> 00:07:34.789
 rhythmic on a measure that will be 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.030
 actually to repeat on every measure in 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:41.539
 position function so agree that 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:43.610
 you will find on the table always 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:49.789
 same on the site whose address is 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:50.750
 under the video and you have to go 

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:53.449
 now 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.520
 so no partition of the line line clin 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:58.669
 to the students and I tell you 

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:01.509
 soon for the accompaniment on 

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.509
 their hunger so
