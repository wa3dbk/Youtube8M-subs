 brought and the golf caddy 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.679
 make performance with 230 ps manufacturer 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.880
 it gets harder and harder for us too 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.500
 thing we are on the creep again 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.010
 come and show the installation video 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.010
 like you now 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.230
 in original plug release 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.110
 who gave me a flattened and a round one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.080
 page or half round page as well 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.930
 put in our pay attention then 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.300
 plug in our wire harness on the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.460
 despise sensor fuse 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.780
 then we have the first one in so 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.730
 connection for the lower sensor now 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.920
 we are under the car here 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.260
 we have the typical vw cover me 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.970
 have already solved the screws 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.130
 here we have the sensor and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.530
 to recognize our wiring harness well on the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.450
 white we put under before 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.940
 hanged 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.860
 Now we open the sensor 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.750
 the original plug with our 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.270
 wire harness and our wiring harness then with 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.530
 the original sensor and then we have 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.180
 to look it down from here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.000
 of course the cover again 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 tightening with the screws 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.340
 do that and that's it we do now 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.410
 as always, the functional test at 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 This vehicle is so that the can 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.750
 bus starts up as soon as the doors open 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.880
 become 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.180
 that means now the lamps start to light up 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.640
 flashing and the green light on it 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.160
 position in this vehicle between 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.500
 Aerial buttons and battery compartment that 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:02.090
 is called here 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.090
 Here we put the module in the bag 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:24.390
 the whole thing to a purely cable her 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:27.290
 Accompaniments winterproof tool from the 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.290
 Engine room off
