what's up guys it's easy fear and this
is<00:00:03.840> another<00:00:04.049> video<00:00:04.440> in<00:00:04.650> my<00:00:04.799> preparing<00:00:05.310> for<00:00:05.460> the

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520

is another video in my preparing for the
WC<00:00:05.910> q<00:00:06.470> type<00:00:07.470> series<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.280> today<00:00:08.639> we're<00:00:08.760> going

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
WC q type series and today we're going

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.470 
WC q type series and today we're going
to<00:00:08.910> talk<00:00:09.000> about<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.269> order<00:00:09.480> of<00:00:09.540> operations

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
to talk about the order of operations

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.700 
to talk about the order of operations
well<00:00:12.480> can't<00:00:12.690> explain<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.049> lot<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.440> drawn

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
well can't explain a lot of like drawn

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.340 
well can't explain a lot of like drawn
search<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.460> reveal<00:00:14.700> cards<00:00:15.139> including<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.199> lot

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
search and reveal cards including a lot

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.230 
search and reveal cards including a lot
of<00:00:16.379> these<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:16.980> like<00:00:17.190> shell<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.029> grave

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
of these so we have like shell and grave

firestone<00:00:21.060> guards<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.359> hand<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:23.539> five

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
firestone guards in hand you have five

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.259 
firestone guards in hand you have five
different<00:00:25.369> deck<00:00:26.369> thinning<00:00:26.730> effects<00:00:27.000> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
different deck thinning effects and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
different deck thinning effects and
today<00:00:27.900> i'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.140> talk<00:00:28.230> about<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.920> order

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
today i'm going to talk about the order

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.830 
today i'm going to talk about the order
that<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.760> should<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.029> them<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.510> minimize

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
that you should do them in to minimize

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160 
that you should do them in to minimize
your<00:00:30.990> chances<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.740> seeing<00:00:32.300> blank<00:00:33.300> cards<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.140> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
your chances of seeing blank cards so a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.560 
your chances of seeing blank cards so a
blank<00:00:34.469> card<00:00:34.680> will<00:00:35.160> be<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.309> card<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:35.940> you

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
blank card will be a card that like you

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.119 
blank card will be a card that like you
cannot<00:00:37.020> add<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.680> don't<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:38.070> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
cannot add or that you don't want to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.650 
cannot add or that you don't want to
draw<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.700> period<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.329> you're<00:00:39.480> going<00:00:39.570> to

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
draw just period because you're going to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.590 
draw just period because you're going to
get<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.500> anyway<00:00:41.399> I'm<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.059> good<00:00:42.180> example<00:00:42.540> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
get to it anyway I'm a good example is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
get to it anyway I'm a good example is
if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> have<00:00:42.840> like<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> rocket<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.010> duality

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
if you have like a rocket in a duality

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.330 
if you have like a rocket in a duality
in<00:00:44.820> hand<00:00:45.320> it's<00:00:46.320> usually<00:00:46.770> better<00:00:46.920> at<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.129> normal

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
in hand it's usually better at a normal

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.090 
in hand it's usually better at a normal
some<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> rocket<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> add<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.660> reload<00:00:49.100> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
some on the rocket to add or reload to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
some on the rocket to add or reload to
decrease<00:00:50.640> your<00:00:50.670> chances<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.420> seeing<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.780> reload

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
decrease your chances of seeing a reload

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.229 
decrease your chances of seeing a reload
off<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.530> duality<00:00:53.010> because<00:00:53.879> that's<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
off the duality because that's just a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.430 
off the duality because that's just a
blank<00:00:54.420> card<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.840> point<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.170> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
blank card at that point because like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
blank card at that point because like
you're<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.710> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> add<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.219> because<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you're not going to add it because you

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
you're not going to add it because you
have<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> rocket<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
have the rocket so it's just like that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.660 
have the rocket so it's just like that
could<00:00:58.680> have<00:00:58.770> been<00:00:58.829> anything<00:00:59.100> else<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> what<00:00:59.640> a

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
could have been anything else and what a

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.689 
could have been anything else and what a
bit<00:00:59.820> more<00:00:59.940> useful<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.989> scenario<00:01:01.309> so<00:01:02.309> like

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
bit more useful in that scenario so like

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.170 
bit more useful in that scenario so like
I<00:01:02.789> said<00:01:02.899> pretend<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.379> you're<00:01:05.280> all

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I said pretend that you are you're all

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.789 
I said pretend that you are you're all
you<00:01:06.540> did<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.840> last<00:01:06.900> term<00:01:07.200> with<00:01:07.380> site<00:01:07.530> reload

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you did your last term with site reload

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.320 
you did your last term with site reload
pass<00:01:08.070> on<00:01:08.400> your<00:01:08.820> opponent's<00:01:09.119> from<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
pass on your opponent's from you

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.480 
pass on your opponent's from you
discarded<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> shell<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> draw<00:01:10.260> card<00:01:10.530> um<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
discarded a shell the draw card um and

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.100 
discarded a shell the draw card um and
then<00:01:11.610> you're<00:01:11.850> starting<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.180> turn<00:01:12.420> with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
then you're starting your turn with

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.350 
then you're starting your turn with
fries<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.650> guards<00:01:13.920> duality<00:01:14.310> planter<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> a

fries from guards duality planter and a

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
fries from guards duality planter and a
reload<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.020> shell<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
reload and then a shell so I'm going to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.710 
reload and then a shell so I'm going to
talk<00:01:17.729> about<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.150> way<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.479> should<00:01:18.630> go

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
talk about the way that you should go

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
talk about the way that you should go
about<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:20.009> think<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.759> think

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
about this and I think this is I think

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.630 
about this and I think this is I think
this<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> fairly<00:01:22.290> standard<00:01:22.799> scenario<00:01:23.430> these

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
this is a fairly standard scenario these

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.830 
this is a fairly standard scenario these
are<00:01:23.729> all<00:01:23.820> cards<00:01:24.119> that<00:01:24.210> you're<00:01:24.330> playing<00:01:24.509> three

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
are all cards that you're playing three

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.950 
are all cards that you're playing three
of<00:01:25.020> possibly<00:01:26.009> two<00:01:26.130> possibly<00:01:26.729> two<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.869> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
of possibly two possibly two but in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
of possibly two possibly two but in
general<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.380> scenarios<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> call

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
general this scenarios going to call

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.590 
general this scenarios going to call
quite<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.430> bit<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> lot<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.210> people<00:01:30.479> my

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
quite a bit and I see a lot of people my

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.780 
quite a bit and I see a lot of people my
locals<00:01:30.990> messing<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> up<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.340> what<00:01:32.549> our<00:01:32.640> do

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
locals messing it up so what our do

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.240 
locals messing it up so what our do
first<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> obviously<00:01:33.680> search<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.799> deck<00:01:34.950> for<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
first is obviously search my deck for a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.140 
first is obviously search my deck for a
volcanic<00:01:35.549> shell<00:01:37.189> and<00:01:38.189> then<00:01:38.549> from<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:38.970> I

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
volcanic shell and then from there I

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
volcanic shell and then from there I
would<00:01:39.540> accurately<00:01:39.659> load<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.229> discard<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
would accurately load to discard the

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
would accurately load to discard the
shell<00:01:41.009> draw<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.090> card<00:01:42.630> which<00:01:42.810> obviously

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
shell draw a card which obviously

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
shell draw a card which obviously
blanket<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:43.890> really<00:01:44.009> matter<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.939> then

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
blanket doesn't really matter and then

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
blanket doesn't really matter and then
i'd<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> second<00:01:45.810> shell<00:01:45.960> search<00:01:46.680> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
i'd use the second shell search the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.330 
i'd use the second shell search the
third<00:01:47.189> copy<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> shell<00:01:49.100> afterwards<00:01:50.100> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
third copy of the shell afterwards I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.670 
third copy of the shell afterwards I
would<00:01:50.909> use<00:01:51.180> planter<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.229> get<00:01:52.350> rid<00:01:52.470> of<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
would use planter to get rid of the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.139 
would use planter to get rid of the
reload<00:01:53.009> drawing<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.579> more<00:01:53.759> cards<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> now<00:01:57.090> we

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
reload drawing two more cards so now we

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.770 
reload drawing two more cards so now we
have<00:01:57.240> 6<00:01:57.810> cards<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.140> hand<00:01:58.399> with<00:01:59.399> reload<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.210> two

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
have 6 cards in hand with reload and two

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.920 
have 6 cards in hand with reload and two
shells<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.320> grave<00:02:01.939> next<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:03.060> would<00:02:03.180> activate

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
shells in grave next I would activate

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
shells in grave next I would activate
the<00:02:04.200> reload<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.070> graveyard<00:02:05.549> assuming<00:02:05.820> my

the reload in graveyard assuming my

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.240 
the reload in graveyard assuming my
opponent<00:02:06.329> how<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> field<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.590> send<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
opponent how to field to send the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.550

scatter<00:02:08.729> shots<00:02:09.060> to<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> Graveyard<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.959> three

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
scatter shots to the Graveyard all three

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.320 
scatter shots to the Graveyard all three
scatter<00:02:10.800> shots<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.750> deck

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
scatter shots are now out of the deck

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.890 
scatter shots are now out of the deck
and<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:14.650> opponent<00:02:14.770> seal<00:02:15.160> is<00:02:15.370> clear<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.180> I

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
and your opponent seal is clear and I

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.060 
and your opponent seal is clear and I
guess<00:02:17.050> I<00:02:17.230> see<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.410> lot<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.560> people<00:02:17.740> mess<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:18.010> up

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
guess I see a lot of people mess it up

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.060 
guess I see a lot of people mess it up
right<00:02:18.400> here<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.540> your<00:02:19.990> two<00:02:20.320> effects<00:02:20.710> that<00:02:20.920> you

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
right here so your two effects that you

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.710 
right here so your two effects that you
have<00:02:21.160> left<00:02:21.400> our<00:02:21.670> duality<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.300> fried<00:02:22.540> some

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
have left our duality and fried some

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.160 
have left our duality and fried some
guards<00:02:22.960> I<00:02:23.050> see<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> lot<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.410> people<00:02:23.590> um<00:02:25.170> normal

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
guards I see a lot of people um normal

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.270 
guards I see a lot of people um normal
something<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.530> firestorm<00:02:26.920> guards<00:02:27.130> at<00:02:27.220> this

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
something the firestorm guards at this

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.160 
something the firestorm guards at this
point<00:02:27.610> which<00:02:28.180> i<00:02:28.270> think<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.510> incorrect<00:02:28.960> play

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
point which i think is incorrect play

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.680 
point which i think is incorrect play
for<00:02:29.440> most<00:02:29.650> scenarios<00:02:30.000> what<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.030> would<00:02:31.240> do<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.570> I

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
for most scenarios what I would do is I

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.220 
for most scenarios what I would do is I
would<00:02:31.720> then<00:02:32.110> duality<00:02:32.860> right<00:02:33.220> there<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:35.080> add

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
would then duality right there to add

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.450 
would then duality right there to add
another<00:02:35.350> card<00:02:35.740> to<00:02:35.860> your<00:02:35.920> hand<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.280> now<00:02:36.370> you

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
another card to your hand so now you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.790 
another card to your hand so now you
have<00:02:36.490> 6<00:02:36.820> cards<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.120> hand<00:02:37.270> still<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.410> as

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
have 6 cards in hand still and then as

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.830 
have 6 cards in hand still and then as
the<00:02:39.070> last<00:02:39.430> card<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:40.120> would<00:02:40.300> know<00:02:40.420> some<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.720> the

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
the last card I would know some of the

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080 
the last card I would know some of the
fires<00:02:40.990> from<00:02:41.200> guards<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:42.250> shuffle<00:02:42.580> back<00:02:42.820> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
fires from guards to shuffle back the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.900 
fires from guards to shuffle back the
scatter<00:02:43.360> shots<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:44.020> one<00:02:44.410> shell<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> then

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
scatter shots and one shell and then

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.550 
scatter shots and one shell and then
draw<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:49.180> way<00:02:49.420> you<00:02:49.900> minimize<00:02:50.380> your

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
draw to this way you minimize your

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.550 
draw to this way you minimize your
chances<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.010> seeing<00:02:51.520> cards<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.750> shell<00:02:53.170> and

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
chances of seeing cards like shell and

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.980 
chances of seeing cards like shell and
scatter<00:02:54.400> shot<00:02:54.490> as<00:02:54.850> you<00:02:55.209> know<00:02:55.510> you're<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.930> to

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
scatter shot as you know you're going to

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.100 
scatter shot as you know you're going to
know<00:02:56.170> them<00:02:56.430> there's<00:02:57.430> no<00:02:57.580> real<00:02:58.360> purpose<00:02:58.630> and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
know them there's no real purpose and

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.050 
know them there's no real purpose and
using<00:02:59.410> card<00:02:59.650> like<00:02:59.800> planetary<00:03:00.280> duality<00:03:00.490> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
using card like planetary duality to

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.320 
using card like planetary duality to
reveal<00:03:01.450> or<00:03:01.690> draw<00:03:01.959> um<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.950> scattershot<00:03:03.760> when<00:03:04.240> you

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
reveal or draw um a scattershot when you

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
reveal or draw um a scattershot when you
know<00:03:04.450> you're<00:03:04.600> just<00:03:04.660> going<00:03:04.840> to<00:03:04.900> mill<00:03:05.080> it<00:03:05.110> with

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
know you're just going to mill it with

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.400 
know you're just going to mill it with
the<00:03:05.440> reload<00:03:05.709> anyway<00:03:06.130> um<00:03:06.970> and<00:03:07.270> then<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:08.170> reason

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
the reload anyway um and then the reason

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.990 
the reload anyway um and then the reason
that<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.620> would<00:03:08.740> use<00:03:08.890> duality<00:03:09.459> before<00:03:09.910> you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that you would use duality before you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.310 
that you would use duality before you
some<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.300> fighters<00:03:10.420> from<00:03:10.630> guards<00:03:10.870> set<00:03:11.140> you

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
some of the fighters from guards set you

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.830 
some of the fighters from guards set you
don't<00:03:11.500> accidentally<00:03:11.980> hit<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.850> scattershot<00:03:13.420> or

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
don't accidentally hit a scattershot or

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.530 
don't accidentally hit a scattershot or
a<00:03:13.870> shell<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.440> like<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.620> off<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.100> back

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
a shell that you like just off the back

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.880 
a shell that you like just off the back
because<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.660> would<00:03:16.750> just<00:03:16.810> be<00:03:17.080> not<00:03:17.500> very<00:03:17.680> good

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
because that would just be not very good

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710 
because that would just be not very good
the<00:03:18.580> only<00:03:18.760> one<00:03:18.850> area<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.360> I<00:03:19.510> would<00:03:19.630> think

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
the only one area that I would think

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.030 
the only one area that I would think
that<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:19.930> would<00:03:20.019> be<00:03:20.170> different<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.920> if

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
that this would be different in is if

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.310 
that this would be different in is if
you<00:03:21.130> actually<00:03:21.340> wanted<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> see<00:03:22.450> a<00:03:22.480> shell<00:03:22.780> or<00:03:23.019> if

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
you actually wanted to see a shell or if

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.840 
you actually wanted to see a shell or if
you<00:03:23.530> actually<00:03:23.680> wanted<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.190> see<00:03:24.430> a<00:03:24.459> scattershot

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
you actually wanted to see a scattershot

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.900 
you actually wanted to see a scattershot
off<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.989> them<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.890> duality<00:03:27.430> like<00:03:27.700> your

comes<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.239> very<00:03:37.390> often<00:03:37.720> but<00:03:38.709> that<00:03:38.860> was<00:03:38.950> a

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
comes up very often but that was a

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.009 
comes up very often but that was a
little<00:03:39.160> scenario<00:03:40.150> where<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.630> started<00:03:40.930> out

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
little scenario where you started out

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.520 
little scenario where you started out
with<00:03:41.200> three<00:03:41.470> cards<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:41.800> hand<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.450> ended<00:03:43.450> with

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
with three cards in hand and ended with

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.060 
with three cards in hand and ended with
six<00:03:44.760> siletz<00:03:45.760> or<00:03:45.850> 77<00:03:46.690> sorry<00:03:46.870> since<00:03:47.800> one<00:03:47.920> of<00:03:47.950> the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
six siletz or 77 sorry since one of the

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.590 
six siletz or 77 sorry since one of the
ways<00:03:48.160> that<00:03:48.400> volcanic<00:03:48.730> scan<00:03:49.150> get<00:03:49.330> just

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
ways that volcanic scan get just

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.850 
ways that volcanic scan get just
incredibly<00:03:50.290> out<00:03:50.440> of<00:03:50.470> hand<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:53.320> momentum<00:03:53.590> the

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
incredibly out of hand the momentum the

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.500 
incredibly out of hand the momentum the
sec<00:03:54.070> is<00:03:54.190> really<00:03:54.370> cool<00:03:54.519> i'm<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> huge<00:03:55.239> player

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
sec is really cool i'm a huge player

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.540 
sec is really cool i'm a huge player
unlike<00:03:55.870> tempo<00:03:56.260> so<00:03:56.890> like<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.190> kind<00:03:57.430> of

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
unlike tempo so like that kind of

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.030 
unlike tempo so like that kind of
opening<00:03:58.269> i<00:03:58.390> would<00:03:58.750> say<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.019> fairly<00:03:59.290> standard

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
opening i would say is fairly standard

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.940 
opening i would say is fairly standard
um<00:04:00.940> but<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:01.840> important<00:04:02.290> knowing<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.680> order

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
um but it's important knowing the order

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.500 
um but it's important knowing the order
that<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.100> should<00:04:03.280> do<00:04:03.400> things<00:04:03.580> to<00:04:03.760> maximize

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
that you should do things to maximize

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.320 
that you should do things to maximize
the<00:04:05.350> efficiency<00:04:05.590> of<00:04:05.920> your<00:04:06.280> plays<00:04:06.519> these<00:04:07.180> this

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
the efficiency of your plays these this

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.870 
the efficiency of your plays these this
is<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.510> deck<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.750> does<00:04:08.140> not<00:04:08.519> forgive<00:04:09.519> miss

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
is a deck that does not forgive miss

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.820 
is a deck that does not forgive miss
plays<00:04:10.150> very<00:04:10.510> well<00:04:10.630> you<00:04:11.230> have<00:04:11.320> to<00:04:11.410> play<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.680> like

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
plays very well you have to play it like

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.009 
plays very well you have to play it like
perfectly<00:04:12.220> all<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.670> time<00:04:12.880> and<00:04:13.150> I<00:04:13.750> don't<00:04:13.930> think

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
perfectly all the time and I don't think

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.539 
perfectly all the time and I don't think
a<00:04:14.110> lot<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.260> people<00:04:14.320> doing<00:04:14.650> that<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:15.040> hopefully

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
a lot of people doing that so hopefully

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.190 
a lot of people doing that so hopefully
