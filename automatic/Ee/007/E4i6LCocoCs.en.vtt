here on the book convict conditioning to

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.569 
here on the book convict conditioning to
write<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.809> I<00:00:50.199> wasn't<00:00:50.710> sure<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:51.460> the

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
write so I wasn't sure what the

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.849 
write so I wasn't sure what the
difference<00:00:51.699> was<00:00:52.149> so<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:52.960> went<00:00:53.170> on<00:00:53.320> Dragon<00:00:53.739> door

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859 
difference was so I went on Dragon door

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:55.529 
difference was so I went on Dragon door
