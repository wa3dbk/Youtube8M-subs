my<00:00:04.980> second<00:00:05.430> microwave<00:00:05.819> another<00:00:06.690> one<00:00:06.870> that

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
my second microwave another one that

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.740 
my second microwave another one that
says<00:00:07.200> H<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.649> as<00:00:07.830> ancient<00:00:08.130> as<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.460> hills<00:00:08.750> almost

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
says H is as ancient as the hills almost

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.270 
says H is as ancient as the hills almost
as<00:00:09.900> old<00:00:10.019> as<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> other<00:00:10.440> one<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.769> was<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.099> old

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
as old as the other one this was so old

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.950 
as old as the other one this was so old
that<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.639> white<00:00:11.880> this<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.269> white<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.750> one

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
that the white this was white at one

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.400 
that the white this was white at one
time<00:00:13.170> but<00:00:13.440> due<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:15.109> ultraviolet<00:00:16.109> light

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
time but due to use ultraviolet light

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.710 
time but due to use ultraviolet light
exposure<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:17.100> heat<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.520> turn<00:00:17.760> yellow<00:00:17.970> this

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
exposure and heat it's turn yellow this

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.560 
exposure and heat it's turn yellow this
was<00:00:18.930> completely<00:00:19.470> dead<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.510> see

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
was completely dead and as you can see

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.990 
was completely dead and as you can see
from<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> date<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.010> one<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.310> made<00:00:23.519> in

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
from the date here this one was made in

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.240 
from the date here this one was made in
1990<00:00:24.750> another<00:00:25.019> old<00:00:25.230> classic<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.859> one's<00:00:26.070> gone

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
1990 another old classic this one's gone

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:26.720 
1990 another old classic this one's gone
dead

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
dead

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
dead
I'm<00:00:27.060> assuming<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.689> probably<00:00:28.050> switches<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I'm assuming it's probably switches that

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.220 
I'm assuming it's probably switches that
have<00:00:28.710> gone<00:00:28.830> bad<00:00:29.039> we're<00:00:29.699> gonna<00:00:29.910> find<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.359> shall

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
have gone bad we're gonna find out shall

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.370 
have gone bad we're gonna find out shall
we

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
we

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.670 
we
we've<00:00:31.650> got<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> side<00:00:32.550> off<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:32.969> unit<00:00:33.270> here

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
we've got the side off this unit here

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.930 
we've got the side off this unit here
and<00:00:34.680> I've<00:00:35.040> don't<00:00:35.219> work<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.579> before<00:00:35.760> I

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and I've don't work on this before I

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.389 
and I've don't work on this before I
change<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.600> magnetron<00:00:37.170> once<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.590> says<00:00:37.800> LG<00:00:38.219> on

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
change that magnetron once it says LG on

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:38.660 
change that magnetron once it says LG on
it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
it
that's<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.300> Panasonic<00:00:39.840> microwave<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.410> an<00:00:40.530> LG

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that's a Panasonic microwave with an LG

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
that's a Panasonic microwave with an LG
magnetron<00:00:41.430> very<00:00:42.360> good<00:00:42.540> first<00:00:43.440> thing<00:00:43.620> we're

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
magnetron very good first thing we're

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.440 
magnetron very good first thing we're
gonna<00:00:43.890> check<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.250> we're<00:00:44.399> gonna<00:00:44.489> get<00:00:45.120> our<00:00:45.270> meter

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
gonna check is we're gonna get our meter

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.680 
gonna check is we're gonna get our meter
out<00:00:45.629> here<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.440> we're<00:00:46.590> gonna<00:00:46.680> check<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> fuse

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
out here and we're gonna check the fuse

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.000 
out here and we're gonna check the fuse
see<00:00:48.690> whether<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> fuse<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.469> blown<00:00:49.620> if<00:00:49.920> the

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
see whether the fuse is blown if the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.939 
see whether the fuse is blown if the
fuse<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.430> blown<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.850> I'll<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.180> look<00:00:51.390> for

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
fuse is blown then I'll know to look for

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.560 
fuse is blown then I'll know to look for
shorting<00:00:52.949> switches<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.489> primary<00:00:54.270> interlock

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
shorting switches and primary interlock

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.680 
shorting switches and primary interlock
switches<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.489> beep<00:00:56.760> tells<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
switches and that beep tells me that the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.119 
switches and that beep tells me that the
fuse<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.760> blown<00:01:00.649> secondary<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> fuse

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
fuse is not blown secondary to the fuse

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.420 
fuse is not blown secondary to the fuse
is<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> thermal<00:01:03.210> cut<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:04.189> thermal<00:01:05.189> cut<00:01:05.339> out

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is a thermal cut out thermal cut out

is a thermal cut out thermal cut out
shop<00:01:05.729> without<00:01:06.030> magnetrons<00:01:06.600> warm<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.049> bet<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
shop without magnetrons warm I bet you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.679 
shop without magnetrons warm I bet you
the<00:01:07.470> thermal<00:01:07.650> cutout<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.180> we've<00:01:09.180> been<00:01:09.360> cooking

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
the thermal cutout as we've been cooking

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.810 
the thermal cutout as we've been cooking
with<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.930> shut<00:01:10.439> off<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:11.010> then<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> wouldn't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
with it shut off and then it wouldn't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
with it shut off and then it wouldn't
start<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.090> up<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.360> bet<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> thermal<00:01:13.229> cutout

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
start it up I bet you the thermal cutout

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.380 
start it up I bet you the thermal cutout
is<00:01:13.979> gone<00:01:14.250> open<00:01:14.369> let's<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.850> put<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> meter<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is gone open let's just put the meter on

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
is gone open let's just put the meter on
here<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.290> see<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.530> it<00:01:16.650> beeps<00:01:17.090> and<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:19.590> doesn't

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
here and see if it beeps and it doesn't

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.420 
here and see if it beeps and it doesn't
beep<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.229> tells<00:01:22.470> me<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.100> thermal

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
beep so what that tells me is my thermal

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.240 
beep so what that tells me is my thermal
cutout<00:01:23.640> has<00:01:24.000> failed<00:01:24.290> I'm<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.740> cool

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
cutout has failed I'm just going to cool

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.380 
cutout has failed I'm just going to cool
this<00:01:26.369> thing<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> bit<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.270> see

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
this thing down a bit here and see

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.090 
this thing down a bit here and see
whether<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.840> reset<00:01:28.170> itself<00:01:28.350> otherwise<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
whether it will reset itself otherwise I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
whether it will reset itself otherwise I
may<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.490> coax<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.150> resetting<00:01:30.890> some

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
may have to coax it into resetting some

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.260 
may have to coax it into resetting some
of<00:01:32.009> these<00:01:32.130> units<00:01:32.520> would<00:01:32.700> reset<00:01:33.090> themselves

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
of these units would reset themselves

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.969 
of these units would reset themselves
other<00:01:33.689> ones<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.110> actually<00:01:34.409> had<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.680> take<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
other ones you actually had to take the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.690 
other ones you actually had to take the
thermal<00:01:35.430> cutout<00:01:35.610> apart<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> pop<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.439> little

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
thermal cutout apart and pop the little

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
thermal cutout apart and pop the little
bimetallic<00:01:38.700> strip<00:01:39.180> back<00:01:39.600> by<00:01:40.350> hand<00:01:40.619> they<00:01:40.829> were

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
bimetallic strip back by hand they were

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
bimetallic strip back by hand they were
a<00:01:41.009> one-time<00:01:41.610> they<00:01:42.060> could<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.329> reset<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:42.869> they

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
a one-time they could be reset but they

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
a one-time they could be reset but they
once<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:43.920> trip<00:01:44.189> they<00:01:44.340> wouldn't<00:01:44.579> reset<00:01:44.850> themself

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
once a trip they wouldn't reset themself

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.730 
once a trip they wouldn't reset themself
I'm<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:45.960> gonna<00:01:46.079> pull<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.380> thing<00:01:46.439> apart

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
I'm just gonna pull this thing apart

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.499 
I'm just gonna pull this thing apart
here<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.460> whether<00:01:47.579> this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> resale

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
here and see whether this is a resale

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
here and see whether this is a resale
free<00:01:48.689> setting<00:01:48.990> or<00:01:49.079> whether<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.470> one<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
free setting or whether it's one I have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.700 
free setting or whether it's one I have
to<00:01:50.009> reset<00:01:50.340> manually<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.140> we've<00:01:52.290> taken<00:01:52.500> out<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to reset manually so we've taken out the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.289 
to reset manually so we've taken out the
thermal<00:01:53.070> cut<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.369> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> unit<00:01:54.090> here

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
thermal cut out this is the unit here

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.550 
thermal cut out this is the unit here
and<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:55.740> does<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.130> reset<00:01:56.460> itself<00:01:57.320> I've<00:01:58.320> cooled

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
and it does not reset itself I've cooled

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.859 
and it does not reset itself I've cooled
it<00:01:58.740> down<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.189> it's<00:01:59.490> still<00:01:59.729> open<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
to open up the thermal cutout I've just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
to open up the thermal cutout I've just
bent<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.360> tabs<00:02:21.690> up<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:22.020> bit<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.709> need

to pop it out from it's the holder and
inside<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.800> class<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.730> this

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
inside here this is a this class of this

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.430 
inside here this is a this class of this
plastic<00:02:36.360> cover<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.690> actually<00:02:36.810> an<00:02:37.080> insulator

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
plastic cover is actually an insulator

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.949 
plastic cover is actually an insulator
to<00:02:37.620> insulate<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.220> protects<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.959> switch

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
to insulate that protects the switch

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.900 
to insulate that protects the switch
from<00:02:40.890> shorting<00:02:41.250> out<00:02:41.340> so<00:02:41.550> we're<00:02:41.640> just<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.850> to

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
from shorting out so we're just going to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.810 
from shorting out so we're just going to
remove<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.300> for<00:02:42.480> now<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.840> we<00:02:43.380> just<00:02:43.560> have<00:02:43.739> to

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
remove that for now and we just have to

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.010 
remove that for now and we just have to
there's<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:44.850> couple<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.270> tips<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.840> side

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
there's a couple little tips on the side

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.290 
there's a couple little tips on the side
here<00:02:46.230> we<00:02:46.350> just<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.770> kind<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.100> spread<00:02:47.459> this

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
here we just have to kind of spread this

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.120 
here we just have to kind of spread this
a<00:02:48.330> little<00:02:48.570> bit<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:48.989> this<00:02:49.380> will<00:02:49.560> pop<00:02:49.739> through

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
a little bit and this will pop through

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.540 
a little bit and this will pop through
pop<00:02:50.459> down<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.739> switch<00:02:52.950> comes<00:02:53.190> apart

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
pop down and as the switch comes apart

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.590 
pop down and as the switch comes apart
you'll<00:02:53.730> find<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.120> there's<00:02:54.300> over<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.510> little

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
you'll find that there's over a little

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.140 
you'll find that there's over a little
turnover<00:02:54.989> there's<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> little<00:02:55.560> disk<00:02:56.150> inside

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
turnover there's a little disk inside

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.259 
turnover there's a little disk inside
here<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> little<00:02:57.660> plate<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.980> how<00:02:59.760> this<00:02:59.970> works

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
here a little plate and how this works

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.120 
here a little plate and how this works
is<00:03:00.540> when<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.140> there's<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.440> little<00:03:01.680> button<00:03:01.950> in

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
is when it there's a little button in

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.770 
is when it there's a little button in
here<00:03:02.370> if<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.519> see<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:02.700> little<00:03:02.790> button<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
here if you see this little button and

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.710 
here if you see this little button and
that<00:03:03.900> button<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.500> pressed<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:06.450> this<00:03:06.570> button

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
that button is pressed when this button

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.590 
that button is pressed when this button
gets<00:03:06.989> pressed<00:03:07.050> it<00:03:07.680> turns<00:03:08.370> off<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.150> switch<00:03:09.390> it

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
gets pressed it turns off the switch it

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.080 
gets pressed it turns off the switch it
opens<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.110> switch<00:03:10.350> see<00:03:11.160> the<00:03:11.280> contacts<00:03:11.790> there

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
opens the switch see the contacts there

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
opens the switch see the contacts there

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
contacts so what happens when the disk

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.440 
contacts so what happens when the disk
would<00:03:17.519> he<00:03:17.820> overheats

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
would he overheats

where's<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:29.040> what<00:03:29.190> events<00:03:29.519> okay<00:03:29.640> there<00:03:30.390> it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
where's that what events okay there it

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.630 
where's that what events okay there it
is

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
is

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.900 
is
they're<00:03:32.640> a<00:03:32.880> little<00:03:33.090> thick<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.470> now<00:03:34.910> reset

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
they're a little thick that is now reset

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.550 
they're a little thick that is now reset
this<00:03:36.870> bimetallic<00:03:37.320> strip<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:38.700> its<00:03:39.560> normal

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
this bimetallic strip to its normal

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.850 
this bimetallic strip to its normal
position<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:41.970> is<00:03:42.090> no<00:03:42.299> longer<00:03:42.650> pressing<00:03:43.650> on

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
position so it is no longer pressing on

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.930 
position so it is no longer pressing on
that<00:03:44.850> little<00:03:45.360> button<00:03:45.959> so<00:03:46.860> then<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.160> take<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that little button so then we take the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:55.580 
that little button so then we take the
unit<00:03:48.350> set<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.440> back<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:52.790> place<00:03:53.790> our<00:03:54.590> heat

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
unit set it back in place our heat

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.890 
unit set it back in place our heat
transfer<00:03:57.019> aluminum<00:03:58.019> casing<00:03:58.680> on<00:03:58.829> it

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
transfer aluminum casing on it

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.960 
transfer aluminum casing on it
place<00:04:00.900> our<00:04:01.200> insulator<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.430> top<00:04:02.640> again

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
place our insulator on the top again

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.110 
place our insulator on the top again
like<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:06.049> and<00:04:07.049> then<00:04:07.440> once<00:04:08.160> again<00:04:08.459> put<00:04:08.970> the

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
like this and then once again put the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.140 
like this and then once again put the
top<00:04:09.329> cover<00:04:09.570> on<00:04:10.130> put<00:04:11.130> the<00:04:11.220> little<00:04:11.430> tabs<00:04:11.670> through

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
top cover on put the little tabs through

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.210 
top cover on put the little tabs through
the<00:04:12.500> little<00:04:13.500> slots<00:04:13.829> on<00:04:14.220> here<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.890> we<00:04:16.890> are<00:04:16.979> good

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
the little slots on here and we are good

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.659 
the little slots on here and we are good
to<00:04:17.250> go<00:04:18.200> now<00:04:19.200> if<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:19.470> really<00:04:20.099> felt<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.489> I

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
to go now if I really felt like that I

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.370 
to go now if I really felt like that I
could<00:04:20.910> bend<00:04:21.239> these<00:04:21.390> little<00:04:21.630> tabs<00:04:21.810> over<00:04:22.019> I<00:04:22.140> get

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
could bend these little tabs over I get

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.010 
could bend these little tabs over I get
maybe<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.650> will

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
maybe I will

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.270 
maybe I will
a<00:04:23.050> little<00:04:23.440> bit<00:04:23.530> they're<00:04:23.830> not<00:04:24.009> really

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
a little bit they're not really

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.740 
a little bit they're not really
necessary<00:04:24.789> and<00:04:24.910> if<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.150> do<00:04:25.330> them<00:04:25.449> too<00:04:25.599> many

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
necessary and if you do them too many

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.809 
necessary and if you do them too many
times<00:04:25.960> they<00:04:26.139> will<00:04:26.259> break<00:04:26.560> it's<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.550> kind<00:04:27.789> of

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
times they will break it's just kind of

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.089 
times they will break it's just kind of
hold<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.210> together<00:04:28.360> now<00:04:29.110> I<00:04:29.139> can<00:04:29.500> take<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
hold it together now I can take the

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:32.369 
hold it together now I can take the
thermal<00:04:30.699> cut<00:04:30.849> out<00:04:31.000> and<00:04:31.449> I<00:04:31.659> can<00:04:31.810> put<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.050> back<00:04:32.199> in

00:04:32.369 --> 00:04:32.379 
thermal cut out and I can put it back in

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:34.080 
thermal cut out and I can put it back in
the<00:04:32.440> microwave<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.490> unit<00:04:33.789> will<00:04:33.909> work

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
the microwave and the unit will work

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.749 
the microwave and the unit will work
until<00:04:34.990> it<00:04:35.139> overheats<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.650> game<00:04:35.830> so<00:04:36.370> let's<00:04:36.580> do

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
until it overheats a game so let's do

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.680 
until it overheats a game so let's do
that<00:04:36.789> okay<00:04:37.409> so<00:04:38.409> I'm<00:04:38.500> mounting<00:04:38.889> the<00:04:39.690> thermal

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
that okay so I'm mounting the thermal

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.839 
that okay so I'm mounting the thermal
cutout<00:04:40.870> again<00:04:41.259> realign<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.159> screws<00:04:42.430> up<00:04:42.639> here

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
cutout again realign the screws up here

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.399 
cutout again realign the screws up here
it's<00:04:43.270> important<00:04:43.690> to<00:04:43.750> make<00:04:43.900> sure<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.080> your

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
it's important to make sure that your

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.219 
it's important to make sure that your
insulator<00:04:44.860> is<00:04:45.479> in<00:04:46.479> place<00:04:46.690> between<00:04:46.930> the

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
insulator is in place between the

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:51.210 
insulator is in place between the
magnetron<00:04:47.740> and<00:04:48.009> the<00:04:48.909> thermal<00:04:49.240> cutout<00:04:50.099> when<00:04:51.099> it

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
magnetron and the thermal cutout when it

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.779 
magnetron and the thermal cutout when it
provides<00:04:51.520> electrical<00:04:52.000> insulation<00:04:52.500> from<00:04:53.789> the

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
provides electrical insulation from the

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.820 
provides electrical insulation from the
magnetron<00:04:55.270> itself<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.080> secondly<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.740> also

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
magnetron itself but secondly it also

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.350 
magnetron itself but secondly it also
reduces<00:04:57.699> the<00:04:57.759> rate<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.180> heat<00:04:58.330> transfer

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
reduces the rate of heat transfer

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.210 
reduces the rate of heat transfer
because<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.319> don't<00:04:59.470> want<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.680> same<00:04:59.889> tripping

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
because you don't want the same tripping

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.460 
because you don't want the same tripping
prematurely<00:05:00.699> right<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.930> now<00:05:02.050> we're<00:05:02.229> going<00:05:02.380> to

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
prematurely right so now we're going to

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.080 
prematurely right so now we're going to
connect<00:05:02.889> the<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:04.330> power<00:05:04.569> leads<00:05:04.870> here<00:05:05.110> game

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
connect the the power leads here game

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.909 
connect the the power leads here game
and<00:05:07.090> now<00:05:07.210> you<00:05:07.360> see<00:05:07.599> if<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.780> take<00:05:07.990> my<00:05:08.139> meter<00:05:08.349> and<00:05:08.710> I

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
and now you see if I take my meter and I

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:11.430 
and now you see if I take my meter and I
mean<00:05:09.130> I'm<00:05:09.280> still<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.840> continuity<00:05:10.840> mode<00:05:11.169> if<00:05:11.319> i

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
mean I'm still in continuity mode if i

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.159 
mean I'm still in continuity mode if i
touch<00:05:11.500> my<00:05:11.919> meter<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.370> here

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
touch my meter on here

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.350 
touch my meter on here
you'll<00:05:14.169> hear<00:05:14.409> we<00:05:14.560> have<00:05:14.680> continuity<00:05:15.280> here<00:05:15.490> the

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
you'll hear we have continuity here the

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.600 
you'll hear we have continuity here the
same<00:05:16.569> is<00:05:16.719> on<00:05:16.870> the<00:05:17.050> fuse<00:05:17.289> so<00:05:17.560> we<00:05:17.680> know<00:05:17.830> that<00:05:18.490> we

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
same is on the fuse so we know that we

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.330 
same is on the fuse so we know that we
now<00:05:18.729> have<00:05:18.909> continuity<00:05:19.509> and<00:05:20.289> we<00:05:20.830> can<00:05:20.979> plug<00:05:21.190> the

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
now have continuity and we can plug the

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.170 
now have continuity and we can plug the
microwave<00:05:21.729> in<00:05:22.830> and<00:05:23.830> we<00:05:24.460> shall<00:05:24.729> have<00:05:24.879> power

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
microwave in and we shall have power

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.360 
microwave in and we shall have power
well<00:05:25.750> there<00:05:25.930> we<00:05:26.050> have<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.379> I<00:05:26.560> can<00:05:26.860> now<00:05:26.979> set<00:05:27.250> the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
well there we have it I can now set the

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.399 
well there we have it I can now set the
clock<00:05:27.610> on<00:05:27.819> this<00:05:27.940> thing<00:05:28.000> yeah<00:05:28.990> that's<00:05:29.169> good

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:29.409 
clock on this thing yeah that's good

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.309 
clock on this thing yeah that's good
enough<00:05:29.440> for<00:05:29.620> testing<00:05:30.719> yeah<00:05:31.719> I<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:32.020> put<00:05:32.169> it<00:05:32.259> on

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
enough for testing yeah I just put it on

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.300 
enough for testing yeah I just put it on
for<00:05:32.380> a<00:05:32.530> couple<00:05:32.680> seconds<00:05:33.219> and<00:05:35.069> we're<00:05:36.069> gonna<00:05:36.159> do

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
for a couple seconds and we're gonna do

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.399 
for a couple seconds and we're gonna do
here<00:05:36.520> except<00:05:36.789> I<00:05:37.300> don't<00:05:37.960> want<00:05:38.169> the<00:05:38.229> thing

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
here except I don't want the thing

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:39.600 
here except I don't want the thing
