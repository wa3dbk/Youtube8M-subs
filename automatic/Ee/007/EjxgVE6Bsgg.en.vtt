00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.620 
and I enjoy that so much because it
definitely<00:03:13.620> shifts<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.400> overall<00:03:14.940> tension

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.380 
definitely shifts the overall tension
and<00:03:16.050> atmosphere<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.100> entire<00:03:17.459> episode<00:03:18.120> and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390

the<00:03:18.510> series<00:03:18.540> in<00:03:19.049> general<00:03:19.160> because<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.190> never

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
the series in general because you never

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.670 
the series in general because you never
know<00:03:20.940> who<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.209> truly<00:03:21.780> going<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.230> win<00:03:22.500> because

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
know who is truly going to win because

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.250 
know who is truly going to win because
since<00:03:23.519> high<00:03:23.790> Q<00:03:24.060> is<00:03:24.209> going<00:03:24.360> to<00:03:24.510> be<00:03:24.600> ending<00:03:25.110> in

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
since high Q is going to be ending in

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.460 
since high Q is going to be ending in
two<00:03:25.560> episodes<00:03:25.739> okay<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:27.170> honestly<00:03:28.170> thought

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
two episodes okay I honestly thought

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.319 
two episodes okay I honestly thought
maybe<00:03:28.799> they<00:03:29.040> might<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.370> had<00:03:29.489> an<00:03:29.579> unexpected

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
maybe they might have had an unexpected

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.360 
maybe they might have had an unexpected
loss<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:31.049> episode<00:03:31.500> maybe<00:03:31.829> even<00:03:32.190> next

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
loss this episode maybe even next

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.770 
loss this episode maybe even next
episode<00:03:32.790> because<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.209> mean<00:03:33.360> since<00:03:33.570> they're

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
episode because I mean since they're

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.390 
episode because I mean since they're
wanting<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.110> end<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:34.739> there<00:03:35.070> must<00:03:35.250> be

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
wanting to end it here there must be

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.590 
wanting to end it here there must be
something<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.790> you<00:03:36.000> know<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.239> either<00:03:36.420> gonna
