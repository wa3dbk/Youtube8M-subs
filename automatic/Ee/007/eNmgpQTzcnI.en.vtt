get your battery and an a over there we

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.290 
get your battery and an a over there we
need<00:05:19.759> to<00:05:20.029> basically<00:05:20.990> break<00:05:21.500> down<00:05:21.560> the<00:05:22.250> whole

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
need to basically break down the whole

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.219 
need to basically break down the whole
photograph<00:05:23.300> but<00:05:23.389> there's<00:05:23.599> just<00:05:23.840> two<00:05:24.259> parts<00:05:24.650> so

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
photograph but there's just two parts so

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:32.709 
photograph but there's just two parts so
there's<00:05:27.229> a<00:05:27.289> screw<00:05:27.650> here<00:05:31.060> on<00:05:32.060> this<00:05:32.270> part<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.659> the

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
there's a screw here on this part of the

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:35.079 
there's a screw here on this part of the
foregrip<00:05:33.310> then<00:05:34.310> using<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:34.789> screwdriver

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:35.089

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:37.420 
foregrip then using the screwdriver
that's<00:05:35.629> supplied<00:05:35.990> what<00:05:36.500> the<00:05:36.680> gun<00:05:36.860> you<00:05:37.039> simply

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
that's supplied what the gun you simply

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:40.119 
that's supplied what the gun you simply
release<00:05:37.610> that<00:05:38.229> this<00:05:39.229> portion<00:05:39.740> here<00:05:39.889> then

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
release that this portion here then

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.279 
release that this portion here then
breaks<00:05:40.400> down<00:05:40.580> into<00:05:40.789> two<00:05:40.969> parts<00:05:41.110> you<00:05:42.110> can

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
breaks down into two parts you can

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.550 
breaks down into two parts you can
connect<00:05:42.770> the<00:05:43.129> battery<00:05:43.550> with<00:05:44.479> that's<00:05:45.229> a<00:05:45.319> large

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
connect the battery with that's a large

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.959 
connect the battery with that's a large
connector<00:05:46.039> it<00:05:46.159> take<00:05:46.339> so<00:05:46.520> you<00:05:46.550> connect<00:05:46.909> the

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:46.969 
connector it take so you connect the

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.089 
connector it take so you connect the
batteries<00:05:47.330> normal<00:05:47.719> large<00:05:48.199> connector<00:05:48.740> and

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:49.099 
batteries normal large connector and

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.740 
batteries normal large connector and
then<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.520> put<00:05:49.699> the<00:05:49.759> two<00:05:49.909> parts<00:05:50.240> of<00:05:50.389> there<00:05:50.569> the

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
then you put the two parts of there the

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.689 
then you put the two parts of there the
four<00:05:50.930> bit<00:05:51.139> black<00:05:51.319> to<00:05:51.469> get<00:05:51.589> up<00:05:51.800> screw<00:05:52.430> back<00:05:52.639> up

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
four bit black to get up screw back up

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.110 
four bit black to get up screw back up
and<00:05:53.509> that's<00:05:53.750> a<00:05:53.870> gun<00:05:54.199> assembled<00:05:54.849> what<00:05:55.849> the<00:05:55.940> bar

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
and that's a gun assembled what the bar

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.170 
and that's a gun assembled what the bar
gets<00:05:56.330> in<00:05:56.449> will<00:05:56.629> do<00:05:56.690> shoot<00:05:56.870> see<00:05:57.099> them<00:05:58.099> above<00:05:58.759> the

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
gets in will do shoot see them above the

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.619 
gets in will do shoot see them above the
foregrip<00:05:59.659> we<00:06:00.110> have<00:06:00.349> the<00:06:00.830> foresight<00:06:01.370> and<00:06:02.150> again

00:06:02.619 --> 00:06:02.629 
foregrip we have the foresight and again

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:03.670 
foregrip we have the foresight and again
this<00:06:02.779> is<00:06:02.930> something<00:06:03.259> that<00:06:03.289> used<00:06:03.500> to<00:06:03.529> be

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
this is something that used to be

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.100 
this is something that used to be
assembled<00:06:04.189> when<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:04.669> take<00:06:04.849> the<00:06:04.969> gun<00:06:05.150> over<00:06:05.990> the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
assembled when you take the gun over the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.499 
assembled when you take the gun over the
box<00:06:06.319> and<00:06:07.039> that's<00:06:07.430> like<00:06:07.759> nothing<00:06:08.120> easier<00:06:08.479> than

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
box and that's like nothing easier than

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:11.320 
box and that's like nothing easier than
that<00:06:08.810> and<00:06:09.620> then<00:06:09.830> become<00:06:10.310> to<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.939> barrel<00:06:11.210> of
