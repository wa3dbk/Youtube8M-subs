00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.660
 The teens at first you came to the conclusion from all over the globe 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.660
 then lead to a sense of humor 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 I have the car until 2 SID 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.089
 in game 77 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.089
 ca 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:30.249
 they agree only ten seconds before 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.170
 I had a little dance this morning, in 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.940
 ca 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.710
 So I'm going down the street over the Rennsteig is first and 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.280
 extensively celebrated 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.950
 Breker 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.590
 more 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.350
 what to touch too high 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 promoter 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.230
 7 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.390
 the previous Elte 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.400
 we will not get her I just came out of the emergency room and I said that 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 I should have my arm off 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.950
 Computer says Nahr 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.030
 SZ what is the study no more appointments today 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.330
 to offer a minister hunter in late March 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.520
 Sooner or later that will happen 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.670
 Ahlhaus is a recognized record box she well-known song is easily injured 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:40.940
 or even broken 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.340
 but we are fully booked to call them a little better before their fall 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.960
 should 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.210
 they are not meant to help me in the next field Eto I just try 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.830
 rarely does not get easier 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.300
 On the other hand, they could not possibly offer now 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.300
 maybe they can not find the one to relate anymore 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 in the future 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:09.410
 I would like to complain 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.989

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.119

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.989
