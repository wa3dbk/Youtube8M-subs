00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.070
 Hello my dear viewers from 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.110
 The economic situation is now in the country to 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.449
 Sorry on my channel is no longer 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.150
 there were computer assemblies but sometimes 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.000
 after all something yes slips and sometimes 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.519
 even shoots and today I want both 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.130
 just dilute the video on your channel and 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.589
 add computer assembly which 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.570
 probably already many were waiting right away 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.610
 I want to warn and apologize 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.130
 the computer was very urgently needed 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.530
 collect and almost immediately give 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.540
 so this is not just a computer 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.240
 compiled for video this is a computer on 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.560
 The sale was compiled for a video render. 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.860
 powerful graphic 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.600
 render station so its very urgent 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.760
 it was necessary to give and withdrawal 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160
 as detailed as I would like 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.650
 I unfortunately failed not to mention 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.170
 about testing in games and specials 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.030
 applications of course but since 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.730
 there were no computer assemblies on the channel 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.130
 a long time ago I decided to share at least 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.290
 these videos and so you probably remember 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.240
 most recently on my channel was 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 video review system in gigabytes 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.680
 waterforce there were three video cards 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.460
 980 powerful processor 5930 to and the whole 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 The system is assembled in a corsair 780 package . 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.030
 many shouted supposedly the system is outdated 980 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.240
 no longer relevant since the 980ti came out 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.930
 Well get here it system 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 three 980ti oh well let's get down to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.390
 review and since I already said the system 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.180
 according to my data was collected specially 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.880
 to render video to work with video and 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.310
 to work in 3d applications and begin 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.010
 review as usual from the body is all that 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.470
 same top carter 780 t 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.180
 I do not know what the trend but nonetheless 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.130
 Almost all are now top 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.409
 the computer is going exactly this 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.280
 the video card package as I already said 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.680
 installed three pieces gtx 980ti they 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.830
 reference therefore even despite 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.659
 so tight fitting nonetheless 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.640
 airflow and temperature conditions will be 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.620
 more or less adequate since the air 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.350
 sucked not only through the turbine 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.540
 below 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.880
 but also there is a hole in the back there 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.340
 cold air is also drawn in 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.280
 if it were not reference cards 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.040
 with air intake only from below, that's all 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.430
 it would be a lot worse processor here 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
 also corresponding to this intel core i7 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.300
 5960 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.790
 x extreme edishen recall this is eight cores 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:41.120
 frequency of 3 gigahertz and cache third 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.370
 level here as much as 20 megabytes and in total 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.920
 the difficulty here is 16 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.960
 computational flow cooled it 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.260
 water cooled system 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.510
 cooler master nepton 280l 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.060
 here is a big radiator designed for 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.250
 fitting two and 140 millimeter 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.030
 fans motherboard here 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.750
 gigabyte x99 in d5 with built-in wi-fi 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.760
 module and backlit ports 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.040
 RAM is 32 gigabytes 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.500
 this is kingston hyper x fury 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.020
 there are two separate ssd installed 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.720
 drive that is not in the raid of the company 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.910
 sandisk and exact volume unfortunately not 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.650
 I can say well and the power supply here 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.850
 Of course, the corresponding 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 This is thermaltake power supply. 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.530
 model and a half kilowatt 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.900
 it may seem like a lot to someone 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.370
 but nevertheless , if we estimate that three 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.040
 reference 980ti in total give 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.430
 750 watts crash plus one hundred forty watts 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.980
 processors plus 100 watts top on all 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.530
 the rest of that turns out almost 1 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.480
 kilowatt power consumption and this with 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.150
 considering that everything will be in stock 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.310
 mode and without overclocking so one and a half 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.610
 kilowatt I think given the small 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.410
 Acceleration is the most it is such a powerful 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.890
 the computer turned out in total 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.390
 here are 16 compute threads three 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.790
 the most top 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.670
 single-chip video card with volume 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.850
 6 gigabytes of memory as much as two ssd 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.730
 drive top case power supply 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:19.790
 a half kilowatt 32 gigabytes of memory 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.040
 and the top motherboard is 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.440
 Here is a powerful render station but 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.050
 I have everything today if you want 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.930
 order such a computer then I want to take 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.090
 you have an autograph but seriously the link 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.790
 on a similar configuration on the comp site 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.550
 day is in the description under this video 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.940
 Thank you all for your attention and see you in 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.940
 new reviews
