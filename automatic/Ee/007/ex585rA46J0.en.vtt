00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
the batteries in it or do we need to put

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.820 
the batteries in it or do we need to put
batteries<00:05:06.880> in<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.180> I'm<00:05:07.510> not<00:05:07.539> sure<00:05:08.110> well<00:05:08.620> let's

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
batteries in it I'm not sure well let's

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.560 
batteries in it I'm not sure well let's
see<00:05:09.039> so<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.430> do<00:05:09.699> this<00:05:09.910> and<00:05:10.449> then<00:05:12.210> put<00:05:13.210> the<00:05:13.360> bowl

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
see so you do this and then put the bowl

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.240 
see so you do this and then put the bowl
on<00:05:13.599> and<00:05:14.440> then<00:05:14.680> clip<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.340> little<00:05:15.820> wet<00:05:16.000> skin<00:05:17.250> not

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
on and then clip the little wet skin not

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.020 
on and then clip the little wet skin not
sure<00:05:18.430> there's<00:05:18.639> a<00:05:18.699> certain<00:05:19.030> way<00:05:19.620> probably<00:05:20.620> oh

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.230 

there<00:05:25.030> we<00:05:25.120> go<00:05:26.010> that's<00:05:27.010> plastic<00:05:27.430> so<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.030> think

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
there we go that's plastic so I think

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.839 
there we go that's plastic so I think
you<00:05:28.510> should<00:05:28.539> be<00:05:28.780> very<00:05:28.810> careful<00:05:29.349> about<00:05:29.680> the<00:05:30.610> end

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:30.849 
you should be very careful about the end

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.649 
you should be very careful about the end
piece<00:05:31.120> yeah<00:05:31.570> and<00:05:31.870> then<00:05:36.000> I<00:05:37.000> don't<00:05:37.479> know<00:05:37.539> if<00:05:37.599> we

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
piece yeah and then I don't know if we

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.920 
piece yeah and then I don't know if we
have<00:05:37.750> to<00:05:37.810> put<00:05:37.930> batteries<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.289> it<00:05:38.500> I<00:05:39.780> think<00:05:40.780> we

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
have to put batteries in it I think we

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.029 
have to put batteries in it I think we
do<00:05:41.699> yeah<00:05:42.699> so<00:05:43.449> we<00:05:43.780> don't<00:05:43.990> batteries<00:05:44.620> in<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.949> so

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
do yeah so we don't batteries in it so

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.050 
do yeah so we don't batteries in it so
that's<00:05:45.159> why<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.430> not<00:05:45.460> working<00:05:45.580> what's

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
that's why it's not working what's

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.550 
that's why it's not working what's
supposed<00:05:46.270> to<00:05:46.419> do<00:05:46.510> is<00:05:46.570> this<00:05:46.780> start<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.349> actually

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
supposed to do is this start is actually

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.290
