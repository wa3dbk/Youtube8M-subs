okay<00:00:01.410> here's<00:00:01.680> the<00:00:01.740> finished<00:00:02.010> product<00:00:02.669> we've

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
okay here's the finished product we've

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.639 
okay here's the finished product we've
got<00:00:03.540> four<00:00:03.959> leads<00:00:05.750> got<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.930> aluminum<00:00:07.379> which<00:00:07.529> is

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
got four leads got the aluminum which is

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.450 
got four leads got the aluminum which is
being<00:00:07.830> held<00:00:08.130> up<00:00:08.280> by<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.599> alligator<00:00:09.599> clip<00:00:10.460> we

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
being held up by the alligator clip we

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.070 
being held up by the alligator clip we
have<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.730> copper<00:00:15.260> which<00:00:16.260> was<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.680> second

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
have the copper which was the second

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.640 
have the copper which was the second
cool<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.439> put<00:00:19.680> around<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.100> aluminum

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
cool that was put around the aluminum

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
cool that was put around the aluminum
after<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> did<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.460> made<00:00:23.730> crystals

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
after I did that and made crystals

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.560 
after I did that and made crystals
around<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.960> wrapped<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.980> piece<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.570> solder

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
around it I wrapped a piece of solder

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.609 
around it I wrapped a piece of solder
around<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:29.420> now<00:00:30.420> before<00:00:30.570> I<00:00:30.779> put<00:00:31.050> crystals

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
around it now before I put crystals

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.510 
around it now before I put crystals
around<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:32.070> solder<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:33.829> charged<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> copper

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
around the solder I charged the copper

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.389 
around the solder I charged the copper
to<00:00:35.730> make<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.480> blue<00:00:36.870> crystals<00:00:37.559> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> copper

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
to make the blue crystals on the copper

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
to make the blue crystals on the copper
which<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.850> mean<00:00:39.120> some<00:00:39.329> people<00:00:39.600> call<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.750> as<00:00:39.989> rice

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
which I mean some people call it as rice

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.200 
which I mean some people call it as rice
some<00:00:40.530> people<00:00:40.770> call<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:42.500> copper<00:00:43.500> sulfate<00:00:44.210> but

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
some people call it copper sulfate but

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
some people call it copper sulfate but
anyway<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.870> used<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.710> piece<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> salt<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.430> put

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
anyway I used a piece of salt or put

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.060 
anyway I used a piece of salt or put
some<00:00:47.760> copper<00:00:48.210> sulfate<00:00:48.750> into<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.559> crystals

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
some copper sulfate into the crystals

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
some copper sulfate into the crystals
which<00:00:50.910> worked<00:00:51.210> really<00:00:51.570> well<00:00:51.719> that's<00:00:52.260> where

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
which worked really well that's where

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
which worked really well that's where
the<00:00:52.559> blue<00:00:53.190> hues<00:00:53.670> coming<00:00:54.120> from<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.480> don't<00:00:54.539> know

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
the blue hues coming from I don't know

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.250 
the blue hues coming from I don't know
if<00:00:54.809> y'all<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.110> able<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> pick<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.800> but<00:00:56.070> uh

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
if y'all be able to pick it up but uh

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.580 
if y'all be able to pick it up but uh
there's<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> blue<00:00:59.809> hue<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.469> way

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there's a blue hue going all the way

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.450 
there's a blue hue going all the way
through<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.510> anyway<00:01:03.510> after<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> did<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
through it anyway after I did that it

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.240 
through it anyway after I did that it
kind<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:07.189> messed<00:01:08.189> up<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.360> solder<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
kind of messed up the the solder so I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
kind of messed up the the solder so I
put<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> new<00:01:11.700> piece<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:12.090> solder<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.780> put

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
put a new piece of solder on it put

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.969 
put a new piece of solder on it put
another<00:01:13.290> thing<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.369> crystals<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:15.000> it

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
another thing at crystals around it

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.929 
another thing at crystals around it
after<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.159> was<00:01:17.340> getting<00:01:17.549> pretty<00:01:17.670> good

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
after that I was getting pretty good

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969 
after that I was getting pretty good
readings<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.020> decided<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.740> take<00:01:19.920> some

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
readings but I decided to take some

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.870 
readings but I decided to take some
steel<00:01:20.460> fishing<00:01:21.030> leader<00:01:22.460> which<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.640> right

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
steel fishing leader which is right

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.960 
steel fishing leader which is right
there<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.720> make<00:01:25.680> another<00:01:25.979> rapper<00:01:26.340> crystal<00:01:26.850> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
there and make another rapper crystal so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.899 
there and make another rapper crystal so
I<00:01:27.030> got<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.570> leads<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.140> their<00:01:28.380> words

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:51.070 

you

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:56.600 

every<00:01:52.080> time<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.730 

crystal<00:01:57.600> did<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.870> put<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.590> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
crystal did I put on there just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:08.000 
crystal did I put on there just
dissolves<00:01:59.370> away

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.520 

if<00:02:09.010> it's<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.520> fourth<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.540> final<00:02:10.600> step<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.440> the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
if it's the fourth and final step of the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.790 
if it's the fourth and final step of the
project<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.730> steel<00:02:16.180> fishing<00:02:16.840> wire<00:02:17.110> they

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
project that is steel fishing wire they

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.070 
project that is steel fishing wire they
had<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> plastic<00:02:18.640> coat<00:02:19.210> on<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:21.840> write<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.960> all

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
had a plastic coat on it I write it all

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.020 
had a plastic coat on it I write it all
the<00:02:23.200> way<00:02:23.290> around<00:02:23.440> i'm<00:02:23.800> holding<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.340> wire<00:02:24.730> in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
the way around i'm holding the wire in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.920 
the way around i'm holding the wire in
place<00:02:25.060> right<00:02:25.750> there<00:02:26.020> with<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:27.930> alligator

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930

clip

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.920 

go<00:02:40.190> ahead<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.580> put<00:02:40.760> another<00:02:40.850> layer<00:02:41.210> crystals

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
go ahead and put another layer crystals

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:49.700 
go ahead and put another layer crystals
on<00:02:42.080> this
