I<00:00:01.610> saw<00:00:02.610> where<00:00:02.760> thou<00:00:02.939> lost<00:00:03.480> able<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.470> get<00:00:04.589> on

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
I saw where thou lost able to get on

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
I saw where thou lost able to get on
with<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.859> bit<00:00:04.950> of<00:00:04.980> spring<00:00:05.310> work<00:00:05.899> we've<00:00:06.899> been

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
with a bit of spring work we've been

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.110 
with a bit of spring work we've been
doing<00:00:07.170> some<00:00:07.680> haricot<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.189> weeding<00:00:08.519> here<00:00:08.700> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
doing some haricot and weeding here the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.520 
doing some haricot and weeding here the
weed<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.750> other<00:00:09.900> side<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> field

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
weed is on the other side of the field

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.650 
weed is on the other side of the field
so<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> can't<00:00:11.010> show<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> that<00:00:11.400> at<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.269> moment

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
so I can't show you that at the moment

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.490 
so I can't show you that at the moment
but<00:00:13.190> we're<00:00:14.190> doing<00:00:14.400> these<00:00:14.490> beans<00:00:15.170> which<00:00:16.170> turn

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
but we're doing these beans which turn

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.070 
but we're doing these beans which turn
on<00:00:16.619> wide<00:00:16.830> rows<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.940> hair<00:00:18.090> comb<00:00:18.359> actually

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
on wide rows the hair comb actually

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.689 
on wide rows the hair comb actually
isn't<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.529> effective<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:20.279> putting<00:00:20.520> weeds

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
isn't that effective for putting weeds

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.779 
isn't that effective for putting weeds
out<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.480> can<00:00:21.630> pull<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:21.900> one<00:00:22.080> or<00:00:22.199> two

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
out you can pull out one or two

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.359 
out you can pull out one or two
broadleaf<00:00:23.789> weeds<00:00:24.060> just<00:00:24.150> cutting<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:25.369> speed

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
broadleaf weeds just cutting this speed

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.359 
broadleaf weeds just cutting this speed
well<00:00:26.580> out<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:27.599> pulls<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.680> black<00:00:29.160> grass

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
well out it pulls a bit of black grass

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.590 
well out it pulls a bit of black grass
out<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.900> it<00:00:30.900> doesn't<00:00:31.140> do<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.890> huge<00:00:32.279> amount<00:00:32.600> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
out but it doesn't do a huge amount the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.319 
out but it doesn't do a huge amount the
one<00:00:33.780> thing<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.110> helping<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:35.190> do<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
one thing it is helping to do here is to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.840 
one thing it is helping to do here is to
level<00:00:37.170> these<00:00:37.290> fields<00:00:37.860> up<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.730> we

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
level these fields up a bit so then we

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.139 
level these fields up a bit so then we
can<00:00:39.000> use<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.510> intro<00:00:40.290> hoe<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.820> try<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
can use the intro hoe in them we try to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.630 
can use the intro hoe in them we try to
mint<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> row<00:00:42.660> hoeing<00:00:43.020> yesterday<00:00:43.469> but<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
mint a row hoeing yesterday but the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.340 
mint a row hoeing yesterday but the
field<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.430> on<00:00:47.430> level<00:00:48.050> that<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.170> very

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
field is so on level that it's very

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.310 
field is so on level that it's very
difficult<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.719> sort<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.780> an

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
difficult to get a sort of an

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.819 
difficult to get a sort of an
appropriate<00:00:53.160> depth<00:00:53.460> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> hoe<00:00:54.140> so<00:00:55.140> if

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
appropriate depth on the hoe so if

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.209 
appropriate depth on the hoe so if
anything<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:58.140> HERA<00:00:58.320> comb<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.890> helping

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
anything the HERA comb is just helping

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.220 
anything the HERA comb is just helping
level<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> fields<00:01:00.239> pulling<00:01:00.600> sowing<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.109> pull

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
level the fields pulling sowing to pull

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
level the fields pulling sowing to pull
a<00:01:01.260> few<00:01:01.500> weeds<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.489> maybe<00:01:02.670> checking<00:01:03.059> them<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
a few weeds out maybe checking them a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.420 
a few weeds out maybe checking them a
little<00:01:03.600> bit<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.890> lovely<00:01:05.129> sunny<00:01:05.339> day

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
little bit but on a lovely sunny day

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.969 
little bit but on a lovely sunny day
like<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:06.450> pull<00:01:06.689> any<00:01:06.840> weeds<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.320> at

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
like this if we do pull any weeds out at

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.170 
like this if we do pull any weeds out at
least<00:01:08.159> they're<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.670> sort<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.880> dry<00:01:09.060> out

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
least they're going to sort of dry out

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.820 
least they're going to sort of dry out
in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> surface<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:12.200> that's<00:01:13.200> just<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> start

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in the surface so that's just the start

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.770 
in the surface so that's just the start
of<00:01:13.920> weeding<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.549> hopefully<00:01:15.030> we'll<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> few

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
of weeding so hopefully we'll get a few

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
of weeding so hopefully we'll get a few
days<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.320> this<00:01:16.409> hurricane<00:01:16.680> weeding<00:01:17.159> in<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
days of this hurricane weeding in and

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.340 
days of this hurricane weeding in and
then<00:01:17.939> switch<00:01:18.210> over<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> inter<00:01:19.619> oho

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
then switch over to the inter oho

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.640 
then switch over to the inter oho
although<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.710> Harrow<00:01:23.340> combing<00:01:23.820> our<00:01:23.939> beans

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
although we are Harrow combing our beans

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.490 
although we are Harrow combing our beans
the<00:01:25.650> beans<00:01:25.830> are<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.750> drilled<00:01:27.750> straight<00:01:27.930> into

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
the beans are just drilled straight into

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.760 
the beans are just drilled straight into
some<00:01:29.460> fairly<00:01:29.700> rough<00:01:30.030> sea<00:01:30.299> beds<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.900> you've<00:01:31.590> got

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
some fairly rough sea beds so you've got

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.340 
some fairly rough sea beds so you've got
that<00:01:31.950> sort<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.970> roughness<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.630> produces

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
that sort of roughness that produces

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.460 
that sort of roughness that produces
some<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> tilt<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.520> Harrow<00:01:36.240> comb<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:37.079> even

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
some kind of tilt to Harrow comb in even

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870 
some kind of tilt to Harrow comb in even
when<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:37.829> hasn't<00:01:38.040> been<00:01:38.220> any<00:01:38.549> sort<00:01:38.790> of

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
when there hasn't been any sort of

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.359 
when there hasn't been any sort of
winter<00:01:39.210> Frost's<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.770> wanted<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.070> show<00:01:41.310> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
winter Frost's I just wanted to show you

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.690 
winter Frost's I just wanted to show you
some<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.450> these<00:01:42.509> wheats<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.430> it's<00:01:44.430> drilled

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
some of these wheats where it's drilled

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.289 
some of these wheats where it's drilled
into<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> much<00:01:45.540> better<00:01:45.750> seed<00:01:46.079> bed<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:47.299> normally

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
into a much better seed bed and normally

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.139 
into a much better seed bed and normally
in<00:01:48.540> any<00:01:48.840> other<00:01:49.590> year<00:01:49.979> where<00:01:50.490> you've<00:01:50.850> got

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
in any other year where you've got

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.420 
in any other year where you've got
probably<00:01:51.780> not<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.320> much<00:01:52.500> rain<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:52.799> also<00:01:53.070> some

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
probably not so much rain but also some

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
probably not so much rain but also some
Frost's<00:01:53.850> you'd<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.140> that<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.470> frost<00:01:55.770> had

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
Frost's you'd see that the frost had

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.550 
Frost's you'd see that the frost had
made<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> tilt<00:01:56.549> on<00:01:56.790> top<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.960> land<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.439> but

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
made a tilt on top of the land here but

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
made a tilt on top of the land here but
as<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.920> see<00:01:59.390> this<00:02:00.390> year<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:00.689> there'd

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
as you can see this year because there'd

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.230 
as you can see this year because there'd
been<00:02:00.990> no<00:02:01.020> frost<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.770> lift<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:03.030> sort<00:02:03.180> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
been no frost to lift it and to sort of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.270 
been no frost to lift it and to sort of
make<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.479> tilth

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
make that tilth

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.059 
make that tilth
by<00:02:05.280> sort<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.579> breaking<00:02:05.969> down<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.649> small<00:02:07.649> clods

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
by sort of breaking down the small clods

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.479 
by sort of breaking down the small clods
of<00:02:08.220> Earth<00:02:08.489> into<00:02:09.149> sort<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.509> fine<00:02:09.780> itself<00:02:10.140> is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
of Earth into sort of fine itself is

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.500 
of Earth into sort of fine itself is
absolutely<00:02:11.489> Rock

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
absolutely Rock

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.930 
absolutely Rock
I<00:02:12.570> say<00:02:13.380> rock<00:02:13.620> hard<00:02:13.890> underneath<00:02:14.430> it's<00:02:14.670> still

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I say rock hard underneath it's still

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.470 
I say rock hard underneath it's still
very<00:02:15.360> very<00:02:15.510> damp<00:02:16.460> because<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.760> rain<00:02:17.970> already

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
very very damp because the rain already

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.300 
very very damp because the rain already
start<00:02:18.660> up<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:18.990> the<00:02:19.170> soil<00:02:19.410> down<00:02:19.650> it's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
start up and the soil down it's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.680 
start up and the soil down it's
difficult<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:20.880> your<00:02:21.030> hand<00:02:21.270> in<00:02:21.450> there<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
difficult to get your hand in there and

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.030 
difficult to get your hand in there and
there's<00:02:21.990> a<00:02:22.080> lot<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.320> moisture<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:22.740> there<00:02:22.920> but

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
there's a lot of moisture in there but

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.620 
there's a lot of moisture in there but
on<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> top<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.670> sort<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.910> capped<00:02:24.210> with<00:02:24.480> all

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
on the top it sort of capped with all

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660 
on the top it sort of capped with all
the<00:02:24.780> rain<00:02:24.960> that<00:02:24.990> we've<00:02:25.290> had<00:02:25.520> meaning<00:02:26.520> that

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
the rain that we've had meaning that

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.690 
the rain that we've had meaning that
actually<00:02:27.120> in<00:02:27.270> these<00:02:27.510> in<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.470> situation<00:02:29.100> it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
actually in these in this situation it

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.150 
actually in these in this situation it
really<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:30.120> pretty<00:02:30.330> useless<00:02:30.920> using<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
really is pretty useless using the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.330 
really is pretty useless using the
Harrow<00:02:33.000> comb<00:02:33.620> which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.830> a<00:02:34.860> shame<00:02:35.100> because

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
Harrow comb which is a shame because

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.770 
Harrow comb which is a shame because
it's<00:02:35.640> one<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.820> our<00:02:35.940> tools<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.300> we<00:02:36.360> can<00:02:36.480> use<00:02:36.510> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
it's one of our tools that we can use to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.110 
it's one of our tools that we can use to
pull<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.020> weeds<00:02:37.230> organically<00:02:37.940> having<00:02:38.940> said

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
pull out weeds organically having said

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.090 
pull out weeds organically having said
that<00:02:39.150> this<00:02:39.480> field<00:02:39.900> actually<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.560> very

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
that this field actually is not very

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.030 
that this field actually is not very
weedy<00:02:41.400> so<00:02:41.970> I'm<00:02:42.060> not<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.330> worried<00:02:42.600> about<00:02:42.660> it

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
weedy so I'm not too worried about it

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000 
weedy so I'm not too worried about it
but<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.130> wanted<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.700> sort<00:02:45.240> of<00:02:45.360> explain<00:02:46.010> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
but I just wanted to sort of explain you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.320 
but I just wanted to sort of explain you
know<00:02:47.130> what<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:50.130> result<00:02:50.460> is<00:02:50.670> having<00:02:51.180> had

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
know what the the result is having had

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.320 
know what the the result is having had
no<00:02:51.920> frost<00:02:52.920> this<00:02:53.130> winter<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.670> having<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.120> had

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
no frost this winter and having so had

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.950 
no frost this winter and having so had
so<00:02:54.480> much<00:02:54.630> rain<00:02:57.350> we're<00:02:58.350> also<00:02:58.500> just<00:02:58.890> starting<00:02:59.640> to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
so much rain we're also just starting to

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.700 
so much rain we're also just starting to
pull<00:03:00.960> its<00:03:01.200> land<00:03:01.470> down<00:03:01.790> spring<00:03:02.790> drilling<00:03:03.180> and

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
pull its land down spring drilling and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.010 
pull its land down spring drilling and
we'd<00:03:04.710> normally<00:03:04.950> never<00:03:05.520> ever<00:03:05.820> take<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.720> war

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
we'd normally never ever take this war

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.540 
we'd normally never ever take this war
track

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.330 

because<00:03:10.550> usually<00:03:11.680> we<00:03:12.680> don't<00:03:12.860> have<00:03:13.040> as<00:03:13.160> much

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
because usually we don't have as much

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.660 
because usually we don't have as much
rain<00:03:13.670> as<00:03:13.879> we<00:03:14.090> have<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.690> had<00:03:15.190> focus<00:03:16.190> winter

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
rain as we have have had focus winter

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.460 
rain as we have have had focus winter
and<00:03:16.940> also<00:03:17.269> we<00:03:17.450> would<00:03:17.599> have<00:03:17.720> expected<00:03:18.290> to

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
and also we would have expected to

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.570 
and also we would have expected to
qualify<00:03:19.010> Frost's<00:03:19.930> which<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.980> frost<00:03:22.280> lifts

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
qualify Frost's which the frost lifts

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.630 
qualify Frost's which the frost lifts
the<00:03:22.700> soil<00:03:22.970> and<00:03:23.300> crack<00:03:24.140> the<00:03:24.920> flags<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.519> this

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
the soil and crack the flags on this

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.880 
the soil and crack the flags on this
plowed<00:03:25.910> land<00:03:26.239> and<00:03:26.599> usually<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.110> just<00:03:27.140> need<00:03:27.590> to

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
plowed land and usually you just need to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.009 
plowed land and usually you just need to
brush<00:03:28.400> across<00:03:28.730> it<00:03:29.000> with<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> cultivator<00:03:29.660> to<00:03:29.870> get

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
brush across it with a cultivator to get

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.259 
brush across it with a cultivator to get
a<00:03:30.050> spring<00:03:30.410> seat<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.099> this<00:03:31.700> year<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.060> lands

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
a spring seat but this year the lands

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.910 
a spring seat but this year the lands
really<00:03:32.660> been<00:03:32.840> packed<00:03:33.110> down<00:03:33.230> by<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.650> rain

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
really been packed down by the rain

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.860 
really been packed down by the rain
there's<00:03:34.430> been<00:03:34.640> no<00:03:34.819> frost<00:03:35.209> so<00:03:35.540> we<00:03:35.660> need

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
there's been no frost so we need

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.630 
there's been no frost so we need
something<00:03:36.170> bigger<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.739> look<00:03:37.010> for<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.280> land<00:03:37.459> up

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
something bigger to look for the land up

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.960 
something bigger to look for the land up
again<00:03:38.170> so<00:03:39.170> we're<00:03:39.290> doing<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.590> once<00:03:39.970> we're

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
again so we're doing this once we're

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.550 
again so we're doing this once we're
going<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.150> go<00:03:41.269> over<00:03:41.299> it<00:03:41.750> again<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:42.049> second<00:03:42.500> time

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
going to go over it again a second time

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.440 
going to go over it again a second time
just<00:03:43.160> leave<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.519> to<00:03:43.640> sort<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.910> slightly<00:03:44.120> dry

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
just leave it to sort of slightly dry

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.240 
just leave it to sort of slightly dry
out<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.660> top<00:03:44.870> we<00:03:45.019> should<00:03:45.230> take<00:03:45.500> two<00:03:46.099> or<00:03:46.220> three

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
out the top we should take two or three

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.539 
out the top we should take two or three
days<00:03:46.400> we<00:03:46.610> get<00:03:47.000> some<00:03:47.209> sunny<00:03:47.630> days<00:03:47.870> like<00:03:47.900> this

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
days we get some sunny days like this

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.740 
days we get some sunny days like this
this<00:03:49.549> is<00:03:49.730> one<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.060> fields<00:03:50.360> we<00:03:50.450> have<00:03:50.599> our

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this is one of the fields we have our

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.660 
this is one of the fields we have our
green<00:03:51.200> manure<00:03:51.560> in<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:51.950> you<00:03:52.069> can<00:03:52.250> see<00:03:52.430> a<00:03:52.459> bit<00:03:52.640> of

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
green manure in so you can see a bit of

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.479 
green manure in so you can see a bit of
mustard<00:03:52.940> still<00:03:53.930> popping<00:03:54.349> it<00:03:54.440> out<00:03:54.680> of<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.010> flag

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
mustard still popping it out of the flag

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.330
