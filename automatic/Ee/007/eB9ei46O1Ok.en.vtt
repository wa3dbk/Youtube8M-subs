escort towing a football pitch an

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.580 
escort towing a football pitch an
accusation<00:01:57.629> that<00:01:58.050> could<00:01:58.170> certainly<00:01:58.410> be

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
accusation that could certainly be

seen them all before a rather more note
I<00:02:42.010> think<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.549> an<00:02:42.670> extensive<00:02:43.090> options<00:02:43.420> list<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
I think is an extensive options list you

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.539 
I think is an extensive options list you
can<00:02:44.200> have<00:02:44.349> things<00:02:44.590> like<00:02:44.769> a<00:02:44.799> compact<00:02:45.310> this

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
can have things like a compact this

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.940 
can have things like a compact this

anyway<00:03:10.599> let's<00:03:10.780> go<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.959> see<00:03:11.019> what<00:03:11.139> it's<00:03:11.230> like

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
anyway let's go and see what it's like

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.050 
anyway let's go and see what it's like

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
about and steer and stop and most of

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:52.159 
about and steer and stop and most of
them<00:05:48.240> do<00:05:48.389> an<00:05:48.509> awful<00:05:48.749> lot<00:05:49.050> more<00:05:49.349> besides<00:05:51.110> so<00:05:52.110> to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
them do an awful lot more besides so to

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.929 
them do an awful lot more besides so to
sum<00:05:52.499> up<00:05:52.529> I<00:05:52.769> didn't<00:05:53.009> like<00:05:53.129> the<00:05:53.249> engine<00:05:53.699> or<00:05:53.879> the

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:53.939 
sum up I didn't like the engine or the

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:55.969 
sum up I didn't like the engine or the
steering<00:05:54.779> and<00:05:54.959> the<00:05:55.289> position<00:05:55.679> of<00:05:55.800> some

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
steering and the position of some

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:57.439 
steering and the position of some
switches<00:05:56.490> is<00:05:56.639> a<00:05:56.669> little<00:05:56.939> difficult<00:05:57.389> for

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
switches is a little difficult for

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.109 
switches is a little difficult for
shorter<00:05:57.929> drivers<00:05:58.379> but<00:05:59.159> to<00:05:59.339> counter<00:05:59.699> that<00:05:59.879> it's

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:00.119 
shorter drivers but to counter that it's

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:02.029 
shorter drivers but to counter that it's
a<00:06:00.240> more<00:06:00.389> modern<00:06:00.749> shape<00:06:01.080> there<00:06:01.619> are<00:06:01.709> some<00:06:01.860> good

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
a more modern shape there are some good

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.730 
a more modern shape there are some good
options<00:06:02.279> and<00:06:02.699> the<00:06:02.879> boots<00:06:03.089> big<00:06:03.449> overall<00:06:04.409> though

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
options and the boots big overall though

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.179 
options and the boots big overall though
it's<00:06:05.399> a<00:06:05.610> disappointment
