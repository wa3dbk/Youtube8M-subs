00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
favorite my only concern with that is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.039 
favorite my only concern with that is
can<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.010> Florida<00:01:14.430> State<00:01:14.670> defense<00:01:15.330> keep<00:01:15.810> all

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
can the Florida State defense keep all

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
can the Florida State defense keep all
burn<00:01:16.409> from<00:01:16.680> scoring<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:18.240> we've<00:01:18.450> watched

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
burn from scoring because we've watched

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.660 
burn from scoring because we've watched
the<00:01:19.049> Florida<00:01:19.409> State<00:01:19.619> offense<00:01:20.130> kind<00:01:20.549> of

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the Florida State offense kind of

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
the Florida State offense kind of
sputter<00:01:21.180> these<00:01:21.659> last<00:01:21.900> couple<00:01:22.110> games<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.710> took

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
sputter these last couple games it took

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.740 
sputter these last couple games it took
them<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.490> while<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> get<00:01:23.939> rolling<00:01:24.150> verse<00:01:24.479> Duke

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
them a while to get rolling verse Duke

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.190 
them a while to get rolling verse Duke
and<00:01:25.070> look<00:01:26.070> Duke<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:26.939> Duke<00:01:27.509> can<00:01:27.689> keep<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> up

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
and look Duke if Duke can keep this up

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.230 
and look Duke if Duke can keep this up
and<00:01:28.350> turn<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.560> football<00:01:29.100> program<00:01:29.640> around<00:01:29.909> at

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and turn that football program around at

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
and turn that football program around at
the<00:01:30.540> god<00:01:30.869> bless<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.350> because<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.829> have

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the god bless them because they have

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.359 
the god bless them because they have
been<00:01:32.420> nothing<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.720> entire<00:01:34.049> life<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.650> am<00:01:34.740> 33

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
been nothing my entire life and I am 33

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
been nothing my entire life and I am 33
so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.299> their<00:01:36.630> football<00:01:37.079> program

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so I think that their football program

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.600 
so I think that their football program
hasn't<00:01:37.860> won<00:01:38.310> dick<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:39.119> 33<00:01:40.079> years<00:01:40.400> good<00:01:41.400> I'm

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
hasn't won dick in 33 years good I'm

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.420 
hasn't won dick in 33 years good I'm
glad<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:42.420> for<00:01:42.689> him<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.020> anyway<00:01:43.649> right<00:01:44.310> I

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
glad good for him but anyway right I

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.149 
glad good for him but anyway right I
just<00:01:44.729> hope<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.570> Florida<00:01:46.470> State<00:01:46.740> doesn't

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
just hope that Florida State doesn't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
just hope that Florida State doesn't
rely<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> defense<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.450> keep<00:01:48.720> all<00:01:48.930> burns

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
rely on that defense to keep all burns

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
rely on that defense to keep all burns
often<00:01:49.680> SAT<00:01:49.860> baby<00:01:50.280> cuz<00:01:50.460> also<00:01:50.880> albarn<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.509> move

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
often SAT baby cuz also albarn can move

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.929 
often SAT baby cuz also albarn can move
the<00:01:51.810> ball<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.770> many<00:01:52.920> different<00:01:53.159> ways<00:01:53.340> don't

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the ball in so many different ways don't

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.520 
the ball in so many different ways don't
know<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.329> think<00:01:54.479> it's<00:01:54.780> different<00:01:55.170> than<00:01:55.320> any

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
know i think it's different than any

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.429 
know i think it's different than any
offense<00:01:56.070> they've<00:01:56.280> seen<00:01:56.579> all<00:01:56.880> year<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.079> it's

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
offense they've seen all year and it's

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
offense they've seen all year and it's
I'm<00:01:58.710> sure<00:01:59.040> Florida<00:01:59.549> State's<00:01:59.790> got<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> backup

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I'm sure Florida State's got the backup

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
I'm sure Florida State's got the backup
kids<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> simulate<00:02:01.560> that<00:02:01.590> offense<00:02:02.280> but

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
kids to simulate that offense but

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
kids to simulate that offense but
getting<00:02:03.090> speed<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.659> practice<00:02:04.290> speed<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.710> not

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
getting speed and practice speed are not

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
getting speed and practice speed are not
the<00:02:05.399> same<00:02:05.610> thing<00:02:06.060> yeah<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.439> that's<00:02:07.860> it

going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.599> be<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> question<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.319> is<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.830> all

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
for a quick second George which I find

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.880 
for a quick second George which I find
very<00:02:23.310> interesting<00:02:23.850> okay<00:02:24.570> they<00:02:25.170> said<00:02:25.530> if<00:02:25.770> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
very interesting okay they said if the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.620 
very interesting okay they said if the
national<00:02:26.340> championship<00:02:27.000> was<00:02:27.210> today<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.570> I

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
national championship was today and I

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.410 
national championship was today and I
might<00:02:28.110> not<00:02:28.260> get<00:02:28.410> argue<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.770> point<00:02:29.360> right<00:02:30.360> now

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
might not get argue this point right now

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.170 
might not get argue this point right now
Alabama<00:02:31.350> would<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.770> favored<00:02:32.250> over<00:02:32.340> florida

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
Alabama would be favored over florida

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.930 
Alabama would be favored over florida
state<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> auburn<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.460> reason<00:02:35.820> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
state and auburn and and the reason it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.700 
state and auburn and and the reason it
is<00:02:36.090> obviously<00:02:36.630> with<00:02:37.020> them<00:02:37.230> being<00:02:37.380> favored

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
is obviously with them being favored

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.080 
is obviously with them being favored
over<00:02:37.770> auburn<00:02:38.250> even<00:02:38.490> though<00:02:38.550> auburn<00:02:38.850> Beetham

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
over auburn even though auburn Beetham

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.640 
over auburn even though auburn Beetham
is<00:02:39.180> because<00:02:39.360> they<00:02:39.510> played<00:02:39.720> in<00:02:39.870> auburn<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.350> now

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
is because they played in auburn and now

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.990 
is because they played in auburn and now
they<00:02:40.830> would<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.010> playing<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.520> neutral<00:02:41.700> site

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
they would be playing in a neutral site

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.980 
they would be playing in a neutral site
if<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.270> met<00:02:42.450> in<00:02:42.510> the<00:02:42.570> national<00:02:42.959> championship

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
if they met in the national championship

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.990 
if they met in the national championship
and<00:02:43.680> obviously<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.310> never<00:02:44.490> play<00:02:44.640> Florida

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
and obviously they never play Florida

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900 
and obviously they never play Florida
State<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.050> is<00:02:46.260> what<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.440> find<00:02:46.800> bizarre<00:02:47.220> if

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
State but this is what I find bizarre if

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.160 
State but this is what I find bizarre if
you<00:02:48.209> think<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:50.060> Alabama<00:02:51.060> would<00:02:51.330> be<00:02:51.450> favored

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
you think that Alabama would be favored

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.250 
you think that Alabama would be favored
over<00:02:52.850> Florida<00:02:53.850> State<00:02:54.090> right<00:02:54.450> if<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.989> said<00:02:55.170> if

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
over Florida State right if you said if

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.940 
over Florida State right if you said if
you're<00:02:55.440> seeing<00:02:55.709> that<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.239> Florida<00:02:57.239> State<00:02:57.270> is

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
you're seeing that and Florida State is

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.490 
you're seeing that and Florida State is
favored<00:02:58.950> by<00:02:58.980> eight<00:02:59.489> over<00:02:59.790> Auburn<00:03:00.390> what<00:03:01.350> would

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
favored by eight over Auburn what would

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.770 
favored by eight over Auburn what would
that<00:03:01.650> make<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.070> spread<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.400> Alabama<00:03:03.390> being

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
that make the spread of Alabama being

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.780 
that make the spread of Alabama being
over<00:03:04.080> Auburn<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.709> they<00:03:04.980> just<00:03:05.250> got<00:03:05.430> beat<00:03:05.640> by

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
over Auburn and they just got beat by

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.810 
over Auburn and they just got beat by
Auburn<00:03:06.150> i<00:03:06.470> said<00:03:07.470> i<00:03:07.530> think<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:07.890> yeah<00:03:08.520> no<00:03:08.670> no<00:03:08.790> I

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
Auburn i said i think the yeah no no I

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:09.979 
Auburn i said i think the yeah no no I
totally<00:03:09.090> understand<00:03:09.570> what<00:03:09.630> you're<00:03:09.720> saying

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
totally understand what you're saying

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.320 
totally understand what you're saying
and<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.200> totally<00:03:10.440> get<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.830> in<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.100> only<00:03:11.580> the

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
and I totally get it in the only the

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.140 
and I totally get it in the only the
only<00:03:12.360> thing<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.380> think<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.610> give<00:03:14.880> Auburn

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
only thing I think that was give Auburn

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.199 
only thing I think that was give Auburn
the<00:03:15.480> advantage<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.080> 30<00:03:16.920> days<00:03:17.190> off<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.730> Nick

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
the advantage is 30 days off in Nick

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.479 
the advantage is 30 days off in Nick
Saban<00:03:18.600> and<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:19.380> don't<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.950> either<00:03:20.190> one<00:03:20.340> of

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
Saban and I don't think either one of

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.670 
Saban and I don't think either one of
those<00:03:20.700> two<00:03:21.060> teams<00:03:21.360> as<00:03:21.630> good<00:03:21.840> as<00:03:21.930> Jimbo<00:03:22.290> Fisher

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
those two teams as good as Jimbo Fisher

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340 
those two teams as good as Jimbo Fisher
