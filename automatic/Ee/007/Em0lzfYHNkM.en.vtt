00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.400

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.180
 Because, Billy. 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.060

 With people, who are your friends .. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.260
 You should contact them to help you. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.380
 I'm trapped inside the pot with a killer 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.700

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.700
 Yes, you are wearing a hat 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.980
 What do we do if the killer attacks me in my dreams? 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.500
 Well this is a completely different thing. If this happens, say oh no 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.880
