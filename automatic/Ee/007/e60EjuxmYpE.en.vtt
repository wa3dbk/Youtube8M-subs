Long Term Food Storage plans and ideas best way to store food long term survival cache

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.199
Hi it's AlaskaGranny Alaska Prepper

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:11.279
I have long term emergency survival food storage  28 different types of cans of dehdrated and dried foods

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.279
that I have stored in my Bunker

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.120
I bought them from the Mormon Church  at LDS.org

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.100
The LDS or Mormon Church sells number 10 cans of dried foods.  What foods can you buy?  Choose from wheat, oatmeal, apples, rice, beans, spaghetti, carrots, onions, sugar, potatoes,milk, and onions

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.760
and I got some fruit and other things from Augason Farms

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.760
I was able to purchase them at Walmart

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.500
I am going to show you how I store them in my bunker

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.809
I have 3 of these 64 liter plastic plastic bins

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.070
that I got at an  office supply store

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.230
I like the snapping lids  I have 9 cans each

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.469
of the dry foods that I got cheap easy budget long lasting

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.030
some long term food storage from the Mormon Church number 10 cans of food sealed to store last be fresh longest lasting for 30 years

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.690
and some long term food storage foods in number 10 cans from Augason Farms that I was able to get  at
Walmart

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.610
and the lock up

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.489
everything seems to be dry inside these fit nicely on my shelves

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.180
so that was what I chose

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.229
I stored my number  10 cans

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.990
of dehydrated fruit that I bought

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.630
in these plastic containers because I
was afraid they cans would rust or vermin would

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.000
try to eat the labels

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.610
and these were 64 liters

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.869
and they seem like they're dry
inside

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.689
but you can see even now it's been
raining for a week

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.130
and there's some moisture on the outside
but the inside

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.030
seems to be dry and the cans don't seem to be rusting at all

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.659
let me take one out and I look at it
closer here's a can of flour that was

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.189
in with the fruit

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.630
I realize I didn't label
these because I kept bringing

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.340
more things down here and the label looks
a little

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.329
like it may have gotten a little bit
damp but the can is completely dry

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.380
and I don't see any evidence of rust or
condensation

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.550
and so I'm really happy to know that
while this may not have been

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.640
ideal it was pretty darn good and I'm
glad that I have my

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.140
big plastic bins they may not be

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.610
the best way to store these because
the cans

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.910
leave a lot of empty space but  now
that I know how they work

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.640
I think I'im going to try stuffing some other
things

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.720
around the  cans and see how that lasts

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.810
be sure to store can openers  that are
manual can openers and plastic lids

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.050
in the bins with any of your

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.739
number ten freeze-dried cans if you
can't get them open or

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.219
you can't reseal them then you're going to 
have a problem

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.120
store foods for long term food storage

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:06.500
