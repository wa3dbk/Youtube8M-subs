00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hey people and welcome to one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.670
 small short video in this video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.429
 I do not really want to explain much 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.809
 I just want to show how to make a mistake 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.170
 You can not say such a small one 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 I do not care how to do such a thing 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.389
 small mistakes that many have fix 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.900
 can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 there is an example that yourself 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.130
 move people as an example like 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.980
 install here the number off here 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.449
 let's assume types 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 Let's take this guy Giovanni and 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:39.989
 if you talk to him zdf 28 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 usa good i do not just think god 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.079
 very bad Seehofer than bad even 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.969
 I do not care 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 zvg should be patterned for modules 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 that means we have just stopped 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.020
 that he should run through this event 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 but that can not be why I show that 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.199
 you times or I'll show you first 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.090
 that it can not explain afterwards 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.559
 you how to do that, the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.480
 is called in this video short video 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.280
 is only about how to adjust 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.080
 that people can run through events 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.670
 if it can usually because 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 namely not running through events 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.880
 really clique man or go 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.159
 automatically a step down 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.960
 although we have adjusted that he 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.380
 go down four or five steps 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.729
 should 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.500
 that means to fix that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.930
 actually begin not so much 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.299
 I have to go through the food again 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.720
 we do something and indeed there 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.299
 from time to time on the right side 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.810
 her third right column in the middle 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.530
 approximately 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.150
 that means nothing else than that one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.040
 can run through an event 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.079
 that means we are now entering 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.110
 Step down and there is catch 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.420
 the event to that is after the first 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.549
 do we 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.990
 and after he's called that after the move 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.450
 there goes now a pattern and then then 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.640
 he is on event and then you come to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.600
 the next moved on theoretically two 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.369
 open 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.759
 In that case, it would just be over 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.689
 the event will be run by this one and 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.000
 Although we should test it on the test 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.910
 my english is great 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.880
 well no matter ethno coach backstage anton 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.980
 Oh well, now I talk to me and look 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.300
 if everything works out because I can 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.110
 Imagine that a few people like that 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.690
 have a problem 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.290
 that sounds like mine and we see he is leaving 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.570
 by 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.660
 he is like this through her event 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.890
 villa means that if you think or is 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.680
 already event because there is no more about it 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.860
 You just have to go from and to 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.780
 Often times make the shortest 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.910
 video at all in my tutorial series 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.540
 two minutes 35 I'm shit 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 that is getting longer and longer 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.470
 until then next
