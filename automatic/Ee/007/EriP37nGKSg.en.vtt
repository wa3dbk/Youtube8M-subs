00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
song could have come to life using this

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.280 
song could have come to life using this
setup<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.180> using<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.629> riff<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.110> main

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
setup so I'm using the riff the main

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.440 
setup so I'm using the riff the main
chorus<00:00:58.710> riff<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.040> that<00:00:59.250> song<00:00:59.520> as<00:00:59.790> a<00:01:00.149> demo

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450
