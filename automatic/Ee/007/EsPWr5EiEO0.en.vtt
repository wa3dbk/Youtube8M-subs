00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.270
 in case the deficit 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.359
 we played a bit in the first half I think 

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:12.099
 % and to god what the missing collar 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.219
 nothing less after two men being cited it was difficult 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:16.850
 what is true 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.779
 telefonica lost the ball stupidly 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.220
 by ford 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.579
 but percent 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:26.069
 but it's still to mark 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:29.639
 and a cartoon interior of dust we pushed and 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:33.409
 for once he waited well and in front of my job 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.370
 I sang 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.380
 he has returned well in this case 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.680
 we still have 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.320
 daniel I believe it was she 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.790
 francis kiprop also deserved 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.910
 your goal we saw it's a sign to the public they waited more than 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:47.970
 support 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.539
 it is a strong sign to bet that to say it although old of 11% help us 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.610
 she does not always know easy 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330
 when the public whistles because 18 years ago 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.850
 a lot of players who lose confidence 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:02.860
 it's one of 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.900
 that's why it's also a ford sign 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.400
 to say that we hire food and water because they need your 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.900
 Warning 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770
 let's respect this dieting in the second half we had a lot of 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.490
 bad passes 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.990
 it's more the apathy of international matches or the ajax already in the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.010
 head 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.840
 - I also believe fatigue 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 it also plays of course it is not easy and addition 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 we observe a country not only I believe 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.210
 and then for the initiates 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.170
 so the fatigue that it plays too of course 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.509
 it's a hymn 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.840
 It was great 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.759
 it's not an easy match too of tomorrow so how to circle 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.710
 play too 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.530
 this theme almost the match against euros against 25 32 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.590
 which also translates the coup republic 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.570
 if you make a goal break 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 it becomes harder harder harder 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.420
 m according to police at a particular match for you to find ajax amsterdam 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.040
 either to our match of a surface 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.800
 the accessits totally to our team 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.600
 if a city 2 team 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.800
 played football team 2 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.730
 play in front 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.730
 so that the savate to our game not easy but still uncertain our 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.110
 match
