00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
let's picture the Carles infinitives at

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.410 
let's picture the Carles infinitives at
the<00:00:35.080> moment<00:00:35.470> it's<00:00:36.190> got<00:00:36.309> a<00:00:36.340> steering<00:00:36.610> wheel<00:00:36.820> and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
the moment it's got a steering wheel and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.320 
the moment it's got a steering wheel and
it's<00:00:37.809> got<00:00:37.989> four<00:00:38.020> wheels<00:00:38.820> there's<00:00:39.820> also<00:00:39.940> an<00:00:40.180> air

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
it's got four wheels there's also an air

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.330 
it's got four wheels there's also an air
freshener<00:00:40.809> hanging<00:00:41.080> up<00:00:41.320> in<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:41.500> in<00:00:42.160> the

freshener hanging up in the in the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.400 
freshener hanging up in the in the
middle<00:00:42.640> so<00:00:43.480> this<00:00:43.750> car<00:00:43.960> goes<00:00:44.140> around<00:00:44.260> the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
middle so this car goes around the

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.740 
middle so this car goes around the
corner<00:00:44.769> he<00:00:44.920> steers<00:00:45.280> to<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.790> right<00:00:46.030> but<00:00:46.600> all

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
corner he steers to the right but all

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.680 
corner he steers to the right but all
the<00:00:46.900> weight<00:00:47.110> goes<00:00:47.559> over<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:48.699> left<00:00:48.970> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
the weight goes over to the left the

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.600 
the weight goes over to the left the
refreshness<00:00:50.140> swings<00:00:50.559> over<00:00:50.739> and<00:00:51.160> anything

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
refreshness swings over and anything

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.009 
refreshness swings over and anything
that's<00:00:51.760> on<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.030> seat<00:00:52.210> will<00:00:52.390> slide<00:00:52.659> over<00:00:52.690> to

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019 
that's on the seat will slide over to

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:55.619 
that's on the seat will slide over to
the<00:00:53.320> left<00:00:53.729> so<00:00:54.729> when<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.000> turn<00:00:55.269> to<00:00:55.479> the<00:00:55.510> right

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
the left so when you turn to the right

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.299 
the left so when you turn to the right
the<00:00:56.500> wheels<00:00:56.769> try<00:00:57.430> to<00:00:57.940> counter<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:58.510> fight<00:00:58.720> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the wheels try to counter and fight it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.130 
the wheels try to counter and fight it
look<00:01:00.309> a<00:01:00.339> little<00:01:00.489> down<00:01:00.729> on<00:01:00.850> a<00:01:00.940> car<00:01:01.390> you've<00:01:01.870> got

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
look a little down on a car you've got

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.890 
look a little down on a car you've got
the<00:01:02.680> left<00:01:02.979> wheels<00:01:03.280> which<00:01:03.820> stop<00:01:04.210> the<00:01:04.479> car<00:01:04.720> from

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
the left wheels which stop the car from

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.560 
the left wheels which stop the car from
tipping<00:01:05.290> over<00:01:05.440> on<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.909> motorcycle<00:01:06.909> you<00:01:07.299> don't

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
tipping over on a motorcycle you don't

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.740 
tipping over on a motorcycle you don't
have<00:01:07.750> this<00:01:07.990> so<00:01:08.710> if<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.010> turn<00:01:09.670> my<00:01:09.970> bars<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.720> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
have this so if I turn my bars to the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.770 
have this so if I turn my bars to the
right<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.650> bike<00:01:11.950> naturally<00:01:12.760> goes<00:01:13.000> to<00:01:13.659> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
right the bike naturally goes to the

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.070 
right the bike naturally goes to the
left<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.970> tend<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.030> find<00:01:16.240> there's<00:01:16.540> an<00:01:16.600> easy<00:01:16.780> way

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
left I tend to find there's an easy way

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.960 
left I tend to find there's an easy way
of<00:01:17.110> explaining<00:01:17.590> this<00:01:17.890> to<00:01:18.070> people<00:01:18.430> rather<00:01:18.670> than

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
of explaining this to people rather than

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.429 
of explaining this to people rather than
to<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> right<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.750> left<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.049> the<00:01:20.110> left<00:01:20.170> to

to the right to the left to the left to
the<00:01:20.530> right<00:01:20.560> basically<00:01:21.340> you<00:01:21.729> push<00:01:22.030> on<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.600> bar

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
the right basically you push on the bar

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.720 
the right basically you push on the bar
that<00:01:23.710> you<00:01:23.860> want<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.430> go<00:01:24.610> so<00:01:26.550> imagine<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.670> a

without<00:02:10.739> countersteering<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:12.220> do<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
without countersteering you do it

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:15.479 
without countersteering you do it
naturally<00:02:13.290> once<00:02:14.290> you<00:02:14.409> start<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.159> about

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
naturally once you start to think about

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.250 
naturally once you start to think about
this<00:02:15.730> not<00:02:16.299> only<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.840> get<00:02:16.989> around<00:02:17.110> the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
this not only can you get around the

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.110 
this not only can you get around the
corner<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.739> little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.129> lower<00:02:18.370> if<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> need<00:02:18.909> to

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
corner a little bit lower if you need to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.199 
corner a little bit lower if you need to
but<00:02:19.750> also<00:02:19.900> if<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.799> to<00:02:20.920> hold<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.519> line<00:02:21.790> like

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
but also if you need to hold a line like

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.649 
but also if you need to hold a line like
a<00:02:22.239> sweeping<00:02:22.810> left<00:02:23.019> or<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.349> sweeping<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.069> Bend

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
a sweeping left or a sweeping right Bend

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.149 
a sweeping left or a sweeping right Bend
you<00:02:25.659> can<00:02:25.840> actually<00:02:25.989> use<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.799> counter

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
you can actually use the counter

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.559 
you can actually use the counter
steering<00:02:27.430> in<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.760> other<00:02:27.879> way<00:02:28.120> as<00:02:28.420> you're

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
steering in the other way as you're

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.420 
steering in the other way as you're
going<00:02:28.720> over

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
going over

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.280 
going over
and<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.700> don't<00:02:29.879> want<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.060> go<00:02:30.209> anymore<00:02:30.420> just

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
and you don't want to go anymore just

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.410 
and you don't want to go anymore just
push<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:32.040> left<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.640> it'll<00:02:33.209> hold

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
push a little bit left and it'll hold

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.479 
push a little bit left and it'll hold
you<00:02:33.629> up<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.079> then<00:02:34.829> when<00:02:34.980> you're<00:02:35.099> ready<00:02:35.129> to

you up and then when you're ready to

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.309 
you up and then when you're ready to
drop<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.939> can<00:02:36.090> relax<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.989> bite<00:02:37.170> will

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
drop you can relax and the bite will

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.520 
drop you can relax and the bite will
naturally<00:02:37.500> then<00:02:37.950> go<00:02:38.720> make<00:02:39.720> sure<00:02:39.900> an<00:02:40.049> example

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
naturally then go make sure an example

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.740 
naturally then go make sure an example
of<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.799> I'm<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.640> be<00:02:41.700> doing<00:02:41.909> a<00:02:42.090> 45

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
of this I'm going to be doing a 45

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.509 
of this I'm going to be doing a 45
degree<00:02:42.840> forward<00:02:43.530> push<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.010> the<00:02:44.129> left

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
degree forward push to the left

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.760 
degree forward push to the left
watch<00:02:44.640> this<00:02:44.909> even<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.510> thumb

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
watch this even with the thumb

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.860 
watch this even with the thumb
the<00:02:47.070> bike<00:02:47.310> takes<00:02:47.640> itself<00:02:48.030> around<00:02:48.390> by<00:02:48.570> just

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
the bike takes itself around by just

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.199 
the bike takes itself around by just
using<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> thumb

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
using the thumb

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.149 
using the thumb
that's<00:02:51.780> how<00:02:51.959> delicate<00:02:52.469> this<00:02:52.650> whole<00:02:52.829> process

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
that's how delicate this whole process

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.300 
that's how delicate this whole process
is<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.930> don't<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.230> push<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.950> thing<00:02:56.129> really

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
is you don't just push the thing really

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.809 
is you don't just push the thing really
heavily

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.550 

okay<00:02:59.420> we're<00:02:59.629> going<00:02:59.719> to<00:02:59.780> coming<00:03:00.049> up<00:03:00.140> to<00:03:00.260> a<00:03:00.290> left

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
okay we're going to coming up to a left

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.259 
okay we're going to coming up to a left
end<00:03:00.799> here<00:03:01.069> so<00:03:01.459> what<00:03:01.609> I'm<00:03:01.700> going<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:01.849> do<00:03:02.030> just

fingertips on the throttle and watch my

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.839 
fingertips on the throttle and watch my
fingertip<00:03:09.409> here

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
fingertip here

itself<00:03:16.250> back<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:16.489> again<00:03:16.989> okay<00:03:17.989> so<00:03:18.049> we've<00:03:18.260> got

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
itself back up again okay so we've got

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.380 
itself back up again okay so we've got
the<00:03:18.440> roundabout<00:03:18.920> here<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.489> again<00:03:20.000> you<00:03:20.209> can

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
the roundabout here and again you can

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.390 
the roundabout here and again you can
lean<00:03:20.599> the<00:03:20.629> by<00:03:20.900> but<00:03:21.200> you<00:03:21.319> can't<00:03:21.590> possibly<00:03:22.129> do<00:03:22.370> it

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
lean the by but you can't possibly do it

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.910 
lean the by but you can't possibly do it
without<00:03:22.700> Italy<00:03:23.209> subconsciously<00:03:24.200> pushing

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
without Italy subconsciously pushing

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.340 
without Italy subconsciously pushing
down<00:03:25.099> on<00:03:25.280> your<00:03:25.400> handlebars

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.890 

okay<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.610> left-hander<00:03:33.180> coming<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.630> here

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
okay so the left-hander coming on here

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.990 
okay so the left-hander coming on here
again<00:03:34.350> I'll<00:03:34.560> just<00:03:34.590> use<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.010> fingertip<00:03:35.490> just

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
again I'll just use the fingertip just

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.330 
again I'll just use the fingertip just
to<00:03:36.120> prove<00:03:36.300> push<00:03:37.290> forwards<00:03:37.860> on<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.070> left

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
to prove push forwards on the left

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:53.260 

it's<00:03:44.730> absolutely<00:03:45.270> amazing<00:03:46.020> how<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:46.920> works

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.930 

a<00:03:53.300> bit<00:03:54.050> more<00:03:54.200> extreme<00:03:54.560> their<00:03:55.070> push<00:03:55.550> rights

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 
a bit more extreme their push rights

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.240 
a bit more extreme their push rights
bring<00:03:56.360> it<00:03:56.510> around<00:03:56.570> and<00:03:57.530> then<00:03:57.740> a<00:03:57.770> little<00:03:58.040> push

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
bring it around and then a little push

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.060 
bring it around and then a little push
over<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.760> left<00:03:59.140> also<00:04:00.140> get<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.380> speed<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
over to the left also get the speed and

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.950 
over to the left also get the speed and
the<00:04:01.280> angular<00:04:01.520> one<00:04:02.030> I<00:04:02.240> can<00:04:02.510> just<00:04:02.540> basically

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
the angular one I can just basically

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.040 
the angular one I can just basically
hold<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:03.860> there<00:04:04.130> I'm<00:04:04.580> coming<00:04:04.820> off<00:04:05.150> relaxed

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
hold it there I'm coming off relaxed
