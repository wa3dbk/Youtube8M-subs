00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.900
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.810
 android mod 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.540
 today I present the house or android 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.220
 open source bam and that is a project that 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.930
 blends the best of bam and 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.540
 cyanogenmod to get a rom 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.190
 complete and super customizable the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.570
 version of android and the 4.4.2 kat kit 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.640
 let's start with the settings are 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.829
 many and therefore for reasons of time 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 otherwise an eternal video would come vi 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.699
 I'll show you the main ones for how much 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.739
 concerns the lock screen 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.539
 options are the classic ones we can 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:48.429
 choose the security level if 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:50.710
 show battery status ed 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.780
 any shortcuts will be there 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.629
 settings for widgets and for 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.670
 the clock under the animation control item 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.800
 we can customize each single 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.980
 animation from the system ones 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.290
 when the keyboard opens, etc. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.940
 house b in black is a function that there 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.250
 will allow you to switch from the classic theme 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.350
 to the dark one and see that there is the 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.210
 possibility to set it manually to 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.880
 varying light conditions 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.100
 depending on whether it is day or night themes 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 obviously the classic the user that there 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.450
 will allow you to set the downloaded ones 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.490
 apart from that we finally find the settings 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.860
 for the interface for halo and for the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.869
 multi window inside the first one 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.330
 we will have the possibility to act in a way 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.950
 complete on a lot of features on 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.560
 custom progress bar we can modify 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.720
 the loading bar present for 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 example on the installation screen 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.820
 applications as you can see 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.729
 customize the speed of the thickness e 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.520
 the distance the number of dashes ei 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.110
 colors to the omniswitch item we could 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.509
 enable this function introduced 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.460
 from the omni rom that practically there 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.280
 will allow you to have a 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.440
 useful task manager we could enable and 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.210
 customize the bar that is present 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.940
 within the default task manager 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.119
 shows the use of the ram divided between 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.950
 cash applications and other monster sail 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.539
 so meanwhile you also see the screen 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.030
 of the recent applications that it is 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.610
 custom then different from that 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.900
 classic of the android pure returning 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.330
 at the interface we will have to ours 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.400
 available a screen recorder we can 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.130
 change the dpi and insert 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.560
 gesture with primove air system we could 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.840
 uninstall system applications e 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.520
 the active display or the are present 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.530
 intelligent lock screen of the 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.420
 motorola moto hicks and the bar app 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.430
 as regards the latter vi 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.349
 I recommend leaving it disabled in 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.790
 as noted that I learn the for 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.830
 example on the home screen 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.950
 remains locked and prevents correct operation 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.569
 device operation 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.849
 within init.d we will have a 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.950
 provision of advanced tools e 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.540
 with bild prop mode we can perform 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.879
 of the modifications that normally 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.110
 would require manual action on the 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.940
 file bild prop 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.280
 for these two items I recommend 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.410
 act with caution as the changes 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.629
 can cause instability and crashes 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.239
 so if you want to use them do it first 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.709
 all a nandroid backup to the item 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.690
 status bar we could of course 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.670
 customize the status bar and up 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.730
 quick settings panel the menu a 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.830
 curtain with tools 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.450
 on lockscreen notifications we could 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.280
 enable the useful function there 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.769
 will allow you to view notifications 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.810
 on the lock screen and enabling 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.670
 the pocket mode option will be activated in the 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.830
 moment the screen will be turned off on 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.480
 proximity sensor that will allow to 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.430
 activate the display automatically 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 when the device will be removed from the 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.080
 finally we could enable the pocket 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.239
 extended desktop on notifications menu 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.849
 set the main drop-down menu 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.860
 we could enable and customize the 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.860
 navigation bar and finally we will have a 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.959
 in fact the team exposed that arrangement 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.489
 is working on this Roma decided to 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.680
 integrate applications with the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.010
 frameworks and modules directly in the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.010
 settings 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.209
 regards halo or the system of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.519
 notifications created by the paranoid team 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.950
 android is fully functional 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:06.519
 while the multi window although there is 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.700
 the item has not yet been implemented 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:09.620
 ok 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.480
 after this string of settings 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.609
 let's move on to system applications e 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.280
 also from this point of view the Roma is 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.650
 in fact well stocked we find apollo ie 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.359
 the cyanogenmod up music player 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.729
 settings that will allow us to 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.860
 resize the dpi startup 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.050
 google applications then google 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.660
 now launcher the google calendar 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.550
 the vocal composer and dsp manager ie 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.490
 an application that allows us to act 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.889
 on the sound a terminal emulator the file 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.360
 cyanogenmod manager and settings 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.000
 that as you see the icon year 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.490
 custom google settings 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.220
 movie studio and news and weather messages 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.349
 a superuser voice recorder one 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.070
 torch and whisper push which is a service 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.870
 which will allow us to encrypt text messages 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.729
 along with google now launcher is present 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.770
 also launcher 3 which does not have the 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:05:00.440
 possibility to integrate google now 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.300
 however there are more settings 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.580
 as you can see we can decide the number 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.770
 of rows and columns the screen 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.780
 default and whether or not to show the 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.820
 search bar 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:12.770
 well I quickly show you the camera 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.419
 then move on to report two bugs to you 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.610
 are present in this rom 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.380
 the room is the classic one of the Android 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.990
 pure but with the possibility of saving 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.930
 also in the external sd so let's go 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.220
 to view some shots taken 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.500
 as you can see the details are enough 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.669
 sharp in both photos and in 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.860
 those with flash 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.270
 the camera however sometimes has 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.330
 focus problems 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.970
 otherwise it's great for bugs 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:41.030
 the first concerns the navigation bar if 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.430
 now I'm going to disable it and then try 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:46.039
 to change the theme with house b in black 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.320
 as you can see when the theme 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:51.110
 the navigation bar is changed 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.330
 automatically activated this happens 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.220
 even when we switch off the phone 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.620
 re-ignition even if by default 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.259
 we had left it disabled there 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.630
 we will find active to take it off we should 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.630
 go back to the interface put the check 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.889
 and removes the second vag again 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.479
 concerns word correction 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:11.550
 if we for example writing a 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.090
 message nor wrong one and let's try to 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.580
 correct it 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.530
 how do you see the application crasha e 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.180
 this doesn't just happen with hangouts but 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:20.169
 with all those that require use 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.630
 of the keyboard 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.949
 ok other things to report there is none 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.300
 I am and then move on to 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.500
 final considerations 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.510
 regarding management 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.180
 I found myself extremely energetic 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:32.790
 well with three hours of wifi and screen 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.770
 active services and a decided use 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:38.110
 intense I got to exceed 20 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.490
 hours and also stability and fluidity do not me 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.290
 they never gave problems 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.410
 so if you really want a rom 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.780
 high performance and above all super 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.520
 customizable this is the right one 

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.990
 perfect this for today is all if the 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.630
 video you liked I recommend 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.979
 remember to put a nice like 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.780
 share it and make the channel known 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:57.160
