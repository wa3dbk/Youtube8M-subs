00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.020
 one day you're going to arrest a salty and 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.720
 you discover that you are not so invincible 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.400
 what you see is roman or connor a 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.800
 maleante of the three to the quarter that by 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.430
 circumstances of life ended up being 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.110
 police detective thanks to his brother in law 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.450
 although certain comrades always 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:39.350
 they reproached his previous life 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.470
 and we say they reproached in the past because 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.090
 ronan starts the game dying but not 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.699
 You can go to the next world until you 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.230
 find out who killed him asia start this 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.570
 proposal in which we control the 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.150
 spirit of ronan having to discover 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.479
 the most disturbing case is his own 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.860
 death as an ethereal entity we will have 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.600
 the skills of going through walls 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.640
 doors own other people for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.710
 listen to your thoughts well through 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.600
 of your eyes to read clues and 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.000
 influence in your acts love 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.430
 objects to confuse possess even to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.500
 a cat to access difficult areas 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.960
 discover hidden objects open passages 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.159
 secrets evoke memories of the past or 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.770
 It even has to transport us quickly 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.409
 being a wandering spirit we can not 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.140
 take objects or touch anyone in fact 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.119
 we do not carry any weapons either, so 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.829
 we will have to use others to 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.740
 be able to advance or perform certain 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:34.840
 actions the main danger is 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.670
 presents in the form of red demons that 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.009
 they wander looking for spirits that 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.079
 eliminate we can dodge leds or 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.759
 confuse them by hiding in areas of 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:44.829
 spirits that remained which gaps in 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.569
 the space if we want we can 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.969
 destroy them when attacking is from the back 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.400
 whenever we press the buttons 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.440
 indicated 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.810
 these moments are those that give more 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.220
 tension to the game there are also areas in the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.500
 soil in which we absorb the 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.750
 demons if we pass over them in a way 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.730
 of spirit the research on 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.320
 our death becomes more disturbing 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.790
 if it is possible to open knowing that our 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.850
 murderer has committed other crimes 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.580
 brutal, always leaving the symbol of 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.840
 the bell in their corpses 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.700
 nicknamed as the killer of the 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 bell we will look for clues about 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.920
 who is this elusive and hooded 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.330
 killer on our way soon 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.730
 we will have the help of a young woman 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.190
 called joy who curiously has the 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.570
 gift of being able to see the spirits 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.209
 establishing a relationship and friendship with 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.330
 ronan and performing physical actions that 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.800
 we can not do for ourselves 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.240
 find clues and go through the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.280
 different scenarios by which we 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.590
 carries this adventure is only a third 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.110
 part of the game then we will find others 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.760
 wandering spirits to help the 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.070
 look for clues about their deaths and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.080
 helping them to go to the next world if 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.670
 We closed correctly each of these 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.700
 mini cases with our inquiries 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.770
 correct 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.200
 in each area we find a multitude of 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.760
 collectibles many of which go 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.620
 giving information about the place about 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.660
 the people on the history of the case 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.810
 about the relationship with our wife and 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.190
 about the inhabitants of saleh the link 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.900
 historic that has come out with what 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.550
 spiritual is reflected 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.830
 constantly in each of the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.630
 locations that we visit the amount 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.959
 of spirits that we see and the danger to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.040
 the supernatural that covers it around 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:20.440
 the story is more interesting 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.239
 bought we launched and the pretext of knowing 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.489
 more about the place and the deaths that 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.140
 they happened to give us the brushstroke of 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.769
 curiosity that we need to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 get into murder &amp; soul suspect no 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.790
 we will see no indicator on the screen anymore 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.549
 beyond the icon with the meters to which 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.269
 we are from the target point there is no radar 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.340
 neither map nor anything many times we 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.170
 we will feel confused without knowing 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.750
 where and in what action do or how 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.239
 dodge dangerous areas and there it is 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.250
 the certain grace find the clues 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.319
 necessary to be able to advance in each 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.780
 Game section will not always be easy 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.440
 as well as selecting the appropriate one for 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.450
 influence on others 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.550
 one of the negative points of the game 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.420
 refers that many times the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.410
 Experience is based on trial and error 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.960
 evidencing in what we can select 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.090
 one track after another after another after another 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.290
 until you find the right one to follow 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.200
 going forward 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.470
 the challenge is almost always non-existent 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.630
 and the minimum difficulty some of the 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.640
 decisions that we make are marking how 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.250
 are the characters what have been their 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.770
 previous facts but this open profile 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.980
 a priori it has not been worked as much as 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.750
 to endow the title of replayability 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:35.570
 enough the multitude of objects to 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.370
 find is very high to find them 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.410
 everyone can be a challenge but the 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.080
 most are in plain view 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:45.530
 we have to pick them up mostly 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.240
 provide data and trophies but little more 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.040
 already slow evolution of the game 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.900
 thought a priori for us to stop 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.750
 to find and discover everything that 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.450
 we can slow it down even more in some 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.720
 moments making the advance sometimes 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.610
 a bit bland part of guilt has it 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.249
 the intelligence of some vigilantes to 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.409
 those that we distract too easily 

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:08.719
 in singing some machine 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.469
 thus the gameplay presents a mountain 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:10.580
 russian 

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:13.009
 contrasting some moments 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.289
 interesting with many others that are 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:17.029
 somewhat boring with a game scheme 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.189
 that offer very similar situations 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.769
 again and again but in different 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:24.110
 locations the exploration mixture 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:26.809
 research and stealth ends up working 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:29.179
 only half the atmosphere 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.429
 get us to an incredible sale 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:33.800
 thanks to a graphic section that fulfills 

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:36.080
 with some occasional images that 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.309
 They look great but I do not know 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.709
 takes advantage of the potential of the new 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.469
 consoles nor does it carry the previous 

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:44.239
 generation to the limit producing almost 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:47.029
 homogeneous on all platforms 

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:49.279
 where it is available highlights the 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:52.279
 design of ronan and joy over the 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:54.739
 rest some textures are not elaborated 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.319
 and the modeling of the rest of the characters is 

00:05:54.739 --> 00:05:59.149
 too simple, on the contrary, 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:00.949
 animations are pretty good thanks 

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:03.949
 to capture movements of the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.349
 main characters the dubbing offers 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.829
 a correct interpretation 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.469
 especially of those characters 

00:06:06.829 --> 00:06:10.999
 storm 2 that appear in the game the 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.460
 sounds of demons and music 

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:15.470
 incidental also emphasize quality 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.150
 of this section is eight hours 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.270
 approximate that will keep us 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.580
 busy murder &amp; sons spec a product 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.680
 something atypical and that in principle pointed 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.740
 ways but that ends up showing more its 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.120
 failures and defects that their virtues 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.419
 a proposal that I will have given a lot 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.419
 plus
