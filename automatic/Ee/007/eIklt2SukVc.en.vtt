00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello the company is the rank of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.980
 clan france rhône alpes and we continue 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.750
 this series whose ultimate weapon campaign 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.949
 with this new core core of the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 beast on which I stayed in my 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.710
 previous video I had indicated pass 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.630
 by an air certainly compo 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.699
 after doing several sessions 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.830
 earthly compo that I had seen 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.929
 by the way not in videos so on 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.489
 the very interesting skybox channel that 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.989
 did some great video and I got 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.180
 subscriber I invite you to discover if 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.680
 you do not know so I decided 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.950
 to go back to my initial intention 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 so to make the year that a compo a 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 compo a full full aerial so I'm 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.340
 passed through the right side of the base all 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.770
 just because in the space here 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.629
 which is empty we find kate torpedo 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.250
 so it hurts already because it makes 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.030
 1500 warhead each torpedo 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.910
 so there you see that with but with my 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.110
 hawk there I went without a problem in 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.409
 management of the staff 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.119
 I used 2010 leaves I think that 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.770
 I could have used even one that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.420
 would have been enough so that's finally I 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.060
 believe that the simplest recipe 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.060
 was there the best as very often 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.009
 is crazy the hawk there on this basis one 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.780
 will not be a bad surprise 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.240
 I think it's pretty random with 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 the good ones when we want to destroy the 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.409
 walls I used a lot of good but 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.320
 I have a lot of trouble 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.659
 so we'll look at the next base that 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.759
 is glue like ghosts 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.409
 so why like ghosts because 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.759
 that in fact there is a little surprise 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.090
 and as soon as we throw a troop you go 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.119
 to see him 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:54.740
 in fact this base she is filled with 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.740
 riom nortel on the outskirts 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:06.530
 such a 4.4 anti-aircraft defense of which I 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.340
 listening to it was laurent du clan 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.679
 france rhône alpes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 I hope this demonstration you 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.520
 will be useful for your weapon campaign 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.890
 ultimate and I wish you a very 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.610
 a lot of jungle and see you soon 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.610
