another bug fix update and guys last but
not<00:02:07.860> least<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> is<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> major

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
not least like this is like the major

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
not least like this is like the major
reason<00:02:09.750> why<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.140> think<00:02:10.319> to<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.739> 22<00:02:11.250> will<00:02:11.610> be

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
reason why I think to you 22 will be

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.250 
reason why I think to you 22 will be
another<00:02:11.910> bug<00:02:12.150> fix<00:02:12.360> update<00:02:12.510> because

another bug fix update because

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.050 
another bug fix update because
if<00:02:13.409> they<00:02:13.650> do<00:02:13.709> end<00:02:14.159> up<00:02:14.280> like<00:02:14.459> putting<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.939> lot

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
if they do end up like putting in a lot

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.910 
if they do end up like putting in a lot
of<00:02:15.120> features<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.689> stuff<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:16.200> have<00:02:16.439> to<00:02:16.650> code

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
of features and stuff they have to code

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.100 
of features and stuff they have to code
in<00:02:17.099> a<00:02:17.220> lot<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.549> stuff<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.120> coding<00:02:18.720> takes<00:02:18.959> a

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
in a lot of stuff and coding takes a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.199 
in a lot of stuff and coding takes a
long<00:02:19.349> time<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.650> do<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.159> throw<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:21.030> the

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
long time to do and throw all the

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.309 
long time to do and throw all the
features<00:02:21.390> that<00:02:21.569> there<00:02:21.840> can<00:02:22.019> be<00:02:22.049> actually

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
features that there can be actually

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.470 
features that there can be actually
adding<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.189> will<00:02:23.370> take<00:02:23.579> a<00:02:23.610> long<00:02:23.879> time<00:02:23.939> for<00:02:24.209> them

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
adding it will take a long time for them

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.179 
adding it will take a long time for them
to<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.870> they<00:02:25.319> don't<00:02:25.379> want<00:02:25.620> us<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.739> have<00:02:25.980> all

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
to do they don't want us to have all

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.860 
to do they don't want us to have all
these<00:02:26.370> bugs<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.849> play<00:02:27.030> around<00:02:27.269> with<00:02:27.510> for<00:02:27.810> like

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
these bugs to play around with for like

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.179 
these bugs to play around with for like
three<00:02:28.140> or<00:02:28.290> four<00:02:28.439> months<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:28.799> think<00:02:28.860> that<00:02:29.099> would

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
three or four months I think that would

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.680 
three or four months I think that would
be<00:02:29.280> pretty<00:02:29.459> annoying<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.360> why<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.599> think

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
be pretty annoying so that's why I think

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.780 
be pretty annoying so that's why I think
that<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.110> you<00:02:31.200> 22<00:02:31.680> will<00:02:31.890> be<00:02:32.010> another<00:02:32.250> bug<00:02:32.519> fix
