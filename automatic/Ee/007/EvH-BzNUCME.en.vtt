00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.540
 O 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 halo game monkeys here swing us 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 today in an armor advantage that left 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.810
 made of solid steel and safe without end 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.550
 Parking is rare 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.080
 and sure enough, he is comfortable especially 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.029
 not that is not at all 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.920
 Bad because we prefer ours anyway 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.230
 want to play panzerplatten 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.420
 That's what we're sitting in, too 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.250
 panzer and must fight against enemy 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.379
 steel colossi to defend 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.420
 to make it as effective as possible 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.670
 we can get the coolest in advance 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190
 Choose weapons and extras from one 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 nasty metal spider with blast set up 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 towards the laser beam from space 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.059
 everything represents what the opponents 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 armor vigorously can flatten the whole 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.469
 is a turn-based strategy game 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.329
 that means you make your move 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.340
 Looks how much damage is done and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 then once the opponent's turn 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.820
 So a bright head he is in demand 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.890
 as good reflexes 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.399
 we'll show you what you're looking for 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.399
 you can be happy 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.799
 it is controlled by mouse and keyboard 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.080
 and even if it starts in the beginning 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.830
 it looks quite complicated 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.690
 easy 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.240
 you do not have to touch any keys in the first place 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.770
 remember the rest, except for the arrow keys 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.119
 you can easily control with the mouse 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.690
 and to control 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:31.729
 There is a whole lot after you 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.000
 put your tank into position 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.680
 is exactly to draw for you have 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.180
 A regulator you with the mouse 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.289
 you can move and the direction of the shot 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.659
 adjust 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.130
 with the thrust regulator indicates how 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.789
 much fired the bullet fired 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 becomes 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:48.050
 because simply with full power on it 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.000
 shoot you will not be further 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.460
 it brings a small handicap 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.310
 the wind depending on how this one 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.710
 stands and how strongly he blows 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.659
 honor shot the cloud with the arrow 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.149
 but always shows you the wind direction 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.420
 and strengthen so that you balance them 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:07.729
 could now only mean water 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.299
 go and try as closely as possible 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.729
 aim 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.049
 a little tip does not quite move you 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.130
 as much as the amount of gasoline 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:18.380
 is limited depending on how good you are 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.579
 you get your money which 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.769
 yes then again in better 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.530
 equipment can also invest in 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.780
 a larger petrol engine with many too 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.650
 Weapons of choice are available 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.209
 you can really let off steam 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.430
 next to the game in the campaign against 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.290
 computer opponents can not make fun 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.030
 Fighting hot with real ones 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.030
 people in survival mode look forward 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 have fun and off to battle
