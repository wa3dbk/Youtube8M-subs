00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
that's almost kill so to talk about a

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.450 
that's almost kill so to talk about a
300<00:05:02.600> I'm<00:05:03.050> gonna<00:05:03.440> say<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.860> only<00:05:04.160> way<00:05:04.310> it's

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
300 I'm gonna say the only way it's

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.300 
300 I'm gonna say the only way it's
possible<00:05:04.970> is<00:05:05.150> if<00:05:05.390> you<00:05:05.540> run<00:05:05.810> support<00:05:06.770> if<00:05:07.070> you

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
possible is if you run support if you

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.960 
possible is if you run support if you
you<00:05:07.580> know<00:05:07.610> have<00:05:07.880> people<00:05:08.330> who<00:05:08.570> are<00:05:08.600> only<00:05:09.260> using

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
you know have people who are only using

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.150 
you know have people who are only using
non-lethal<00:05:11.050> helping<00:05:12.050> you<00:05:12.230> out<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:13.010> know

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
non-lethal helping you out you know

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.920 
non-lethal helping you out you know
maybe<00:05:13.910> the<00:05:14.210> 300-plus<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:15.200> doable<00:05:16.720> otherwise<00:05:17.720> I

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
maybe the 300-plus is doable otherwise I

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.110 
maybe the 300-plus is doable otherwise I
don't<00:05:17.990> see<00:05:18.260> it<00:05:18.380> happening<00:05:18.530> solo<00:05:19.310> and<00:05:19.550> another
