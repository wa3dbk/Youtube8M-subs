00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
correctly there's another one as well

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.870 
correctly there's another one as well
it<00:01:09.510> has<00:01:09.780> 20<00:01:10.380> charges<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:11.549> it's<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.850> a

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
it has 20 charges but it's on a

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.140 
it has 20 charges but it's on a
seven-day<00:01:12.630> cooldown<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> think<00:01:13.790> but<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.909> you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
seven-day cooldown I think but if you

seven-day cooldown I think but if you
use<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> charge<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.500> will<00:01:16.680> add<00:01:16.799> a<00:01:16.830> thousand<00:01:17.700> rep
