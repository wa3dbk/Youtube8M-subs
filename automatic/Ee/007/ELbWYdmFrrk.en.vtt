for<00:01:54.930> time<00:01:55.079> trying<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.350> figure<00:01:55.530> out<00:01:55.710> different

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
for time trying to figure out different

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.100 
for time trying to figure out different
ways<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.430> make<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.270> made<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.689> one<00:01:57.930> with

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
ways to make this I made this one with

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.380 
ways to make this I made this one with
the<00:01:58.259> back<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> can<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> red<00:02:00.180> one

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the back and as you can see the red one

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
the back and as you can see the red one
was<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> slipper<00:02:01.770> well<00:02:02.579> what<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
was more like a slipper well what I

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.380 
was more like a slipper well what I
decided<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.899> do<00:02:05.000> was<00:02:06.619> miniaturize<00:02:07.619> them<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> I

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
decided to do was miniaturize them so I

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.900 
decided to do was miniaturize them so I
actually<00:02:11.180> reduced

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
actually reduced

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.720 
actually reduced
pattern<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.740> this<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:14.920> what<00:02:15.070> I<00:02:15.100> came<00:02:15.250> up<00:02:15.490> with

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
pattern and this is what I came up with

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.710 
pattern and this is what I came up with
and<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:16.990> thought<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.250> would<00:02:18.460> be<00:02:18.910> a<00:02:19.120> great

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
and I thought that it would be a great

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:27.050 
and I thought that it would be a great
idea<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.300> bottom<00:02:22.690> of<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:25.020> to

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
idea and this is the bottom of it to

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.570 
idea and this is the bottom of it to
place<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.330> mini<00:02:28.660> something<00:02:29.470> like<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:33.280> I

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
place on a mini something like this so I

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.640 
place on a mini something like this so I
reduce<00:02:34.210> them<00:02:34.600> I<00:02:34.810> hope<00:02:35.200> she<00:02:35.380> doesn't<00:02:35.590> mind

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
reduce them I hope she doesn't mind

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.080 
reduce them I hope she doesn't mind
because<00:02:38.650> I<00:02:38.770> thought<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.100> were<00:02:39.160> so<00:02:39.430> cute<00:02:39.820> on

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
because I thought they were so cute on

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.080 
because I thought they were so cute on
you<00:02:40.930> know<00:02:41.770> something<00:02:41.800> like<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.730> mini<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:45.090> am

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
you know something like a mini and I am

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
you know something like a mini and I am
with<00:02:46.780> this<00:02:46.990> one<00:02:47.320> I<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:50.550> used<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.910> k<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
with this one I just used the k and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.050 
with this one I just used the k and
company<00:02:52.630> papers<00:02:53.230> I<00:02:53.410> said<00:02:53.680> some<00:02:53.980> bling<00:02:54.340> some

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
company papers I said some bling some

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.320 
company papers I said some bling some
ribbon<00:02:56.760> little<00:02:57.760> pearl<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.610> the<00:03:00.610> coordinating

ribbon little pearl and the coordinating

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.010 
ribbon little pearl and the coordinating
paper<00:03:01.540> that's<00:03:02.410> pretty<00:03:02.620> much<00:03:02.860> it<00:03:03.070> there<00:03:04.020> here's

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
paper that's pretty much it there here's

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.020 
paper that's pretty much it there here's
another<00:03:05.110> one<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.010> actually<00:03:06.160> use<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.790> back

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
another one and I actually use the back

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.140 
another one and I actually use the back
side<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:08.080> pattern<00:03:09.040> what<00:03:09.580> I'm<00:03:09.700> going<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:09.970> do

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
side of the pattern what I'm going to do

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.740 
side of the pattern what I'm going to do
with<00:03:10.300> these<00:03:10.570> when<00:03:10.930> I<00:03:10.960> put<00:03:11.290> them<00:03:11.410> on<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.750> minis

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
with these when I put them on the minis

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.290 
with these when I put them on the minis
I'm<00:03:14.500> going<00:03:14.710> to<00:03:14.770> actually<00:03:15.010> thin<00:03:15.730> out<00:03:15.910> some

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
I'm going to actually thin out some

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.720 
I'm going to actually thin out some
decoupage<00:03:16.959> are<00:03:17.470> not<00:03:17.800> decoupage<00:03:18.310> I'm<00:03:18.490> sorry

decoupage are not decoupage I'm sorry
modge<00:03:19.000> podge<00:03:19.030> and<00:03:19.840> I'm<00:03:20.500> going<00:03:20.740> to<00:03:20.800> dip<00:03:21.100> them<00:03:21.370> in

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
modge podge and I'm going to dip them in

modge podge and I'm going to dip them in
the<00:03:21.580> Marge<00:03:21.910> Podge<00:03:22.330> and<00:03:22.360> let<00:03:22.930> them<00:03:23.140> dry<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:23.830> that

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
the Marge Podge and let them dry so that

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.230 
the Marge Podge and let them dry so that
they<00:03:24.959> would<00:03:25.959> be<00:03:25.990> sturdier<00:03:26.920> this<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.000> paper

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
they would be sturdier this the paper

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.850 
they would be sturdier this the paper
the<00:03:28.540> paper<00:03:28.900> that<00:03:29.560> i<00:03:29.590> use<00:03:29.950> is<00:03:30.250> good<00:03:31.410> what<00:03:32.410> i<00:03:32.440> use

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
the paper that i use is good what i use

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.250 
the paper that i use is good what i use
instead<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.430> putting<00:03:33.670> paper<00:03:33.910> on<00:03:34.270> top<00:03:34.690> of<00:03:34.900> paper

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
instead of putting paper on top of paper

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.210 
instead of putting paper on top of paper
behind<00:03:35.650> paper<00:03:36.280> i<00:03:36.640> actually<00:03:37.470> use<00:03:38.470> chipboard

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
behind paper i actually use chipboard

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.570 
behind paper i actually use chipboard
lightweight<00:03:40.000> chipboard<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:42.340> right

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
lightweight chipboard and this right

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.360 
lightweight chipboard and this right
here<00:03:42.610> is<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:42.910> pattern<00:03:43.330> now<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:45.220> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
here is the pattern now this is the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.490 
here is the pattern now this is the
pattern<00:03:45.610> that<00:03:45.940> i<00:03:46.000> use<00:03:46.300> smoke<00:03:46.690> but<00:03:46.930> most<00:03:47.260> of

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
pattern that i use smoke but most of

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.760 
pattern that i use smoke but most of
them<00:03:47.650> as<00:03:47.830> you<00:03:47.980> can<00:03:48.160> see<00:03:48.510> these<00:03:49.510> two<00:03:49.959> pieces<00:03:50.260> is

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
them as you can see these two pieces is

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.370 
them as you can see these two pieces is
either<00:03:51.370> or<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.090> use<00:03:52.330> one<00:03:52.630> or<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:53.140> other<00:03:53.170> i<00:03:54.360> cut

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
either or you use one or the other i cut

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.520 
either or you use one or the other i cut
the<00:03:56.380> pattern<00:03:57.600> with<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.630> coordinating<00:03:59.260> paper

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
the pattern with the coordinating paper

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.490 
the pattern with the coordinating paper
and<00:04:00.100> i<00:04:00.850> cut<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> piece<00:04:01.360> of<00:04:01.420> chipboard<00:04:01.750> so<00:04:02.320> that

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
and i cut a piece of chipboard so that

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.350 
and i cut a piece of chipboard so that
it<00:04:02.650> would<00:04:02.800> make<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.310> foundation<00:04:04.090> of<00:04:04.239> a

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
it would make the foundation of a

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.320 
it would make the foundation of a
stronger<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:06.340> is<00:04:06.550> another<00:04:06.850> one<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.150> actually

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
stronger this is another one I actually

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.820 
stronger this is another one I actually
put<00:04:07.900> bling<00:04:08.800> if<00:04:09.280> you<00:04:09.489> can<00:04:09.640> see<00:04:09.910> around<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.470> heel

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
put bling if you can see around the heel

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:18.300 
put bling if you can see around the heel
and<00:04:14.730> it's<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.880> coordinating<00:04:16.540> paper

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
and it's the coordinating paper

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.640 
and it's the coordinating paper
and<00:04:19.030> i<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.209> put<00:04:19.630> bling<00:04:19.900> over<00:04:20.200> here<00:04:20.470> in<00:04:20.560> a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and i just put bling over here in a

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.870 
and i just put bling over here in a
little<00:04:20.829> ribbon<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:22.600> have<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.870> go<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.880> youtube

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
little ribbon you have to go to youtube

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.610 
little ribbon you have to go to youtube
and<00:04:25.120> watch<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.600> videos<00:04:25.930> there<00:04:26.290> they<00:04:26.470> have

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
and watch the videos there they have

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.430 
and watch the videos there they have
some<00:04:26.889> great<00:04:27.160> ones<00:04:27.700> that<00:04:28.060> people<00:04:28.870> actually<00:04:29.139> use

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
some great ones that people actually use

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.970 
some great ones that people actually use
in<00:04:29.830> swaps<00:04:30.310> and<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.150> thought<00:04:32.110> they<00:04:32.230> were<00:04:32.380> so<00:04:32.620> cute

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
in swaps and I thought they were so cute

in swaps and I thought they were so cute
and<00:04:33.130> what<00:04:33.340> they<00:04:33.520> do<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.360> they<00:04:35.260> actually<00:04:35.470> for

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
and what they do is they actually for

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.909 
and what they do is they actually for
the<00:04:36.100> larger<00:04:36.639> ones<00:04:36.880> they'll<00:04:37.690> take<00:04:38.080> um<00:04:38.380> I've

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
the larger ones they'll take um I've

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:43.350 
the larger ones they'll take um I've
seen<00:04:39.280> where<00:04:39.490> Terry<00:04:39.820> what<00:04:40.120> she<00:04:40.360> did<00:04:40.630> was<00:04:41.440> um<00:04:42.360> she
