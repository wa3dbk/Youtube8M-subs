slightly<00:01:18.369> different<00:01:18.580> way<00:01:18.940> I<00:01:19.180> think<00:01:19.300> there<00:01:19.540> are

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
slightly different way I think there are

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.270 
slightly different way I think there are
three<00:01:19.780> main<00:01:19.810> benefits<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.710> digital<00:01:20.890> first

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
three main benefits to a digital first

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.980 
three main benefits to a digital first
approach<00:01:21.670> first<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.540> all<00:01:22.630> there's<00:01:22.810> lower

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
approach first of all there's lower

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.080 
approach first of all there's lower
costs<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.560> get<00:01:23.740> into<00:01:23.950> the<00:01:24.070> game<00:01:24.250> versus<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
costs to get into the game versus the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.500 
costs to get into the game versus the
traditional<00:01:25.330> TV<00:01:26.260> led<00:01:26.530> approach<00:01:27.180> second<00:01:28.180> the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
traditional TV led approach second the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.510 
traditional TV led approach second the
speed<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.960> publish<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.500> much<00:01:30.040> much<00:01:30.250> quicker

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
speed to publish is much much quicker

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.370

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
each film and what really was very

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.730 
each film and what really was very
