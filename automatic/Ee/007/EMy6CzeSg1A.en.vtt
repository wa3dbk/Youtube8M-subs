00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.380
 hello guys in this video I show you 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.439
 how to make these lanterns a lot 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.570
 simple made from gods 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 tin cans like this so it is 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.320
 a really simple project but of 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.900
 great effect and hope you like it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.099
 which follow the tutorial the material 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.199
 necessary to achieve this 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:38.210
 project is in jars of 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:42.239
 like this you can peel a hammer 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.629
 of the nails I use these here but if you have 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:51.540
 those a little longer and even better 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:54.239
 of the scotch of paper a felt-tip pen and a 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:01:00.239
 Checkered sheet like this one 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:03.479
 canvas for the spray paint and paints 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.119
 candles like these here and we see that 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:07.890
 what he did as the first case 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.430
 I have to remove the paper label that 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.190
 wraps my jar so I'm looking for a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.810
 point where it starts to come off you see 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.130
 it is neither a corner nor then I take the hairdryer 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.780
 this is the best method to 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.720
 remove the can labels 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.860
 because the glue warms up and becomes 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 much easier to detach the label is 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.340
 much easier than with water 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 with alcohol or any other method 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.560
 see look at the incredible ease 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.510
 with which it comes away now remain 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.070
 these are parts where there is more 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.979
 then glue using the same method 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 I'm going to heat it with a hair dryer to warm it 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.450
 well and then with the ritual simply the 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.520
 remove you see how well it comes off 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.520
 here it is and then the title comes off 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.140
 easy i do the same thing in 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.140
 all of them I will show you again 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.360
 you see it melts completely and you 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.520
 you can remove it and this is the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.710
 baroque but once the glue is removed e 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 the cup to the abyss from the clean front 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.000
 I have selected 3 different ones 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.470
 size measures and now I go to 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.180
 pour in water from the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.910
 simple tap water and the game 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.460
 better well to the brim so then 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.100
 now this point must be entered into 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.800
 freezer and left at least one or 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.810
 two days 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.650
 while we wait for the water to freeze 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.670
 take the squared sheet and the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.580
 felt-tip pen and we begin to trace gods 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:49.120
 dots you see these are 88 dots 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:56.090
 now track of other 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:03:01.790
 then others 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.160
 12 36 7 plate you see has formed the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.650
 first part of the snowflake 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.220
 now I'm going to form the other lines that 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.220
 diagonals 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.120
 at this point because he knows why 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.830
 actually a snowflake 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.019
 I'm going to create only on some of 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.920
 these bars 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.629
 the final reason of the snowflake and it 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.440
 I do it this way you see now I will 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:34.579
 let me see well again then create 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.470
 of dots in this way 2 3 4 5 e 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.239
 this is the form you can leave it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.280
 so or you can decide to decorate 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.569
 even the center liked to decorate it 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.569
 then added more dots 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.440
 and here he is now finished with the 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.329
 scissors I'm going to cut out the excess of 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.370
 paper because I don't need all the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.000
 a whole sheet is enough for me a little more 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.730
 small sheet then cut up 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.420
 to get the desired size 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.420
 here it is 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.150
 now I take my cloth and spread it 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.749
 on my worktop this way 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.639
 in order to cover it and protect it 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:14.040
 I take my jar and see the water 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:17.789
 it has completely frozen over 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:21.599
 very cold and now I'm going to overlap 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:24.810
 to the jar the sheet with mine 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:26.690
 design this way I make one 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.169
 pressure in a manner more anyway 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:33.919
 start with a little with the water to adhere 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.000
 and then I go with the paper tape 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.960
 obviously it will never stick to the 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.729
 but all the minimum that will allow 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:48.300
 keep the sheet quite firm and 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:51.449
 here is here ready now I take nail and 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.669
 hammer and began the operation that 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.699
 seems complicated but I assure you that not 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.060
 it's so hard and if I can 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:03.000
 you can do it too, so I follow 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:06.419
 the dots I drew for each one 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.490
 point to some hammering so as to 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:15.080
 creating holes continues like this for everything 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.080
 as my design 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.870
 When he finished the paper again that 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.160
 wants 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:27.140
 and here is the snowflake motif 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.030
 on my jar golds decided to 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.000
 continue to decorate the jar with 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.620
 so many little flowers here and there so that there 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.170
 is this main motif of the bow 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:41.000
 of snow and then precisely these little holes vi 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.610
 I show another possibility a 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.350
 another drawing in this case a heart e 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.360
 do it exactly the same way 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.560
 then with the nail the hammer will 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:55.070
 make these holes and once ready 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:58.430
 we are in the paper and this is the other 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.900
 design at this point are ready for 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.720
 be colored then I take mine 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:05.300
 spray paint the well acted and began to 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.420
 spray it on the jar in all the 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.420
 points 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.770
 and here they are these jars 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.800
 already painted chronic see that the 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:18.400
 paint came good because 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.379
 managed to spread out evenly 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.979
 and now they are ready to be 

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:27.099
 used as lanterns then 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:31.940
 to do this I take my jar 

00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:35.620
 I insert my candle inside and 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.620
 I simply go to turn it on 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:41.550
 and here is my tin can 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.440
 become a lantern 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.470
 so the project is this much 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.880
 simple really second wrongdoing is 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.890
 very nice now I'll show you 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.890
 in fact contextualized with candles 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.810
 lit in the dark you see how beautiful they are 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.670
 so if you enjoyed this tutorial
