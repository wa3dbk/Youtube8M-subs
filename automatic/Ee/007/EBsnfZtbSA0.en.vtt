well we're constantly trying to look to

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.570 
well we're constantly trying to look to
me<00:00:04.210> postures<00:00:04.810> more<00:00:05.500> natural<00:00:05.920> how<00:00:06.370> do<00:00:06.430> we

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
me postures more natural how do we

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.360 
me postures more natural how do we
really<00:00:07.270> amp<00:00:07.600> up<00:00:07.810> the<00:00:07.990> sensation<00:00:08.709> when<00:00:09.190> you're

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:09.370

really amp up the sensation when you're
running<00:00:09.630> natural<00:00:10.630> motion<00:00:10.780> i<00:00:10.960> think<00:00:11.139> is

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:11.259 
running natural motion i think is

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:13.499 
running natural motion i think is
central<00:00:11.679> to<00:00:11.710> everything<00:00:12.099> we<00:00:12.429> do<00:00:12.639> around<00:00:13.330> the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
a very natural run the sensation from

a very natural run the sensation from
the<00:00:37.870> shoe<00:00:38.080> really<00:00:38.470> comes<00:00:38.799> from<00:00:39.220> being

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
the shoe really comes from being

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.600 
the shoe really comes from being
directly<00:00:40.570> on<00:00:40.989> the<00:00:41.559> lunar<00:00:41.710> foam<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.370> really

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
directly on the lunar foam it really

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.630 
directly on the lunar foam it really
gives<00:00:42.790> you<00:00:42.940> that<00:00:43.150> nice<00:00:43.559> soft<00:00:44.559> initial<00:00:45.070> impact

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
gives you that nice soft initial impact

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.070 
gives you that nice soft initial impact
through<00:00:46.089> Luna<00:00:46.479> but<00:00:46.659> also<00:00:46.809> that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
through Luna but also that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.799 
through Luna but also that
responsiveness<00:00:47.769> as<00:00:48.339> you<00:00:48.610> run<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.119> then<00:00:49.629> that

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
responsiveness as you run and then that

coming up and down throughout the shoe

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.410 
coming up and down throughout the shoe
gives<00:00:53.680> you<00:00:53.799> constant<00:00:54.400> feedback<00:00:54.670> so<00:00:55.150> as<00:00:55.269> you're

feeling the RO going to feel the shoe
working<00:00:58.210> with<00:00:58.390> you<00:00:58.659> rather<00:00:59.140> than<00:00:59.290> against<00:00:59.799> you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
working with you rather than against you

you that great natural motion on the
outsole<00:01:10.180> we're<00:01:10.630> using<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:11.110> thin<00:01:11.440> web

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
outsole we're using a thin web

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.800 
outsole we're using a thin web
technology<00:01:12.520> it's<00:01:12.760> a<00:01:12.880> rubber<00:01:13.060> outsole<00:01:13.600> but

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
technology it's a rubber outsole but

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
technology it's a rubber outsole but
it's<00:01:13.930> incredibly<00:01:14.500> thin

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
it's incredibly thin

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.820 
it's incredibly thin
and<00:01:16.550> the<00:01:16.700> beautiful<00:01:16.970> thing<00:01:17.150> about<00:01:17.620> flying<00:01:18.620> it

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
and the beautiful thing about flying it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.710 
and the beautiful thing about flying it
is<00:01:19.040> that<00:01:19.250> it<00:01:19.370> gives<00:01:19.400> you<00:01:19.730> this<00:01:19.850> rule<00:01:20.180> second

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
is that it gives you this rule second

is that it gives you this rule second
skin<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.260> really<00:01:21.560> hugs<00:01:22.190> down<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:23.060> around

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
skin that really hugs down and around

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.510 
skin that really hugs down and around
your<00:01:23.570> foot<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.710> other<00:01:24.830> benefit<00:01:25.400> of

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
your foot and the other benefit of

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.520 
your foot and the other benefit of
flying<00:01:25.880> it<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.150> that<00:01:26.330> you're<00:01:26.450> able<00:01:26.570> to<00:01:27.020> design

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
flying it is that you're able to design

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.710 
flying it is that you're able to design
exactly<00:01:28.310> what<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.850> need<00:01:29.060> where<00:01:29.390> you<00:01:29.480> need<00:01:29.690> it

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
exactly what you need where you need it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.020 
exactly what you need where you need it
so<00:01:30.020> if<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.230> need<00:01:30.440> breathability<00:01:31.430> you<00:01:31.850> can

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
so if you need breathability you can

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.610 
so if you need breathability you can
design<00:01:32.300> and<00:01:32.510> breathability<00:01:32.900> if<00:01:33.230> you<00:01:33.410> need

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
design and breathability if you need

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.740 
design and breathability if you need
stability<00:01:34.040> and<00:01:34.490> support<00:01:34.670> you<00:01:35.240> can<00:01:35.450> absolutely

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
stability and support you can absolutely

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.400 
stability and support you can absolutely
design<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.190> these<00:01:38.060> fly<00:01:38.450> wire<00:01:38.750> cables

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
design that in and these fly wire cables

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.080 
design that in and these fly wire cables
that<00:01:39.680> run<00:01:39.710> throughout<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.520> mid-foot<00:01:40.910> and

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
that run throughout the mid-foot and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.640 
that run throughout the mid-foot and
around<00:01:41.360> they<00:01:41.780> really<00:01:41.990> add<00:01:42.200> this<00:01:42.440> extra

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
around they really add this extra

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.520 
around they really add this extra
dimension<00:01:43.370> of<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.640> lockdown<00:01:44.150> so<00:01:44.660> really<00:01:44.900> hold

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
dimension of the lockdown so really hold

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.710 
dimension of the lockdown so really hold
you<00:01:45.740> down<00:01:45.920> onto<00:01:46.220> the<00:01:46.310> platform<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.360> shoe<00:01:47.600> is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
you down onto the platform the shoe is

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.270 
you down onto the platform the shoe is
really<00:01:48.140> simple<00:01:48.350> when<00:01:48.620> you<00:01:48.710> look<00:01:48.890> at<00:01:49.010> the<00:01:49.100> shoe

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
really simple when you look at the shoe

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.800 
really simple when you look at the shoe
it<00:01:49.430> just<00:01:49.610> looks<00:01:49.790> like<00:01:49.880> an<00:01:50.090> extension<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.660> your

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
it just looks like an extension of your
