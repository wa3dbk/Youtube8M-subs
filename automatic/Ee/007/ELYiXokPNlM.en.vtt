hey guys here I have this 2014 Ford
Fusion<00:00:12.690> titanium<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.910> one<00:00:15.089> obviously<00:00:15.660> has

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
Fusion titanium this one obviously has

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.830 
Fusion titanium this one obviously has
the<00:00:15.960> EcoBoost<00:00:16.410> engine<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> we'll<00:00:18.660> go<00:00:18.810> ahead

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the EcoBoost engine so we'll go ahead

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.929 
the EcoBoost engine so we'll go ahead
and<00:00:19.050> kind<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.439> take<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> little<00:00:19.920> look<00:00:20.250> at<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.430> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
and kind of take a little look at it and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.310 
and kind of take a little look at it and
one<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:21.810> things<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.170> I'm

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
one of the first things that I'm

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.560 
one of the first things that I'm
noticing<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> different<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.789> the

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
noticing that is different is the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.730 
noticing that is different is the
exhausts<00:00:25.380> are<00:00:25.680> different<00:00:26.330> I<00:00:27.500> don't<00:00:28.500> know<00:00:28.619> if

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
exhausts are different I don't know if

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.470 
exhausts are different I don't know if
I've<00:00:28.890> ever<00:00:28.920> said<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.789> one<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> my<00:00:30.029> videos

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
I've ever said this in one of my videos

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.160 
I've ever said this in one of my videos
but<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:32.160> has<00:00:32.579> been<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.940> common<00:00:33.450> issue<00:00:33.600> with

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
but there has been a common issue with

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.740 
but there has been a common issue with
the<00:00:34.380> fusion<00:00:35.270> that<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:37.110> chrome<00:00:37.980> exhaust<00:00:38.750> would

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
the fusion that the chrome exhaust would

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.830 
the fusion that the chrome exhaust would
turn<00:00:40.050> black<00:00:40.520> because<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.090> soot<00:00:42.570> in

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
turn black because of so much soot in

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010 
turn black because of so much soot in
all<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:44.280> comes<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.180> exhaust<00:00:45.390> pipes

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
all that comes out of the exhaust pipes

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
all that comes out of the exhaust pipes
because<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.559> engines<00:00:46.950> turbocharged<00:00:47.520> but

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
because the engines turbocharged but

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.560 
because the engines turbocharged but
this<00:00:47.940> one<00:00:48.090> has<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.739> guess<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> guard<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.329> not

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
this one has I guess a guard it's not

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.029 
this one has I guess a guard it's not
technically<00:00:52.020> an<00:00:52.170> attached<00:00:52.469> pipe<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.890> can

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
technically an attached pipe you can

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.410 
technically an attached pipe you can
still<00:00:53.250> see<00:00:53.430> where<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> pipe<00:00:53.850> comes<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.239> back

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
still see where the pipe comes out back

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.979 
still see where the pipe comes out back
there<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:56.210> don't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.539> I'd<00:00:57.780> still

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
there but I don't know I think I'd still

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.330 
there but I don't know I think I'd still
rather<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.680> mine<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.989> because

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:01.340 
rather have what mine has just because

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.929 
rather have what mine has just because
it's<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:03.530> more<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.280> more<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> chrome

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
it's a more you get more of the chrome

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
it's a more you get more of the chrome
look<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.780> that's<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.229> bad<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.619> that's<00:01:07.770> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
look but that's not bad and that's a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.890 
look but that's not bad and that's a
pretty<00:01:08.100> good<00:01:08.280> fix<00:01:08.549> they<00:01:09.090> disguised<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.720> pretty

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
pretty good fix they disguised it pretty

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.780 
pretty good fix they disguised it pretty
well<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.860> can<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.460> has<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
well as you can see this one has the

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.080 
well as you can see this one has the
19-inch<00:01:12.240> rims<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:13.020> my<00:01:13.170> car<00:01:13.409> has<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
19-inch rims just like my car has I

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.460 
19-inch rims just like my car has I
would<00:01:15.090> absolutely<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.810> these<00:01:16.020> rims<00:01:16.200> on<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
would absolutely get these rims on the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.280 
would absolutely get these rims on the
titanium<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:17.369> like<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> said<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.049> these

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
titanium I think like I said that these

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.719 
titanium I think like I said that these
make<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.799> break<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> car<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:21.680> that's

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
make or break the car so that's

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.670 
make or break the car so that's
definitely<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:24.000> must<00:01:24.270> for<00:01:24.479> me<00:01:24.540> coming<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> the

believe they changed to HIDs I think

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.830 
believe they changed to HIDs I think
they're<00:03:15.489> still<00:03:15.730> projectors<00:03:16.269> which<00:03:16.540> was<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
it on the 2013 I think they should have
