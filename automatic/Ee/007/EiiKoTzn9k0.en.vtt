little<00:01:28.290> bit<00:01:28.500> quicker<00:01:28.740> under<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> water

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
little bit quicker under the water

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
little bit quicker under the water
because<00:01:29.850> these<00:01:30.689> little<00:01:31.259> Punk's<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.920> fast

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
what I think we should do is hop into

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.830 
what I think we should do is hop into
the<00:01:38.009> water<00:01:38.250> hello<00:01:38.759> squids<00:01:39.119> how<00:01:39.360> you're<00:01:39.540> doing

working nicely very good I like that
so<00:01:47.970> let's<00:01:48.960> spawn<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.439> of<00:01:49.530> these<00:01:49.649> guys<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so let's spawn one of these guys in and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.069 
so let's spawn one of these guys in and
see<00:01:50.970> how<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.240> do<00:01:51.570> three<00:01:52.229> two<00:01:53.119> one<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:54.960> go

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
see how we do three two one here we go

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
see how we do three two one here we go
let's<00:01:55.890> try<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.159> spawn<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.549> as<00:01:56.640> far<00:01:56.850> away

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
let's try and spawn one in as far away

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
let's try and spawn one in as far away
as<00:01:57.060> possible<00:01:57.180> there<00:01:57.600> we<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.780> oh<00:01:58.409> no<00:01:59.040> ow<00:01:59.070> what

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
as possible there we go oh no ow what

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.899 
as possible there we go oh no ow what
the<00:01:59.880> heck<00:02:00.119> ah<00:02:00.270> oh<00:02:01.070> my<00:02:02.070> goodness

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the heck ah oh my goodness

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.929 
the heck ah oh my goodness
they<00:02:03.810> are<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.380> are<00:02:04.560> they're<00:02:04.890> powerful<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
they are that are they're powerful so I

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.180 
they are that are they're powerful so I
think<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.570> may<00:02:06.840> have<00:02:06.869> accidentally<00:02:07.740> spawned

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
think I may have accidentally spawned

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.919 
think I may have accidentally spawned
two<00:02:08.459> at<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> same<00:02:08.910> time<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:09.420> was<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
two at the same time which was it was

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.570 
two at the same time which was it was
not<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> good<00:02:10.440> idea<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.009> let's<00:02:11.190> try<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.430> again

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
not a good idea so let's try that again

on earth look it's even faster on the
land<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:32.700> only<00:03:33.060> balances<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.840> three

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
land it only balances for about three

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.500 
land it only balances for about three
times<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.740> then<00:03:34.860> explodes<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:35.820> he's<00:03:36.060> be<00:03:36.240> very
