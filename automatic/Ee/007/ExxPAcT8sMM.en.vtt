00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:13.980
 by the brothers of and is missing fi minecraft of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:16.800
 to be reviewed a brand new night there 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.300
 always speak rais files or better 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.300
 for the first time prime rais 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.140
 today we do 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.930
 the death agency the lantern state 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:34.470
 then this is added an inter that is 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.470
 a lantern 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.940
 it is very very convenient as you can 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.940
 to see 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.520
 which illuminates the surrounding area 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:50.950
 that is, as if we had a lantern in our hands and 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:55.000
 that is, it can only be illuminated 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.120
 with units I make the lantern only 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.739
 last place on the right 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.260
 mentally because otherwise we put it 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.490
 on the other hand, as you can see 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.299
 from the use of pannella because now I wear myself 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.090
 from there the light follows us it can be said 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.800
 we launch from an inner part like 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.210
 we can see remains only 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.729
 animal lighting only 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.320
 around the third hour but I resume 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.770
 it remains the same for let's say so 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.580
 split up this lighting this year 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.320
 great lantern passes into the mind 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.630
 will issue last and inventory 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 now let's see how 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.550
 the crafting of this lantern 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.210
 only two pieces of would follow 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.979
 glass and 6 uncultivated areas and above all the 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 coal because our alternates to 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.940
 coal 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.750
 now just add two in italy 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.440
 glass both now and from left to center 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.400
 of the graphic area or admit if 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.560
 iron ingots both below and above 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:11.020
 so you just have to leave 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 we take space in the empty center 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.810
 I have to see we knocked though 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:23.830
 that empties illuminates and you say that like that 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.920
 makes quotes to turn on having it 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.000
 coal inventory 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.130
 all and the inventory this 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.070
 then become the main one 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.790
 Quick inventory but just press 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.430
 still holding the right button lantern 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.100
 as you can see it does like 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.000
 power on 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.110
 of a flame with the needle starts 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.540
 remove 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 he writes we always arrive until we do 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.480
 charge at all and tell you it's a lot 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.450
 very useful because 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.620
 this light also lasts a lot 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.829
 very well this was all that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.150
 I had to say about this fashion then vi 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:09.110
 I only say that this death 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.900
 and still being processed 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.490
 perfect 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.750
 must still go to the matinees all 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.750
 the lighting system of the 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.570
 of the lantern 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.370
 maybe he can this way they wanted 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:41.550

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:44.310
 I kill ok, I was saying that i 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.180
 The creators of this night were standing 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.970
 thinking of adding oil for the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.100
 lantern and do not feed the coal but 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.900
 you always know they will reach because 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.870
 this is still being processed 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.390
 you eat all but very well 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.060
