 What should she do here? 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.780
 But now I have closed it correctly 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.849
 I have no idea or is 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.369
 in the Kannenstieg restriction as it did 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.539
 everyone should be my mistake 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.019
 because Iraq can easily resolve 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.119
 the sequel to SEC 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.270
 but that came before me or not that banned it 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.270
 probably going down mix off the spoon and so on 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.330
 the Chandlers

 "Noticed Swiss that's my name 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.100
 and 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.160
 it's a bit of infantry 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.570
 so 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.950
 Thieves and you want is now alone with 130 HP 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.370
 I saw happy 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.370

 and it is the "Twitter is a great game and I check it again 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.330
 where it goes

 «Books only nine people crack man as a chair 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.010
 She is already fashion 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.609
 z 

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:15.609
 that's all right 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.949

 No 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:00.869
 where did I drive her here? 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:02.359
 the abandoned ones 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:06.839
 and even the four mentioned in the air before but not to their 

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:08.919
 satisfaction 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.079
 and Steiner and by the way just the abandoned ones can do such 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.079
 country 

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:20.179
 then one stops 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.479
 but it's still popular because of it

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.229
 OK

 according to a seen should have seen 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.569
 and so it does not pull you anymore 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.459
 sound more complicated 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 then we can go back now 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.389
 6 o'clock no more 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.889
 and I think I'm doing a little break 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.499
 and on the outside problem Patrizia definitely go further 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.400

 at least as far as it is playable 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.409
 but thick goods fix 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:30.319
