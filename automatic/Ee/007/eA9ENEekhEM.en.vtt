00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
something very simple where you just

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.429 
something very simple where you just
take<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> magnet<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.600> coil<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> wire<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
take a magnet and a coil of wire and

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.050 
take a magnet and a coil of wire and
start<00:01:16.590> making<00:01:16.950> sound<00:01:17.220> with<00:01:17.460> very<00:01:17.670> humble

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
materials and then you motivate all the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
materials and then you motivate all the
way<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.210> something<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.750> sounds<00:01:22.080> good<00:01:22.229> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
way up to something that sounds good and

way up to something that sounds good and
then<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.580> rest<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.150> really<00:01:24.360> an

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
then the rest of it was really an

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.179 
then the rest of it was really an
opportunity<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.259> them<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.439> build<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.979> working

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
opportunity for them to build a working

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.499 
opportunity for them to build a working
pair<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> speakers<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.970> they<00:01:27.000> get<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.360> keep

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
pair of speakers that they get to keep
and<00:01:27.890> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.070> process<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.520> doing<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> ask

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and in the process of doing that ask

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.760 
and in the process of doing that ask
questions<00:01:30.600> along<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> way<00:01:31.079> why<00:01:31.500> am<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.710> doing

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
questions along the way why am I doing

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
questions along the way why am I doing
this<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.270> change<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.049> would

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
this what if I change this what would

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.160 
this what if I change this what would
happen<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> lot<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.390> time<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.960> answer

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
happen so a lot of time to answer

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.249

the thing that you just built and we
just<00:01:49.170> made<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.320> room<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.340> loud<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> just

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
just made the room really loud and just

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.480 
just made the room really loud and just
full<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.479> whole<00:01:51.630> bunch<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.990> really

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
full of a whole bunch of really

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.749 
full of a whole bunch of really
music<00:01:52.900> so<00:01:53.900> they're<00:01:54.110> pretty<00:01:54.439> much<00:01:54.649> exactly<00:01:55.009> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
music so they're pretty much exactly the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.130 
music so they're pretty much exactly the
design<00:01:56.030> of<00:01:56.180> a<00:01:56.270> Bose<00:01:56.420> speaker<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.810> we<00:01:56.899> sell

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
design of a Bose speaker that we sell

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810 
design of a Bose speaker that we sell
and<00:01:57.320> we've<00:01:57.439> sold<00:01:57.680> for<00:01:57.950> many<00:01:58.070> many<00:01:58.250> years<00:01:58.549> so

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
and we've sold for many many years so

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.249 
and we've sold for many many years so
it's<00:01:59.000> a<00:01:59.090> design<00:01:59.390> that<00:01:59.420> we<00:01:59.750> think<00:01:59.990> is<00:02:00.110> pretty

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
it's a design that we think is pretty

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.649 
it's a design that we think is pretty
classic<00:02:00.710> we<00:02:01.399> redesigned<00:02:02.090> it<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:02.390> they<00:02:02.509> can

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
classic we redesigned it so they can

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.600 
classic we redesigned it so they can
really<00:02:02.960> get<00:02:03.290> inside<00:02:03.619> and<00:02:03.830> see<00:02:04.009> what<00:02:04.280> each

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
really get inside and see what each

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.179 
really get inside and see what each
piece<00:02:04.909> is<00:02:05.090> doing<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.869> be<00:02:06.560> able<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.740> hear<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.070> as

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189 
piece is doing and be able to hear it as

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.710 
piece is doing and be able to hear it as
it<00:02:07.220> comes<00:02:07.460> together<00:02:07.729> so<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:08.420> it's

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
it comes together so it's it's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.050 
it comes together so it's it's
completely<00:02:09.080> identical<00:02:10.009> acoustically<00:02:10.789> to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
completely identical acoustically to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.780 
completely identical acoustically to
