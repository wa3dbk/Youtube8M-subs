years<00:02:32.780> ago<00:02:32.900> in<00:02:33.260> Detroit<00:02:33.410> where<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.700> probably

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
years ago in Detroit where we probably

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.940 
years ago in Detroit where we probably
wouldn't<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> wasn't<00:02:36.050> as<00:02:36.140> gifted<00:02:36.680> and

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
wouldn't it wasn't as gifted and

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.000 
wouldn't it wasn't as gifted and
talented<00:02:36.980> as<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.820> team<00:02:38.090> offensively<00:02:38.740> so<00:02:39.740> we

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
talented as this team offensively so we

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.210 
talented as this team offensively so we
we<00:02:40.940> did<00:02:41.120> everything<00:02:41.390> defense<00:02:42.050> first<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.100> won

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
we did everything defense first and won

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.430 
we did everything defense first and won
an<00:02:43.340> NBA<00:02:43.490> title<00:02:43.970> doing<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.690> way<00:02:44.720> and<00:02:45.170> you

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
an NBA title doing it that way and you

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.230 
an NBA title doing it that way and you
know<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.980> think<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.490> get<00:02:46.640> into<00:02:46.790> playoff

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
know I think when you get into playoff

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.479 
know I think when you get into playoff
run<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.630> deep<00:02:47.959> into<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.410> playoffs<00:02:48.590> there's

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
run and deep into the playoffs there's

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.920 
run and deep into the playoffs there's
the<00:02:49.610> teams<00:02:49.880> they're<00:02:50.090> really

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
the teams they're really

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.740 
the teams they're really
we<00:02:51.409> bout<00:02:51.650> they<00:02:52.459> figured<00:02:52.849> out<00:02:52.939> all<00:02:53.150> ffensive<00:02:53.629> LY

we bout they figured out all ffensive LY

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.420 
we bout they figured out all ffensive LY
but<00:02:54.019> it's<00:02:54.439> the<00:02:54.530> teams<00:02:54.769> that<00:02:54.890> defender

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430
