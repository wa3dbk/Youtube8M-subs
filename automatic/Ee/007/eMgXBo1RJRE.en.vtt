00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.620
 the game I wanted to do a first 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.480
 question for you do you think the 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.240
 Brazil is prepared to make a good 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.330
 next year many people have 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.430
 made enormous criticism of the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.279
 are being made even those 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.170
 movements also focused on 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:24.260
 Mother says with your opinion and I like 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:28.130
 always tell an anecdote and I do not 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.550
 I want to fall into this ridicule of committing 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.219
 same clown but the Japanese one who 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.329
 convinced that it was he who ended up with 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.239
 Hiroshima 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.250
 he was in the bathroom when he gave the 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.070
 discharge of americans drop the bomb 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.010
 But for him he was already in the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.800
 bathroom and pressed of coal in world 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.590
 fell right I do not think it was the canopy of 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.649
 confederations is responsible for 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.739
 manifestations but certainly the population 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.199
 when confronted with the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.090
 sumptuousness with the megalomania of 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.600
 states that presented themselves to that 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.190
 competition in the next financial year 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.200
 that something was wrong was 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.230
 out of time, right? 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.970
 we can not do this beauty 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.460
 from this new source 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.870
 the beauty of this new castelão its beauty 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.940
 of this new maracanã 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.800
 this stadium in Brasilia where 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.640
 professional football has in the first 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.670
 second division is that we are not 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.470
 able to make such hospitals 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.930
 schools of this type collective transport 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.150
 this kind of thing was somehow 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.280
 a drop that overflowed the glass and that 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.530
 required the fifa standard 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.810
 So I think the following but we 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.720
 we had a fabulous opportunity to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.910
 show the world who we really are 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.850
 and one thing that was very curious about 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.490
 Confederations Cup was to have contact 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.070
 with the foreign press 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.070
 surprise with what she sells because 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.710
 because as a rule they make us 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 an idea that has nothing to do with 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.150
 brazil's history the old idea of 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.040
 cordial man is the misunderstanding of the 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.380
 sérgio buarque de hollanda né 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.580
 the cordial man and the country could have a 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.530
 million and three hundred thousand homicides 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.560
 in the last 33 years just to remember 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:20.640
 too, because it's talking about this thing 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 footballing already starting out there is the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.000
 a consensus or common sense indicates 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.400
 They made fortunes for the glass and I 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.750
 I think it 's our duty, there are always people. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.250
 the conversion of this further into the environment 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.650
 public in Braga that has almost 18 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.420
 billions that are public works that can 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.810
 being that rob very little more works 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 public access routes to public 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.320
 airports etc and has 7 billion and slightly 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.620
 That's where it's already done. 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.930
 and it seems to me that a 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.180
 several people's agreement 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.470
 governors on your behalf already catches all 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.480
 grab all 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.250
 you see for example to give an example 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.580
 that it was already good to be touched in this by a 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.620
 reason I sometimes worry because I 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.660
 I've been talking about the country a lot there. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.510
 make magical criticisms it makes sense to have a 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.040
 stadium in Natal where there is no football from 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.310
 first division 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.769
 Imagine if it makes sense on the reef where 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.630
 there were three states to make one more to 20 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.910
 kilometers from the center and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.519
 nautical 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.860
 exactly - cheered and paid the price right. 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.360
 already fell to the second division because 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.540
 out of its trapdoor and looks like aa 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.940
 critic of the southern wonder is not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.250
 Here comes the Christmas tree. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.530
 storm, not because it has a stadium 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 Manaus can not be, I want you. 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.180
 start by sao paulo the tucano government 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.760
 in São Paulo start one of the great 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.100
 crimes with public money of the 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.950
 years in this country that are paulo has a 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.940
 stadium called morumbi, which has been 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:02.459
 50 years serving world football where ever 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.670
 played world cup games because the 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.330
 brazil played several games 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.120
 world cup qualifiers in the 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.549
 morumbi where they have played finals of 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.459
 most important liberators cup 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:18.060
 tournament and not only are 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.799
 paulo stadium owner palmeiras 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.600
 played the final of the liberators there 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.940
 afterwards played the final of the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.170
 liberators there the corinthians not because 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.650
 I did not care for this tournament 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:31.770
 until last year when aaa solved 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.720
 to win there in pacaembu very well for a 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.760
 picuinha or by interests 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.850
 unconfessable 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.150
 this stadium was knocked out of the 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.280
 world an event that takes a month and 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.050
 Which do you have in each stadium at most? 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.730
 five or six games 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.700
 could someone ask me more if 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:52.230
 finding the wall of a stadium ideal for 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:57.270
 receive a world cup certainly not 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.490
 is not ideal but what we have and we 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.370
 we do not need to think about having stadiums 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.270
 Ideals, we need to have roads 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.880
 ideals 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:09.210
 we need to have ideal airports to 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.220
 People need to have a number of other 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.840
 other elements that make up the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.230
 infrastructure of cities 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.560
 Ideally I've been in the French Cup in 98 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.780
 at the stadium and a daughter 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.850
 the marcelo stadium was exactly the same 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:28.730
 stadium and that Brazil had played the 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:31.230
 world cup from 38 to 60 years before 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.450
 because we have to do 12 stadiums 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:35.490
 in the united states of america made 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.790
 World Cup in 94 not build a 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.840
 stadium in france in 98 times a stadium 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.110
 stade de france 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:46.770
 there on the outskirts of Paris what we 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.040
 we have to make 12 because the 

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.970
 contractors of the major agencies of the right 

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:56.340
 campaign funds more evenly 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:06:00.330
 distributed by governors of all 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.690
 the parties certainly no unless 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.690
 that you want
