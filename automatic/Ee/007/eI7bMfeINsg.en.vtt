a picture the fireballs actually staying

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.549 
a picture the fireballs actually staying
there<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.639> found<00:00:12.630> out<00:00:12.690> today<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.960> i<00:00:13.410> didn't

watch<00:00:13.679> somebody<00:00:13.889> else<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.309> refined<00:00:14.670> randomly

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
watch somebody else is refined randomly

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.050 
watch somebody else is refined randomly
I<00:00:15.560> shoot<00:00:16.560> fireballs<00:00:16.770> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.250> Spencer<00:00:17.699> into

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
I shoot fireballs of the Spencer into

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.670 
I shoot fireballs of the Spencer into
her<00:00:18.119> unloaded<00:00:18.570> chunk<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.320> stays<00:00:20.100> there<00:00:20.400> and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
her unloaded chunk it stays there and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
her unloaded chunk it stays there and
this<00:00:22.680> leap<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.130> go<00:00:23.250> away<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.580> log<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> out<00:00:24.000> like

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
this leap to go away can log it out like

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.800 
this leap to go away can log it out like
a<00:00:24.180> Nam<00:00:24.769> do<00:00:25.769> whatever<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.480> even<00:00:27.480> work<00:00:27.630> some

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
a Nam do whatever but I even work some

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.890 
a Nam do whatever but I even work some
water<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.369> the<00:00:29.369> word<00:00:29.580> thing<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:30.060> this<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.480> if

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
water to the word thing about this is if

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.979 
water to the word thing about this is if
you<00:00:31.080> can<00:00:32.009> move<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.309> water<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
you can move in water so you can see the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.220 
you can move in water so you can see the
fireball<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.469> moving<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:35.969> not<00:00:36.270> updating

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
fireball is moving but it's not updating

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.410 
fireball is moving but it's not updating
or<00:00:37.320> anything<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:39.090> put<00:00:39.480> blocks<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.170> and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
or anything you put blocks on it and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.610 
or anything you put blocks on it and
there's<00:00:42.420> bubbles<00:00:42.780> coming<00:00:43.050> out<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.290> very

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
there's bubbles coming out of it very

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.299 
there's bubbles coming out of it very
cold<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:46.289> don't<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.070> they're<00:00:47.190> he's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
cold and I don't know if they're he's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.190 
cold and I don't know if they're he's
gone<00:00:47.489> patches<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.180> looks<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.870> cool<00:00:49.140> I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
gone patches but looks pretty cool I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
gone patches but looks pretty cool I
guess<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.770> he<00:00:49.950> can<00:00:50.190> shoot<00:00:50.640> fireballs<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
guess if he can shoot fireballs to

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.490 
guess if he can shoot fireballs to
another<00:00:51.629> chunks<00:00:52.430> um<00:00:53.719> yeah<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.260> said<00:00:55.289> I

guys next time thanks for watching oh
yeah<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.369> also<00:01:29.670> works<00:01:29.939> off<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> ghast<00:01:30.600> fireball

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
yeah and also works off a ghast fireball

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.490 
yeah and also works off a ghast fireball
this<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.430> actually<00:01:32.820> gas<00:01:33.299> fireball<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.320> might

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this is actually gas fireball it might

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
this is actually gas fireball it might
look<00:01:34.650> like<00:01:34.710> d<00:01:35.540> other<00:01:36.540> one<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:38.030> think<00:01:39.030> it's

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
look like d other one but I think it's

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.179 
look like d other one but I think it's
just<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.659> same<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:40.110> but<00:01:40.290> enlarged<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:41.009> bit

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
just the same thing but enlarged a bit

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.780 
just the same thing but enlarged a bit
the<00:01:42.150> fire's<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.600> bigger<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.579> balls<00:01:44.579> bit

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
the fire's bit bigger the balls bit

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.030 
the fire's bit bigger the balls bit
bigger<00:01:45.140> Alan<00:01:46.140> test<00:01:46.290> will<00:01:46.500> happen<00:01:46.740> let's<00:01:46.950> see

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
bigger Alan test will happen let's see

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
bigger Alan test will happen let's see
water<00:01:48.030> effects<00:01:48.810> it

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.670 

you<00:01:53.020> will<00:01:53.140> be<00:01:53.350> closed<00:01:53.620> here<00:01:58.440> didn't<00:01:59.440> seem<00:01:59.620> like

water<00:02:14.650> has<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.830> be<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.990> know<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.700> was<00:02:18.700> kind

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
water has to be like I know I was kind

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.840 
water has to be like I know I was kind
of<00:02:18.940> weird<00:02:19.150> so<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.920> kept<00:02:20.920> up<00:02:21.070> blocks<00:02:21.310> next<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
of weird so I kept up blocks next to it
