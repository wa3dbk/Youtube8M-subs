00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.390 
different moves took him over in a
headlock<00:06:20.060> but<00:06:20.630> then<00:06:20.870> like<00:06:21.560> what<00:06:22.250> I<00:06:22.280> would

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 
headlock but then like what I would

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.070 
headlock but then like what I would
consider<00:06:22.640> to<00:06:22.880> be<00:06:22.970> good<00:06:23.300> wrestling<00:06:23.600> he<00:06:23.870> went

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
consider to be good wrestling he went

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.900 
consider to be good wrestling he went
right<00:06:24.350> back<00:06:24.740> to<00:06:24.800> that<00:06:25.100> arm<00:06:25.340> again<00:06:25.610> he<00:06:25.700> didn't

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
right back to that arm again he didn't

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.400 
right back to that arm again he didn't
go<00:06:26.000> to<00:06:26.060> another<00:06:26.240> body<00:06:26.480> part<00:06:26.600> he<00:06:26.930> stayed<00:06:27.230> with

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
go to another body part he stayed with

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.200 
go to another body part he stayed with
it<00:06:27.440> arm<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.950> I<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:28.370> think<00:06:28.790> that's<00:06:28.970> going<00:06:29.150> to

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
it arm and I I think that's going to

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.450 
it arm and I I think that's going to
make<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:29.510> difference<00:06:29.950> no<00:06:30.950> question<00:06:31.400> about

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
make the difference no question about

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.750 
make the difference no question about
that<00:06:31.670> and<00:06:32.150> it<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.860> Brad<00:06:33.860> Armstrong<00:06:34.490> now
