covered<00:00:22.650> by<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:22.919> water<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.579> it's<00:00:23.759> inside<00:00:24.000> of

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
covered by the water if it's inside of

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.619 
covered by the water if it's inside of
the<00:00:24.689> plate<00:00:25.489> then<00:00:26.489> you<00:00:26.640> need<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> small<00:00:27.210> compact

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:27.629 
the plate then you need a small compact

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.830 
the plate then you need a small compact
camera<00:00:28.020> or<00:00:28.290> DSLR<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:29.460> record<00:00:29.849> yourself<00:00:30.270> taking

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.110 
camera or DSLR to record yourself taking
this<00:00:31.290> little<00:00:31.500> marble<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.219> dropping<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.910> into

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
this little marble and dropping it into

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.869 
this little marble and dropping it into
the<00:00:33.329> water<00:00:33.710> like<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.670> would

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
the water like this and I would

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.740 
the water like this and I would
recommend<00:00:36.360> to<00:00:36.600> use<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.140> fast<00:00:37.860> lens<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.579> this

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
recommend to use a fast lens like this

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.410 
recommend to use a fast lens like this
1.8<00:00:39.750> 50<00:00:40.379> millimeter<00:00:40.770> lens<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.789> also<00:00:42.239> maybe

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
1.8 50 millimeter lens and also maybe

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.660 
1.8 50 millimeter lens and also maybe
you<00:00:42.539> want<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.260> filter<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.130> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
you want to put a filter on here to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
you want to put a filter on here to
protect<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.120> from<00:00:45.180> water<00:00:45.680> spilling<00:00:46.680> around<00:00:46.950> so

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
protect it from water spilling around so

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.630 
protect it from water spilling around so
I<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:47.880> shirt<00:00:48.150> Alexis<00:00:49.220> then<00:00:50.220> we<00:00:50.460> need<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I put on a shirt Alexis then we need a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.610 
I put on a shirt Alexis then we need a
lot<00:00:50.880> of<00:00:51.000> light<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.810> a<00:00:51.930> small<00:00:52.200> shutter

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
lot of light to have a small shutter

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.880 
lot of light to have a small shutter
speed<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.360> we<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.480> one<00:00:54.660> light<00:00:54.870> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.470> also

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
speed so we have one light here and also

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
speed so we have one light here and also
one<00:00:56.309> light<00:00:56.550> over<00:00:56.910> there<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.510> will<00:00:57.660> be<00:00:57.870> going

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
one light over there that will be going

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.610 
one light over there that will be going
onto<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.760> tripod<00:00:59.870> so<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.260> camera

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
onto this tripod so you take your camera

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.639 
onto this tripod so you take your camera
and<00:01:01.770> mount<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.280> onto<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> tripod<00:01:03.019> focus<00:01:04.019> until

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
and mount it onto the tripod focus until

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:07.190 
and mount it onto the tripod focus until
the<00:01:04.829> meteorite's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.700> small<00:01:06.000> marble<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.570> then

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the meteorite's a small marble and then

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.990 
the meteorite's a small marble and then
drop<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.850> plate<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:10.520> would<00:01:11.520> recommend

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
drop it into the plate I would recommend

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.990 
drop it into the plate I would recommend
a<00:01:12.180> drop<00:01:12.450> height<00:01:12.719> from<00:01:12.990> around<00:01:13.380> 1<00:01:14.310> meter<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
a drop height from around 1 meter it

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.779 
a drop height from around 1 meter it
should<00:01:15.210> be<00:01:15.390> something<00:01:15.959> like<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:17.429> do

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
should be something like this so you do

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.389 
should be something like this so you do
this<00:01:17.969> maybe<00:01:18.450> like<00:01:18.959> 30<00:01:19.259> times<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:20.039> make<00:01:20.219> sure

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
this maybe like 30 times and make sure

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:22.730 
this maybe like 30 times and make sure
that<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.149> water<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.689> not<00:01:21.959> dropping<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
that the water is not dropping from the

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.980 
that the water is not dropping from the
marble<00:01:23.069> like<00:01:23.219> yeah<00:01:23.520> wait<00:01:24.149> -<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> water<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
marble like yeah wait - the water is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.849 
marble like yeah wait - the water is
calm<00:01:25.289> then<00:01:26.130> just<00:01:26.369> let<00:01:26.639> it<00:01:26.729> fall<00:01:26.939> into<00:01:27.209> the<00:01:27.450> pool

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
calm then just let it fall into the pool

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.109 
calm then just let it fall into the pool
and<00:01:28.859> then<00:01:29.100> take<00:01:29.459> a<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.969> computer

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
and then take a look on the computer

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.889 
and then take a look on the computer
what<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> got<00:01:31.819> now<00:01:32.819> we<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.119> imported<00:01:33.749> our

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
what you got now we have imported our

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.709 
what you got now we have imported our
footage<00:01:34.350> from<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:34.859> SD<00:01:35.159> card<00:01:35.459> and<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:36.359> can<00:01:36.539> open

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
footage from the SD card and we can open

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:39.679 
footage from the SD card and we can open
it<00:01:36.959> for<00:01:37.350> example<00:01:37.649> in<00:01:38.009> iMovie<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:39.509> will

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
it for example in iMovie but this will

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.989 
it for example in iMovie but this will
also<00:01:39.869> work<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.259> same<00:01:40.709> way<00:01:40.740> probably<00:01:41.639> in

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
also work the same way probably in

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.809 
also work the same way probably in
Windows<00:01:42.420> Movie<00:01:42.569> Maker<00:01:42.889> in<00:01:43.889> iMovie<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.639> have<00:01:44.789> a

now I understand processing and we have

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.069 
now I understand processing and we have
here<00:02:01.829> our<00:02:02.099> footage<00:02:02.669> we<00:02:03.359> can<00:02:03.569> now<00:02:03.749> scrub

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
here our footage we can now scrub

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.349 
here our footage we can now scrub
through<00:02:04.349> the<00:02:04.439> footage<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.310> find<00:02:05.669> interesting

footage frame by frame so we press to
the<00:02:15.989> right<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.060> we<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.239> take<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.750> what

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
the right and we can take a look what

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.550 
the right and we can take a look what
happens<00:02:19.349> when<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.340> marble<00:02:20.850> drops<00:02:21.300> into<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
happens when the marble drops into the

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.370 
happens when the marble drops into the
water<00:02:23.120> so<00:02:24.120> let's<00:02:24.390> say<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.750> two<00:02:24.900> sided

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
water so let's say we have two sided

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.750 
water so let's say we have two sided
for<00:02:25.620> maybe<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:27.570> impact<00:02:28.050> here<00:02:28.350> we<00:02:29.130> selected

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
for maybe this impact here we selected

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600 
for maybe this impact here we selected
and<00:02:30.530> then<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.680> drag<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.040> into<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.460> actual

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
and then we drag it into the actual

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.920 
and then we drag it into the actual
movie<00:02:32.790> area<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:34.940> hit<00:02:35.940> saying<00:02:36.510> something

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
movie area and hit saying something

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.260 
movie area and hit saying something
about<00:02:36.990> frame<00:02:37.320> weights<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.970> don't<00:02:38.970> want<00:02:39.180> to

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
about frame weights we don't want to

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.390 
about frame weights we don't want to
change<00:02:39.510> those<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.380> now<00:02:41.250> we<00:02:41.310> can<00:02:41.700> go<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:41.910> clip

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
change those and now we can go on clip

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.580 
change those and now we can go on clip
slow<00:02:44.400> motion<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.060> set<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.990> example<00:02:46.440> to

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
slow motion and set this for example to

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:56.990 
slow motion and set this for example to
10%<00:02:48.020> maybe<00:02:49.020> play<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.380> back<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:55.820> you<00:02:56.820> get<00:02:56.970> a

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
10% maybe play it back now you get a

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.620 
10% maybe play it back now you get a
slow<00:02:57.270> motion<00:02:57.450> clip<00:02:59.000> now<00:03:00.000> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.300> do<00:03:00.420> some

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
slow motion clip now you can do some

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.080 
slow motion clip now you can do some
editing<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:01.290> export<00:03:01.770> your<00:03:01.950> video<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:02.490> upload

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
editing and export your video and upload

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.020 
editing and export your video and upload
it<00:03:03.120> maybe<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.750> YouTube<00:03:04.170> SAV<00:03:04.920> responds<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.880> this

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
it maybe to YouTube SAV responds to this

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.330

one I'm looking forward to see all of

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.510 
one I'm looking forward to see all of
your<00:03:08.670> homemade<00:03:09.120> meteorite<00:03:09.990> impacts<00:03:10.620> alright

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
your homemade meteorite impacts alright

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.670 
your homemade meteorite impacts alright
now<00:03:11.940> it's<00:03:12.120> time<00:03:12.330> to<00:03:12.360> analyze<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.140> data<00:03:13.290> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
now it's time to analyze the data and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:21.770 
now it's time to analyze the data and
discuss<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.250> results<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.940> will<00:03:15.090> find<00:03:20.780> let's

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
discuss the results we will find let's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.690 
discuss the results we will find let's
take<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.050> look<00:03:22.350> at<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> impact<00:03:23.010> frame<00:03:23.520> by<00:03:23.670> frame

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
take a look at the impact frame by frame

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.540 
take a look at the impact frame by frame
we<00:03:24.630> see<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:25.020> how<00:03:25.290> our<00:03:25.470> meteorite<00:03:25.860> is<00:03:26.190> coming

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
we see here how our meteorite is coming

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.610 
we see here how our meteorite is coming
from<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.940> top<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.870> sittings<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.410> water

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
from the top and the sittings of water

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.370 
from the top and the sittings of water
the<00:03:29.370> water<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.790> already<00:03:30.360> repaid<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.960> the<00:03:31.110> side

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
the water is already repaid to the side

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.220 
the water is already repaid to the side
as<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.710> can<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.160> by<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.730> shadow<00:03:33.060> we<00:03:34.050> would

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
as you can see by the shadow we would

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.230 
as you can see by the shadow we would
benefit<00:03:34.710> from<00:03:34.770> some<00:03:35.010> additional<00:03:35.220> frames<00:03:35.940> here

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
benefit from some additional frames here

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.480 
benefit from some additional frames here
but<00:03:36.780> unfortunately<00:03:36.930> I<00:03:37.710> could<00:03:37.950> only<00:03:38.130> record

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
but unfortunately I could only record

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.360 
but unfortunately I could only record
this<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.180> 30<00:03:39.420> frames<00:03:39.810> per<00:03:39.960> second<00:03:40.440> however<00:03:40.890> you

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
this in 30 frames per second however you

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.030 
this in 30 frames per second however you
can<00:03:41.580> see<00:03:41.820> here<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.690> impact<00:03:43.050> crater<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.980> a

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
can see here that the impact crater is a

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.450 
can see here that the impact crater is a
lot<00:03:44.310> bigger<00:03:44.580> than<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.390> actual<00:03:45.750> asteroid<00:03:46.460> also

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
lot bigger than the actual asteroid also

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.550 
lot bigger than the actual asteroid also
we<00:03:47.670> can<00:03:47.850> see<00:03:48.060> how<00:03:48.270> very<00:03:48.510> fine<00:03:48.870> droplets<00:03:49.080> of

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
we can see how very fine droplets of

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.280 
we can see how very fine droplets of
water<00:03:49.650> get<00:03:50.610> ejected<00:03:50.940> from<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.840> impact<00:03:52.200> site

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
water get ejected from the impact site

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.800 
water get ejected from the impact site
in<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:53.160> next<00:03:53.430> frame<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:53.850> see<00:03:53.880> how<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.390> impact

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
in the next frame we see how the impact

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.560 
in the next frame we see how the impact
medic<00:03:55.260> is<00:03:55.440> injected<00:03:56.010> first<00:03:56.340> out<00:03:56.580> on<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.390> Left

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
medic is injected first out on the Left

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.410 
medic is injected first out on the Left
we<00:03:57.840> see<00:03:58.050> an<00:03:58.170> secondary<00:03:58.770> impact<00:03:59.280> caused<00:04:00.120> by

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
we see an secondary impact caused by

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.020 
we see an secondary impact caused by
material<00:04:00.600> of<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.320> impact<00:04:01.709> site<00:04:01.950> we<00:04:02.610> can<00:04:02.790> see

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
material of the impact site we can see

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.910 
material of the impact site we can see
here<00:04:03.330> how<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.540> impact<00:04:03.959> wave<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.530> going

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
here how the impact wave is going

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.070 
here how the impact wave is going
further<00:04:05.190> out<00:04:05.520> but<00:04:06.090> it's<00:04:06.270> also<00:04:06.450> going<00:04:06.840> back

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
further out but it's also going back

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.320 
further out but it's also going back
together<00:04:07.320> on<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:07.890> spot<00:04:08.190> where<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.790> meteorite

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
together on the spot where the meteorite

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.020 
together on the spot where the meteorite
hit<00:04:09.690> now<00:04:10.470> we<00:04:10.530> have<00:04:10.800> some<00:04:11.010> two<00:04:11.160> balances<00:04:11.730> and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
hit now we have some two balances and

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.680 
hit now we have some two balances and
that<00:04:12.930> was<00:04:13.140> our<00:04:13.380> impact<00:04:14.340> of<00:04:14.580> course<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.660> should

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
that was our impact of course it should

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.539 
that was our impact of course it should
be<00:04:15.959> mentioned<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.650> meteorite<00:04:17.070> would

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
be mentioned that the meteorite would

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.030 
be mentioned that the meteorite would
not<00:04:17.730> remain<00:04:18.090> intact<00:04:18.570> like<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.170> mob<00:04:19.350> here<00:04:19.799> and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
not remain intact like the mob here and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.850 
not remain intact like the mob here and
would<00:04:20.489> shatter<00:04:20.730> into<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.239> lot<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.480> pieces<00:04:21.959> also

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
would shatter into a lot of pieces also

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.950 
would shatter into a lot of pieces also
the<00:04:23.400> actual<00:04:23.670> impact<00:04:24.060> might<00:04:24.450> look<00:04:24.660> a<00:04:24.810> little

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
the actual impact might look a little

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.500 
the actual impact might look a little
bit<00:04:25.170> different<00:04:25.560> because<00:04:26.520> we<00:04:26.760> are<00:04:27.000> using<00:04:27.150> water

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
bit different because we are using water

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.440 
bit different because we are using water
here<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.200> it's<00:04:28.560> a<00:04:28.680> very<00:04:28.860> small<00:04:29.190> scale<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:30.420> I

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
here and it's a very small scale but I

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.660 
here and it's a very small scale but I
think<00:04:30.840> this<00:04:31.260> experiment<00:04:31.890> can<00:04:32.250> really<00:04:32.520> give

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
think this experiment can really give

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.150 
think this experiment can really give
you<00:04:32.820> an<00:04:32.880> idea<00:04:33.030> what<00:04:33.870> an<00:04:33.990> actual<00:04:34.380> impact<00:04:34.770> might

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
you an idea what an actual impact might

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.530 
you an idea what an actual impact might
look<00:04:35.340> like

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
look like

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:54.680 
look like
let's<00:04:37.290> enjoy<00:04:37.620> some<00:04:37.650> other<00:04:38.100> impacts

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.390 

we<00:04:55.690> can<00:04:55.870> also<00:04:56.080> watch<00:04:56.380> this<00:04:56.560> impact<00:04:57.040> from<00:04:57.250> the

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
we can also watch this impact from the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.930 
we can also watch this impact from the
top<00:04:58.170> this<00:04:59.170> again<00:04:59.500> shows<00:04:59.770> how<00:05:00.160> big<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.580> impact

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
top this again shows how big the impact

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.610 
top this again shows how big the impact
crater<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.480> compared<00:05:02.170> to<00:05:02.260> the<00:05:02.500> actual

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
crater is compared to the actual

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.490 
crater is compared to the actual
meteorite<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.670> you<00:05:04.390> also<00:05:04.600> see<00:05:04.930> again<00:05:05.260> very

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
meteorite and you also see again very

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.590 
meteorite and you also see again very
nice<00:05:05.740> secondary<00:05:06.520> impacts<00:05:07.090> that<00:05:07.210> are<00:05:07.360> caused

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
nice secondary impacts that are caused

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.470 
nice secondary impacts that are caused
by<00:05:07.870> meta<00:05:08.110> swirl<00:05:08.950> into<00:05:09.280> the<00:05:09.430> air<00:05:09.610> by<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.150> main

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
by meta swirl into the air by the main

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.450 
by meta swirl into the air by the main
impact

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
impact

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.420 
impact
we<00:05:13.360> can<00:05:13.540> now<00:05:13.720> compare<00:05:14.230> our<00:05:14.470> results<00:05:14.500> with<00:05:15.250> the

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
we can now compare our results with the

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.550 
we can now compare our results with the
craters<00:05:16.000> we<00:05:16.150> find<00:05:16.420> on<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.750> earth<00:05:16.780> or<00:05:17.230> for

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
craters we find on the earth or for

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.860 
craters we find on the earth or for
example<00:05:18.040> also<00:05:18.220> on<00:05:18.550> the<00:05:18.670> moon<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.480> moon<00:05:19.510> is

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
example also on the moon the moon is

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.320 
example also on the moon the moon is
here<00:05:20.050> an<00:05:20.260> easy<00:05:20.440> example<00:05:20.620> because<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.880> craters

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
here an easy example because the craters

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.810 
here an easy example because the craters
are<00:05:22.510> not<00:05:22.660> changed<00:05:23.140> that<00:05:23.350> much<00:05:23.560> as<00:05:24.220> they<00:05:24.490> are<00:05:24.640> on

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
are not changed that much as they are on

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.210 
are not changed that much as they are on
the<00:05:24.850> earth<00:05:25.000> if<00:05:25.870> we<00:05:26.110> take<00:05:26.290> now<00:05:26.530> a<00:05:26.560> look<00:05:26.860> at<00:05:27.040> the

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
the earth if we take now a look at the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.770 
the earth if we take now a look at the
moon<00:05:27.430> we<00:05:27.670> see<00:05:27.880> there<00:05:28.120> are<00:05:28.180> a<00:05:28.240> lot<00:05:28.390> of<00:05:28.420> craters

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
moon we see there are a lot of craters

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.470 
moon we see there are a lot of craters
in<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.800> craters<00:05:30.460> have<00:05:30.760> very<00:05:31.030> special

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
in the craters have very special

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.600 
in the craters have very special
features<00:05:31.930> we<00:05:32.410> can<00:05:32.440> see<00:05:32.800> some<00:05:33.130> secondary

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
features we can see some secondary

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.430 
features we can see some secondary
impacts<00:05:34.270> that<00:05:34.420> we<00:05:34.570> also<00:05:34.750> saw<00:05:35.110> in<00:05:35.320> our

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
impacts that we also saw in our

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.970 
impacts that we also saw in our
experiment<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:37.390> also<00:05:37.570> we<00:05:38.140> see<00:05:38.380> there<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:38.890> a

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
experiment and also we see there is a

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.310 
experiment and also we see there is a
little<00:05:39.250> peak<00:05:39.580> in<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:40.000> middle<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.540> this<00:05:41.170> is

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
little peak in the middle and this is

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.980 
little peak in the middle and this is
because<00:05:41.740> the<00:05:42.370> meta<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:42.940> bouncing<00:05:43.540> back<00:05:43.750> a

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
because the meta is bouncing back a

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.470 
because the meta is bouncing back a
little<00:05:44.260> bit<00:05:44.530> so<00:05:44.770> it<00:05:45.280> gets<00:05:45.490> pushed<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:46.120> the<00:05:46.240> side

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:46.480 
little bit so it gets pushed to the side

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.870 
little bit so it gets pushed to the side
when<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> meteor<00:05:47.470> hit<00:05:47.500> but<00:05:48.310> then<00:05:48.520> they're

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
when the meteor hit but then they're

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.580 
when the meteor hit but then they're
ours<00:05:49.060> is<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.300> little<00:05:49.540> bit<00:05:49.630> bouncy<00:05:49.780> so<00:05:50.290> it<00:05:50.410> gets

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
ours is a little bit bouncy so it gets

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.710 
ours is a little bit bouncy so it gets
pulled<00:05:50.950> up<00:05:51.160> in<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.700> middle<00:05:51.970> like<00:05:52.330> with<00:05:52.600> the

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
pulled up in the middle like with the

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.950 
pulled up in the middle like with the
water<00:05:52.870> in<00:05:53.380> our<00:05:53.650> experiment<00:05:54.370> so<00:05:55.300> I<00:05:55.360> hope<00:05:55.780> you

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
water in our experiment so I hope you

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.780 
water in our experiment so I hope you
