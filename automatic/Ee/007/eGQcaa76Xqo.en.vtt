00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:09.720
 well in this case we have an 80 400 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.720
 from the box 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:22.090
 manuals and official guarantee to equip 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.090
 with center 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:33.040
 what 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.040
 and all those things 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.880
 weather 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.240
 but 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:47.740
 this is the size of the lens 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:51.630
 when it's saved it's week 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.630
 different positions of the green 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:01:01.490
 to different this would have could be 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.640
 handle the opening if I did not 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:07.210
 I'm going to put the camera so I show you how 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.210
 Opera 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.909
 excellent at this time 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.260
 with filters 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.179
 in this case the neutral is the one that has 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.179
 always and the polarized 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.610
 what we are going to do is put the 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850
 the protector 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.899
 and we are going to connect it 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.899
 machine 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 the size when the 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.900
 parasol yes 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.900
 there would be a card 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.320
 so it would move on a tripod 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.520
 easy to load 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:33.730
 necklace you can move him generally 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:35.980
 I use the collar up like in this 70 200 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:40.349
 and I use the collar up to me it seems 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.349
 easier to grasp and in any case 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:48.500
 that is the tripod comfortable but good 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.500
 ej 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.800
 I'm going to 400 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.939
 a little 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.219
 that size when we are in 400 here 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:13.129
 have the option of the typical of the 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:15.439
 zoom if you want to do 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.209
 full or limited that means that if 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.319
 let's focus on something that is less than 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.519
 6 meters would have to put the limits 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.519
 all here also at 6 meters 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.060
 equally but with the 300 28 for example 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.940
 you can not focus anything 6 meters to 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.820
 focus on what is outside of the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.819
 window is going to be faster closed a 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.260
 full 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.980
 the island in focus 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.980
 If then 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.100
 is showing the effect of listening br 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.340
 changing the focus of the place 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.650
 and let's go into action 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.340
 and for the motor to see 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.840
 there it is back inside 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.210
 or not 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.270
 so has an action can you see that 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.819
 is 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.830
 perfect if you can change the focus 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.830
 automatic or manual 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.900
 we go back to 80 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.900
 good 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.090
 good this
