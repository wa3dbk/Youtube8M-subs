00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Hello everybody!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Today I like to show you

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
how I create my own Manga.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.000
At the moment there's the Mangatalente contest 2012 in Germany.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.000
So I think about a story for an own Manga.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
And the idea I had I liked to write down.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.200
So I bought a notebook for my ideas.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.080
There I write down the story.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.210
This is a first plan with a lot of changes.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.000
There are also more ideas and how the story could continue.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.640
And when I finished the first ideas within the notebook...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.180
... I write the story with the computer.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.640
Then the story gets a title and I start to organize the pages.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.820
This would be the last page for example.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
When I finished the text...

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.900
... I start with the sketches.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.900
Here you can see how I roughly sketched the pages.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.420
Panel 1, 2, 3, 4..., next page and so on...

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.630
And here you can also see the sketches how the Manga continues.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.000
During I made the sketches, I look at the text what can be changed.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.900
At this point I've decided to add some more text.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.900
When I finished the sketches and the text...

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.200
I start to transfer the sketches on this special paper.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:04.250
This is a very special paper, it's the Deleter comic book paper.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.250
I've imported it from Japan, yes! xD

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.170
Here it has blue lines and rulers for orientation on the paper.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.170
Unfortunately you can not see it just as good.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.000
On this paper I began to transfer my sketches.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.310
This is panel 1, 2, 3 and 4

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.690
Unfortunately you can not see it just as good, too, because it's drawn with lightblue.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:35.370
I draw it with lightblue because when I ink it later, the scanner couldn't scan the blue lines in the black/white modus.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.370
Yeah and when I begin to ink the pages I will be back with the next video!

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.000
So, I would be happy if you would be there the next time again :)

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:49.370
Bye, bye! :)
