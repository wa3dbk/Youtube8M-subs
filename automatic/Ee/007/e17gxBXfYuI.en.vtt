drop<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:07.910> beat<00:01:08.120> Joe<00:01:08.590> first<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.740> plot<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.070> B

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
drop that beat Joe first you plot the B

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.190 
drop that beat Joe first you plot the B
which<00:01:10.580> is<00:01:10.730> where<00:01:10.910> the<00:01:11.060> line<00:01:11.270> passes<00:01:11.900> through

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
which is where the line passes through

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.440 
which is where the line passes through
the<00:01:12.350> wide<00:01:12.560> line<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.310> vertical<00:01:13.790> axis

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
the wide line that's the vertical axis

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.180 
the wide line that's the vertical axis
then<00:01:14.750> use<00:01:15.020> the<00:01:15.200> slope<00:01:15.320> which<00:01:15.710> will<00:01:15.890> help<00:01:16.100> you

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
then use the slope which will help you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.250 
then use the slope which will help you
define<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.850> next<00:01:17.060> point<00:01:17.390> on<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.630> graph<00:01:18.020> of

end<00:01:28.010> to<00:01:28.310> show<00:01:28.520> infinity<00:01:29.270> I<00:01:29.510> think<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.870> started

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
end to show infinity I think you started

end to show infinity I think you started
this<00:01:30.500> problem<00:01:30.890> in<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.160> standard<00:01:31.370> formation

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
this problem in the standard formation

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.580 
this problem in the standard formation
but<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:32.600> you<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.930> to<00:01:33.080> change<00:01:33.290> it<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.560> a

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
but now you got to change it to a

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.170 
but now you got to change it to a
different<00:01:33.890> equation<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.670> need<00:01:34.820> a<00:01:34.850> point

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
different equation you need a point

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.910 
different equation you need a point
where<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.540> start<00:01:35.810> another<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.229> make<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.680> line

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
where to start another to make the line

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.800 
where to start another to make the line
so<00:01:37.340> let's<00:01:37.700> start<00:01:38.030> moving<00:01:38.450> stuff<00:01:38.630> just

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
so let's start moving stuff just

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.510 
so let's start moving stuff just
listening<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.260> this<00:01:39.410> rhyme<00:01:39.650> first<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:40.369> move

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
listening to this rhyme first you move

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.790 
listening to this rhyme first you move
the<00:01:40.670> X<00:01:40.850> to<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.270> opposite<00:01:41.780> side<00:01:42.020> when<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.560> move

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
the X to the opposite side when you move

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.830 
the X to the opposite side when you move
it<00:01:42.950> don't<00:01:43.130> forget<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.760> change<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.360> side<00:01:44.600> if

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
it don't forget to change the side if

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.660 
it don't forget to change the side if
there's<00:01:45.050> a<00:01:45.140> number<00:01:45.290> by<00:01:45.619> the<00:01:45.680> Y<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.310> you<00:01:46.430> gotta

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
there's a number by the Y then you gotta

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.120 
there's a number by the Y then you gotta
divide<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.630> number<00:01:47.960> by<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> X<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.860> the<00:01:48.950> one

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
divide the number by the X and the one

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.190 
divide the number by the X and the one
to<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:49.340> right<00:01:49.430> now<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:50.840> form<00:01:50.869> y

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
to the right now it's in the form y

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.170 
to the right now it's in the form y
equals<00:01:51.560> MX<00:01:51.710> plus<00:01:51.890> B<00:01:52.190> that's<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.729> one<00:01:52.940> you<00:01:53.030> need

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
equals MX plus B that's the one you need

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
equals MX plus B that's the one you need
for<00:01:53.390> graphing<00:01:53.750> these<00:01:53.869> equations<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.500> see<00:01:54.740> you

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
for graphing these equations you see you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.440 
for graphing these equations you see you
remember<00:01:55.310> this<00:01:55.460> one<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:55.970> live<00:01:56.180> through

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
remember this one and you live through

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.090 
remember this one and you live through
the<00:01:56.600> algebra<00:01:56.810> storm<00:01:57.320> now<00:01:57.710> you're<00:01:57.890> graphing

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
the algebra storm now you're graphing

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.980 
the algebra storm now you're graphing
these<00:01:58.369> equations<00:01:58.910> in<00:01:59.030> slope-intercept<00:01:59.660> form

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
these equations in slope-intercept form

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.990 
these equations in slope-intercept form
first<00:02:00.590> you<00:02:00.680> plot<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.009> B<00:02:01.220> which<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.670> where<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
first you plot the B which is where the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120 
first you plot the B which is where the
line<00:02:02.210> passes<00:02:02.840> through<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.259> why<00:02:03.440> line<00:02:03.800> that's

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
line passes through the why line that's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.340 
line passes through the why line that's
the<00:02:04.190> vertical<00:02:04.700> axis<00:02:05.390> then<00:02:05.660> you<00:02:05.780> use<00:02:05.960> the<00:02:06.110> slope

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the vertical axis then you use the slope

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.050 
the vertical axis then you use the slope
which<00:02:06.619> will<00:02:06.800> help<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.130> find<00:02:07.429> the<00:02:07.789> next

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
over run the steepness of the line from

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.260 
over run the steepness of the line from
the<00:02:33.530> B<00:02:33.710> use<00:02:33.980> the<00:02:34.160> slope<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:34.790> do<00:02:34.910> put<00:02:35.150> your

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
the B use the slope and I do put your

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.910 
the B use the slope and I do put your
find<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:35.990> number<00:02:36.350> on<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.680> top<00:02:36.860> just

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
find first the number on the top just

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250 
find first the number on the top just
take<00:02:37.250> a<00:02:37.280> look<00:02:37.520> at<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.790> sign<00:02:38.060> apply<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:39.080> the

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
take a look at the sign apply it to the

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.559 
take a look at the sign apply it to the
numerator<00:02:39.560> that's<00:02:40.130> the<00:02:40.340> rise<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.610> go<00:02:41.120> up<00:02:41.360> if

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
numerator that's the rise you go up if

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.870 
numerator that's the rise you go up if
it's<00:02:41.780> positive<00:02:42.290> down<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.100> negative<00:02:43.280> is

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
it's positive down if it's negative is

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.240 
it's positive down if it's negative is
the<00:02:44.150> denominator<00:02:44.510> for<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.470> run<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.800> it<00:02:46.069> but

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the denominator for the run of it but

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.500 
the denominator for the run of it but
all<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.520> points<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:46.819> can<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.240> go<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
all the points you can then go the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.540 
all the points you can then go the
opposite<00:02:47.990> way<00:02:48.050> slope<00:02:48.740> intercept<00:02:49.280> form<00:02:49.310> is

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
opposite way slope intercept form is

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.940 
opposite way slope intercept form is
easy<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.940> mr.<00:02:50.390> Murphy<00:02:50.870> first<00:02:51.500> you<00:02:51.620> plot<00:02:51.830> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
easy with mr. Murphy first you plot the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
easy with mr. Murphy first you plot the
B<00:02:52.130> which<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.550> where<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.880> line<00:02:53.120> passes<00:02:53.720> through

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
B which is where the line passes through

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.230 
B which is where the line passes through
the<00:02:54.140> wide<00:02:54.350> line<00:02:54.650> that's<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.040> vertical<00:02:55.340> axis

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
the wide line that's the vertical axis

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.850 
the wide line that's the vertical axis
then<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.569> use<00:02:56.780> the<00:02:56.959> slope<00:02:57.200> which<00:02:57.470> will<00:02:57.680> help

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
then you use the slope which will help

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.800 
then you use the slope which will help
you<00:02:57.980> define<00:02:58.100> the<00:02:58.610> next<00:02:58.910> point<00:02:59.180> on<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.569> graph

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
you define the next point on the graph

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.990 
you define the next point on the graph
of<00:03:00.050> this<00:03:00.200> linear<00:03:00.590> line<00:03:00.920> draw<00:03:01.400> a<00:03:01.430> line<00:03:01.730> through

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
of this linear line draw a line through

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.880 
of this linear line draw a line through
the<00:03:02.150> points<00:03:02.510> draw<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> straight<00:03:03.050> use<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.319> ruler

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the points draw a straight use a ruler

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.530 
the points draw a straight use a ruler
completely<00:03:04.370> through<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> plane<00:03:04.970> that'd<00:03:05.390> be

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
completely through the plane that'd be

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.780 
completely through the plane that'd be
even<00:03:05.780> cooler<00:03:06.530> Murphy<00:03:06.950> y'all<00:03:07.160> we<00:03:07.280> done<00:03:07.490> check

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
even cooler Murphy y'all we done check

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:08.860 
even cooler Murphy y'all we done check
you<00:03:07.910> listen<00:03:08.270> to<00:03:08.390> me

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
you listen to me

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.330
