00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello comrades we are and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.269
 continue to draw our manga and you 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.190
 you can see how I do enough 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.679
 conditional restaurant plan in which 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.929
 will take place the actions of our manga 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.520
 I really got ideas on 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 conflict escalation 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.400
 but it is then if suddenly I draw and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.619
 8 pages in the fact that for some reason 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.949
 instead of the plan began to make a curve 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.500
 sketch perspective no malice i am 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.530
 so imagined deciding not so 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 I will lose a lot of time for such pampering 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.350
 used these pictures when working 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 there was one question and how to draw 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.239
 perspective on paper textbooks always 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.120
 small pictures 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.059
 but as you can see the points I have significantly left 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.230
 would be beyond the real canvas painting in 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.440
 full size 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.469
 although watched all sorts of videos where skillful 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.440
 Master define all the eye but because 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.870
 not all such masters sketch came out 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.540
 rather approximate only as a general 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 concept from which I will make a start 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.930
 when modeling if you look like 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.530
 make levels of games or characters to 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.990
 you can often find the source code there 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.960
 it turns out that the difference between the concept 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:26.159
 and the embodiment is significant and the question is only 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.770
 in degree then sketch of since me 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.909
 I had to re-install all the programs for 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.900
 known reasons 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.689
 At first I decided to install 2015 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.890
 but it killed the possibility of installation 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:44.040
 on x and then put 2014 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.850
 but without plug-ins live boring and it's time 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.610
 time to put them 2014 sketch of immediately 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.220
 pleased with the fact that the folder plugins 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.009
 which from time immemorial lay and together with 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.770
 him in one folder hid somewhere near 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.740
 trait in the system folders 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.560
 can only be found with the help of a strong 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.580
 witchcraft for this must be used 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.910
 I spoke a ruby console without magic 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 not enough 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.650
 is it in the drop down menu box us 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.710
 need to enter a command 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.800
 she will not repeat on the screen I think you 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:24.130
 you read the sword art online last 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.090
 the arch there all the magic worked according to this 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.810
 principle 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.920
 but it was not there that almost all the plugins were 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.800
 I downloaded do not work in 2014 had 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.080
 set as before 2013 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.990
 I took the plugin from this group 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.460
 VKontakte link as the team in 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.460
 video description 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.940
 nothing complicated we drop the plugin in 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.390
 folder plugins until we need a round 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.640
 horn rounding edges in 3d max 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.760
 if my memory serves me it was called 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.580
 chamfering a separate reference to him 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.770
 the work itself with sketch up on as in 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.440
 I have two previous videos 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.160
 similar lessons on this topic link to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.310
 the screen 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:12.430
 everything is detailed there from the new 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.400
 the columns that I made components 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.959
 although already told about this component 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.870
 it's like empathy 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.230
 changing one copy are projected and on 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.450
 others for identical objects 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.610
 indispensable thing to create a component 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.910
 need to go into editing 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.810
 create a component and then clone 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.000
 dragging through the control tool 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.090
 move to go into editing 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.640
 component double click on it 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.510
 to exit edit mode 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:48.400
 click on the area outside the component then 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.470
 I needed tables 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.440
 I have come across such a second time 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.590
 problem connecting to 3d warehouse 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.920
 not work for the first time waited through 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.500
 some time itself has earned but 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.430
 In this case, I went to the 3d warehouse 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.020
 . sketch up dot com enough in embers 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.440
 drive 3d warehouse 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.160
 he will be 1 link and everything is the same 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.310
 that in sketch api it's even better because without 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.889
 lags 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.829
 Apparently the sketch up itself use the Internet 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.720
 explorer therefore mercilessly fail 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.180
 working with 3d warehouse 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.760
 search is still better to lead on 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.610
 English or another common 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.630
 language angle translate to help you 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:38.389
 This is what in Russian spoke thick 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:42.530
 dostoevsky and even personally you do not 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.350
 its international and massive though if 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.470
 results do not suit you can search 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:51.200
 in all languages ​​that will come head 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.860
 I remember once I found some nice pillars 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:58.220
 power lines in Japanese since 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.460
 i needed exactly japanese ones so 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.240
 make a correction for this stalk or 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.940
 Khrushchev will be easier to find in Russian on 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:11.419
 today it's all on the video just gone 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:14.780
 50 minutes a total of thirty- one 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.810
 hour 30 minutes of pure time I hope you 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:22.360
 learned something new do not forget to put 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.360
