to take and knock out frequencies but

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.540 
to take and knock out frequencies but
take<00:01:41.850> out<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.000> bass<00:01:42.240> take<00:01:43.140> up<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.440> mid<00:01:43.619> take

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
take out the bass take up the mid take

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.330 
take out the bass take up the mid take
it<00:01:44.670> all<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.830> right<00:01:46.830> there<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.160> by

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it all out so right there just by

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.040 
it all out so right there just by
touching<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> knob<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.600> fun<00:01:48.900> it's

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
touching the knob it's really fun it's

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.650 
touching the knob it's really fun it's
really<00:01:49.140> intuitive<00:01:49.530> now<00:01:50.520> we<00:01:50.910> also<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> filter

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:51.660 
really intuitive now we also have filter

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.560 
really intuitive now we also have filter
on<00:01:51.780> here<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:53.550> that<00:01:53.610> filter<00:01:54.030> does<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.210> secondary

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
on here and that filter does a secondary

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.999 
on here and that filter does a secondary
function<00:01:54.780> which<00:01:55.080> is<00:01:55.229> activated<00:01:55.770> which

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
function which is activated which

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.140 
function which is activated which
essentially<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> filter<00:01:56.790> role

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.000 

so<00:02:02.150> if<00:02:02.240> you're<00:02:02.330> using<00:02:02.570> abs<00:02:03.020> having<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.800> filter

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010 
so if you're using abs having a filter

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.320 
so if you're using abs having a filter
role<00:02:04.220> available<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.730> you<00:02:04.790> directly<00:02:05.090> like<00:02:05.300> that

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
role available to you directly like that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.139 
role available to you directly like that
it's<00:02:05.690> actually<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.050> really<00:02:06.230> cool<00:02:06.560> thing<00:02:07.149> in

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
it's actually a really cool thing in

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.370 
it's actually a really cool thing in
addition<00:02:08.570> at<00:02:08.690> like<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.930> said<00:02:09.110> we<00:02:09.229> have<00:02:09.350> our

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
addition at like I said we have our

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.630 
addition at like I said we have our
transport<00:02:09.680> controls<00:02:10.190> where<00:02:10.280> we<00:02:10.340> can<00:02:10.460> start

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
transport controls where we can start

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850 
transport controls where we can start
tracks<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:12.020> control<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.530> speed<00:02:12.620> at

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
tracks and and control the speed at

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.230 
tracks and and control the speed at
tracks<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.310> set<00:02:13.430> my<00:02:13.550> sink<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:13.910> things<00:02:14.150> like

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
tracks and set my sink is things like

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.180 
tracks and set my sink is things like
that<00:02:14.570> I<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.200> headphone<00:02:15.500> output<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
that I have a headphone output on the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.460 
that I have a headphone output on the
front<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.720> unbalanced<00:02:18.380> output

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
front of it I have a unbalanced output

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.780 
front of it I have a unbalanced output
in<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.830> back<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.160> it<00:02:19.250> that's<00:02:19.400> running<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
in the back of it that's running so the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
in the back of it that's running so the
speaker's<00:02:20.180> right<00:02:20.360> now<00:02:20.540> it's<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.290> plus<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
speaker's right now it's a plus the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.020 
speaker's right now it's a plus the
power<00:02:21.860> device<00:02:22.160> which<00:02:22.400> means<00:02:22.550> basically<00:02:22.760> we

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
power device which means basically we

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.310 
power device which means basically we
can<00:02:23.120> plug<00:02:23.330> them<00:02:23.450> straight<00:02:23.660> into<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:23.930> computer

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
can plug them straight into the computer

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.110 
can plug them straight into the computer
you<00:02:24.350> don't<00:02:24.470> have<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:24.980> anything<00:02:25.310> else<00:02:25.550> in

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
you don't have to have anything else in

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.850 
you don't have to have anything else in
between<00:02:26.270> or<00:02:26.690> any<00:02:26.780> outlet<00:02:27.260> powers<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.740> things

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
between or any outlet powers and things

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.480 
between or any outlet powers and things
like<00:02:28.040> that

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
like that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.740 
like that
so<00:02:29.140> this<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.350> AMX<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.550> is<00:02:31.670> available

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so this is the AMX and this is available

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.670 
so this is the AMX and this is available
this<00:02:34.530> fall<00:02:35.210> 439<00:02:36.210> quit<00:02:36.420> here<00:02:36.570> in<00:02:36.630> humans<00:02:37.050> and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
this fall 439 quit here in humans and

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.390 
this fall 439 quit here in humans and
then<00:02:37.920> next<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> few<00:02:38.550> heavy<00:02:38.760> afx<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:40.200> afx<00:02:40.920> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
then next to a few heavy afx that afx is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.870 
then next to a few heavy afx that afx is
a<00:02:41.610> an<00:02:42.360> audio<00:02:42.600> interface<00:02:43.250> an<00:02:44.250> audio<00:02:44.520> interface

I bought in a controller as designed

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.200 
I bought in a controller as designed
specifically<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.370> work<00:02:47.550> with<00:02:47.700> sirata<00:02:48.000> that

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
specifically to work with sirata that

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:49.490 
specifically to work with sirata that

a<00:03:23.540> little<00:03:24.080> bit<00:03:24.519> that's<00:03:25.519> one<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:25.879> functions

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
a little bit that's one of the functions

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.910 
a little bit that's one of the functions
second<00:03:26.900> pumps<00:03:27.080> that<00:03:27.170> happen<00:03:27.439> here's<00:03:27.650> my<00:03:27.769> pitch

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
second pumps that happen here's my pitch

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.490 
second pumps that happen here's my pitch
control<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.629> pick<00:03:29.780> up<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> little<00:03:30.290> bit

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
control so I can pick up a little bit

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.500 
control so I can pick up a little bit
this<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.620> pitch<00:03:30.860> Bend<00:03:31.159> as<00:03:31.849> opposed<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.269> Fitz

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:32.510 
this is pitch Bend as opposed to Fitz

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.390 
this is pitch Bend as opposed to Fitz
change<00:03:34.269> alright<00:03:35.269> and<00:03:36.140> of<00:03:36.200> course<00:03:36.400> another

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
change alright and of course another

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
second but first I wanna go I wanna jump

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.110 
second but first I wanna go I wanna jump
over<00:03:41.360> to<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.510> effects<00:03:41.780> go<00:03:41.989> quick<00:03:42.260> so<00:03:42.940> all<00:03:43.940> my

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
over to the effects go quick so all my

over to the effects go quick so all my
effects<00:03:44.540> section<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:44.930> can<00:03:45.019> see<00:03:45.200> I<00:03:45.230> have<00:03:45.379> a

00:03:45.399 --> 00:03:45.409 
effects section you can see I have a

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:47.039 
effects section you can see I have a
planter<00:03:45.890> right<00:03:46.040> here<00:03:46.220> in<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.370> first<00:03:46.579> effect

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
planter right here in the first effect

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.319 
planter right here in the first effect
and<00:03:48.049> I<00:03:48.079> can<00:03:48.319> of<00:03:48.739> course<00:03:48.769> turn<00:03:49.129> it<00:03:49.280> on<00:03:49.370> the

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
and I can of course turn it on the

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.330 
and I can of course turn it on the
parameter<00:03:50.840> on<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.140> but<00:03:51.739> we've<00:03:51.920> got<00:03:52.099> something

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
parameter on it but we've got something

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:53.770 
parameter on it but we've got something
even<00:03:52.549> better<00:03:52.790> than<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.120> we've<00:03:53.390> added<00:03:53.629> our
