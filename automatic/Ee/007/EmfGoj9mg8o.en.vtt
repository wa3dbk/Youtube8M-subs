blender<00:00:28.680> if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:29.460> know<00:00:29.550> how<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.939> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
blender if you don't know how to do that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.359 
blender if you don't know how to do that
all<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> do<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> take<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.740> folder

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
all you have to do is take that folder

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.440 
all you have to do is take that folder
and<00:00:32.399> put<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> add-on<00:00:33.329> folder<00:00:33.809> which<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
and put it in the add-on folder which is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.430 
and put it in the add-on folder which is
which<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.480> where<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:37.050> install<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.680> blender

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
which is where you install the blender

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.290 
which is where you install the blender
so<00:00:40.440> after<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.640> open<00:00:41.850> up<00:00:41.910> blender

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so after you do that you open up blender

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.299 
so after you do that you open up blender
and<00:00:42.800> go<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> file<00:00:44.250> user<00:00:44.760> preferences<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
and go to file user preferences and

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.450 
and go to file user preferences and
add-ons<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.579> add-ons<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.930> search<00:00:49.379> up

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
add-ons in add-ons you can search up

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
add-ons in add-ons you can search up
sapling<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.289> it's<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> show<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.770> add

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
sapling and it's going to show you add

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.340 
sapling and it's going to show you add
curved<00:00:53.820> sapling<00:00:54.390> which<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> add-on<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
curved sapling which is the add-on you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.500 
curved sapling which is the add-on you
just<00:00:55.680> downloaded<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:56.969> check<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just downloaded so just check that and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:07.959 
just downloaded so just check that and
then<00:00:57.899> close<00:00:58.260> it<00:01:02.000> ok<00:01:03.000> so

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:17.029 

so<00:01:08.969> we<00:01:10.159> freeze<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:14.630> haven't<00:01:15.710> haven't<00:01:16.710> really

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:17.039 
so we freeze I haven't haven't really

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:32.200 
so we freeze I haven't haven't really
shut<00:01:17.250> down<00:01:17.429> my<00:01:17.579> computer<00:01:17.609> for<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> while

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.040 

okay<00:01:34.240> so<00:01:36.550> right<00:01:37.550> so<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:37.850> activate<00:01:38.210> it<00:01:38.660> you<00:01:38.870> have

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
okay so right so to activate it you have

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.980 
okay so right so to activate it you have
to<00:01:39.200> go<00:01:39.320> to<00:01:39.380> shift<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:40.010> to<00:01:40.070> add<00:01:40.430> and<00:01:40.910> then<00:01:41.030> curve

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
to go to shift a to add and then curve

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.710 
to go to shift a to add and then curve
and<00:01:42.350> then<00:01:42.500> add<00:01:42.830> tree<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:45.130> a<00:01:46.130> few<00:01:46.700> or<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.360> first

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
and then add tree and a few or the first

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.260 
and then add tree and a few or the first
couple<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.260> times<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:49.640> going<00:01:49.910> to<00:01:50.060> come<00:01:50.240> out

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
couple of times it's going to come out

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:56.710 
couple of times it's going to come out
all<00:01:50.780> messed<00:01:51.229> up<00:01:51.470> and<00:01:54.550> like<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:56.150> branches<00:01:56.630> are

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
all messed up and like the branches are

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.090 
all messed up and like the branches are
going<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:56.930> be<00:01:56.990> upside<00:01:57.320> down<00:01:58.000> but<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.890> can

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
going to be upside down but you can

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.130 
going to be upside down but you can
actually<00:02:01.250> just<00:02:01.760> delete<00:02:02.720> those<00:02:02.840> branches

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
actually just delete those branches

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.370 
actually just delete those branches
later<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.770> or<00:02:04.180> after<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.210> while<00:02:05.600> of<00:02:05.840> trying<00:02:06.200> it

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
later on or after a while of trying it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.979 
later on or after a while of trying it
actually<00:02:06.740> fixes<00:02:07.160> itself<00:02:07.520> but<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.690> are<00:02:08.780> some

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
actually fixes itself but here are some

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.050 
actually fixes itself but here are some
of<00:02:09.110> them<00:02:09.399> yes<00:02:10.399> so<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.640> can't<00:02:10.820> really<00:02:10.940> expect

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
of them yes so you can't really expect

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.420 
of them yes so you can't really expect
much<00:02:11.510> from<00:02:11.570> this<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.320> it's<00:02:12.739> still<00:02:13.280> in

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
much from this because it's still in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.370 
much from this because it's still in
development<00:02:13.600> but<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.660> think<00:02:14.900> it's<00:02:14.989> pretty<00:02:15.200> cool

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
development but I think it's pretty cool

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.280 
development but I think it's pretty cool
because<00:02:16.160> because<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.270> these<00:02:17.390> options<00:02:17.900> you<00:02:18.020> can

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
because because of these options you can

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.420 
because because of these options you can
have<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.680> shape<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.910> tree<00:02:22.480> like<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:23.690> one

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
have the shape of the tree like this one

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.229 
have the shape of the tree like this one
or<00:02:25.430> conical<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:27.340> tempered<00:02:28.340> cylindrical

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
or conical or tempered cylindrical

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.310 
or conical or tempered cylindrical
whatever<00:02:30.020> that<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.350> and<00:02:31.130> then<00:02:31.870> after<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:33.200> do

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
whatever that is and then after you do

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.090 
whatever that is and then after you do
that<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.610> keep<00:02:35.030> count<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.380> polygons

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
that you can keep count of the polygons

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.640 
that you can keep count of the polygons
which<00:02:37.970> right<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:38.180> is<00:02:38.510> six<00:02:38.750> thousand<00:02:39.260> four

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
which right now is six thousand four

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.979 
which right now is six thousand four
hundred<00:02:39.850> by<00:02:41.890> changing<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.150> options<00:02:44.570> for<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
hundred by changing the options for the

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.000 
hundred by changing the options for the
the<00:02:45.260> number<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.590> branches<00:02:45.860> or<00:02:46.400> number<00:02:47.209> of

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
the number of branches or number of

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.350 
the number of branches or number of
branch<00:02:49.010> splitting<00:02:49.610> or<00:02:49.790> base<00:02:50.150> splitting<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
branch splitting or base splitting you

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.390 
branch splitting or base splitting you
can<00:02:53.480> also<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.019> length<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.470> size<00:02:54.680> and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
can also have the length and size and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.780 
can also have the length and size and
all<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.700> stuff<00:02:56.350> also<00:02:57.350> we<00:02:58.100> have<00:02:58.220> the<00:02:58.370> option

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790
