00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 google kids leads by ever yo 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.609
 I hold the first episode of a new 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.680
 online gta 5 series where I come to 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.480
 teach how to get secret cars 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.490
 hidden and rare for each episode 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.139
 you will have around between 4 and 6 cars 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.030
 different so nothing we go with the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.049
 first episode in this episode first 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.880
 I'm going to teach how to get cars 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.140
 quite useful and easy to get and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.820
 I'm going to leave a little to the end the 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.800
 more difficult and complex cars so 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.330
 nothing ahead the first vehicle is a 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.920
 supergiven van of the police that 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.960
 we can find exactly in this 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.550
 position and well we will not have any 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 problem to catch it and when I say that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 it's super armored I mean it's 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.290
 almost indestructible has only one point 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.020
 weak that because I 'm not going to say 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.540
 but neither the c4 nor almost anything can with him 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 it's practically indestructible so 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.360
 well , it's going to be good for us 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.250
 missions or when we want to guide the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 part out there we have no problem 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.110
 in picking it up and we can find I think 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
 between 6 and 8 people that one those that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.199
 are behind you can open close the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.149
 door to shoot everything they want 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.559
 Everything is at your whim, so it's a 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.210
 pretty good car and it deserves 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.980
 Pretty worth the next vehicle 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
 what to teach to get is the truck 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
 of trevor that is quite unique and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 special and you can only get it from 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.339
 this form and one we will realize 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 which is special because if we go to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.090
 workshop and one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.400
 we will see that they have a way of tuning 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.049
 quite unique and special so one 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.820
 works of pimp leave in the description 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.380
 a video of my associate colleague who has it 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
 of tuning so you can see that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.549
 one is unique and one the only way to 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 get it there we have to give the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.020
 start let's do online activities 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.549
 host an activity and there is a 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.619
 that is called dirt road we have 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.030
 to give to that and good you see that when 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.009
 we appear here the only thing that we have to 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.630
 to do is go to the place that I go and there 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.560
 we will find the van that what 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.930
 what we have to do here 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.369
 just take it to our garage if 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 you look at the map when we have 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.670
 Some mission does not go where you are 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.590
 house exactly so before entering 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.179
 to the mission to see you well in prayer 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.190
 that is your house to be able to put it 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.690
 to the garage and good and just what 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.610
 you have now you can leave the mission 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.289
 finish it or do whatever you want but it 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.729
 you have your van so nothing 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's worth it's a pretty unique car and 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.690
 special as I said and good is very 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580
 well the third car I'll teach you to 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.560
 get is a very easy car and the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.119
 rh8 which is totally free but there 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
 many people who do not know how to get it 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.030
 and well I will explain it because it is 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.190
 pretty simple and the only thing you have 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.090
 what to do is from your computer 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.470
 register them on a page that is called 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 social club that I'll leave it at 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.560
 description 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.140
 blog your account either from 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.400
 version 3 or xbox and just when 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.489
 metais to the game what you have to do 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 It is to make the mobile internet to throw yourself into 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.120
 This section of cars and others 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.340
 well you will see it in the background and you will see that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.230
 there is one called rh8 that states that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.050
 it's totally free just what 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.489
 you buy and they will bring it to your garage 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.020
 important for you to give it you have to 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.459
 have a garage or 'so until 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.530
 do not have it, you can not get it 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.090
 none your car is pretty simple from 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.680
 get and well is going pretty good on 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.569
 everything if you're starting so good 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.709
 It's pretty good also the two 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.330
 cars that teach you how to get to 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.769
 then they are quite difficult and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.030
 complexes of getting so you 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.250
 I recommend that you be quite attentive 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.110
 one of them is this one that I avoid putting that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.640
 it's unique you can only get from this 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.799
 way because in free mode from in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.540
 online does not come out so you have to 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.340
 pay close attention and the other goes to 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.200
 michael be the car that gets 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 by the same method and there is another way to 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.799
 get it that is a mission of Simon 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.600
 but good since good sir is for the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.310
 taught from here I'm going to tell you the 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.870
 textually names of the two cars 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.870
 so you can see the car that you are 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.549
 watching background is called this class does 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.410
 to subscribe exactly so it's worth I say 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.960
 in English for you to understand and 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.730
 michael's car what good 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:24.120
 exactly in the same place it is called or 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.830
 I bleat I tell you to drop the apuntaros 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.900
 name the pronunciation is exactly 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.100
 how it is written so the only thing that 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.390
 we have to do it as I said 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.520
 quite complex so what is going to 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.930
 explain then good then the 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.700
 only way to get these two 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.680
 cars is doing the tutorial of 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.730
 beginning of the online but not you 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.950
 worry that you will not have to 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.330
 restart the character or anything by the 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.860
 style that teach how to get it with 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.810
 your main character is worth 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.670
 need to repeat the tutorial with 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.680
 this character is then worth the only 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 what you have to do is create another 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.220
 character a second character yes good 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.990
 you have two characters created if not 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.940
 you are willing to delete none 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:58.650
 you can not get the car 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.940
 example I have a main one and the other one 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.620
 it does not matter what you have to do 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.180
 is to create a new character in the 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.610
 second hole where you want to go 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
 you just have to do the tutorial 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.960
 and you know that always at the beginning there 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.520
 a career that in that race to choose 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.810
 the option to catch those two cars 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.200
 It's worth what I said earlier 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.549
 you have exactly the description like that 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.049
 that you just have to look for those 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.150
 two names, as you will see from when 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.490
 I'm going to do with the be the only thing 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.370
 you have to do is catch it running with 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.810
 he does not pass 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.240
 if you lose or if you win 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.550
 just when the race is over you 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.530
 will leave in your car or it may be that 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.820
 As I do, if you go in the background 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.169
 when the race ended I like it in the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.699
 another car because I was playing with 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.590
 other players but do not worry 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.910
 because if you see that your car does not come out 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.100
 all you have to do is give it 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.139
 to the start gta online you are looking for a new 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.120
 session and you will leave in your car worth 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.650
 in the car that you have chosen so 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.300
 you will say good once we have the car 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.250
 Well now how do I have this 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.630
 car with my main character worth 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.250
 well at this moment what we have to 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.979
 to do is tell a friend to be a 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.780
 our session but let us invite 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.160
 nobody will be because we have to continue 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.750
 doing a few missions worth 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.280
 because you already know in the tutorial then to 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.169
 Sometimes he does not let you invite anyone and that 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.539
 but good as soon as you see that it leaves you 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:10.120
 invite people to imitate a friend 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.530
 you say I 'm going for you, you leave him 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.600
 the car that gets in the car 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.039
 important and then what you have to 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.410
 to do is to change back to our 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.419
 main character go where he is 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.830
 your friend and take the car and already with 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.360
 your main character the only thing that 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.610
 you have to do is save or save it 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.949
 in the garage and you already have it 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.380
 I recommend that you go to the workshop before 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.700
 nothing that you put an insurance and that 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.200
 because if they destroy it 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.660
 have put him safe or anything like that 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.070
 you are going to be without a car and I tell you that 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.770
 At least it costs half an hour 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.420
 get it so well I recommend you 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.650
 not that you go to the workshop and then what 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.930
 you take to the garage and you are already 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.220
 your unique car as I said in the 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.560
 race you can take the car that 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.560
 michael ye the called Contractions 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.200
 tiger or the one that I have taught you in the background 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.300
 which is called class towards asia 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.610
 has a very special tuning too 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.050
 like having seen those images in the background 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.400
 are from a friend who has it and has 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.750
 tuned so I'll leave your channel in the 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.910
 description I can also put our 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.680
 images has a very special trip and 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.390
 very cool so one thing advice that 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.190
 you fuck is and if you want the two then 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.270
 you can do it twice so nothing
