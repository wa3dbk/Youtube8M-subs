some<00:02:02.600> very<00:02:03.380> cool<00:02:03.590> developer<00:02:04.100> and<00:02:04.280> this<00:02:04.790> guy

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
some very cool developer and this guy

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.940 
some very cool developer and this guy
you<00:02:05.060> know<00:02:05.360> it's<00:02:05.630> been<00:02:05.780> improving<00:02:06.410> this<00:02:06.560> across

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
you know it's been improving this across

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.350 
you know it's been improving this across
from<00:02:07.160> me<00:02:07.280> when<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.460> kind<00:02:07.640> of<00:02:07.700> using<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.090> it<00:02:08.239> was

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
from me when I kind of using it it was

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270 
from me when I kind of using it it was
crashing<00:02:08.750> motor<00:02:08.899> desires<00:02:09.289> which<00:02:10.129> was

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
crashing motor desires which was

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.540 
crashing motor desires which was
unfortunate<00:02:10.819> and<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:12.410> wasn't<00:02:12.860> really<00:02:13.430> working

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
unfortunate and it wasn't really working

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.090 
unfortunate and it wasn't really working
well

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
well

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.080 
well
now<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:15.470> does<00:02:16.470> stay<00:02:16.830> if<00:02:17.100> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.580> enable<00:02:17.820> it<00:02:18.060> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
now it does stay if you can enable it to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.030 
now it does stay if you can enable it to
stay<00:02:18.450> for<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> few<00:02:18.930> minutes<00:02:19.260> in<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> background

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
stay for a few minutes in the background

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.250 
stay for a few minutes in the background
so<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:20.820> happens<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.300> when<00:02:21.540> you<00:02:21.630> keep<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.170> in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
so what happens is when you keep it in

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.050 
so what happens is when you keep it in
the<00:02:22.320> background<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.010> copy<00:02:23.280> things<00:02:23.760> on

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the background and you copy things on

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.300 
the background and you copy things on
the<00:02:24.180> iPad<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:25.140> saves<00:02:25.470> their<00:02:25.680> other<00:02:25.830> body<00:02:26.040> me<00:02:26.190> to

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the iPad it saves their other body me to

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
the iPad it saves their other body me to
do<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.000> know<00:02:27.120> clip<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:27.480> history<00:02:27.840> people

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
do this you know clip or history people

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.680 
do this you know clip or history people
physically<00:02:28.920> poor<00:02:29.100> history<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.610> then<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.540> can

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
physically poor history and then you can

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.460 
physically poor history and then you can
face<00:02:30.930> from<00:02:31.230> there<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.160> this<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:32.850> helps<00:02:33.300> me

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
face from there so this really helps me

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.990 
face from there so this really helps me
when<00:02:34.470> I'm<00:02:34.590> filling<00:02:34.950> out<00:02:35.070> something<00:02:35.520> or<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:35.970> I

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
when I'm filling out something or when I

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.850 
when I'm filling out something or when I
just<00:02:36.240> copied<00:02:36.540> several<00:02:36.930> things<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.740> this

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
just copied several things so this

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.270 
just copied several things so this
really<00:02:37.950> helps<00:02:38.280> out<00:02:38.400> but<00:02:39.180> still<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.720> doesn't<00:02:40.280> it

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
really helps out but still it doesn't it

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.610 
really helps out but still it doesn't it
doesn't<00:02:41.430> help<00:02:42.270> me<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:42.630> pasting<00:02:43.200> many<00:02:43.380> things

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
doesn't help me with pasting many things

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.990 
doesn't help me with pasting many things

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
out a good way I suddenly don't think

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.820 
out a good way I suddenly don't think
I'm<00:03:53.610> going<00:03:53.850> to<00:03:53.970> see<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.360> coming<00:03:55.260> anytime

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
I'm going to see that coming anytime

I'm going to see that coming anytime
soon<00:03:56.450> yeah<00:03:57.920> anyway<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.190> guys<00:03:59.520> I<00:03:59.760> mean<00:03:59.970> Tribble

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
soon yeah anyway so guys I mean Tribble

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.440 
soon yeah anyway so guys I mean Tribble
history<00:04:00.810> application<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:01.560> recommended<00:04:02.130> it

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
history application we recommended it

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.880 
history application we recommended it
solves<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.810> problem<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.380> copying<00:04:04.770> and

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
solves the problem of copying and

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.010 
solves the problem of copying and
pasting<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.940> other<00:04:06.060> thing<00:04:06.300> about<00:04:06.330> the<00:04:06.750> eye-fi

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
pasting the other thing about the eye-fi

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.230 
pasting the other thing about the eye-fi
also<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.710> the<00:04:07.830> item<00:04:08.130> as<00:04:08.250> well<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.910> fact

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
also and the item as well is the fact

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.750 
also and the item as well is the fact
that<00:04:09.390> sometimes<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.080> 2d<00:04:10.350> very<00:04:11.160> hard<00:04:11.430> to<00:04:11.550> check

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
that sometimes the 2d very hard to check

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.690 
that sometimes the 2d very hard to check
something<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.960> my<00:04:13.500> tip<00:04:13.560> is<00:04:13.920> that<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.460> have<00:04:14.550> to

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
something so my tip is that you have to

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.000 
something so my tip is that you have to
zoom<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.180> lot<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.600> pinch<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.020> zoom<00:04:16.080> a<00:04:16.260> lot<00:04:16.500> to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
zoom a lot to pinch and zoom a lot to

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.660 
zoom a lot to pinch and zoom a lot to
select<00:04:17.310> something<00:04:17.520> very<00:04:18.090> often<00:04:18.770> and<00:04:19.770> this<00:04:20.549> is

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
select something very often and this is

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.280 
select something very often and this is
to<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.940> chromatic<00:04:21.570> so<00:04:21.690> for<00:04:21.810> example<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:22.140> there

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
to of chromatic so for example if there

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.230 
to of chromatic so for example if there
is<00:04:22.380> text<00:04:22.740> box<00:04:22.979> on<00:04:23.220> the<00:04:23.310> website<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.000> you<00:04:24.090> want

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
is text box on the website and you want

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.940 
is text box on the website and you want
to<00:04:24.330> select<00:04:24.479> what<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.840> text<00:04:25.290> box<00:04:25.470> it's<00:04:25.680> really

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
to select what the text box it's really

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.610 
to select what the text box it's really
hard<00:04:26.160> for<00:04:26.400> some<00:04:27.150> reason

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
hard for some reason

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.060 
hard for some reason
it<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> safari<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.510> on<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:29.690> iOS<00:04:30.080> I<00:04:30.530> will

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
it is a safari on the on the iOS I will

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.280 
it is a safari on the on the iOS I will
select<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.550> hope<00:04:31.699> xbox<00:04:32.180> instead<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.810> text

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
select the hope xbox instead of the text

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.469 
select the hope xbox instead of the text
is<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.530> text<00:04:33.710> box<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.760> things<00:04:35.300> like<00:04:35.449> that

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
is the text box there things like that

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.629 
is the text box there things like that
that<00:04:35.840> still<00:04:36.110> make<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.590> bit<00:04:36.740> clunky<00:04:37.010> copying

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
that still make it a bit clunky copying

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.850 
that still make it a bit clunky copying
pasting<00:04:37.790> and<00:04:38.090> typing<00:04:38.449> on<00:04:38.540> the<00:04:38.660> iPad<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.830> I

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
pasting and typing on the iPad so I

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.340 
pasting and typing on the iPad so I
think<00:04:40.250> this<00:04:40.340> acting<00:04:40.729> thing<00:04:40.840> will<00:04:41.840> be<00:04:41.990> solved

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
think this acting thing will be solved

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.680 
think this acting thing will be solved
the<00:04:42.800> copying<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.280> pasting<00:04:43.370> well<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.510> should

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
the copying and pasting well it should

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.240 
the copying and pasting well it should
dissolve<00:04:44.900> with<00:04:45.080> third-party<00:04:45.530> app<00:04:45.650> for<00:04:46.130> now

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
dissolve with third-party app for now

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.030 
dissolve with third-party app for now
but<00:04:46.850> if<00:04:47.030> you<00:04:47.180> know<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.570> better<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.080> if

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
but if you know it's better and if

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.620 
but if you know it's better and if
you've<00:04:49.280> been<00:04:49.310> missing<00:04:49.850> copying<00:04:50.419> and<00:04:50.510> pasting

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
you've been missing copying and pasting

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.900 
you've been missing copying and pasting
on<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.500> iPads<00:04:51.889> I<00:04:52.100> mean<00:04:52.340> with<00:04:52.639> a<00:04:52.669> bigger

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
on the iPads I mean with a bigger

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.490 
on the iPads I mean with a bigger
keyboard<00:04:53.120> because<00:04:53.660> you've<00:04:53.930> been<00:04:53.960> using<00:04:54.260> some

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
keyboard because you've been using some

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.159 
keyboard because you've been using some
app<00:04:54.680> to<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.370> little<00:04:55.639> de<00:04:55.729> max<00:04:56.050> there<00:04:57.050> is<00:04:57.139> a

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
app to the little de max there is a

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.290 
app to the little de max there is a
solution<00:04:57.290> for<00:04:57.590> that<00:04:57.650> kind<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:58.729> the<00:04:58.790> on

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
solution for that kind of on the on

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.719 
solution for that kind of on the on
there<00:04:59.540> I<00:05:00.550> yeah<00:05:01.550> and<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.789> will<00:05:01.970> be<00:05:02.150> cool<00:05:02.570> that

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
there I yeah and it will be cool that

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.850 
there I yeah and it will be cool that
applications<00:05:04.729> like<00:05:05.150> labor<00:05:05.630> history

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
applications like labor history

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.219 
applications like labor history
eventually<00:05:06.860> come<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.630> synchronized<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.810> iCloud

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
eventually come a synchronized to iCloud

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.770 
eventually come a synchronized to iCloud
and<00:05:09.470> then<00:05:09.830> you<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.699> have<00:05:10.940> all<00:05:11.240> those<00:05:11.449> copy

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
and then you can have all those copy

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.219 
and then you can have all those copy
pasted<00:05:12.110> across<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.970> old<00:05:14.150> devices<00:05:14.449> we<00:05:14.870> will<00:05:15.080> be

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
pasted across the old devices we will be

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.860 
pasted across the old devices we will be
fantastic<00:05:15.560> to<00:05:16.250> really<00:05:16.760> be<00:05:17.240> able<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:17.479> copy

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
fantastic to really be able to copy

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.390 
fantastic to really be able to copy
something<00:05:18.260> on<00:05:18.500> the<00:05:18.590> ipad<00:05:18.919> mini<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.250> then

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
something on the ipad mini and then

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.150 
something on the ipad mini and then
paste<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.090> in<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.330> iphone<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:21.350> will<00:05:21.650> make<00:05:21.889> it

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
paste it in the iphone that will make it

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.779

for<00:05:22.520> me<00:05:22.729> a<00:05:22.970> dream<00:05:23.560> application<00:05:24.560> I<00:05:24.740> mean<00:05:25.669> this

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
for me a dream application I mean this

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:27.580 
for me a dream application I mean this
creep<00:05:26.240> or<00:05:26.389> history<00:05:26.690> application<00:05:27.169> is<00:05:27.289> already

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
creep or history application is already

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.340 
creep or history application is already
getting<00:05:27.860> various<00:05:28.340> as<00:05:28.550> an<00:05:28.669> iCloud<00:05:29.000> think<00:05:29.389> but<00:05:30.110> I

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
getting various as an iCloud think but I

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.050 
getting various as an iCloud think but I
think<00:05:30.440> when<00:05:30.889> I<00:05:30.919> enabled<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.430> is<00:05:31.550> crash<00:05:31.820> too

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
think when I enabled it is crash too

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.050 
think when I enabled it is crash too
much<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.870> I'm<00:05:33.830> sure<00:05:34.039> it's<00:05:34.550> going<00:05:34.669> to<00:05:34.729> be<00:05:34.849> better

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
much so I'm sure it's going to be better

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.760 
much so I'm sure it's going to be better
so<00:05:35.389> this<00:05:35.660> thing<00:05:35.870> this<00:05:36.020> thing<00:05:36.080> also<00:05:36.349> is<00:05:36.470> coming

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
so this thing this thing also is coming

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:42.010 
so this thing this thing also is coming
through<00:05:36.889> this<00:05:37.039> out<00:05:37.220> alright<00:05:39.280> well<00:05:40.780> and<00:05:41.780> this

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
through this out alright well and this

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.839 
through this out alright well and this
is<00:05:42.260> how<00:05:42.620> far<00:05:42.919> we<00:05:43.160> are<00:05:43.190> going<00:05:43.430> to<00:05:43.520> take<00:05:43.669> this
