amps<00:00:33.180> we've<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:34.290> original<00:00:34.860> blue<00:00:35.730> verb

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
amps we've got the original blue verb

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.479 
amps we've got the original blue verb
which<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> sort<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> derivative<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.370> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
which is a sort of a derivative of a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.400 
which is a sort of a derivative of a
super<00:00:39.030> reverb<00:00:39.210> style<00:00:39.750> amp<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.230> some

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
super reverb style amp with some

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.369 
super reverb style amp with some
upgrades<00:00:40.860> controls<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.480> gain<00:00:42.719> stages

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
upgrades controls on on the gain stages

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.720 
upgrades controls on on the gain stages
it's<00:00:43.649> got<00:00:43.829> its<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.399> reverb<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.300> vibrato<00:00:46.730> sort

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
it's got its got reverb and vibrato sort

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.700 
it's got its got reverb and vibrato sort
of<00:00:47.820> flowing<00:00:48.149> from<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.200> new<00:00:49.350> blue

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
of flowing from that is the new blue

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.160 
of flowing from that is the new blue
drive<00:00:50.039> amp<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> bottom<00:00:51.090> here<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.480> that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
drive amp on the bottom here and that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.650 
drive amp on the bottom here and that
trades<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> vibrato<00:00:53.699> tubes<00:00:54.180> for<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
trades one of the vibrato tubes for a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.240 
trades one of the vibrato tubes for a
preamp<00:00:55.140> tube<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.530> it's<00:00:55.680> got<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> little<00:00:56.039> bit

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
preamp tube so it's got a little bit

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.349 
preamp tube so it's got a little bit
juicier<00:00:57.530> preamp<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.890> got<00:00:59.039> some<00:00:59.359> sustained

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
juicier preamp it's got some sustained

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.869 
juicier preamp it's got some sustained
in<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.600> preamp<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.350> some<00:01:01.530> harmonic<00:01:02.430> content

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
in the preamp and some harmonic content

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.429 
in the preamp and some harmonic content
that's<00:01:03.090> difficult<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.840> without<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.170> full

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
that's difficult to get without a full

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.000 
that's difficult to get without a full
3-2<00:01:04.890> preamp<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.720> I'm<00:01:06.720> debuting<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.500> brand<00:01:07.799> new

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
3-2 preamp and I'm debuting a brand new

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.570 
3-2 preamp and I'm debuting a brand new
dual<00:01:08.460> Drive<00:01:08.820> which<00:01:09.150> says<00:01:09.420> blue<00:01:09.750> verb<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.260> it

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
dual Drive which says blue verb on it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.250 
dual Drive which says blue verb on it
but<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.090> sort<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.689> prototype

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
but it's a it's sort of a prototype

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.320 
but it's a it's sort of a prototype
faceplate<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.010> DiMeo<00:01:14.460> labeling<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
faceplate with DiMeo labeling and this

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.450 
faceplate with DiMeo labeling and this
is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.540> two<00:01:15.840> channel<00:01:16.110> amp<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.250> got<00:01:17.430> a

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
is a two channel amp it's got a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.060 
is a two channel amp it's got a
dedicated<00:01:18.409> overdrive<00:01:19.409> channel<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
dedicated overdrive channel and a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.010 
dedicated overdrive channel and a
dedicated<00:01:20.610> clean<00:01:21.060> channel<00:01:21.420> that's<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.900> is

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
dedicated clean channel that's that is

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.020 
dedicated clean channel that's that is
switched<00:01:22.259> externally<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.070> each<00:01:23.340> channel<00:01:23.850> has

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
switched externally so each channel has

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.560 
switched externally so each channel has
its<00:01:24.060> own<00:01:24.420> input<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.799> got<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.850> D<00:01:27.240> style

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
its own input and it's got a a D style

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.230 
its own input and it's got a a D style
buffered<00:01:28.229> effects<00:01:28.590> loop<00:01:28.860> built<00:01:29.700> in<00:01:29.880> coming

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
buffered effects loop built in coming

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.749 
buffered effects loop built in coming
out<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> back<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.369> let<00:01:32.369> me<00:01:32.400> take<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.729> for

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
out of the back and let me take you for

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:54.960 
out of the back and let me take you for
a<00:01:32.970> ride<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.600> for<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:34.020> bit

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.630 

so<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:56.050> know<00:01:56.110> your<00:01:56.290> little<00:01:56.560> juicier<00:01:57.160> sort<00:01:57.550> of

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
so you know your little juicier sort of

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.420 
so you know your little juicier sort of
think<00:01:57.850> 59<00:01:58.390> bassman<00:01:58.690> meets<00:01:59.200> super<00:01:59.620> reverb<00:01:59.830> kind

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
think 59 bassman meets super reverb kind

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.370 
think 59 bassman meets super reverb kind
of<00:02:00.580> clean<00:02:00.850> sound<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.450> then<00:02:01.870> we<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.170> the

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
of clean sound and then we have the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.370 
of clean sound and then we have the
dedicated<00:02:02.890> overdrive<00:02:03.820> channel<00:02:04.570> which<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.170> a

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
dedicated overdrive channel which is a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.320 
dedicated overdrive channel which is a
flavor<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:05.980> you'll<00:02:06.310> recognize<00:02:06.550> but<00:02:07.210> it's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
flavor that you'll recognize but it's

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:37.800 
flavor that you'll recognize but it's
got<00:02:07.480> a<00:02:07.510> little<00:02:07.810> bit<00:02:07.930> different<00:02:08.970> dynamics

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.180 

and<00:02:38.810> just<00:02:39.320> so<00:02:39.470> we<00:02:39.620> know<00:02:39.650> what<00:02:39.770> we're<00:02:40.040> dealing

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
and just so we know what we're dealing

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.830 
and just so we know what we're dealing
with<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:40.490> talk<00:02:40.850> about<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.210> guitar<00:02:41.360> real

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
with here talk about your guitar real

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.660 
with here talk about your guitar real
fast<00:02:42.080> so<00:02:42.170> people<00:02:42.470> know<00:02:42.590> what<00:02:43.040> kind<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.280> pickups

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
fast so people know what kind of pickups
