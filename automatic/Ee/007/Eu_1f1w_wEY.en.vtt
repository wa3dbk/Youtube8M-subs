go ahead and take it out here it's

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.590 
go ahead and take it out here it's
actually<00:00:32.690> it's<00:00:33.690> actually<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.200> its<00:00:34.350> own<00:00:34.559> little

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
actually it's actually in its own little

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.510 
actually it's actually in its own little
box<00:00:36.600> which<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.170> pretty<00:00:37.380> cool<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.100> does<00:00:38.250> say

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
box which is pretty cool and it does say

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.100 
box which is pretty cool and it does say
green<00:00:38.850> laser<00:00:39.090> pointer<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.660> top<00:00:39.870> so<00:00:40.020> I'm

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
green laser pointer on the top so I'm

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.110 
green laser pointer on the top so I'm
actually<00:00:40.290> hoping<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.820> green

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
actually hoping that it's not green

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.049 
actually hoping that it's not green
because<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> already<00:00:42.809> own<00:00:42.930> one<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.140> those<00:00:44.059> so

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
because I already own one of those so

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.610 
because I already own one of those so
we'll<00:00:45.149> have<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.420> check<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.809> once<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> get

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
we'll have to check that out once I get

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.840 
we'll have to check that out once I get
into<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.280> yeah<00:00:49.100> let's<00:00:50.100> go<00:00:50.370> ahead<00:00:50.489> take<00:00:50.820> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
into it but yeah let's go ahead take it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.290 
into it but yeah let's go ahead take it
a<00:00:51.090> open<00:00:51.510> box<00:00:51.840> here<00:00:52.289> so<00:00:52.440> what<00:00:53.399> it<00:00:53.550> comes<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
a open box here so what it comes with is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.510 
a open box here so what it comes with is
the<00:00:54.690> laser<00:00:54.870> itself<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.949> wrist<00:00:56.250> strap<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
the laser itself with a wrist strap a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
the laser itself with a wrist strap a
battery<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.789> a<00:01:00.629> charger

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
battery and a charger

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.369 
battery and a charger
now<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:02.760> particular<00:01:02.969> laser<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.899> pretty<00:01:04.260> much

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
now this particular laser is pretty much

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.760 
now this particular laser is pretty much
the<00:01:04.589> exact<00:01:04.920> same<00:01:05.040> design<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:06.260> basically<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the exact same design and basically the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.090 
the exact same design and basically the
exact<00:01:08.280> same<00:01:08.520> model<00:01:08.820> as<00:01:09.090> my<00:01:09.479> green<00:01:09.750> laser<00:01:10.100> that

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
exact same model as my green laser that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.600 
exact same model as my green laser that
I<00:01:11.159> unboxed<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.909> week<00:01:12.150> ago<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.430> also

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
I unboxed about a week ago and it also

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.149 
I unboxed about a week ago and it also
takes<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> same<00:01:15.450> exact<00:01:15.810> battery<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.920> let's<00:01:17.070> go

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
takes the same exact battery so let's go

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.469 
takes the same exact battery so let's go
ahead<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.310> get<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.270> box

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
ahead and get all of this out of the box

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
ahead and get all of this out of the box
real<00:01:18.869> quick<00:01:23.990> alright<00:01:26.780> okay<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:27.950> here<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
real quick alright okay so here is the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219 
real quick alright okay so here is the
laser<00:01:29.400> itself<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.990> looks

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
laser itself as you can see it looks

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.319 
laser itself as you can see it looks
pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.530> identical<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.369> my<00:01:32.520> green<00:01:33.090> laser

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
pretty much identical to my green laser

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.710 
pretty much identical to my green laser
like<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> said<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.720> focusable

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
like I said and it also is a focusable

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.980 
like I said and it also is a focusable
so<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.200> still<00:01:37.409> has<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.420> spinning<00:01:39.420> wheel<00:01:39.659> on

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
so it still has the spinning wheel on

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.270 
so it still has the spinning wheel on
the<00:01:40.140> front<00:01:40.170> side<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:42.590> focus<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.070> beam

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the front side so you can focus the beam

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.030 
the front side so you can focus the beam
depending<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.149> how<00:01:45.420> strong<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.710> want<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.950> to

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
depending on how strong you want it to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.210 
depending on how strong you want it to
be<00:01:47.159> essentially<00:01:48.590> let's<00:01:49.590> get<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> charger<00:01:50.189> out

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
be essentially let's get the charger out

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
be essentially let's get the charger out
it's<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> little<00:01:50.579> bag<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:53.689> okay<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.770> is

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
it's a little bag here okay and this is

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.620 
it's a little bag here okay and this is
the<00:01:56.009> exact<00:01:56.369> same<00:01:56.579> charger<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.360> came<00:01:57.570> with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the exact same charger that came with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.760 
the exact same charger that came with
the<00:01:58.520> green<00:01:59.520> laser<00:01:59.790> pointer<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.200> uses

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the green laser pointer because it uses

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.429 
the green laser pointer because it uses
the<00:02:01.950> exact<00:02:02.430> same<00:02:02.520> battery<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.360> voltage<00:02:04.259> as

can<00:02:29.400> also<00:02:29.490> get<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> battery<00:02:30.330> in<00:02:30.570> one

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
can also get this battery in one

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.680 
can also get this battery in one
thousand<00:02:31.320> milliamp<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.860> well<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:33.420> you<00:02:33.510> will

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
thousand milliamp as well but you will

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.470 
thousand milliamp as well but you will
not<00:02:33.810> get<00:02:34.110> the<00:02:34.290> same<00:02:34.620> power<00:02:35.070> output<00:02:35.400> as<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
not get the same power output as you

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.420 
not get the same power output as you
would<00:02:36.660> with<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:36.990> twelve<00:02:37.230> hundred<00:02:37.350> million<00:02:37.890> so

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
would with the twelve hundred million so

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.550 
would with the twelve hundred million so
I<00:02:38.460> recommend<00:02:39.000> actually<00:02:39.390> getting<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:40.350> Co

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
I recommend actually getting the Co

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.410 
I recommend actually getting the Co
hundred<00:02:40.920> rather<00:02:41.370> than<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:42.210> thousand<00:02:42.980> so

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
hundred rather than the one thousand so

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.720 
hundred rather than the one thousand so
let's<00:02:45.420> go<00:02:45.600> ahead<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:46.280> it's<00:02:47.280> not<00:02:47.460> want<00:02:47.640> to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
let's go ahead and it's not want to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.120 
let's go ahead and it's not want to
focus<00:02:47.910> again<00:02:48.300> there<00:02:48.570> we<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.720> okay<00:02:49.380> I'll<00:02:49.980> put

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
focus again there we go okay I'll put

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.850 
focus again there we go okay I'll put
the<00:02:50.250> battery<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.900> if<00:02:52.110> this<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.320> a<00:02:52.680> blue

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
the battery in and see if this is a blue

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.400 
the battery in and see if this is a blue
laser<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.220> could<00:02:53.430> hopefully<00:02:53.940> from<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.510> label

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
laser I could hopefully from this label

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.130 
laser I could hopefully from this label
here<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.710> said<00:02:56.430> it's<00:02:56.610> blue<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.480> don't<00:02:58.050> know

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
here it said it's blue but I don't know

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.540 
here it said it's blue but I don't know
so<00:02:58.440> let's<00:02:58.590> go<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.770> put<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.010> battery<00:02:59.280> in<00:02:59.430> and

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
so let's go and put the battery in and

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:10.850 
so let's go and put the battery in and
check<00:02:59.730> it<00:02:59.850> out<00:02:59.940> okay<00:03:08.150> alright<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.620> okay<00:03:10.620> we

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
check it out okay alright and okay we

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.410 
check it out okay alright and okay we
are<00:03:11.070> good<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.850> purple<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:14.280> camera<00:03:15.210> it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
are good so it is purple on camera it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.450 
are good so it is purple on camera it
will<00:03:15.660> seem<00:03:16.020> to<00:03:16.170> be<00:03:16.260> much<00:03:16.530> brighter<00:03:16.830> than<00:03:17.070> in

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
will seem to be much brighter than in

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.840 
will seem to be much brighter than in
person<00:03:18.080> because<00:03:19.080> our<00:03:19.650> eyes<00:03:19.980> can't<00:03:20.580> actually

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
person because our eyes can't actually

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.780 
person because our eyes can't actually
pick<00:03:21.330> up<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.750> wavelength<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:23.580> this

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
pick up the wavelength that this

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.500 
pick up the wavelength that this
particular<00:03:24.120> laser<00:03:24.660> gives<00:03:25.050> off<00:03:25.260> I<00:03:26.510> believe

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
particular laser gives off I believe

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.080 
particular laser gives off I believe
that<00:03:27.720> the<00:03:28.260> wavelength<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.950> infrared<00:03:29.580> so

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
that the wavelength is infrared so

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.630 
that the wavelength is infrared so
that's<00:03:30.540> why<00:03:30.720> in<00:03:31.410> person<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.100> particular

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
that's why in person this particular

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.630 
that's why in person this particular
color<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.150> laser<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.690> not<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:34.320> bright<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.340> the

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
color of laser is not as bright as the

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.120 
color of laser is not as bright as the
green<00:03:35.850> one<00:03:36.000> so<00:03:36.990> I'm<00:03:37.560> going<00:03:37.710> to<00:03:37.740> bring<00:03:37.860> in<00:03:38.040> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
green one so I'm going to bring in the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.800 
green one so I'm going to bring in the
green<00:03:38.310> laser<00:03:38.520> here<00:03:38.880> as<00:03:39.000> you<00:03:39.210> can<00:03:39.270> tell<00:03:39.540> they

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
green laser here as you can tell they

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.800 
green laser here as you can tell they
are<00:03:39.840> pretty<00:03:40.290> much<00:03:40.410> identical<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:41.280> design<00:03:41.940> and

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
are pretty much identical in design and

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.880 
are pretty much identical in design and
size<00:03:43.200> both<00:03:43.950> have<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.340> adjustable<00:03:44.970> focus<00:03:45.890> and

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
size both have the adjustable focus and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.590 
size both have the adjustable focus and
they<00:03:47.130> both<00:03:47.280> use<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.520> same<00:03:47.670> battery<00:03:48.330> and

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
they both use the same battery and

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.450 
they both use the same battery and
voltage<00:03:49.280> um<00:03:51.110> but<00:03:52.110> as<00:03:52.770> you<00:03:52.860> can<00:03:52.950> see<00:03:53.010> there's

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
voltage um but as you can see there's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.340 
voltage um but as you can see there's
the<00:03:53.700> green<00:03:53.730> laser<00:03:54.210> and<00:03:54.450> as<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.570> can<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.140> is

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
the green laser and as you can see it is

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.980 
the green laser and as you can see it is
way<00:03:55.770> brighter<00:03:56.250> than<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.330> purple<00:03:57.690> one<00:03:57.810> was

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
way brighter than the purple one was

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.780 
way brighter than the purple one was
because<00:03:58.170> like<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.620> said<00:03:58.680> our<00:03:59.070> eyes<00:03:59.250> just<00:03:59.520> can't

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
because like I said our eyes just can't

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.270 
because like I said our eyes just can't
pick<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.210> the<00:04:00.600> light<00:04:01.230> wavelength<00:04:01.800> of<00:04:02.010> the

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
pick up the light wavelength of the

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.190 
pick up the light wavelength of the
purple<00:04:02.670> infrared<00:04:03.240> laser<00:04:04.400> so<00:04:05.720> some<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.960> may

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
purple infrared laser so some of you may

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.090 
purple infrared laser so some of you may
not<00:04:07.770> like<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.490> uh<00:04:09.470> I<00:04:10.470> know<00:04:10.620> there's<00:04:10.890> some

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
not like that uh I know there's some

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.010 
not like that uh I know there's some
people<00:04:11.400> out<00:04:11.640> there<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:11.910> might<00:04:12.810> have

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
people out there that might have

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.840 
people out there that might have
expected<00:04:13.680> this<00:04:13.800> laser<00:04:14.040> to<00:04:14.220> be<00:04:14.340> brighter<00:04:14.610> than

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
expected this laser to be brighter than

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.470 
expected this laser to be brighter than
what<00:04:15.060> it<00:04:15.180> is<00:04:15.210> but<00:04:15.980> um<00:04:17.120> yeah<00:04:18.120> that's<00:04:18.330> just

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
what it is but um yeah that's just

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.670 
what it is but um yeah that's just
pretty<00:04:18.750> much<00:04:18.960> it<00:04:20.120> now<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.900> did<00:04:22.229> say<00:04:22.650> that

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
pretty much it now they did say that

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.580 
pretty much it now they did say that
this<00:04:23.070> particular<00:04:23.250> laser<00:04:23.790> can

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
this particular laser can

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.780 
this particular laser can
but<00:04:24.710> balloons<00:04:25.100> so<00:04:25.370> I'm<00:04:25.490> going<00:04:25.639> to<00:04:25.669> actually

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
but balloons so I'm going to actually

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.930 
but balloons so I'm going to actually
test<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.540> right<00:04:26.750> now<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:28.340> only<00:04:28.430> balloons<00:04:28.790> I

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
test that right now the only balloons I

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.659 
test that right now the only balloons I
have<00:04:29.150> or<00:04:29.389> green<00:04:29.930> water<00:04:30.350> balloons<00:04:30.710> so<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.430> have

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
have or green water balloons so I have

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:34.330 
have or green water balloons so I have
to<00:04:31.850> put<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.300> little<00:04:32.480> dark<00:04:32.720> spot<00:04:33.050> on<00:04:33.229> it<00:04:33.380> but

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
to put a little dark spot on it but

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.340 
to put a little dark spot on it but
let's<00:04:34.520> go<00:04:34.669> ahead<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.240> see<00:04:36.169> if<00:04:36.470> it<00:04:36.710> will<00:04:36.860> pop<00:04:37.130> it

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.070 

and<00:04:42.350> there<00:04:43.130> you<00:04:43.220> go<00:04:43.340> so<00:04:43.669> it<00:04:44.000> they<00:04:44.300> were<00:04:44.360> true<00:04:44.900> on

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and there you go so it they were true on

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.500 
and there you go so it they were true on
that<00:04:45.290> so<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.740> can<00:04:45.949> pop<00:04:46.250> balloons<00:04:46.639> which<00:04:47.389> is

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
that so it can pop balloons which is

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.689 
that so it can pop balloons which is
nice<00:04:47.830> but<00:04:48.830> you<00:04:48.889> want<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.130> make<00:04:49.220> sure<00:04:49.250> that<00:04:49.580> the

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
nice but you want to make sure that the

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.560 
nice but you want to make sure that the
focus<00:04:50.150> point<00:04:50.449> is<00:04:50.750> in<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.470> tight<00:04:52.240> beam<00:04:53.240> rather

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
focus point is in the tight beam rather

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.640 
focus point is in the tight beam rather
than<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.990> unfocused<00:04:54.860> beam<00:04:55.389> um<00:04:56.440> same<00:04:57.440> thing

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
than the unfocused beam um same thing

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.500 
than the unfocused beam um same thing
goes<00:04:57.800> for<00:04:57.830> my<00:04:58.100> green<00:04:58.310> laser<00:04:58.550> if<00:04:59.060> you<00:04:59.210> happen<00:04:59.479> to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:04:59.510 
goes for my green laser if you happen to

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.990 
goes for my green laser if you happen to
get<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.780> green<00:04:59.960> laser<00:05:00.139> on<00:05:00.410> line<00:05:01.100> as<00:05:01.250> well<00:05:01.460> it

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
get the green laser on line as well it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.909 
get the green laser on line as well it
should<00:05:02.300> also<00:05:02.479> be<00:05:02.810> able<00:05:02.870> to<00:05:03.020> pop<00:05:03.229> balloon<00:05:03.560> so

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919
