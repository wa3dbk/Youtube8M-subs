like the metal that he rides aren't just
a<00:01:58.110> little<00:01:58.320> bit<00:01:58.439> better

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
a little bit better

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.860 
a little bit better
because<00:02:01.110> it's<00:02:01.260> not<00:02:01.470> just<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:01.890> simple<00:02:02.220> and<00:02:02.870> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
because it's not just so simple and the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.890 
because it's not just so simple and the
headpiece<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.620> the<00:02:04.800> same<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.540> notice

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
headpiece is the same and you notice

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.710 
headpiece is the same and you notice
that<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.200> not<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.850> turn<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.210> you<00:02:09.330> can<00:02:09.540> see

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
that or not but we turn it you can see

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.200 
that or not but we turn it you can see
it's<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.110> same<00:02:10.320> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> back<00:02:10.740> also<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.460> they

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
it's the same on the back also and they

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's the same on the back also and they
do<00:02:12.360> both<00:02:12.600> have<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> little<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.380> of<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.590> crescent

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
do both have a little bit of a crescent

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.150 
do both have a little bit of a crescent
so<00:02:14.730> I'll<00:02:14.970> take<00:02:15.180> their<00:02:15.390> tapes<00:02:16.200> off<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.860> can

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so I'll take their tapes off so you can

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:26.060 
so I'll take their tapes off so you can
see<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:24.020> there's<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.230> back<00:02:25.440> pressing<00:02:25.800> on

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
see that there's the back pressing on

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.840 
see that there's the back pressing on
both<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.490> them

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
both of them

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.910 
both of them
like<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> said<00:02:27.660> both<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.230> think<00:02:28.590> they're<00:02:28.770> really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
