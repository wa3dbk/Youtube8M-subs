00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
solteira by Okuma it's a lever drag reel

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
solteira by Okuma it's a lever drag reel
which<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.290> really<00:00:40.770> nice<00:00:40.920> because<00:00:41.160> it's<00:00:41.430> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
which is really nice because it's a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.110 
which is really nice because it's a
bigger<00:00:41.790> stronger<00:00:42.800> smoother<00:00:43.800> drag<00:00:44.100> surface<00:00:44.670> if

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
bigger stronger smoother drag surface if

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.670 
bigger stronger smoother drag surface if
I<00:00:45.300> get<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:46.079> big<00:00:46.230> fish<00:00:46.410> something

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680

that<00:00:46.829> goes<00:00:46.920> down<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.730> reel<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.600> two-speed

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
that goes down this reel is a two-speed

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.869
