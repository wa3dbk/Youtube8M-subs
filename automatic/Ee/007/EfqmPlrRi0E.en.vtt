00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 that was awesome true there falls that 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:11.179
 the security capabilities of an evil 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:13.830
 in himself this this angel he surely 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 in our work goes with angels 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 25 years and I can tell you that there were 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.830
 a war on a spiritual level that are 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.990
 protecting the planet and that people do not 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.070
 he realizes he needs good angels 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.470
 and bad 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
 it is justly we can after 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.910
 talk about it is very important that the 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.100
 people have an idea of what they are talking about and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.030
 the fallen as we know they are an angel and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.520
 a light a little ray look at either one of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.550
 the ways of your identify when they are 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.920
 for example angels who are spirits 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.680
 superiors and when they are inferior 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.140
 even when they are souls 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.030
 let's say they are there has 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.700
 involved 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.790
 by tone by color by brightness 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.580
 when it looked something that is 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.060
 negative the color of it is very gray 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:10.800
 he does not have this light he does not save you what 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.619
 that opaque and between gray 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.690
 likewise cross to yellow to a tone 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.260
 quite dark as when one sees one 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.240
 shadow with a shadow in opaque spectrum 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.610
 that does not allow light not own 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 Andalusia there are those who come with a 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 very special shine 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.479
 I also usually manifests 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 this way with the room because we 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.119
 we will know that this manifestation of wings 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.729
 to represent the being let's say light 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 divine and to show the speed and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.470
 energy with that moves and there 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.350
 surely in a protection of the planet 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.050
 to the region that was for something that 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.420
 could happen and obviously that in some 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.680
 moment that space also guides and it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.560
 Refrigerate immediately 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 come back today he lives here like this in the moll yes 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.580
 the evil was closed
