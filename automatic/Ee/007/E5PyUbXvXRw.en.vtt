00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.369 

okay<00:00:07.479> here's<00:00:07.779> the<00:00:07.960> setup<00:00:08.260> I'm<00:00:08.620> gonna<00:00:08.860> use<00:00:09.160> to

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
okay here's the setup I'm gonna use to

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.490 
okay here's the setup I'm gonna use to
run<00:00:11.379> my<00:00:11.559> wires<00:00:12.420> from<00:00:13.420> the<00:00:13.600> solar<00:00:13.840> panel<00:00:14.320> down

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
run my wires from the solar panel down

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:15.959 
run my wires from the solar panel down
now<00:00:14.770> the<00:00:14.830> solar<00:00:15.129> panel<00:00:15.520> is<00:00:15.580> going<00:00:15.730> to<00:00:15.789> have<00:00:15.940> a

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
now the solar panel is going to have a

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.120 
now the solar panel is going to have a
male<00:00:16.330> connector<00:00:17.050> like<00:00:17.380> this<00:00:17.560> and<00:00:17.770> a<00:00:17.800> couple

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
male connector like this and a couple

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.470 
male connector like this and a couple
feet<00:00:18.340> but<00:00:18.640> what<00:00:18.789> I'm<00:00:18.880> going<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.060> do<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:19.359> I'm

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.480 
feet but what I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.060 
feet but what I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:19.660> drill<00:00:19.869> a<00:00:19.900> hole<00:00:19.990> through<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.680> top<00:00:21.040> of

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
going to drill a hole through the top of

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.280 
going to drill a hole through the top of
the<00:00:21.250> trailer<00:00:21.640> I<00:00:21.850> know<00:00:22.510> a<00:00:22.540> lot<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.780> you<00:00:22.960> cringe

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
the trailer I know a lot of you cringe

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.529 
the trailer I know a lot of you cringe
when<00:00:23.530> you<00:00:24.010> hear<00:00:24.130> me<00:00:24.280> say<00:00:24.430> that<00:00:24.460> I<00:00:24.880> have<00:00:25.270> no

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
when you hear me say that I have no

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.570 
when you hear me say that I have no
problem<00:00:25.570> doing<00:00:25.900> it<00:00:26.140> but<00:00:26.710> I'm<00:00:26.800> going<00:00:26.950> to<00:00:27.039> use<00:00:27.100> so

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
problem doing it but I'm going to use so

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.160 
problem doing it but I'm going to use so
this<00:00:27.760> this<00:00:28.090> here<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.570> cable<00:00:28.869> I'm<00:00:28.960> going<00:00:29.110> to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
this this here is the cable I'm going to

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.230 
this this here is the cable I'm going to
use<00:00:29.289> it's<00:00:29.500> ten<00:00:29.740> three<00:00:29.950> cable<00:00:30.400> I've<00:00:31.000> measured

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
use it's ten three cable I've measured

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.850 
use it's ten three cable I've measured
it<00:00:31.480> out<00:00:31.570> I'm<00:00:31.720> going<00:00:31.840> to<00:00:31.900> need<00:00:32.020> about<00:00:32.140> 21<00:00:32.619> feet

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
it out I'm going to need about 21 feet

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.830 
it out I'm going to need about 21 feet
of<00:00:33.039> it<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:33.520> actually<00:00:34.180> when<00:00:34.449> you're<00:00:34.539> doing<00:00:34.719> your

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
of it so actually when you're doing your

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.779 
of it so actually when you're doing your
calculations<00:00:34.960> for<00:00:35.680> your<00:00:35.829> solar<00:00:36.100> for<00:00:36.579> your

00:00:36.779 --> 00:00:36.789 
calculations for your solar for your

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.069 
calculations for your solar for your
voltage<00:00:37.620> line<00:00:38.620> loss<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:40.329> I'll<00:00:40.420> have<00:00:40.569> 21<00:00:40.929> feet

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
voltage line loss so I'll have 21 feet

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.660 
voltage line loss so I'll have 21 feet
of<00:00:41.260> this<00:00:41.379> basically<00:00:41.890> I<00:00:41.920> have<00:00:42.039> to<00:00:42.190> double<00:00:42.370> that

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
of this basically I have to double that

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.840 
of this basically I have to double that
so<00:00:42.879> that<00:00:43.030> makes<00:00:43.449> it<00:00:43.629> 42<00:00:44.109> feet<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.649> I<00:00:45.399> figured

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
so that makes it 42 feet and I figured

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.700 
so that makes it 42 feet and I figured
all<00:00:45.940> that<00:00:46.149> in<00:00:46.300> my<00:00:46.479> calculations<00:00:47.170> to<00:00:47.350> keep<00:00:47.530> my

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
all that in my calculations to keep my

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.469 
all that in my calculations to keep my
voltage<00:00:48.249> drop<00:00:48.550> under<00:00:49.109> 3%<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.370> I've<00:00:51.850> got<00:00:52.030> 10<00:00:52.210> 3

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
voltage drop under 3% so I've got 10 3

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.479 
voltage drop under 3% so I've got 10 3
cable<00:00:52.929> so<00:00:53.319> one's<00:00:53.559> going<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.889> go<00:00:53.979> to<00:00:54.219> solar

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
cable so one's going to go to solar

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.000 
cable so one's going to go to solar
positive<00:00:55.089> 1/2<00:00:55.539> solar<00:00:55.780> negative<00:00:56.319> and<00:00:56.589> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
positive 1/2 solar negative and the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.110 
positive 1/2 solar negative and the
other<00:00:57.129> one<00:00:57.280> I'm<00:00:57.370> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.549> ground<00:00:57.789> to<00:00:57.999> the

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
other one I'm going to ground to the

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.079 
other one I'm going to ground to the
trailer<00:00:58.510> it's<00:00:59.379> it's<00:00:59.769> hooked<00:01:00.010> onto<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.519> frame

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
trailer it's it's hooked onto the frame

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.670 
trailer it's it's hooked onto the frame
of<00:01:01.359> the<00:01:02.069> solar<00:01:03.069> panels<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.690> this<00:01:04.839> 10<00:01:05.110> this<00:01:05.470> is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
of the solar panels so this 10 this is

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.149 
of the solar panels so this 10 this is
heavy-duty<00:01:05.950> cable<00:01:06.690> 10<00:01:07.690> 3<00:01:08.020> it's<00:01:08.560> 1/2<00:01:08.770> inch<00:01:09.039> in

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
heavy-duty cable 10 3 it's 1/2 inch in

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.920 
heavy-duty cable 10 3 it's 1/2 inch in
diameter<00:01:09.399> now<00:01:09.909> what<00:01:10.060> I<00:01:10.090> use<00:01:10.420> to<00:01:10.750> go<00:01:10.899> through

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
diameter now what I use to go through

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.459 
diameter now what I use to go through
the<00:01:11.289> my<00:01:11.560> trailer<00:01:12.009> these<00:01:12.610> are<00:01:13.049> rain<00:01:14.049> barrel

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
the my trailer these are rain barrel

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.679 
the my trailer these are rain barrel
bulkhead<00:01:14.890> fittings<00:01:15.280> so<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:16.360> one's<00:01:16.570> for

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
bulkhead fittings so this one's for

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.440 
bulkhead fittings so this one's for
half-inch<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:18.460> I'll<00:01:18.579> drill<00:01:18.789> the<00:01:18.909> hole<00:01:19.149> in<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
half-inch so I'll drill the hole in the

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.270 
half-inch so I'll drill the hole in the
trailer<00:01:19.630> that<00:01:19.810> will<00:01:20.140> go<00:01:20.259> through<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:21.070> got

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
trailer that will go through it's got

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.450 
trailer that will go through it's got
the<00:01:21.430> rubber<00:01:21.579> washer<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.979> got<00:01:24.100> a<00:01:24.130> reverse

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
the rubber washer and it's got a reverse

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.349 
the rubber washer and it's got a reverse
thread<00:01:24.520> on<00:01:25.030> it

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
thread on it

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.130 
thread on it
so<00:01:26.320> that'll<00:01:26.590> go<00:01:26.680> through<00:01:26.920> your<00:01:27.070> trailer

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so that'll go through your trailer

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.209 
so that'll go through your trailer
that'll<00:01:29.140> go<00:01:29.229> through<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.530> roof<00:01:29.740> so<00:01:30.070> when

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:30.219 
that'll go through the roof so when

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:31.590 
that'll go through the roof so when
that's<00:01:30.369> tightened<00:01:30.700> up<00:01:30.850> there<00:01:31.270> shouldn't<00:01:31.539> be

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
that's tightened up there shouldn't be

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.230 
that's tightened up there shouldn't be
any<00:01:31.780> leakage<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:33.100> nice<00:01:33.310> thing<00:01:33.579> with<00:01:33.700> these<00:01:33.909> is

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
any leakage the nice thing with these is

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.899 
any leakage the nice thing with these is
they<00:01:34.420> accept<00:01:34.869> a<00:01:35.560> strain<00:01:36.189> relief<00:01:36.219> on<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.759> other

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
they accept a strain relief on the other

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.789 
they accept a strain relief on the other
end<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:38.140> there's<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.409> half-inch<00:01:38.829> strain<00:01:39.159> relief

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
end so there's a half-inch strain relief

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.700 
end so there's a half-inch strain relief
so<00:01:41.799> when<00:01:41.950> that's<00:01:42.130> going<00:01:42.310> through<00:01:42.429> the<00:01:42.609> trailer

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
so when that's going through the trailer

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.990 
so when that's going through the trailer
I'll<00:01:44.710> be<00:01:44.890> going<00:01:45.130> down<00:01:45.340> through<00:01:45.670> there<00:01:45.969> like

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
I'll be going down through there like

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.800 
I'll be going down through there like
that

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.800 

coming<00:01:53.560> out<00:01:53.680> the<00:01:53.830> other<00:01:53.860> side<00:01:54.630> okay<00:01:55.630> I've<00:01:55.750> just

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
coming out the other side okay I've just

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.020 
coming out the other side okay I've just
noticed<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.740> problem<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.310> this<00:01:57.490> here<00:01:57.700> this<00:01:57.880> will

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
noticed a problem on this here this will

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.120 
noticed a problem on this here this will
this<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.180> half-inch<00:01:58.810> this<00:01:59.619> is<00:01:59.799> a<00:01:59.830> strain

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
this is half-inch this is a strain

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.590 
this is half-inch this is a strain
relief<00:02:00.159> that<00:02:00.640> will<00:02:00.820> go<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:01.210> there<00:02:01.390> but

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
relief that will go in there but

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.410 
relief that will go in there but
unfortunately<00:02:02.340> my<00:02:03.340> particular<00:02:03.820> cables<00:02:04.270> too

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
unfortunately my particular cables too

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.660 
unfortunately my particular cables too
thick<00:02:04.630> for<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:04.990> so<00:02:05.950> I'll<00:02:06.070> just<00:02:06.250> have<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.549> go

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
thick for that so I'll just have to go

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.400 
thick for that so I'll just have to go
without<00:02:06.940> it<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.240> I'll<00:02:07.479> devices<00:02:08.110> or<00:02:08.380> other

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
without it and I'll devices or other

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.100 
without it and I'll devices or other
sort<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:08.979> strain<00:02:09.250> relief<00:02:09.630> inside<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.780> jail<00:02:10.959> or

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
sort of strain relief inside the jail or

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.080 
sort of strain relief inside the jail or
somewhere<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.620> did<00:02:12.160> a<00:02:12.370> couple<00:02:12.670> years<00:02:12.790> back<00:02:13.030> I

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
somewhere I did a couple years back I

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.850 
somewhere I did a couple years back I
bought<00:02:13.360> some<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.750> these<00:02:13.840> for<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> cables<00:02:14.709> on

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
bought some of these for the cables on

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.050 
bought some of these for the cables on
the<00:02:14.890> front<00:02:15.190> they<00:02:15.340> were<00:02:15.430> a<00:02:15.459> different<00:02:15.819> style

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
the front they were a different style

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.090 
the front they were a different style
and<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:17.170> seemed<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.440> work<00:02:17.620> better<00:02:17.830> they

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
and they seemed to work better they

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.410 
and they seemed to work better they
would<00:02:18.310> accept<00:02:18.900> larger<00:02:20.280> larger<00:02:21.420> strain

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
would accept larger larger strain

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.410 
would accept larger larger strain
reliefs<00:02:23.069> okay<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.580> idea<00:02:24.610> right<00:02:25.060> now<00:02:25.120> I'm

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
reliefs okay so the idea right now I'm

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.640 
reliefs okay so the idea right now I'm
going<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.660> go<00:02:25.780> out<00:02:25.870> I'm<00:02:26.080> going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> mark<00:02:26.470> my

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
going to go out I'm going to mark my

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.060 
going to go out I'm going to mark my
position<00:02:26.860> in<00:02:27.250> my<00:02:27.280> hole<00:02:27.489> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.880> trailer<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:30.040> a

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
position in my hole on the trailer do a

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.250 
position in my hole on the trailer do a
pilot<00:02:30.340> hole<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.700> then<00:02:31.120> drill<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.480> hole

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pilot hole and then drill the hole

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.120 
pilot hole and then drill the hole
through<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:33.519> accept<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.150> bulkhead<00:02:34.750> fitting

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
through to accept the bulkhead fitting

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.860 
through to accept the bulkhead fitting
now<00:02:36.130> once<00:02:36.519> that<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.910> in<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.720> not

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
now once that is in there like it's not

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.870 
now once that is in there like it's not
exactly<00:02:38.290> waterproof<00:02:38.860> but<00:02:39.069> all<00:02:39.250> just<00:02:39.550> goop<00:02:39.700> it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
exactly waterproof but all just goop it

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.710 
exactly waterproof but all just goop it
up<00:02:39.970> or<00:02:40.600> whatever<00:02:40.810> goop<00:02:41.200> or<00:02:42.330> butyl<00:02:43.330> tape<00:02:43.480> or

up or whatever goop or butyl tape or
something<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.260> will<00:02:44.890> do<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.190> top<00:02:45.459> and<00:02:45.730> bottom

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
something I will do it top and bottom

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.090 
something I will do it top and bottom
no<00:02:46.390> originally<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.110> was<00:02:47.410> going<00:02:47.590> to<00:02:47.709> have<00:02:47.860> my

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
no originally I was going to have my

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.390 
no originally I was going to have my
charge<00:02:48.610> controller<00:02:49.120> mounted<00:02:49.390> here<00:02:50.310> just<00:02:51.310> a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
charge controller mounted here just a

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.610 
charge controller mounted here just a
couple<00:02:51.580> feet<00:02:51.880> from<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.239> actual<00:02:52.510> solar<00:02:53.050> panels

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
couple feet from the actual solar panels

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.530 
couple feet from the actual solar panels
and<00:02:53.890> then<00:02:54.069> run<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> bunch<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.790> heavy<00:02:54.970> cable<00:02:55.420> I

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and then run a bunch of heavy cable I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.870 
and then run a bunch of heavy cable I
had<00:02:55.690> about<00:02:55.930> 20<00:02:56.799> feet<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.040> have<00:02:57.280> a<00:02:57.310> four<00:02:57.610> gauge

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
had about 20 feet I have a four gauge

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.860 
had about 20 feet I have a four gauge
cable<00:02:58.590> running<00:02:59.640> down<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:01.030> then<00:03:01.510> under<00:03:01.750> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
cable running down and then under the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.090 
cable running down and then under the
trailer<00:03:02.079> and<00:03:02.320> then<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.620> front<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:03.010> the

trailer and then to the front to the

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.550 
trailer and then to the front to the
battery<00:03:03.660> after<00:03:04.660> doing<00:03:05.560> some<00:03:05.769> more<00:03:05.950> research

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
battery after doing some more research

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.199 
battery after doing some more research
particularly<00:03:08.560> there's<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.860> northern<00:03:09.700> Arizona

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
particularly there's a northern Arizona

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.470 
particularly there's a northern Arizona
wind<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.750> some<00:03:11.019> they<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.380> a<00:03:11.410> solar<00:03:12.190> form<00:03:12.640> you

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
wind and some they have a solar form you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.750 
wind and some they have a solar form you
can<00:03:13.630> just<00:03:13.810> type<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.320> northern<00:03:15.040> Arizona<00:03:15.220> wind

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
can just type in northern Arizona wind

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
can just type in northern Arizona wind
and<00:03:15.910> Sun<00:03:16.120> calm<00:03:16.630> and<00:03:16.930> it'll<00:03:17.200> come<00:03:17.350> up<00:03:17.380> with<00:03:17.620> a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
and Sun calm and it'll come up with a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.069 
and Sun calm and it'll come up with a
form<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.160> solar<00:03:18.370> form<00:03:18.820> asked<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.750> bunch<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
form of solar form asked a bunch of

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:21.180 
form of solar form asked a bunch of
questions<00:03:20.140> got<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.799> little<00:03:21.040> better

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
questions got a little better

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.830 
questions got a little better
understanding<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.320> it's<00:03:24.209> been<00:03:25.209> suggested

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
understanding and it's been suggested

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.210 
understanding and it's been suggested
that<00:03:25.870> I'm<00:03:26.079> better<00:03:26.230> off<00:03:26.470> putting<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.950> charge

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
that I'm better off putting the charge

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.640 
that I'm better off putting the charge
controller<00:03:27.630> lower<00:03:28.630> and<00:03:29.019> closer<00:03:29.230> to<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
controller lower and closer to the

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.170 
controller lower and closer to the
battery<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.190> it'll<00:03:30.400> be<00:03:30.489> cooler<00:03:30.760> and<00:03:31.060> then

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
battery so it'll be cooler and then

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.849 
battery so it'll be cooler and then
there's<00:03:31.390> a<00:03:31.450> less<00:03:31.690> room<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:32.200> most<00:03:32.410> important

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
there's a less room the most important

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.470 
there's a less room the most important
thing<00:03:33.010> is<00:03:33.130> to<00:03:33.160> run<00:03:33.489> from<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:34.030> charge

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
thing is to run from the charge

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.509 
thing is to run from the charge
controller<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.200> your<00:03:35.320> battery<00:03:35.560> so<00:03:36.280> I'll<00:03:36.370> keep

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
controller to your battery so I'll keep

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.780 
controller to your battery so I'll keep
that<00:03:36.670> as<00:03:36.880> short<00:03:37.150> as<00:03:37.299> possible<00:03:38.220> so<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.670> way

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
that as short as possible so the way

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.490 
that as short as possible so the way
this<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.299> work<00:03:40.329> out<00:03:40.660> now<00:03:40.870> I'm<00:03:41.109> gonna

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
this is going to work out now I'm gonna

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.640 
this is going to work out now I'm gonna
have<00:03:41.709> a<00:03:41.739> brother<00:03:41.890> 25-foot<00:03:42.730> run<00:03:43.000> of<00:03:43.420> cable<00:03:44.410> one

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
have a brother 25-foot run of cable one

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.270 
have a brother 25-foot run of cable one
way<00:03:44.859> to<00:03:45.579> engage<00:03:46.170> from<00:03:47.170> my<00:03:47.620> actual<00:03:48.040> solar

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
way to engage from my actual solar

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.780 
way to engage from my actual solar
panels<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.329> charge<00:03:49.720> controller<00:03:50.700> so<00:03:51.700> you

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
panels to the charge controller so you

take<00:03:51.970> that<00:03:52.090> 25<00:03:52.570> mm<00:03:53.019> by<00:03:53.140> 2<00:03:53.200> so<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.620> give<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:53.890> 50

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
take that 25 mm by 2 so that give you 50

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.990 
take that 25 mm by 2 so that give you 50

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
feet or run that just comes into play

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.699 
feet or run that just comes into play
when<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.359> do<00:03:58.510> your<00:03:58.660> calculations<00:03:58.810> for<00:03:59.530> your

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
when you do your calculations for your

when you do your calculations for your
old<00:03:59.890> each<00:04:00.070> drop<00:04:00.599> I've<00:04:01.599> done<00:04:01.840> all<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
old each drop I've done all the

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.309 
old each drop I've done all the
calculations<00:04:02.140> and<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.010> should

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
calculations and I should

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.039 
calculations and I should
they'll<00:04:03.499> be<00:04:03.650> way<00:04:04.189> well<00:04:04.909> within<00:04:05.120> limits<00:04:05.719> now

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
they'll be way well within limits now

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.929 
they'll be way well within limits now
all<00:04:06.230> this<00:04:06.349> other<00:04:06.499> setup<00:04:06.920> here<00:04:07.099> this<00:04:07.280> was<00:04:07.519> for

00:04:07.929 --> 00:04:07.939 
all this other setup here this was for

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.369 
all this other setup here this was for
when<00:04:08.209> it<00:04:08.329> was<00:04:08.420> going<00:04:08.569> to<00:04:08.629> be<00:04:08.689> set<00:04:08.870> up<00:04:08.900> here<00:04:09.019> so

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
when it was going to be set up here so

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.349 
when it was going to be set up here so
this<00:04:09.499> will<00:04:09.650> all<00:04:09.799> be<00:04:09.920> taken<00:04:09.950> out<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:11.180> what<00:04:11.329> I

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:11.359 
this will all be taken out so what I

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:13.440 
this will all be taken out so what I
have<00:04:11.569> to<00:04:11.749> do<00:04:11.870> now<00:04:12.049> this<00:04:12.349> is<00:04:12.560> where<00:04:12.739> the

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
have to do now this is where the

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.900 
have to do now this is where the
bulkhead<00:04:14.450> fitting<00:04:14.870> it's<00:04:15.019> going<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.379> go<00:04:15.499> up<00:04:15.910> up

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
bulkhead fitting it's going to go up up

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.349 
bulkhead fitting it's going to go up up
here<00:04:17.299> in<00:04:17.509> the<00:04:18.049> roof<00:04:18.229> and<00:04:18.970> then<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.150> lines

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
here in the roof and then the lines

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.390 
here in the roof and then the lines
going<00:04:20.630> to<00:04:20.690> come<00:04:20.870> down<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.349> I'll<00:04:21.470> just<00:04:21.739> put<00:04:22.370> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
going to come down and I'll just put a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.730 
going to come down and I'll just put a
strain<00:04:22.699> relief<00:04:22.729> on<00:04:23.180> it<00:04:23.330> here<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.690> run<00:04:24.560> it<00:04:24.710> down

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
strain relief on it here and run it down

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:26.589 
strain relief on it here and run it down
throw<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.699> hole<00:04:25.849> in<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.150> bottom<00:04:26.449> of<00:04:26.539> the

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
throw a hole in the bottom of the

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.990 
throw a hole in the bottom of the
trailer<00:04:26.990> down<00:04:27.979> through<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> channel<00:04:28.550> the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
trailer down through the channel the

trailer down through the channel the
frame<00:04:29.210> Channel<00:04:29.660> and<00:04:29.870> then<00:04:30.020> back<00:04:30.560> into<00:04:30.830> the

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
frame Channel and then back into the

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.620 
frame Channel and then back into the
front<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> trailer<00:04:31.580> so<00:04:31.910> it<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.449> be<00:04:32.539> hooked

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
front of the trailer so it can be hooked

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.120 
front of the trailer so it can be hooked
up<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.080> charge<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.530> be<00:04:33.590> inside<00:04:33.889> of<00:04:33.949> my

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
up to the charge and be inside of my

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.620 
up to the charge and be inside of my
closet<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:34.669> I've<00:04:34.789> gone<00:04:35.000> through<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.509> I've

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
closet and I've gone through and I've

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.390 
closet and I've gone through and I've
roughly<00:04:36.020> marked<00:04:36.380> where<00:04:36.620> I<00:04:36.650> want<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:37.039> hole<00:04:37.220> to

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
roughly marked where I want the hole to

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.339 
roughly marked where I want the hole to
come<00:04:37.580> through<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.570> it's<00:04:38.720> gonna<00:04:38.810> be<00:04:38.990> something

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
come through so it's gonna be something

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:40.990 
come through so it's gonna be something
like<00:04:39.530> that<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:40.099> what<00:04:40.220> I'm<00:04:40.340> gonna<00:04:40.460> do<00:04:40.669> is<00:04:40.789> take

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
like that now what I'm gonna do is take

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.540 
like that now what I'm gonna do is take
and<00:04:41.180> drill<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> pilot<00:04:41.720> hole<00:04:42.110> here<00:04:42.590> and<00:04:42.800> then<00:04:43.400> go

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
and drill a pilot hole here and then go

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.430 
and drill a pilot hole here and then go
to<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.789> top<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.030> drill<00:04:44.840> over<00:04:45.020> here<00:04:45.110> I'm<00:04:45.259> on

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
to the top and drill over here I'm on

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.900 
to the top and drill over here I'm on
top<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:45.889> trailer<00:04:46.220> here<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.610> is<00:04:46.759> the

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
top of the trailer here this is the

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.210 
top of the trailer here this is the
pilot<00:04:47.270> hole<00:04:47.330> coming<00:04:47.840> through<00:04:48.080> the<00:04:48.530> idea<00:04:48.889> will

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
pilot hole coming through the idea will

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.890 
pilot hole coming through the idea will
be<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.520> drill<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.030> hole<00:04:50.240> through<00:04:50.270> here<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:50.810> oh

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
be to drill a hole through here and oh

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.629 
be to drill a hole through here and oh
this<00:04:51.020> is<00:04:51.169> a<00:04:51.199> parched<00:04:51.500> hull<00:04:51.740> hate

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
this is a parched hull hate

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.460 
this is a parched hull hate
I<00:04:52.669> painted<00:04:53.539> my<00:04:53.599> trailer<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.080> doesn't<00:04:54.349> really

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
I painted my trailer it doesn't really

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.760 
I painted my trailer it doesn't really
bother<00:04:54.590> me<00:04:54.770> that<00:04:54.949> much<00:04:55.099> I'll<00:04:55.880> keep<00:04:56.840> the<00:04:57.080> plug

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
bother me that much I'll keep the plug

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.110 
bother me that much I'll keep the plug
that<00:04:57.919> comes<00:04:58.130> out<00:04:58.310> though<00:04:58.520> just<00:04:58.759> in<00:04:58.789> case<00:04:58.880> I

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
that comes out though just in case I

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.480 
that comes out though just in case I
ever<00:04:59.240> do<00:04:59.389> want<00:04:59.539> to<00:04:59.690> seal<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.830> back<00:05:00.919> over<00:05:01.250> again

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
ever do want to seal it back over again

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.060 
ever do want to seal it back over again
and<00:05:02.110> bondo<00:05:03.110> it<00:05:03.259> up<00:05:03.380> add<00:05:03.560> fiberglass

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
and bondo it up add fiberglass

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:15.200 
and bondo it up add fiberglass
underneath

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.680 

the<00:05:16.210> idea<00:05:16.630> is<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.820> don't<00:05:18.820> go<00:05:18.910> through<00:05:19.180> like<00:05:19.390> that

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
the idea is I don't go through like that

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.500 
the idea is I don't go through like that
we<00:05:20.260> tightened<00:05:20.650> up<00:05:20.710> down<00:05:20.950> below<00:05:21.300> you<00:05:22.300> might

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
we tightened up down below you might

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.030 
we tightened up down below you might
have<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:22.780> goop<00:05:22.930> around<00:05:23.230> it<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.440> bit<00:05:23.620> just<00:05:23.860> to

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
have to goop around it a bit just to

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.960 
have to goop around it a bit just to
keep<00:05:24.370> water<00:05:25.120> tight<00:05:26.010> now<00:05:27.010> I'll<00:05:27.190> have<00:05:27.340> 21<00:05:27.760> feet

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
keep water tight now I'll have 21 feet

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.570 
keep water tight now I'll have 21 feet
of<00:05:28.150> this<00:05:28.300> this<00:05:28.510> right<00:05:28.720> now<00:05:28.870> is<00:05:29.020> too<00:05:29.200> short<00:05:29.580> but

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
of this this right now is too short but

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.780 
of this this right now is too short but
this<00:05:30.700> will<00:05:30.910> feed<00:05:31.120> down<00:05:31.360> through<00:05:31.690> like<00:05:31.900> that

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.100 

now<00:05:36.790> I'll<00:05:36.910> have<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.120> determine<00:05:37.510> just<00:05:37.780> how<00:05:37.930> much

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
now I'll have to determine just how much

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.690 
now I'll have to determine just how much
I<00:05:38.260> want<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.500> leave<00:05:38.650> out<00:05:38.830> here<00:05:39.010> I<00:05:39.040> might<00:05:39.490> want<00:05:39.670> to

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
I want to leave out here I might want to

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.010 
I want to leave out here I might want to
leave<00:05:39.850> a<00:05:39.880> little<00:05:40.090> extra<00:05:40.240> because<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.690> panel's

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
leave a little extra because the panel's

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.510 
leave a little extra because the panel's
I<00:05:41.170> might<00:05:41.320> have<00:05:41.470> them<00:05:41.560> tilt<00:05:41.800> in<00:05:41.980> this<00:05:42.130> way<00:05:42.310> or<00:05:42.490> I

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
I might have them tilt in this way or I

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.180 
I might have them tilt in this way or I
might<00:05:42.670> help<00:05:42.820> them<00:05:43.000> tilting<00:05:43.390> the<00:05:43.510> other<00:05:43.630> way

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
might help them tilting the other way

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:47.070 
might help them tilting the other way
and<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.640> can<00:05:45.790> always<00:05:46.120> just<00:05:46.330> secure<00:05:46.690> them<00:05:46.840> here

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.080 
and I can always just secure them here

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.890 
and I can always just secure them here
with<00:05:47.260> a<00:05:47.290> with<00:05:48.250> a<00:05:48.280> twist<00:05:48.580> tie<00:05:48.760> or<00:05:48.940> whatever<00:05:49.240> and

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
with a with a twist tie or whatever and

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.720 
with a with a twist tie or whatever and
then<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.380> idea<00:05:50.710> is<00:05:50.830> when<00:05:51.130> I<00:05:51.160> want<00:05:51.400> to<00:05:51.460> hook<00:05:51.580> up

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
then the idea is when I want to hook up

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.790 
then the idea is when I want to hook up
for<00:05:51.940> solar<00:05:52.890> just<00:05:53.890> a<00:05:54.040> matter<00:05:55.710> twisting<00:05:56.710> the

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
for solar just a matter twisting the

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.650 
for solar just a matter twisting the
plug<00:05:57.010> in<00:05:57.190> like<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.610> twisting<00:05:58.180> it<00:05:58.330> so<00:05:58.510> it's

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
plug in like that twisting it so it's

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.250 
plug in like that twisting it so it's
locked

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
locked

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.170 
locked
it'll<00:05:59.410> be<00:05:59.530> secured<00:05:59.950> here<00:06:00.280> so<00:06:00.790> I<00:06:00.820> can<00:06:01.060> either

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
it'll be secured here so I can either

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.760 
it'll be secured here so I can either
travel<00:06:01.600> down<00:06:01.750> the<00:06:01.870> highway<00:06:02.170> like<00:06:02.350> this<00:06:02.530> with

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:05.440 
the panel's flat and like that or if I

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.930 
the panel's flat and like that or if I
have<00:06:05.560> the<00:06:05.680> panel's<00:06:06.070> mounted<00:06:06.430> on<00:06:06.550> my<00:06:06.580> truck

have the panel's mounted on my truck

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.060 
have the panel's mounted on my truck
it's<00:06:07.570> just<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:07.900> matter<00:06:08.110> of<00:06:08.230> inserting<00:06:08.800> the
