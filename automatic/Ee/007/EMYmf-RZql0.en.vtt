00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
like the rush of building drums and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.770 
like the rush of building drums and
rolling<00:03:44.169> snares<00:03:44.680> on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.489> track<00:03:45.790> rush<00:03:46.239> with

rolling snares on the track rush with

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.569 
rolling snares on the track rush with
these<00:03:46.930> intense<00:03:47.349> guitars<00:03:47.799> just<00:03:48.069> tightly

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
these intense guitars just tightly

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.640 
these intense guitars just tightly
locking<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.419> with<00:03:49.630> them<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:50.019> feel<00:03:50.500> like

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650
