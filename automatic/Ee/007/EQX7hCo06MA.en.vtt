00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
seizures and what I found out was that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.139 
seizures and what I found out was that
the<00:00:40.140> main<00:00:40.379> cause<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> seizures<00:00:41.460> in<00:00:41.790> bearded

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the main cause of seizures in bearded

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.180 
the main cause of seizures in bearded
dragons<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> calcium<00:00:43.110> deficiency<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.980> I've

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
dragons as a calcium deficiency so I've

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
dragons as a calcium deficiency so I've
been<00:00:44.370> treating<00:00:44.700> him<00:00:44.789> for<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
been treating him for that in the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
been treating him for that in the
meantime<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.289> have<00:00:46.620> him<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.250> cage

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460

I have him on cage carpet which is I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
I have him on cage carpet which is I
think<00:00:52.410> it's<00:00:52.800> better<00:00:52.980> because<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.969> none

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
think it's better because that way none

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.600 
think it's better because that way none
of<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> substrate<00:00:54.780> gets<00:00:55.020> into<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.350> food<00:00:55.620> I'm

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
of the substrate gets into the food I'm

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.970 
of the substrate gets into the food I'm
able<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:57.120> examine<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.750> fecal<00:00:58.260> matter<00:00:58.440> very

buried<00:01:09.119> in<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> sand<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.960> don't<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.560> do

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
buried in the sand I don't have to do

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
buried in the sand I don't have to do
any<00:01:10.830> searching<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.420> allows<00:01:12.689> me

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
any searching for it and this allows me

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.410 
any searching for it and this allows me
to<00:01:12.900> maintain<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> temperature<00:01:14.310> gradient<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
to maintain a temperature gradient that

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
to maintain a temperature gradient that
I<00:01:15.689> feel<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.320> necessary<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:17.159> his<00:01:18.979> getting

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
done here is I put the cage carpet in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.020 
done here is I put the cage carpet in
there<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.650> rock<00:01:26.610> heater<00:01:26.880> over<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.200> too<00:01:29.030> for

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.630 
there is a rock heater over here too for
the<00:01:30.150> basking<00:01:30.600> area<00:01:30.720> he<00:01:31.680> needs<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.220> very

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the basking area he needs to be very

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.550 
the basking area he needs to be very
warm<00:01:32.970> especially<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:33.869> illness<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.439> need

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
there so that i can monitor the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.050 
there so that i can monitor the
temperatures<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> make<00:01:41.759> sure<00:01:41.909> i<00:01:41.939> don't

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
temperatures and make sure i don't

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.420 
temperatures and make sure i don't
overheat<00:01:42.570> him<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.590> have<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.979> basking<00:01:44.369> light

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
overheat him i do have the basking light

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.880 
overheat him i do have the basking light
overhead<00:01:44.939> so<00:01:45.420> he<00:01:45.570> has<00:01:45.750> heat<00:01:46.140> coming<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:46.470> both

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
overhead so he has heat coming from both

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
overhead so he has heat coming from both
directions<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.790> he<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.600> warm

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
directions and he can really warm

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.600 
directions and he can really warm
himself<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.439> he<00:01:49.530> feels<00:01:49.680> he<00:01:49.890> needs<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.159> on<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
himself if he feels he needs to on that

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.030 
himself if he feels he needs to on that
side<00:01:50.850> over<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.079> I've<00:01:52.290> been<00:01:52.320> keeping<00:01:52.680> his

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
side over here I've been keeping his

it's a little bit warm in there so you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.029 
it's a little bit warm in there so you
could<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.290> there's<00:02:07.770> little

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
to examine that so this also allows me

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.650 
to examine that so this also allows me
to<00:02:48.950> see<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.310> he<00:02:49.490> has<00:02:49.520> eaten<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.180> vegetables

that I've put in here I've dusted them

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.730 
that I've put in here I've dusted them
with<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> supplement<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:55.450> added<00:02:56.450> minerals<00:02:57.350> to

with a supplement for added minerals to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.160 
with a supplement for added minerals to
help<00:02:58.040> him<00:02:58.160> recover<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.850> he's<00:02:59.690> also<00:02:59.870> got<00:03:00.140> his

they have an illness or recovering from
an<00:03:11.030> illness<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.600> very<00:03:12.500> beneficial<00:03:12.740> for<00:03:13.550> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
an illness is very beneficial for the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.340 
an illness is very beneficial for the
reasons<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.200> I<00:03:15.290> mentioned<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:16.370> monitoring

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
reasons that I mentioned the monitoring

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.400 
reasons that I mentioned the monitoring
and<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.970> way<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.210> can<00:03:20.450> really<00:03:20.930> maintain<00:03:21.170> a

temperature gradient that you feel is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.840 
temperature gradient that you feel is
