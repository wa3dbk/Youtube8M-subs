00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.210
 test 7 touched many with the question of how 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 create a website without spending nth 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.599
 the amount of money is well or falls as 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.960
 can I buy my own website less 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:19.080
 cheaper and cost and for example very 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 such a web offers good value 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.560
 designer called mix perhaps 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.210
 its most important difference from all 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:34.829
 editors who used it 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.309
 editor almost email 5 so 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.840
 show you what you can get off to create 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:48.539
 but how do you see a list of them pretty 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:50.539
 extensive ie you can choose any 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.870
 from business areas and create a website 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:57.989
 which one you need so but let's go exactly 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.730
 review 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:07.650
 it is in the cost itself and then you 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.110
 show what site I tried a couple 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.630
 to create in this designer 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.299
 until the site is not so good and kimchi 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.580
 need to work but as far as free 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.850
 time i will work this site and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.710
 so here I am you the system will not be anything 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 to read 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.200
 You can see for yourself and how I said prices 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.200
 quite democratic 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.110
 and so no no no you account 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.260
 examples 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:02:01.940
 but the site here is a romantic world not a 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:02:06.290
 just come on and show you it so we 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.580
 there I will look here as you see I 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.679
 created buttons 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.410
 it is clickable, and all that is understood 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.110
 come and still hurt everyone 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:21.019
 almost go smoothly but then added 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.760
 news some homepage is not 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:28.030
 there is also an added button using 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.300
 which authorities come to my channel and 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.620
 so that was the site 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.739
 Well, as you can see, if you wish, you can 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.769
 create a very nice site pretty 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.620
 quality well i'm certainly not just that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.870
 on site quality but if you 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.840
 spend nth amount of time and nth 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.140
 the amount of money you will get 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.850
 you will be very pleased so let's say 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:59.329
 the result you have invested 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.790
 and time and money and yes even want 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:02.410
 repeat site advertise your 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.160
 services 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:11.959
 advertises your channels your your scope 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.920
 activities so let's say and therefore has 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:21.530
 site today is pretty say 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:24.980
 so itâ€™s prestigious to have a block 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.430
 well and not with his own nominal 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.930
 the site is prestigious people who come 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.880
 On this site will see that you 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:36.950
 understand at least some there 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.950
 programming can languages 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.930
 programming site design with 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.650
 using some kind of web constructors 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.269
 make the site well and can you pay 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.940
 someone can help him with money 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.410
 anyone so if you 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.130
 my videos seemed useful to put 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.280
 likes and if there is a criticism let's say be 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.130
 constructive and less moto on my 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.180
 channel and so sam was normal put 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.180
