00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.480
 Hello sir 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.200
 Welcome to the 700th section of Modest Taste videos 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.200
 we have a catering recipe in this section 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.640
 We will learn the construction of "Wet Cookie" 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.800
 But if you want to have a look at the material list 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.200
 200 grams of margarine 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.600
 1 coffee cup sunflower oil 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 1 coffee cup cocoa 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 1 piece of egg 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.680
 1 tea cup with powdered sugar 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.240
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.240
 1 packet of vanilla 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.400
 and as much flour as possible 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 for sherbet; 1 cup powdered sugar 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.960
 and 1.5 cups of water 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.160
 Let's start by boiling the sherbet to make our wet cookie 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.680
 We said we have 1 glass of sugar ... 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.120
 add 1.5 cups of water 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.920
 and 1 we will sit on fire to boil 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.880
 Let's start to knead dough while sherbet 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.000
 we have stated that we have one egg 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.560
 our margarine softened at room temperature ... 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.400
 and 1 coffee cup sunflower oil 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.600
 We also added a small amount of tea cup powder sugar as it is syrupy 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.360
 now we're feeding some supplies with fingertips 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.680
 now we're adding cocoa 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 mixing with some more finger tips 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 and now we can add flour 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.160
 we add vanilla and baking powder on flour 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.520
 we knead by adding flour to a non-sticky consistency area 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.640
 yes our caste is integrated 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.000
 it doesn't stick to it, it needs to be a bit hard 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.280
 we always buy walnuts as much as we say ... 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.240
 We ball ... 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.960
 and greaseproof paper 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.400
 our last cookie is left on the tray 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.720
 now we can give to 190 degrees angry oven 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.880
 our cookies are cooked, how do we understand that cooked? 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.200
 cracks begin to form on 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.800
 we left the oven for about 5 minutes 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.680
 now we leave the spoon on the sherbet 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.200
 we do not need to remind you that our sherry is cold 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.560
 wait for the sherbet 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.160
 preferably 1 night to hold more beautiful but 2-3 hours will be enough 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.400
 2 hours later 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.120
 yes our cookie drew sherbet 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.120
 Now is the service time 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.800
 it was also a share worthy of the recipe of the humble tastes 700. 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.800
 Modest Taste videos 700'e section ... 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.800
 We shared the description of "Wet Cookie" 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.440
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.480
 Goodbye sir ...
