have it it's always in the bargain bin

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.230 
have it it's always in the bargain bin
but<00:05:16.900> I've<00:05:17.020> held<00:05:17.229> off<00:05:17.469> because<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:18.339> has<00:05:18.580> really

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
but I've held off because it has really

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.140 
but I've held off because it has really
really<00:05:19.629> mixed<00:05:20.259> reviews<00:05:20.650> but<00:05:20.979> let's<00:05:21.669> be<00:05:21.849> honest

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
really mixed reviews but let's be honest

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.809 
really mixed reviews but let's be honest
I<00:05:22.270> think<00:05:22.330> all<00:05:22.659> of<00:05:22.689> her<00:05:22.930> books<00:05:23.080> do<00:05:23.409> they<00:05:24.159> tend<00:05:24.699> to

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:24.819 
I think all of her books do they tend to

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:25.980 
I think all of her books do they tend to
get<00:05:24.969> a<00:05:25.029> reaction<00:05:25.300> out<00:05:25.569> of<00:05:25.629> people<00:05:25.719> whether

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
get a reaction out of people whether

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.589 
get a reaction out of people whether
it's<00:05:26.259> good<00:05:26.529> or<00:05:26.560> bad<00:05:27.150> including<00:05:28.150> my<00:05:28.240> favorites

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:28.599 
it's good or bad including my favorites

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.029 
it's good or bad including my favorites
from<00:05:28.689> her<00:05:28.900> and<00:05:29.139> in<00:05:29.229> fact<00:05:29.379> every<00:05:29.710> book<00:05:29.889> I've

definitely<00:06:43.570> worth<00:06:43.930> a<00:06:44.110> chance<00:06:44.320> considering

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
definitely worth a chance considering

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.160 
definitely worth a chance considering
how<00:06:45.250> much<00:06:45.400> I<00:06:45.640> loved<00:06:45.910> the<00:06:46.150> other<00:06:46.300> two<00:06:46.570> it's<00:06:46.960> sort

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
how much I loved the other two it's sort

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.800 
how much I loved the other two it's sort
of<00:06:47.320> fairytale<00:06:47.830> asked<00:06:48.340> and<00:06:48.760> surreal<00:06:49.240> I<00:06:49.540> think

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:49.810 
of fairytale asked and surreal I think

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.500 
of fairytale asked and surreal I think
they<00:06:50.470> did<00:06:50.650> have<00:06:50.920> the<00:06:51.160> sequel<00:06:51.670> out<00:06:51.880> of<00:06:52.060> the<00:06:52.150> wild

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
they did have the sequel out of the wild

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.230 
they did have the sequel out of the wild
which<00:06:53.350> I<00:06:53.680> probably<00:06:54.370> should<00:06:54.790> have<00:06:54.880> just<00:06:54.940> gone

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
which I probably should have just gone

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.970 
which I probably should have just gone
ahead<00:06:55.390> and<00:06:55.540> got<00:06:55.900> because<00:06:56.320> there<00:06:56.560> was<00:06:56.650> only<00:06:56.770> one

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:56.980 
ahead and got because there was only one

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.520 
ahead and got because there was only one
copy<00:06:57.190> but<00:06:58.090> i<00:06:58.300> figured<00:06:58.630> i<00:06:58.720> would<00:06:58.840> wait<00:06:58.960> until<00:06:58.990> i

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
copy but i figured i would wait until i

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.410 
copy but i figured i would wait until i
had<00:06:59.770> read<00:06:59.920> this<00:07:00.130> and<00:07:00.400> see<00:07:00.580> what<00:07:00.610> i<00:07:00.760> think<00:07:01.090> and

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420 
had read this and see what i think and

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.170 
had read this and see what i think and
the<00:07:02.110> other<00:07:02.290> i<00:07:02.410> got<00:07:02.680> was<00:07:02.980> spirit<00:07:03.730> bound<00:07:03.850> by

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:04.180 
the other i got was spirit bound by

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:06.390 
the other i got was spirit bound by
Richelle<00:07:04.510> Mead<00:07:04.720> I<00:07:04.990> thought<00:07:05.800> that<00:07:06.100> I<00:07:06.130> owned

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
Richelle Mead I thought that I owned

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.610 
Richelle Mead I thought that I owned
this<00:07:06.670> entire<00:07:06.940> series<00:07:07.270> actually<00:07:08.140> I<00:07:08.170> knew<00:07:08.380> for<00:07:08.560> a

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
this entire series actually I knew for a

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.110 
this entire series actually I knew for a
long<00:07:08.770> time<00:07:09.010> that<00:07:09.190> I<00:07:09.220> was<00:07:09.340> missing<00:07:09.550> one<00:07:09.910> of<00:07:10.030> the

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
long time that I was missing one of the

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.490 
long time that I was missing one of the
books<00:07:10.300> right<00:07:10.420> in<00:07:10.660> the<00:07:10.720> middle<00:07:10.870> because<00:07:11.140> I<00:07:11.350> had

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
books right in the middle because I had

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.560 
books right in the middle because I had
won<00:07:11.680> some<00:07:11.950> copies<00:07:12.400> and<00:07:12.730> some<00:07:12.940> I<00:07:12.970> had<00:07:13.240> picked<00:07:13.420> up

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
won some copies and some I had picked up

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.120 
won some copies and some I had picked up
really<00:07:13.780> cheap<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:14.260> so<00:07:14.440> it<00:07:14.500> was<00:07:14.620> just<00:07:14.650> kind<00:07:14.830> of

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
really cheap and so it was just kind of

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.400 
really cheap and so it was just kind of
getting<00:07:15.790> it<00:07:15.910> all<00:07:16.000> piecemeal<00:07:16.540> but<00:07:17.080> I<00:07:17.140> thought

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:17.410 
getting it all piecemeal but I thought

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.500 
getting it all piecemeal but I thought
that<00:07:17.470> I<00:07:17.680> had<00:07:17.860> filled<00:07:18.160> in<00:07:18.460> the<00:07:18.760> gaps<00:07:19.000> and<00:07:19.330> that<00:07:19.480> I

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:19.510 
that I had filled in the gaps and that I

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.110 
that I had filled in the gaps and that I
did<00:07:19.750> on<00:07:19.960> the<00:07:20.110> entire<00:07:20.350> series<00:07:20.680> but<00:07:21.460> I<00:07:21.760> was<00:07:21.910> on

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
did on the entire series but I was on

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.260 
did on the entire series but I was on
Goodreads<00:07:22.690> and<00:07:23.080> for<00:07:23.470> some<00:07:23.680> reason<00:07:23.710> I<00:07:24.400> decided

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:25.270 
Goodreads and for some reason I decided

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.300 
Goodreads and for some reason I decided
to<00:07:25.450> check<00:07:25.480> through<00:07:25.870> my<00:07:25.990> shelves<00:07:26.230> and<00:07:26.590> it<00:07:27.040> said

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
to check through my shelves and it said

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.390 
to check through my shelves and it said
that<00:07:27.460> I<00:07:27.490> didn't<00:07:28.030> own<00:07:28.210> spirit<00:07:28.720> bound<00:07:28.840> and<00:07:29.400> I

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 
that I didn't own spirit bound and I

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.830 
that I didn't own spirit bound and I
thought<00:07:30.580> maybe<00:07:30.730> I<00:07:30.850> had<00:07:30.940> just<00:07:31.210> messed<00:07:31.510> up<00:07:31.690> and

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840 
thought maybe I had just messed up and

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.090 
thought maybe I had just messed up and
not<00:07:31.960> marked<00:07:32.230> it<00:07:32.350> but<00:07:32.530> then<00:07:32.620> I<00:07:32.650> couldn't<00:07:32.890> find

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100 
not marked it but then I couldn't find

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.700 
not marked it but then I couldn't find
it<00:07:33.250> on<00:07:33.310> my<00:07:33.430> shelves<00:07:33.640> either<00:07:33.850> so<00:07:34.330> there<00:07:35.170> is<00:07:35.410> the

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:35.710 
it on my shelves either so there is the

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:37.590 
it on my shelves either so there is the
potential<00:07:36.070> that<00:07:36.370> I<00:07:36.430> do<00:07:36.520> already<00:07:37.030> own<00:07:37.270> this<00:07:37.420> one

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:37.600 
potential that I do already own this one

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.210 
potential that I do already own this one
and<00:07:37.780> I<00:07:37.840> just<00:07:37.990> couldn't<00:07:38.140> find<00:07:38.500> it<00:07:38.680> but<00:07:38.920> I'm

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
and I just couldn't find it but I'm

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.820 
and I just couldn't find it but I'm
thinking<00:07:40.000> that<00:07:40.270> I<00:07:40.330> was<00:07:40.540> right<00:07:40.810> originally<00:07:41.680> and

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830 
thinking that I was right originally and

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.620 
thinking that I was right originally and
that<00:07:41.920> i<00:07:41.950> did<00:07:42.520> still<00:07:42.790> have<00:07:43.000> one<00:07:43.150> missing<00:07:43.480> from

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.630 
that i did still have one missing from

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.050 
that i did still have one missing from
the<00:07:43.720> series<00:07:44.080> so<00:07:44.830> though<00:07:45.310> I<00:07:45.340> wasn't<00:07:45.580> actively

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:46.060 
the series so though I wasn't actively

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.240 
the series so though I wasn't actively
looking<00:07:46.420> for<00:07:46.480> it<00:07:46.780> walked<00:07:47.140> in<00:07:47.380> and<00:07:47.590> it<00:07:47.830> was<00:07:47.950> just

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.250 
looking for it walked in and it was just

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.220 
looking for it walked in and it was just
sitting<00:07:48.520> there<00:07:48.550> and<00:07:48.970> it<00:07:49.150> was<00:07:49.360> the<00:07:49.780> only<00:07:49.900> copy

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:50.230 
sitting there and it was the only copy

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:52.620 
sitting there and it was the only copy
in<00:07:50.560> hardcover<00:07:51.460> which<00:07:51.730> is<00:07:51.940> the<00:07:52.210> rest<00:07:52.390> of<00:07:52.540> my

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:52.630 
in hardcover which is the rest of my

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.560 
in hardcover which is the rest of my
series<00:07:52.930> is<00:07:53.080> hardcover<00:07:53.710> and<00:07:53.890> it<00:07:54.250> was<00:07:54.400> 199<00:07:54.910> so<00:07:55.540> I

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:55.570 
series is hardcover and it was 199 so I

00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:58.520 
series is hardcover and it was 199 so I
figured<00:07:56.170> even<00:07:56.530> if<00:07:56.830> I<00:07:57.010> do<00:07:57.100> potentially<00:07:57.640> have<00:07:58.090> it

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:58.530 
figured even if I do potentially have it

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:00.900 
figured even if I do potentially have it
better<00:07:59.530> safe<00:07:59.800> than<00:07:59.920> sorry<00:07:59.980> and<00:08:00.340> if<00:08:00.490> I<00:08:00.580> do<00:08:00.640> find

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:00.910 
better safe than sorry and if I do find

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:03.000 
better safe than sorry and if I do find
that<00:08:01.030> other<00:08:01.180> copy<00:08:01.480> then<00:08:01.810> you<00:08:02.230> know<00:08:02.350> I'll<00:08:02.800> pass

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.010 
that other copy then you know I'll pass

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.830 
that other copy then you know I'll pass
it<00:08:03.040> on<00:08:03.250> to<00:08:03.370> someone<00:08:03.550> else<00:08:03.670> but<00:08:04.000> I<00:08:04.330> went<00:08:04.780> ahead

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 
it on to someone else but I went ahead

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:07.230 
it on to someone else but I went ahead
and<00:08:04.960> picked<00:08:05.140> it<00:08:05.290> up<00:08:05.410> and<00:08:06.240> definitely

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 
and picked it up and definitely

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.630 
and picked it up and definitely
completed<00:08:07.810> my<00:08:08.050> vampire<00:08:08.440> academy<00:08:08.950> series<00:08:08.980> and

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:09.640 
completed my vampire academy series and

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.570 
completed my vampire academy series and
now<00:08:09.850> that<00:08:10.030> really<00:08:10.180> is<00:08:10.330> all
