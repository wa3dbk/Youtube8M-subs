00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
to do something I can't do it because

00:04:52.509 --> 00:05:03.989 
to do something I can't do it because
they<00:04:52.869> usually<00:05:02.339> about<00:05:03.339> you<00:05:03.459> healed<00:05:03.699> them<00:05:03.849> right

00:05:05.429 --> 00:05:05.439 
now than they might actually get

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.359 
now than they might actually get
somewhere<00:05:06.179> I'm<00:05:07.179> aware<00:05:07.449> that<00:05:07.659> it's<00:05:07.860> that<00:05:08.860> that

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:09.369 
somewhere I'm aware that it's that that

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:10.979 
somewhere I'm aware that it's that that
swelling<00:05:09.819> appeal<00:05:10.209> is<00:05:10.389> a<00:05:10.419> different<00:05:10.839> way<00:05:10.959> of

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:10.989 
swelling appeal is a different way of

00:05:10.989 --> 00:05:14.279 
swelling appeal is a different way of

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
spelling it but I don't care speaking of

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:15.889 
spelling it but I don't care speaking of
which<00:05:14.349> I'm<00:05:14.889> nipping<00:05:15.309> off<00:05:15.369> to<00:05:15.519> the<00:05:15.579> save<00:05:15.759> point

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:15.899 
which I'm nipping off to the save point

00:05:15.899 --> 00:05:20.809 
which I'm nipping off to the save point
done<00:05:16.899> let's<00:05:17.589> cut<00:05:17.800> around<00:05:18.959> what<00:05:19.959> we<00:05:20.050> want<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.259> do

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
done let's cut around what we want to do

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:23.909 
done let's cut around what we want to do
you<00:05:21.819> want<00:05:21.999> to<00:05:22.059> go<00:05:22.319> this<00:05:23.319> way<00:05:23.589> it's<00:05:23.769> very

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919 
you want to go this way it's very

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.379 
you want to go this way it's very
confusing<00:05:24.099> because<00:05:24.669> you<00:05:24.819> have<00:05:24.939> to<00:05:25.029> go<00:05:25.179> up<00:05:25.239> to

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:25.389 
confusing because you have to go up to

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:26.909 
confusing because you have to go up to
quite<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.689> tale<00:05:25.869> but<00:05:26.139> anything<00:05:26.499> all<00:05:26.679> may<00:05:26.860> be

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
quite the tale but anything all may be

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:28.679 
quite the tale but anything all may be
logically<00:05:27.489> you<00:05:27.519> would<00:05:27.669> go<00:05:27.909> from<00:05:28.239> there<00:05:28.449> no

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 
logically you would go from there no

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.379 
logically you would go from there no
doubt<00:05:29.219> you<00:05:30.219> have<00:05:30.339> to<00:05:30.489> go<00:05:30.610> around<00:05:30.669> that<00:05:30.909> way<00:05:30.969> go

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
doubt you have to go around that way go

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:36.479 
doubt you have to go around that way go
down<00:05:32.319> this<00:05:32.469> way<00:05:32.529> and<00:05:34.860> we<00:05:35.860> have<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.159> climb<00:05:36.339> these

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:36.489 
down this way and we have to climb these

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:40.139 
down this way and we have to climb these
platforms<00:05:36.849> here<00:05:37.389> I<00:05:37.419> believe<00:05:38.669> very<00:05:39.669> simple

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:40.149 
platforms here I believe very simple

00:05:40.149 --> 00:05:41.429 
platforms here I believe very simple
route<00:05:40.329> I<00:05:40.509> don't<00:05:40.689> know<00:05:40.749> why<00:05:40.869> I'm<00:05:40.989> telling<00:05:41.049> you

the way to go as well you could figure

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:44.879 
the way to go as well you could figure
it<00:05:43.659> out<00:05:43.779> for<00:05:43.959> yourself<00:05:44.019> if<00:05:44.589> you're<00:05:44.739> playing
