00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.720
 Many people confuse the terms cement and concrete 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.530
 the cement is a gray powder 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.409
 which is used to make concrete 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.609
 It is also an ingredient of the mortar used to place bricks 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.669
 It is also used to pave roads 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.509
 build dams or cover reservoirs 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.509
 let's see this work material 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.669
 the process starts in the limestone quarry 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.239
 limestone that is near the surface has a high content of 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.460
 silica and rice and aluminum oxide 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.800
 deeper 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 the limestone is more pure contain less of those minerals and more carbonate 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.230
 of calcium 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.770
 In this factory both types of rock are used 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.770
 varying the proportions to make different types of cement 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.410
 the operators drill the rock wall and place explosives in the holes 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.650
 for security reasons 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.430
 Operators must stand behind the area they are flying keeping 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 a distance of at least 50 meters 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.940
 after the explosion the blades come into action 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.300
 load the rocks in dumps with a capacity of 50 tons 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.610
 then they carry their cargo to the nearby cement plant 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.560
 in the plant the dump trucks empty the rocks in what is called shredder 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.400
 primary 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.200
 The primary crusher reduced the approximate size of tennis balls 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.950
 a constant stream of water prevents dust from accumulating and depositing on 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.950
 hoppers 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.550
 two 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 two 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.820
 from there a conveyor belt carry the rocks up 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.320
 a secondary crusher that reducing the size of goal balls 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:17.269
 the rocks rich in calcium carbonate and the low carbon act are crushed 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.269
 separately 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.599
 now is the time to mix both the proportion varies according to the type of 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.429
 cement that is made 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:32.679
 this machine called triple apte heaps of the required proportions 

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:36.539
 this is called pure mixture 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:41.159
 then a recuperator loads the mixture in a machine called 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:44.159
 roller crusher 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:48.930
 depending on the minerals present naturally in the crushed rock the 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:52.219
 Factory adds minerals is as follows 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:53.919
 and a rÃºa 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.919
 Certain types of cement also require aluminum oxide 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.709
 the roller mixes and shreds the ingredients evenly producing 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.939
 a dry rock powder that they call raw food 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.459
 that powder passes a preheated hours 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.669
 the temperature of the powder is 80 degrees before entering 40 seconds these 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:15.069
 ten times hotter 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.329
 thus begins the process of joining the minerals that will later harden 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.159
 when they hydrate with water 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.559
 the preheater a is equipped with a fast calcination 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:29.479
 in about five seconds it removes 95% of the carbon dioxide from the powder 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.429
 through a chemical reaction 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:35.270
 this to island the lime that is the most important element of cement 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.740
 the dust passes a rotary kiln a huge cylindrical furnace that moves it from 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.719
 up and down 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:45.159
 the oven rotates about two revolutions per minute to ensure that the material 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.869
 travel at the right speed 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:52.239
 the gas flame of the burner that is in the background burns at a thousand 700 degrees 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:53.609
 centigrade 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.480
 when the dust that approaches the reaches the thousand 500 degrees merge 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.479
 pieces like marbles that are called chemistry 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.459
 When the clinker leaves the oven, large fans cool it down 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.760
 a temperature of 60 degrees it is important to cool the cinca quickly 

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:16.239
 to obtain quality cement from there, the clinker passes to the 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.239
 storage 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.040
 The final step in the manufacture of cement is the final crushing 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.509
 plaster is added to the customer 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:35.189
 The precise quantity varies according to the type of cement that is manufactured 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.959
 plaster delays the time it takes cement to set so you can 

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.770
 work up to two hours before it hardens 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.129
 cement roller mills are called ball mills 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:46.720
 because they contain metal balls 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.920
 about 150 tons in the largest mills 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.569
 as the roller rotates 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.490
 the balls crush and crush the clinker and plaster to create a powder 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.270
 fine 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.850
 So cement is not a hard job
