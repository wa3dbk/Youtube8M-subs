auditing of those figures they can do

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.279 
auditing of those figures they can do
that<00:00:26.640> that'll<00:00:27.300> get<00:00:27.420> some<00:00:27.630> credibility<00:00:27.990> back

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that that'll get some credibility back

that that'll get some credibility back
but<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> fact<00:00:29.070> remains<00:00:29.130> is<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> only

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
but the fact remains is that the only

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.069 
but the fact remains is that the only
reason<00:00:30.359> why<00:00:30.900> these<00:00:30.960> CD<00:00:31.679> s<00:00:31.800> guys<00:00:32.070> are<00:00:32.430> able<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
reason why these CD s guys are able to

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.540 
reason why these CD s guys are able to
to<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.200> hey<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.520> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to make hey it's because this is a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.850 
to make hey it's because this is a
country<00:00:35.790> which<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.079> much<00:00:37.320> at<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> behest

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
country which is so much at the behest

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.229 
country which is so much at the behest
of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.160> markets<00:00:38.700> because<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.120> their

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
of the markets because of their

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.420 
of the markets because of their
extraordinarily<00:00:39.719> high<00:00:40.410> debt<00:00:40.739> levels<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:41.280> is

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
extraordinarily high debt levels this is

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.250 
extraordinarily high debt levels this is
the<00:00:41.550> real<00:00:41.730> point<00:00:42.000> not<00:00:42.270> regulation<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.930> CD

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
the real point not regulation of the CD

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
the real point not regulation of the CD
s<00:00:43.350> market<00:00:43.860> isn't<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.160> yeah<00:00:44.910> i<00:00:44.940> agree<00:00:45.270> i<00:00:45.480> think

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
s market isn't it yeah i agree i think

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.290 
s market isn't it yeah i agree i think
in<00:00:46.140> general<00:00:46.469> now<00:00:47.010> everybody<00:00:47.489> thinks<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:47.969> we

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
in general now everybody thinks that we

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.959 
in general now everybody thinks that we
need<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.510> regulation<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.829> think<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.820> need

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
need more regulation I think we need

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.069 
need more regulation I think we need
less<00:00:51.270> regulation<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.250> need<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
less regulation but what we need is

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.760 
less regulation but what we need is
regulation<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.500> makes<00:00:55.890> sense<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:57.379> my<00:00:58.379> point

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
regulation that makes sense and my point

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.599 
regulation that makes sense and my point
is<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.809> were<00:01:01.230> real<00:01:01.680> interest<00:01:02.370> rates

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
is if there were real interest rates

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
is if there were real interest rates
that<00:01:03.059> are<00:01:03.090> high<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:04.260> wouldn't<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:04.799> all<00:01:05.040> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
that are high you wouldn't have all the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340 
that are high you wouldn't have all the
speculation<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.240> we've<00:01:06.510> had<00:01:06.720> over<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.260> last

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
speculation that we've had over the last

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.359 
speculation that we've had over the last
10-15<00:01:08.130> years<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:10.020> again<00:01:10.500> i'm<00:01:10.830> going<00:01:11.130> back

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
10-15 years and so again i'm going back

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
10-15 years and so again i'm going back
to<00:01:11.610> easy<00:01:11.970> monetary<00:01:12.570> policies<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> fed<00:01:13.830> in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
encouraged speculation on a incredible

out AIG I think AIG should have gone
bust<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.380> whole<00:01:37.729> derivatives

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
bust and then the whole derivatives

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.740 
bust and then the whole derivatives
market<00:01:39.299> would<00:01:39.450> have<00:01:39.659> shrunk<00:01:40.369> but<00:01:41.369> each<00:01:41.670> time

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
market would have shrunk but each time

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.139 
market would have shrunk but each time
you<00:01:42.750> bail<00:01:42.990> out<00:01:43.259> someone<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.159> that's<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.820> form

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you bail out someone and that's a form

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.719 
you bail out someone and that's a form
of<00:01:45.360> regulating<00:01:46.170> markets<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:47.280> create

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
of regulating markets you create

mark<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.219> I'd<00:02:05.790> rather<00:02:05.850> live<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.509> world

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
mark and I'd rather live in a world

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.270 
mark and I'd rather live in a world
where<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:07.020> could<00:02:07.290> borrow<00:02:07.530> at<00:02:07.799> two<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.099> three

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
where I could borrow at two or three

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.160 
where I could borrow at two or three
percent<00:02:08.670> rather<00:02:09.300> than<00:02:09.509> one<00:02:09.690> where<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:09.899> could

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

borrow at six or seven

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.720 
borrow at six or seven
and<00:02:12.370> basically<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.720> just<00:02:13.840> about<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.490> moral

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
and basically it's just about the moral

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.880 
and basically it's just about the moral
hazard<00:02:16.240> aspect<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:16.810> think<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.290> mean<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.530> long<00:02:17.710> as

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
hazard aspect I think I mean as long as

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.850 
hazard aspect I think I mean as long as
you<00:02:18.100> tell<00:02:18.400> people<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.330> if<00:02:20.260> you<00:02:20.680> have

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
you tell people that if you have

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.440 
you tell people that if you have
borrowed<00:02:21.130> too<00:02:21.400> much<00:02:21.610> and<00:02:21.790> you<00:02:21.850> can't<00:02:22.120> pay<00:02:22.330> it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
borrowed too much and you can't pay it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.090 
borrowed too much and you can't pay it
back<00:02:22.660> then<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.470> will<00:02:23.590> suffer<00:02:23.920> consequences

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
back then you will suffer consequences

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.490 
back then you will suffer consequences

view on November twenty-fifths when the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.090 
view on November twenty-fifths when the
Euro<00:03:12.130> went<00:03:12.430> over<00:03:12.940> 150<00:03:13.720> one<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.860> was<00:03:15.070> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
Euro went over 150 one that this was a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.090 
Euro went over 150 one that this was a
false<00:03:15.430> breakout<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.630> that<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.650> Euro<00:03:17.890> would

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
false breakout and that the Euro would

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.250 
false breakout and that the Euro would
then<00:03:18.280> correct<00:03:18.760> on<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.209> downside<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:20.080> we

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
then correct on the downside then we

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.430 
then correct on the downside then we
went<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.560> 134<00:03:21.550> and<00:03:21.880> now<00:03:22.360> we<00:03:22.420> rebound<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.290> to

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
went to 134 and now we rebound it to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.449 
went to 134 and now we rebound it to
over<00:03:23.800> 137<00:03:24.760> we're<00:03:25.269> at<00:03:25.420> 136<00:03:26.320> something<00:03:26.860> today<00:03:27.070> I

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
over 137 we're at 136 something today I

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.259 
over 137 we're at 136 something today I
think<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:29.200> taller<00:03:29.530> may<00:03:30.220> weaken<00:03:30.760> somewhat

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
think the taller may weaken somewhat

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.300 
think the taller may weaken somewhat
more<00:03:31.630> against<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.260> euro<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.620> maybe<00:03:32.950> around

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
more against the euro to maybe around

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.479 
more against the euro to maybe around
140<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:34.810> thereafter<00:03:35.190> strengthened<00:03:36.190> again

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
140 but thereafter strengthened again

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:38.820 
140 but thereafter strengthened again
against<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.180> euro<00:03:37.390> because<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.380> believer

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
against the euro because I'm a believer

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.360 
against the euro because I'm a believer
that<00:03:39.070> the<00:03:39.690> EU<00:03:40.690> will<00:03:40.720> bail<00:03:41.260> out<00:03:41.530> Greece<00:03:42.010> and

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
that the EU will bail out Greece and

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.120 
that the EU will bail out Greece and
then<00:03:42.610> they'll<00:03:42.790> have<00:03:42.820> to<00:03:43.300> pay<00:03:43.690> laut<00:03:43.989> others<00:03:44.530> so

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
then they'll have to pay laut others so

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.210 
then they'll have to pay laut others so
again<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.820> kind<00:03:46.180> of<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.360> monetization

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
again it's kind of a monetization

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.420 
again it's kind of a monetization
process<00:03:48.220> and<00:03:48.690> therefore<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:50.080> don't<00:03:50.590> regard<00:03:51.040> the

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
process and therefore I don't regard the

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.530 
process and therefore I don't regard the
euro<00:03:51.730> as<00:03:51.970> being<00:03:53.400> significantly<00:03:54.540> better

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
euro as being significantly better

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.140 
euro as being significantly better
currency<00:03:56.290> than<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.620> u.s.<00:03:56.920> Daleks<00:03:57.489> especially

currency than the u.s. Daleks especially

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.479 
currency than the u.s. Daleks especially
not<00:03:58.330> that<00:03:58.360> this<00:03:58.630> exchange<00:03:58.930> rate<00:03:59.350> level<00:03:59.800> i<00:03:59.950> mean

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
not that this exchange rate level i mean

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.630 
not that this exchange rate level i mean
i<00:04:00.640> traveled<00:04:01.180> through<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.390> United<00:04:01.959> States

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.620 
i traveled through the United States
recently<00:04:03.640> and<00:04:04.300> to<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.350> EU<00:04:05.560> recently<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.640> mean

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
recently and to the EU recently I mean

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.039 
recently and to the EU recently I mean
in<00:04:07.810> America<00:04:08.350> outside<00:04:08.950> New<00:04:09.580> York<00:04:09.610> Los<00:04:10.510> Angeles

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
in America outside New York Los Angeles

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.830 
in America outside New York Los Angeles
San<00:04:11.290> Francisco<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.730> can<00:04:12.880> find<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.299> perfectly

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
San Francisco you can find a perfectly

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.320 
San Francisco you can find a perfectly
nice<00:04:13.989> hotel<00:04:14.590> for<00:04:14.890> like<00:04:15.070> a<00:04:15.100> hundred<00:04:15.340> thirty<00:04:15.790> US

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
nice hotel for like a hundred thirty US

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.110 
nice hotel for like a hundred thirty US
dollar<00:04:16.600> to<00:04:17.500> perfectly<00:04:17.919> nice<00:04:18.130> room<00:04:18.580> that<00:04:18.970> you

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
dollar to perfectly nice room that you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.360 
dollar to perfectly nice room that you
can't<00:04:19.390> find<00:04:19.510> in<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.109> EU<00:04:20.410> so<00:04:20.979> I<00:04:21.010> think<00:04:21.130> the

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
can't find in the EU so I think the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.730 
can't find in the EU so I think the
price<00:04:21.609> level<00:04:21.910> in<00:04:22.180> America<00:04:22.660> also<00:04:23.229> in<00:04:23.320> terms<00:04:23.530> of

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
price level in America also in terms of

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.800 
price level in America also in terms of
real<00:04:23.979> estate<00:04:24.130> is

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
real estate is

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.409 
real estate is
reasonably<00:04:25.440> attractive<00:04:25.669> so<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:26.700> rather<00:04:27.060> think

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
reasonably attractive so I rather think

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.860 
reasonably attractive so I rather think
that<00:04:27.720> the<00:04:27.870> taller<00:04:28.110> Bay<00:04:28.350> appreciates<00:04:29.100> somewhat

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
that the taller Bay appreciates somewhat

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.020 
that the taller Bay appreciates somewhat
against<00:04:30.870> the<00:04:31.169> yen<00:04:31.440> I<00:04:31.710> also<00:04:32.370> think<00:04:32.669> that<00:04:32.820> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
against the yen I also think that the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.050 
against the yen I also think that the
taller<00:04:33.389> will<00:04:33.630> appreciate<00:04:34.260> and<00:04:34.820> against<00:04:35.820> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
taller will appreciate and against the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.810 
taller will appreciate and against the
other<00:04:36.260> Asian<00:04:37.260> currencies<00:04:37.860> I<00:04:38.010> think<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.490> the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
other Asian currencies I think that the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.570 
other Asian currencies I think that the
dollar<00:04:39.060> will<00:04:39.270> rather<00:04:39.570> depreciate<00:04:40.470> further

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
dollar will rather depreciate further

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.750 
dollar will rather depreciate further
because<00:04:41.580> I<00:04:42.080> think<00:04:43.080> eventually<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:44.310> Chinese

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
because I think eventually the Chinese

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.060 
because I think eventually the Chinese
will<00:04:45.030> let<00:04:45.270> their<00:04:45.480> currency<00:04:46.070> appreciate

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
will let their currency appreciate

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.490 
will let their currency appreciate
somewhat<00:04:47.610> more<00:04:47.970> not<00:04:48.690> so<00:04:48.900> much<00:04:49.050> under<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
somewhat more not so much under the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.409 
somewhat more not so much under the
pressure<00:04:49.740> of<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.190> United<00:04:50.610> States<00:04:50.639> but<00:04:51.360> I

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
pressure of the United States but I

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.330 
pressure of the United States but I
think<00:04:51.720> they<00:04:51.810> will<00:04:51.960> recognize<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.860> it's<00:04:53.070> for

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
think they will recognize that it's for

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.909 
think they will recognize that it's for
the<00:04:53.460> more<00:04:53.730> desirable<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:55.050> have<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.290> currency

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
the more desirable to have a currency

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.800 
the more desirable to have a currency
that<00:04:55.950> is<00:04:56.130> slightly<00:04:56.550> stronger<00:04:57.000> than<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.510> is<00:04:57.630> at

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
that is slightly stronger than it is at

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.600 
that is slightly stronger than it is at
the<00:04:57.930> present<00:04:58.110> time<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.130> know<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.430> viewer

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
the present time and I know the viewer

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.100 
the present time and I know the viewer
was<00:04:59.760> asking<00:05:00.090> about<00:05:00.150> gold<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.750> we<00:05:00.810> have<00:05:00.960> an

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
was asking about gold and we have an

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.140 
was asking about gold and we have an
email<00:05:01.590> in<00:05:01.710> from<00:05:01.889> John<00:05:02.160> asking<00:05:02.550> about<00:05:02.700> gold<00:05:02.970> as

email in from John asking about gold as

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.670 
email in from John asking about gold as
well<00:05:03.180> can<00:05:03.479> you<00:05:03.600> ask<00:05:03.750> your<00:05:03.990> guests<00:05:04.200> if<00:05:04.470> he

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
well can you ask your guests if he

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.050 
well can you ask your guests if he
thinks<00:05:04.860> currency<00:05:05.340> debasement<00:05:05.520> will

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
thinks currency debasement will

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.060 
thinks currency debasement will
necessarily<00:05:06.389> lead<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:06.990> higher<00:05:07.410> much<00:05:08.040> higher

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
necessarily lead to higher much higher

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.920 
necessarily lead to higher much higher
gold<00:05:08.610> prices<00:05:08.880> could<00:05:09.210> Bernanke<00:05:09.660> &amp;<00:05:09.780> Co

manipulate gold prices I don't think

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.300 
manipulate gold prices I don't think
they<00:05:12.720> can<00:05:12.780> manipulate<00:05:13.110> it<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.889> think<00:05:14.160> we

they can manipulate it I think we

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.969 
they can manipulate it I think we
already<00:05:14.520> have<00:05:15.000> now<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.360> gold<00:05:15.780> standard<00:05:16.200> it's

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
already have now a gold standard it's

gold now we'll gold always go up I
mentioned<00:05:38.700> earlier<00:05:39.150> on<00:05:39.360> that<00:05:39.810> in<00:05:40.520> periods<00:05:41.520> of

rapid and accelerating inflation you

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.380 
rapid and accelerating inflation you
have<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.690> shift<00:05:45.930> assets<00:05:46.620> back<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.130> forth<00:05:47.460> so

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
have to shift assets back and forth so

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:54.529 
have to shift assets back and forth so
between<00:05:49.039> 2001<00:05:50.039> and<00:05:51.919> 2008<00:05:52.919> you<00:05:53.820> had<00:05:54.060> to<00:05:54.330> be<00:05:54.510> in

gold and out of equities basically

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.210 
gold and out of equities basically
because<00:05:57.180> gold<00:05:57.389> outperformed<00:05:58.139> currencies<00:05:59.070> and

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
because gold outperformed currencies and

the<00:06:20.639> SP<00:06:21.240> has<00:06:21.419> marginally<00:06:21.979> outperformed<00:06:22.979> gold

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 
the SP has marginally outperformed gold

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.310 
the SP has marginally outperformed gold

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:25.320 
so there are times when equities will do

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.860 
so there are times when equities will do
