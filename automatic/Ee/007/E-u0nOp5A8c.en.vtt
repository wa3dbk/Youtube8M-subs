00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
I have assembled a number of projects on

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.560 
I have assembled a number of projects on
here<00:00:29.510> from<00:00:29.900> cabinets<00:00:30.560> and<00:00:30.830> tables<00:00:31.340> and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
here from cabinets and tables and

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.440 
here from cabinets and tables and
knowing<00:00:32.570> that<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:33.220> surface<00:00:34.220> is<00:00:34.730> perfectly

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
knowing that this surface is perfectly

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.290 
knowing that this surface is perfectly
flat<00:00:35.750> has<00:00:36.470> been<00:00:36.739> great<00:00:37.130> for<00:00:37.520> assembling<00:00:38.180> those

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
flat has been great for assembling those

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.410 
flat has been great for assembling those
projects<00:00:38.900> my<00:00:39.530> old<00:00:39.890> top<00:00:40.190> was<00:00:40.489> decidedly<00:00:41.000> not

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
projects my old top was decidedly not

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.710 
projects my old top was decidedly not
flat<00:00:41.800> and<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:42.980> was<00:00:43.190> trouble<00:00:44.059> for<00:00:44.360> trying<00:00:44.480> to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
flat and that was trouble for trying to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.049 
flat and that was trouble for trying to
do<00:00:44.840> any<00:00:45.050> kind<00:00:45.230> of<00:00:45.350> assembly<00:00:45.770> at<00:00:46.250> often<00:00:46.610> resorts

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059

concrete<00:00:48.860> floor<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:50.750> this<00:00:50.930> has<00:00:51.140> been<00:00:51.320> just

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
concrete floor so this has been just

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.160 
concrete floor so this has been just
awesome<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.040> heights<00:00:52.370> been<00:00:52.610> great<00:00:53.170> pretty

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
awesome the heights been great pretty

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.530 
awesome the heights been great pretty
high<00:00:54.519> starting<00:00:55.519> is<00:00:55.760> right<00:00:55.940> in<00:00:56.059> front<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.360> me

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
high starting is right in front of me

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.399 
high starting is right in front of me
and<00:00:57.370> it's<00:00:58.370> been<00:00:58.519> wonderful<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.210> one<00:00:59.900> downside

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
and it's been wonderful the one downside

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.369 
and it's been wonderful the one downside
so<00:01:00.739> far<00:01:01.040> is<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.550> front<00:01:01.879> vise<00:01:02.170> I've<00:01:03.170> just

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
so far is this front vise I've just

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.140 
so far is this front vise I've just
reattach<00:01:03.680> tit<00:01:04.190> in<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.309> same<00:01:04.550> location<00:01:05.120> where

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
reattach tit in the same location where

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.840 
reattach tit in the same location where
it<00:01:05.449> was<00:01:05.600> on<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.780> old<00:01:05.960> bench<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:07.430> problem

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
it was on the old bench and the problem

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.850 
it was on the old bench and the problem
is<00:01:08.000> this<00:01:08.270> bench<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.720> quite<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:08.990> bit<00:01:09.229> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
is this bench is quite a bit the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.160 
is this bench is quite a bit the
tabletop<00:01:10.400> here<00:01:10.640> is<00:01:10.729> quite<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:10.970> bit<00:01:11.210> deeper

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
tabletop here is quite a bit deeper

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.100 
tabletop here is quite a bit deeper
taller<00:01:12.890> than<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.580> old<00:01:14.420> one<00:01:14.600> was<00:01:14.750> just<00:01:14.870> about<00:01:15.050> a

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
taller than the old one was just about a

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.110 
taller than the old one was just about a
couple<00:01:15.409> inches<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:15.920> this<00:01:15.979> is<00:01:16.040> about<00:01:16.400> four<00:01:16.940> or

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
couple inches and this is about four or

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.300 
couple inches and this is about four or
five<00:01:17.299> inches<00:01:17.330> so<00:01:18.290> this<00:01:18.409> vise<00:01:18.680> is<00:01:18.860> now<00:01:18.979> sitting

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
five inches so this vise is now sitting

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.969 
five inches so this vise is now sitting
below<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:20.060> top<00:01:20.299> and<00:01:20.690> that's<00:01:21.590> been<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> real

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
below the top and that's been a real

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.910 
below the top and that's been a real
problem<00:01:22.010> if<00:01:22.610> I<00:01:22.760> want<00:01:23.000> to<00:01:23.060> use<00:01:23.210> any<00:01:23.420> other<00:01:23.450> dogs

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
problem if I want to use any other dogs

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
reach above the surface so I need to

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.600 
reach above the surface so I need to
raise<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.970> place<00:01:35.240> up<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:35.870> also<00:01:36.800> this<00:01:37.190> back

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.660 
jaw is proud of the surface and I'd like
to<00:01:41.480> inset<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.230> so<00:01:42.860> that<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.100> back<00:01:43.280> jaws<00:01:43.550> is

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
to inset that so that the back jaws is

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.180 
to inset that so that the back jaws is
perfectly<00:01:44.120> flat<00:01:44.990> with<00:01:45.230> this<00:01:45.410> front<00:01:45.770> surface

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
perfectly flat with this front surface

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.650 
perfectly flat with this front surface
so<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.370> can<00:01:46.490> clamp<00:01:46.640> some<00:01:46.910> longer<00:01:47.210> boards<00:01:47.540> across

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
so I can clamp some longer boards across

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.470 
so I can clamp some longer boards across
the<00:01:48.140> whole<00:01:48.320> front<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.370> I<00:01:49.400> need<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:49.970> raise<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.360> up

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:50.480 
the whole front so I need to raise it up

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.690 
the whole front so I need to raise it up
and<00:01:50.780> inset<00:01:51.320> it<00:01:51.440> a<00:01:51.500> little<00:01:51.680> bit

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
and inset it a little bit

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.780 
and inset it a little bit
it<00:01:53.240> shouldn't<00:01:53.480> be<00:01:53.570> too<00:01:53.750> tricky<00:01:54.020> I<00:01:54.790> attached

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
it shouldn't be too tricky I attached

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.150 
it shouldn't be too tricky I attached
with<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.060> couple<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.360> bolts<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:57.860> put<00:01:58.040> in

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
with a couple of bolts and I put in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.420 
with a couple of bolts and I put in
Phillip<00:01:58.490> blocks<00:01:58.730> with<00:01:58.910> those<00:01:59.030> bolts<00:01:59.390> go<00:01:59.570> so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
Phillip blocks with those bolts go so

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
Phillip blocks with those bolts go so
process<00:02:01.430> should<00:02:01.670> be<00:02:01.790> as<00:02:01.880> simple<00:02:02.030> as<00:02:02.270> flipping

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
process should be as simple as flipping

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.810 
process should be as simple as flipping
this<00:02:02.720> top<00:02:02.960> over<00:02:03.380> marking<00:02:04.190> where<00:02:04.400> I<00:02:04.430> need<00:02:04.670> to

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
remove some material in order to inset

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.270 
remove some material in order to inset
this<00:02:07.550> and<00:02:07.880> raise<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.660> up<00:02:08.810> and<00:02:09.050> then<00:02:09.979> reattach

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
this and raise it up and then reattach

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.720 
this and raise it up and then reattach
it<00:02:10.989> I've<00:02:11.989> now<00:02:12.170> got<00:02:12.230> the<00:02:12.500> tabletop<00:02:13.129> upside<00:02:13.519> down

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
it I've now got the tabletop upside down

it I've now got the tabletop upside down
and<00:02:13.959> I<00:02:14.959> need<00:02:15.019> to<00:02:15.530> raise<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:16.700> from<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
and I need to raise this from the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.160 
and I need to raise this from the
underside<00:02:17.840> about<00:02:18.620> an<00:02:18.830> inch<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.250> half<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
underside about an inch and a half and

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
underside about an inch and a half and
luckily<00:02:21.170> that's<00:02:21.290> less<00:02:21.530> than<00:02:21.560> these<00:02:21.800> bars<00:02:22.129> so<00:02:22.670> I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
luckily that's less than these bars so I

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.380 
luckily that's less than these bars so I
only<00:02:22.970> need<00:02:23.120> to<00:02:23.569> cut<00:02:23.870> out<00:02:24.099> around<00:02:25.099> this<00:02:25.580> metal

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
only need to cut out around this metal

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.580 
only need to cut out around this metal
to<00:02:26.770> recess<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.610> these<00:02:28.880> metal<00:02:29.240> port

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
to recess just these metal port

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.040 
to recess just these metal port
on<00:02:29.800> each<00:02:29.950> side<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.819> then<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.510> need<00:02:31.690> to<00:02:31.720> move<00:02:31.930> it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
on each side and then I need to move it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.330 
on each side and then I need to move it
back<00:02:32.459> about<00:02:33.459> 5/8<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:34.300> an<00:02:34.420> inch<00:02:34.560> so<00:02:35.560> I'll<00:02:35.769> redo

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
back about 5/8 of an inch so I'll redo

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.119 
back about 5/8 of an inch so I'll redo
these<00:02:36.459> bolt<00:02:36.819> holes<00:02:36.910> and<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.560> know<00:02:38.650> cut<00:02:39.010> out

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
these bolt holes and you know cut out

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.910 
these bolt holes and you know cut out
the<00:02:39.370> front<00:02:39.760> apron<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:41.170> recess<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.830> whole

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the front apron to recess the whole

00:02:41.920 --> 00:03:24.110 
the front apron to recess the whole
thing

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.440 

cut<00:03:24.569> through<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.870> front<00:03:25.739> apron<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:27.360> so

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
cut through the front apron and just so

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.990 
cut through the front apron and just so
happens<00:03:27.810> that's<00:03:27.959> the<00:03:28.170> exact<00:03:28.560> amount<00:03:29.000> that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
happens that's the exact amount that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.910 
happens that's the exact amount that
needed<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.300> recess<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.260> voice<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:31.769> that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
needed to recess the voice so that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.550 
needed to recess the voice so that
worked<00:03:32.099> out<00:03:32.250> perfectly<00:03:32.730> for<00:03:33.030> me<00:03:33.379> and<00:03:34.379> then<00:03:34.530> I

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
worked out perfectly for me and then I

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.559 
worked out perfectly for me and then I
started<00:03:35.099> taking<00:03:35.910> out<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.209> bulk<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:36.480> the

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
started taking out the bulk of the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.369 
started taking out the bulk of the
material<00:03:36.989> here<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.640> tried<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> router<00:03:38.970> first

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
material here I tried the router first

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.089 
material here I tried the router first
quickly<00:03:40.379> realized<00:03:40.620> that's<00:03:40.830> gonna<00:03:40.920> take

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
quickly realized that's gonna take

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:44.180 
quickly realized that's gonna take
forever<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:41.670> grab<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.780> drill<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.830> Forstner

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
forever so grab the drill the Forstner

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.390 
forever so grab the drill the Forstner
bit<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.760> took<00:03:45.629> out<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.930> bulk<00:03:46.170> too<00:03:47.010> to

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
bit and took out the bulk too to

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.509 
bit and took out the bulk too to
approximate<00:03:47.940> depth<00:03:48.150> leaving<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.569> short<00:03:49.519> ran

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
approximate depth leaving it short ran

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:51.770 
approximate depth leaving it short ran
through<00:03:50.700> a<00:03:50.730> battery<00:03:50.940> very<00:03:51.209> quickly<00:03:51.510> on<00:03:51.690> my

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
through a battery very quickly on my

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.960 
through a battery very quickly on my
Festool<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.560> remembered<00:03:53.370> of<00:03:53.459> course<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.790> had<00:03:53.940> a

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
Festool I remembered of course I had a

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.870 
Festool I remembered of course I had a
corded<00:03:54.480> drill<00:03:54.750> pulled<00:03:55.319> that<00:03:55.440> out<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:56.549> got

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
corded drill pulled that out and I got

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.970 
corded drill pulled that out and I got
rid<00:03:57.030> of<00:03:57.060> the<00:03:57.150> bulk<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.569> use<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.470> vacuum<00:03:58.860> I

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
rid of the bulk of this use the vacuum I

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.289 
rid of the bulk of this use the vacuum I
was<00:03:59.130> doing<00:03:59.340> it<00:03:59.430> try<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.730> pull<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> chips<00:04:00.180> away

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
was doing it try and pull the chips away

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.240 
was doing it try and pull the chips away
now<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.110> think<00:04:01.260> I'll<00:04:01.470> go<00:04:01.560> back<00:04:01.590> to<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:02.010> router

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
now I think I'll go back to the router

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.000 
now I think I'll go back to the router
and<00:04:02.640> clean<00:04:03.540> all<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.840> up<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.769> don't<00:04:04.829> think

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
and clean all this up and I don't think

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:16.789 
and clean all this up and I don't think
that<00:04:05.280> will<00:04:05.370> take<00:04:05.400> too<00:04:05.730> long<00:04:05.940> at<00:04:06.239> this<00:04:06.360> point

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.729 

I've<00:04:17.310> now<00:04:17.459> got<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.879> recess<00:04:18.389> created<00:04:19.049> both<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
I've now got the recess created both the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.170 
I've now got the recess created both the
front<00:04:20.069> by<00:04:20.310> cutting<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.419> cherry<00:04:21.810> apron<00:04:22.259> and

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
front by cutting the cherry apron and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.779 
front by cutting the cherry apron and
the<00:04:24.180> bottom<00:04:24.650> by<00:04:25.650> using<00:04:25.860> accommodation<00:04:26.580> of

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
the bottom by using accommodation of

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.760 
the bottom by using accommodation of
Forstner<00:04:27.479> bed<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.289> router<00:04:28.650> and<00:04:29.159> even<00:04:29.580> chisel

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
Forstner bed and router and even chisel

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.779 
Forstner bed and router and even chisel
and<00:04:31.770> hammer<00:04:32.039> I<00:04:33.440> sense<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.560> depth<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.610> bit

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
and hammer I sense the depth of the bit

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.460 
and hammer I sense the depth of the bit
so<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.060> got<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.300> nice<00:04:36.509> clean<00:04:36.900> bottom<00:04:37.319> however

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
so I got a nice clean bottom however

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.300 
so I got a nice clean bottom however
because<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.009> recess<00:04:38.310> serves<00:04:38.580> large<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:40.310> should

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
because the recess serves large I should

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.649 
because the recess serves large I should
have<00:04:41.400> routed<00:04:41.639> sort<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.120> from<00:04:42.240> front<00:04:42.509> to<00:04:42.539> back

00:04:42.649 --> 00:04:42.659 
have routed sort of from front to back

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.589 
have routed sort of from front to back
so<00:04:43.259> I<00:04:43.289> had<00:04:43.620> a<00:04:44.069> good<00:04:44.430> support<00:04:44.879> for<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.090> base<00:04:45.300> I

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
so I had a good support for the base I

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:47.300 
so I had a good support for the base I
did<00:04:45.810> not<00:04:45.930> do<00:04:46.139> that<00:04:46.319> I<00:04:46.349> sort<00:04:46.650> of<00:04:46.740> just<00:04:47.009> taken<00:04:47.250> the

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
did not do that I sort of just taken the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.909 
did not do that I sort of just taken the
whole<00:04:47.400> thing<00:04:47.580> at<00:04:47.669> the<00:04:47.699> same<00:04:47.879> time<00:04:48.560> so<00:04:49.560> the<00:04:49.710> very

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 
whole thing at the same time so the very

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.649 
whole thing at the same time so the very
middle<00:04:50.250> section<00:04:50.940> here<00:04:52.819> right<00:04:53.819> in<00:04:54.000> here<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
middle section here right in here I

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.930 
middle section here right in here I
ended<00:04:55.470> up<00:04:55.560> just<00:04:55.740> doing<00:04:56.009> by<00:04:56.159> hand<00:04:56.190> with<00:04:56.849> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
ended up just doing by hand with the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.999 
ended up just doing by hand with the
chisel<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.599> got<00:04:58.289> a<00:04:58.319> pretty<00:04:58.590> close<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.919> the

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
chisel and got a pretty close to the

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.339 
chisel and got a pretty close to the
bottom<00:04:59.159> it's<00:05:00.000> definitely<00:05:00.449> this<00:05:00.569> voice<00:05:00.810> really

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
bottom it's definitely this voice really

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.129 
bottom it's definitely this voice really
heavy<00:05:01.530> and<00:05:02.280> it's<00:05:02.639> eating<00:05:02.849> very<00:05:03.210> well<00:05:03.330> so<00:05:03.960> I'm

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
heavy and it's eating very well so I'm

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.589 
heavy and it's eating very well so I'm
not<00:05:04.229> worried<00:05:04.560> about<00:05:04.650> any<00:05:05.120> slight<00:05:06.120> differences
