keep up with the skate bag and I must

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.010 
keep up with the skate bag and I must
admit<00:01:00.490> I<00:01:00.640> do<00:01:00.760> see<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.150> lot<00:01:01.360> of<00:01:01.390> people<00:01:01.720> down<00:01:01.870> here

but<00:01:02.200> they're<00:01:02.320> always<00:01:02.470> on<00:01:02.740> BMX<00:01:03.130> is<00:01:03.720> usually

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
but they're always on BMX is usually

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.289 
but they're always on BMX is usually
very<00:01:04.750> young<00:01:05.140> kids<00:01:05.700> because<00:01:06.700> nobody<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.119> bit

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
very young kids because nobody a bit

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:08.520 
very young kids because nobody a bit
more<00:01:07.450> experience<00:01:07.869> would<00:01:07.990> be<00:01:08.020> seeing<00:01:08.350> dead

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
more experience would be seeing dead

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.380 
more experience would be seeing dead
here<00:01:08.770> so<00:01:08.979> so<00:01:09.490> you've<00:01:09.580> got<00:01:09.700> this<00:01:09.820> kind<00:01:10.000> of<00:01:10.180> caged

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
here so so you've got this kind of caged

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.050 
here so so you've got this kind of caged
area<00:01:10.840> up<00:01:11.229> here<00:01:11.470> with<00:01:11.619> the<00:01:11.680> platform<00:01:11.920> then<00:01:12.820> this

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
area up here with the platform then this

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.090 
area up here with the platform then this
fat<00:01:13.359> Bank<00:01:13.600> down<00:01:13.869> here<00:01:14.109> I<00:01:14.320> guess<00:01:14.649> you<00:01:14.829> could<00:01:14.979> do

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
fat Bank down here I guess you could do

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.810 
fat Bank down here I guess you could do
something<00:01:15.490> going<00:01:15.670> up<00:01:15.909> up<00:01:16.359> in<00:01:16.600> that<00:01:16.719> direction

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
something going up up in that direction

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090 
something going up up in that direction
but<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.570> mean<00:01:19.929> the<00:01:20.079> quality<00:01:20.259> of<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.590> floor<00:01:20.859> and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
but I mean the quality of the floor and

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.039 
but I mean the quality of the floor and
is<00:01:21.189> so<00:01:21.399> bad<00:01:21.640> that<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:22.060> probably<00:01:22.539> gonna<00:01:22.869> be

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
is so bad that you probably gonna be

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.870 
is so bad that you probably gonna be
unlikely<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.530> get<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.859> momentum<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.520> do<00:01:24.670> much

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
unlikely to get the momentum to do much

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.679 
unlikely to get the momentum to do much
there<00:01:26.249> it's<00:01:27.249> slightly<00:01:27.700> improved<00:01:28.270> from<00:01:28.420> when<00:01:28.569> I

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
there it's slightly improved from when I

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.499 
there it's slightly improved from when I
was<00:01:28.780> here<00:01:28.990> before<00:01:29.109> because<00:01:29.469> this<00:01:29.799> stuff<00:01:30.249> here

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
was here before because this stuff here

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.660 
was here before because this stuff here
apart<00:01:32.229> from<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.409> fact<00:01:32.590> if<00:01:32.890> you<00:01:33.009> can<00:01:33.159> see<00:01:33.399> it's

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
apart from the fact if you can see it's

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.849 
apart from the fact if you can see it's
just<00:01:33.729> a<00:01:33.880> really<00:01:34.090> rough<00:01:34.359> edges<00:01:34.600> there<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.799> you

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:35.859 
just a really rough edges there so you

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:37.620 
just a really rough edges there so you
get<00:01:36.009> one<00:01:36.399> skate<00:01:36.700> up<00:01:36.850> there<00:01:37.030> you'd<00:01:37.210> end<00:01:37.359> up<00:01:37.450> on

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
get one skate up there you'd end up on

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.080 
get one skate up there you'd end up on
your<00:01:37.749> ass<00:01:37.899> but<00:01:38.740> I'm<00:01:38.889> this<00:01:41.579> can<00:01:42.579> you<00:01:42.670> see<00:01:42.880> it's

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
your ass but I'm this can you see it's

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.270 
your ass but I'm this can you see it's
kind<00:01:43.359> of<00:01:43.450> rippling<00:01:43.990> as<00:01:44.170> I<00:01:44.259> put<00:01:44.469> my<00:01:44.499> weight<00:01:45.069> on

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
kind of rippling as I put my weight on

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.099 
kind of rippling as I put my weight on
it<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:46.060> absorbs<00:01:46.630> some<00:01:46.840> of<00:01:46.990> your

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
it and that absorbs some of your

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.840 
it and that absorbs some of your
momentum<00:01:47.649> a<00:01:49.289> remarkable<00:01:50.289> contrast<00:01:50.829> a<00:01:51.100> decent

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
momentum a remarkable contrast a decent

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.149 
momentum a remarkable contrast a decent
quality<00:01:51.969> rhino<00:01:52.389> ramp<00:01:52.689> see<00:01:52.899> it's<00:01:53.109> just<00:01:53.259> secured

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
quality rhino ramp see it's just secured

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:55.949 
quality rhino ramp see it's just secured
around<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.490> edges<00:01:54.909> but<00:01:55.060> there's<00:01:55.270> no<00:01:55.420> securing

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
around the edges but there's no securing

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:57.919 
around the edges but there's no securing
down<00:01:56.109> in<00:01:56.200> the<00:01:56.259> middle<00:01:56.499> so<00:01:56.649> it<00:01:56.770> doesn't<00:01:57.039> keep<00:01:57.159> it

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
down in the middle so it doesn't keep it

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.129 
down in the middle so it doesn't keep it
it<00:01:58.929> doesn't<00:01:59.200> make<00:01:59.469> it<00:02:00.749> doesn't<00:02:01.749> make<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.869> feel

it doesn't make it doesn't make it feel

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.429 
it doesn't make it doesn't make it feel
very<00:02:02.170> solid<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.920> then<00:02:03.490> you've<00:02:03.639> got<00:02:03.819> this<00:02:03.999> some

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
very solid and then you've got this some

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.599 
very solid and then you've got this some
this<00:02:05.439> little<00:02:05.740> bit<00:02:05.889> bit<00:02:06.219> up<00:02:06.340> here

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
this little bit bit up here

something<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.860> way<00:02:37.100> too<00:02:37.160> steep<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:38.390> try

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
something but way too steep to to try

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.790 
something but way too steep to to try
and<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:41.120> can<00:02:41.420> tell<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:41.780> too<00:02:42.080> steep<00:02:42.560> because

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
and you can tell it's too steep because

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.890 
and you can tell it's too steep because
see<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> way<00:02:43.670> it's<00:02:43.880> crowded<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.570> floor

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
see the way it's crowded that floor

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.360 
see the way it's crowded that floor
there<00:02:45.110> that's<00:02:45.350> not<00:02:45.560> just<00:02:45.770> filling<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.130> give<00:02:46.280> it

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
there that's not just filling to give it

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.040 
there that's not just filling to give it
a<00:02:46.430> nice<00:02:46.550> transition<00:02:47.030> that's<00:02:47.300> repair<00:02:47.660> damage

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
a nice transition that's repair damage

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.510 
a nice transition that's repair damage
from<00:02:48.200> where<00:02:48.410> peoples<00:02:48.740> come<00:02:48.950> down<00:02:49.160> off<00:02:49.340> there

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
from where peoples come down off there

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.540 
from where peoples come down off there
and<00:02:49.700> again<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.600> see<00:02:50.810> these<00:02:50.990> horrible

and again you can see these horrible

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.760 
and again you can see these horrible
whole<00:02:52.550> villages<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.240> my<00:02:53.390> foots<00:02:53.660> just<00:02:54.620> tick

now I mean that's you know that it's
going<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.150> cut<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.450> off<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:56.690> you<00:02:56.840> fall<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.380> it

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
going to cut you off if you fall it's it

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.100 
going to cut you off if you fall it's it
just<00:02:57.980> ruins<00:02:58.790> your<00:02:58.970> flow<00:02:59.240> up<00:02:59.510> and<00:02:59.720> down<00:02:59.870> and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
just ruins your flow up and down and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.930 
just ruins your flow up and down and
then<00:03:00.650> you've<00:03:00.800> got<00:03:00.950> this<00:03:01.100> little<00:03:01.370> quarter<00:03:01.730> here

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
then you've got this little quarter here

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.640 
then you've got this little quarter here
with<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.480> cage<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.020> back<00:03:03.200> it<00:03:03.380> almost

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
with a little cage on the back it almost

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.760 
with a little cage on the back it almost
seems<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.070> put<00:03:04.570> an<00:03:05.570> oxymoron<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.410> put<00:03:06.590> our

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
seems to put an oxymoron to put our

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.740 
seems to put an oxymoron to put our
safety<00:03:07.250> fencing<00:03:07.940> around<00:03:08.030> something<00:03:08.450> it's

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
safety fencing around something it's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.600 
safety fencing around something it's
just<00:03:08.960> so<00:03:09.080> innately<00:03:09.410> unsafe<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.250> horrible<00:03:10.520> in

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
just so innately unsafe and horrible in

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.790 
just so innately unsafe and horrible in
the<00:03:10.760> first<00:03:10.970> place<00:03:11.210> and<00:03:11.540> a<00:03:12.050> good<00:03:12.200> example<00:03:12.740> of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
the first place and a good example of

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.550 
the first place and a good example of
the<00:03:12.980> lack<00:03:13.850> of<00:03:13.880> safety<00:03:14.210> features<00:03:14.870> is<00:03:15.050> this<00:03:15.200> kind

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
the lack of safety features is this kind

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.190 
the lack of safety features is this kind
of<00:03:15.680> launch<00:03:15.890> box<00:03:16.280> here<00:03:16.640> which<00:03:17.330> is<00:03:17.570> just<00:03:17.600> a<00:03:17.960> way

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
of launch box here which is just a way

a skate park before um I guess the the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.380 
a skate park before um I guess the the
best<00:03:42.050> part<00:03:42.380> of<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.620> park<00:03:42.890> such<00:03:43.790> as<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.090> is

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
best part of the park such as it is

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.830 
best part of the park such as it is
easy<00:03:44.989> some<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.430> little<00:03:47.180> quarter<00:03:47.660> to

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
easy some is this little quarter to

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.600 
easy some is this little quarter to
spine<00:03:48.230> which<00:03:48.650> at<00:03:48.860> least<00:03:49.040> gives<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.400> enough

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
spine which at least gives you enough

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.220 
spine which at least gives you enough

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
float and come back and forwards again

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.620 
float and come back and forwards again
you<00:03:51.890> know<00:03:52.010> really<00:03:52.400> badly<00:03:52.640> finish<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.360> really

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
you know really badly finish so I really

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.990 
you know really badly finish so I really
hate<00:03:53.840> to<00:03:53.870> see<00:03:54.080> a<00:03:54.590> park<00:03:55.130> like<00:03:55.190> this<00:03:55.370> seat<00:03:55.760> see

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
hate to see a park like this seat see

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.340 
hate to see a park like this seat see
the<00:03:56.090> quality<00:03:56.450> of<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.630> world<00:03:56.870> in<00:03:57.050> there<00:03:57.230> is

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
the quality of that world in there is

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.250 
the quality of that world in there is
just<00:03:57.530> abysmal<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.910> down<00:03:59.150> here<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.989> be

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
just abysmal just down here just to be

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.760 
just abysmal just down here just to be
badly<00:04:00.500> welded<00:04:01.100> and<00:04:01.570> yeah<00:04:02.570> you<00:04:02.780> know<00:04:02.810> oddly<00:04:03.560> in

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
badly welded and yeah you know oddly in

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.500 
badly welded and yeah you know oddly in
there<00:04:03.950> so<00:04:04.130> that's<00:04:04.340> anywhere<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.360> the

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
there so that's anywhere that the

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.150 
there so that's anywhere that the
cements<00:04:05.989> not<00:04:06.200> well<00:04:06.380> finished<00:04:06.800> in<00:04:07.010> you're

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
cements not well finished in you're

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.350 
cements not well finished in you're
gonna<00:04:07.250> get<00:04:07.430> partly<00:04:07.820> and<00:04:07.910> that's<00:04:08.030> going<00:04:08.180> to<00:04:08.239> be

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
gonna get partly and that's going to be

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.630 
gonna get partly and that's going to be
like<00:04:08.810> extra<00:04:09.230> hours<00:04:09.620> before<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.100> dries<00:04:10.370> out

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
like extra hours before that dries out

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.729 
like extra hours before that dries out
and<00:04:10.760> the<00:04:10.850> kids<00:04:11.060> can<00:04:11.239> use<00:04:11.269> it<00:04:11.600> at<00:04:12.410> the<00:04:12.560> back

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
and the kids can use it at the back

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.940 
and the kids can use it at the back
there<00:04:12.950> also<00:04:14.050> puddles<00:04:15.050> are<00:04:15.230> formed<00:04:15.560> where<00:04:15.769> this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
there also puddles are formed where this

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.880 
there also puddles are formed where this
some<00:04:16.190> where<00:04:16.940> this<00:04:17.180> material<00:04:17.390> is<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.260> not

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
some where this material is is not

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.250 
some where this material is is not
completely<00:04:19.430> flat<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:20.780> again<00:04:20.900> that's

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
completely flat and and again that's

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.900 
completely flat and and again that's
hours<00:04:21.680> before<00:04:21.980> the<00:04:22.100> kids<00:04:22.280> can<00:04:22.460> use<00:04:22.580> that<00:04:22.760> so

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
hours before the kids can use that so

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.420 
hours before the kids can use that so
even<00:04:23.150> if<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.390> if<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.080> stopped<00:04:24.320> raining<00:04:24.740> now<00:04:25.130> and

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
even if it if it stopped raining now and

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.190 
even if it if it stopped raining now and
the<00:04:25.789> Sun<00:04:26.000> came<00:04:26.210> out<00:04:26.270> that<00:04:26.600> would<00:04:26.720> still<00:04:26.990> be<00:04:27.020> an

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
the Sun came out that would still be an

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.330 
the Sun came out that would still be an
extra<00:04:27.500> cup<00:04:27.680> of<00:04:27.800> hours<00:04:28.130> on

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
extra cup of hours on

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:29.560 
extra cup of hours on
top<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.699> rest<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.030> part<00:04:29.240> before<00:04:29.510> you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
top of the rest of the part before you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.780 
top of the rest of the part before you
can<00:04:29.720> use<00:04:29.930> it<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:31.010> don't<00:04:31.340> know<00:04:31.430> what<00:04:31.639> this

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 
can use it I don't know what this

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.070 
can use it I don't know what this
materials<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:32.840> um<00:04:34.600> it's<00:04:35.600> some<00:04:35.780> kind<00:04:35.990> of

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
materials like it's um it's some kind of

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.730 
materials like it's um it's some kind of
laminate<00:04:36.440> again<00:04:37.840> got<00:04:38.840> regular<00:04:39.199> cross<00:04:39.440> screws

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
laminate again got regular cross screws

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.920 
laminate again got regular cross screws
onto<00:04:39.919> it<00:04:40.100> so<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.310> kids<00:04:40.550> can<00:04:40.729> unscrew<00:04:41.180> it<00:04:41.210> if

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
onto it so the kids can unscrew it if

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.689 
onto it so the kids can unscrew it if
you<00:04:42.050> can<00:04:42.199> see<00:04:42.229> here<00:04:42.740> just<00:04:43.070> regular<00:04:43.460> cross

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
you can see here just regular cross

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.960 
you can see here just regular cross
cross<00:04:44.449> screws<00:04:45.310> they<00:04:46.310> don't<00:04:46.520> seem<00:04:46.760> to<00:04:46.910> have

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
cross screws they don't seem to have

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.700 
cross screws they don't seem to have
done<00:04:47.030> but<00:04:47.389> it<00:04:47.600> surprises<00:04:48.080> me<00:04:48.320> that<00:04:48.620> they

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
done but it surprises me that they

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.700 
done but it surprises me that they
haven't<00:04:49.300> probably<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.479> sign<00:04:50.780> of<00:04:51.020> how<00:04:51.169> poor<00:04:51.500> this

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
haven't probably a sign of how poor this

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.290 
haven't probably a sign of how poor this
park<00:04:51.979> is<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.220> they<00:04:52.430> can't<00:04:52.669> even<00:04:52.790> be<00:04:52.940> bothered

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
park is that they can't even be bothered

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.060 
park is that they can't even be bothered
to<00:04:53.479> come<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.780> vandalize<00:04:54.139> it<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.500> then<00:04:54.949> you've

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
to come and vandalize it and then you've

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.070 
to come and vandalize it and then you've
got<00:04:55.220> this<00:04:55.370> a<00:04:55.430> little<00:04:56.030> mini<00:04:56.300> spine<00:04:56.690> here<00:04:59.080> you

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
got this a little mini spine here you

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.690 
got this a little mini spine here you
know<00:05:00.199> nothing<00:05:00.680> coming<00:05:00.889> in<00:05:01.070> this<00:05:01.190> direction<00:05:01.250> so

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
know nothing coming in this direction so

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:02.950 
know nothing coming in this direction so
that's<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.120> kind<00:05:02.330> of<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.479> wasted<00:05:02.840> opportunity

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
that's the kind of a wasted opportunity

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.409 
that's the kind of a wasted opportunity
but<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.650> guess<00:05:03.919> coming<00:05:04.610> down<00:05:04.880> from<00:05:05.090> there<00:05:05.270> and

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419 
but I guess coming down from there and

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:07.719 
but I guess coming down from there and
over<00:05:05.660> the<00:05:05.750> spine<00:05:06.080> it's<00:05:06.650> not<00:05:06.800> too<00:05:06.979> too<00:05:07.340> big<00:05:07.490> and

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
over the spine it's not too too big and

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.700 
over the spine it's not too too big and
too<00:05:07.790> intimidating<00:05:08.630> so<00:05:08.870> it's<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.350> can<00:05:09.560> learn

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
too intimidating so it's you can learn

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.740 
too intimidating so it's you can learn
on<00:05:09.950> it

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
on it

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.469 
on it
yeah<00:05:11.750> not<00:05:12.110> not<00:05:12.860> a<00:05:12.889> very<00:05:13.190> impressive<00:05:13.400> part<00:05:13.910> 1<00:05:14.180> 2

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
yeah not not a very impressive part 1 2

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:17.530 
yeah not not a very impressive part 1 2
3<00:05:14.780> 4<00:05:15.200> 5<00:05:15.650> 6<00:05:16.100> pieces<00:05:16.550> of<00:05:16.639> equipment<00:05:16.850> our<00:05:17.210> little

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
3 4 5 6 pieces of equipment our little

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.690 
3 4 5 6 pieces of equipment our little
box<00:05:17.720> here<00:05:17.900> I<00:05:17.960> didn't<00:05:18.169> notice<00:05:18.410> that<00:05:18.590> I<00:05:18.800> guess

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 
box here I didn't notice that I guess

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.279 
box here I didn't notice that I guess
that's<00:05:19.940> better<00:05:20.120> than<00:05:20.240> nothing<00:05:20.660> but<00:05:20.690> again<00:05:20.870> if

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
that's better than nothing but again if

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:22.629 
that's better than nothing but again if
you<00:05:21.680> up<00:05:21.830> onto<00:05:22.070> the<00:05:22.220> box

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
you up onto the box

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.909 
you up onto the box
you've<00:05:23.180> got<00:05:23.360> the<00:05:23.450> danger<00:05:23.960> then<00:05:24.139> of<00:05:24.320> falling

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
you've got the danger then of falling

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.060 
you've got the danger then of falling
from<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.250> box<00:05:25.490> onto<00:05:25.760> this<00:05:26.000> onto<00:05:26.419> this<00:05:26.570> edge
