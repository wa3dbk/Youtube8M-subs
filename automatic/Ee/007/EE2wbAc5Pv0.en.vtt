your snowboard tricks the thinking goes

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.320 
your snowboard tricks the thinking goes
behind<00:00:28.599> 3<00:00:29.169> fundamentals<00:00:30.040> which<00:00:30.310> is<00:00:30.580> balanced

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
behind 3 fundamentals which is balanced

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.200 
behind 3 fundamentals which is balanced
positioning<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.290> timing<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:33.700> majority<00:00:34.180> of

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
positioning and timing the majority of

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.760 
positioning and timing the majority of
snowboarding<00:00:34.840> will<00:00:34.990> literally<00:00:35.350> be<00:00:35.530> in<00:00:35.650> your

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
snowboarding will literally be in your

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.290 
snowboarding will literally be in your
head<00:00:35.950> ten<00:00:36.340> percent<00:00:36.610> of<00:00:36.700> is<00:00:36.820> that<00:00:37.030> should<00:00:37.150> just

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
head ten percent of is that should just

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.450 
head ten percent of is that should just
stood<00:00:37.540> around<00:00:37.570> not<00:00:37.990> doing<00:00:38.020> very<00:00:38.260> much<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.400> you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
stood around not doing very much so you

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.210 
stood around not doing very much so you
want<00:00:39.850> to<00:00:39.940> get<00:00:40.060> these<00:00:40.239> three<00:00:40.480> three<00:00:40.870> things

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
want to get these three three things

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.740 
want to get these three three things
nailed<00:00:42.220> and<00:00:42.520> locked<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.880> whatnot<00:00:43.150> alright

talking about balance on your snowboard

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.420 
talking about balance on your snowboard
this<00:00:46.270> involves<00:00:46.870> how<00:00:47.050> high<00:00:47.380> up<00:00:47.650> you<00:00:47.680> are<00:00:48.010> or<00:00:48.250> how

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
this involves how high up you are or how

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.580 
this involves how high up you are or how
low<00:00:48.670> to<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.910> ground<00:00:48.970> you<00:00:49.330> are<00:00:49.450> obviously<00:00:50.080> all

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
low to the ground you are obviously all

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.710 
low to the ground you are obviously all
of<00:00:50.860> your<00:00:51.010> gravity<00:00:51.460> comes<00:00:51.940> straight<00:00:52.390> from<00:00:52.420> your

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
of your gravity comes straight from your

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.840 
of your gravity comes straight from your
core<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.470> lower<00:00:53.680> your<00:00:53.890> core<00:00:54.160> is<00:00:54.340> to<00:00:54.490> the<00:00:54.610> snow

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
core the lower your core is to the snow

core the lower your core is to the snow
the<00:00:55.420> more<00:00:55.600> balanced<00:00:55.930> you're<00:00:56.050> going<00:00:56.170> to<00:00:56.230> have

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
the more balanced you're going to have

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.960 
the more balanced you're going to have
while<00:00:56.680> on<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.830> rail<00:00:57.100> while<00:00:57.580> writing<00:00:57.850> your

fundamental<00:01:01.180> so<00:01:01.810> throughout<00:01:02.530> riding<00:01:02.980> you

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
fundamental so throughout riding you

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.829 
fundamental so throughout riding you
want<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.280> basically<00:01:03.430> relax<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.509> little<00:01:04.629> bit

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
want to basically relax a little bit

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.960 
want to basically relax a little bit
push<00:01:05.290> your<00:01:05.470> knees<00:01:05.619> out<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:06.070> edge<00:01:06.189> and<00:01:06.790> so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
push your knees out to the edge and so

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.030 
push your knees out to the edge and so
you'll<00:01:07.119> feel<00:01:07.390> your<00:01:07.540> core<00:01:07.750> almost<00:01:08.170> sink<00:01:08.470> and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
you'll feel your core almost sink and

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.950 
you'll feel your core almost sink and
that<00:01:09.250> way<00:01:09.400> you've<00:01:09.670> got<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:10.150> lot<00:01:10.450> more<00:01:10.479> balanced

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
that way you've got a lot more balanced

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.780 
that way you've got a lot more balanced
a<00:01:11.049> lot<00:01:11.170> more<00:01:11.290> stability<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.280> if<00:01:12.490> you<00:01:12.610> were<00:01:12.729> to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
a lot more stability and if you were to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.370 
a lot more stability and if you were to
fall<00:01:13.060> over<00:01:13.090> you've<00:01:13.600> got<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.109> much

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
fall over you've got this much

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.730 
fall over you've got this much
positioning<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.490> actually<00:01:15.789> move<00:01:15.969> out<00:01:16.179> of

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
positioning to actually move out of

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.870 
positioning to actually move out of
actually<00:01:17.740> going<00:01:17.979> to<00:01:18.130> fall<00:01:18.280> over<00:01:18.310> and<00:01:18.549> whatnot

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
actually going to fall over and whatnot

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.060 
actually going to fall over and whatnot
so<00:01:19.570> you<00:01:20.229> want<00:01:20.350> to<00:01:20.409> keep<00:01:20.530> that<00:01:20.560> in<00:01:20.679> mind<00:01:20.920> when

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
so you want to keep that in mind when

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:22.499 
so you want to keep that in mind when
you<00:01:21.189> come<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.429> doing<00:01:21.609> any<00:01:21.789> trick<00:01:22.090> as<00:01:22.270> well<00:01:22.420> as

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
you come to doing any trick as well as

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.599 
you come to doing any trick as well as
when<00:01:22.689> you're<00:01:22.840> riding<00:01:23.020> along<00:01:23.229> how<00:01:23.649> high<00:01:24.280> up<00:01:24.429> or

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
when you're riding along how high up or

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.940 
when you're riding along how high up or
how<00:01:24.729> low<00:01:24.969> down<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.270> need<00:01:25.359> to<00:01:25.479> be<00:01:25.799> secondly<00:01:26.799> is

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
how low down you need to be secondly is

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.190 
how low down you need to be secondly is
positioning<00:01:27.549> this<00:01:28.210> is<00:01:28.329> really<00:01:28.509> important<00:01:29.049> in

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
positioning this is really important in

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.169 
positioning this is really important in
terms<00:01:29.469> of<00:01:29.799> every<00:01:30.280> trick<00:01:30.549> that<00:01:30.819> you'll<00:01:30.999> ever

uncle<00:01:54.330> little<00:01:54.659> bit<00:01:55.580> other<00:01:56.580> positions

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
uncle little bit other positions

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.570 
uncle little bit other positions
includes<00:01:57.570> going<00:01:58.500> onto<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.190> right<00:01:59.340> foot

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
which again is basically making an

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.750 
which again is basically making an
imaginary<00:02:03.960> line<00:02:04.340> throwing<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> through<00:02:05.610> your

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
imaginary line throwing it through your

knee are all over that foot and
everything<00:02:15.840> else<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.530> position<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.190> way

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
everything else is in position that way

and<00:02:31.820> and<00:02:32.820> these<00:02:33.750> basically<00:02:34.170> form<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
and and these basically form the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.010 
and and these basically form the

on a snowboard and they can get a lot

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.020 
on a snowboard and they can get a lot
more<00:02:39.690> into<00:02:40.050> detailed<00:02:40.470> actually<00:02:41.310> which<00:02:41.730> trick

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
more into detailed actually which trick

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.570 
more into detailed actually which trick
you<00:02:42.150> want<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.420> do<00:02:42.570> but<00:02:42.870> which<00:02:43.080> there's<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.580> ton

you want to do but which there's a ton
of<00:02:44.610> positions<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.360> need<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:46.080> learn<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
of positions that need to learn and

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.470 
of positions that need to learn and
adopt<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.580> last<00:02:47.790> thing<00:02:47.970> is<00:02:48.030> your<00:02:48.239> timing

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
adopt and the last thing is your timing

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.110 
adopt and the last thing is your timing
which<00:02:49.080> is<00:02:49.260> basically<00:02:49.670> works<00:02:50.670> out<00:02:50.850> with<00:02:50.970> your

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
which is basically works out with your

which is basically works out with your
speed<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.930> works<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.290> way<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.500> want<00:02:52.980> to<00:02:53.070> jump

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
speed it works that way you want to jump

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.530 
speed it works that way you want to jump
where<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.420> land<00:02:56.360> it's<00:02:57.360> all<00:02:57.510> about

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
basically waiting for that right moment

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.420 
basically waiting for that right moment
where<00:03:00.570> you<00:03:01.010> lord<00:03:02.010> initiate<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> trick<00:03:03.140> and

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
where you lord initiate the trick and
