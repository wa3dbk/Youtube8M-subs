a bite going into the effect so check it

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.029 
a bite going into the effect so check it
out<00:00:29.880> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.449> sounds<00:00:30.600> like<00:00:30.890> is<00:00:31.890> what

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
out this is what it sounds like is what

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:37.580 
out this is what it sounds like is what
it<00:00:32.160> sounds<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.460> without<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.560> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
it sounds like without it and here is in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
it sounds like without it and here is in
the<00:00:37.800> upload<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.880> is<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.180> be<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> full

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the upload so this is going to be a full

00:00:39.600 --> 00:01:09.800 
the upload so this is going to be a full
volume<00:00:39.870> going<00:00:40.290> into<00:00:40.530> the<00:01:08.330> whole<00:01:09.330> break<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
volume going into the whole break of a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
volume going into the whole break of a
walk<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> president<00:01:11.100> with<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
walk but it's a president with the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:22.670 
walk but it's a president with the
filters<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.119> just

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.080 

so<00:01:23.680> now<00:01:23.860> it's<00:01:23.979> also<00:01:24.100> got<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.369> mode<00:01:24.610> thing<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.000> you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
so now it's also got a mode thing so you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.399 
so now it's also got a mode thing so you
switch<00:01:25.329> it<00:01:25.360> down<00:01:25.659> one<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.170> cuts<00:01:26.350> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
switch it down one and it cuts the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:27.660 
switch it down one and it cuts the
blonde<00:01:26.649> so<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.920> starts<00:01:27.159> to<00:01:27.220> sound<00:01:27.369> more<00:01:27.610> and

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
blonde so it starts to sound more and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:38.999 
blonde so it starts to sound more and
more<00:01:27.789> like<00:01:27.909> a<00:01:28.060> little<00:01:28.299> transistor<00:01:28.720> radio<00:01:38.009> I'm

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
more like a little transistor radio I'm

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.319 
more like a little transistor radio I'm
really<00:01:39.189> tailor<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.640> booster<00:01:39.939> buying<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.270> and

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
really tailor the booster buying it and

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.270 
really tailor the booster buying it and
here's<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.720> hizzle<00:01:41.079> love<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:45.130> that

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
here's the hizzle love it see that

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.580 
here's the hizzle love it see that
filter<00:01:45.670> sound<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.600> then<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.020> wall<00:01:47.259> comes

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
filter sound and then the wall comes

00:01:47.590 --> 00:02:02.969 
filter sound and then the wall comes
right<00:01:47.740> after<00:01:47.860> it<00:02:01.289> it's<00:02:02.289> you<00:02:02.470> know<00:02:02.590> it's<00:02:02.619> got<00:02:02.950> a

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
right after it it's you know it's got a

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.529 
right after it it's you know it's got a
the<00:02:03.220> woz<00:02:03.429> more<00:02:03.759> of<00:02:03.819> an<00:02:03.909> after<00:02:04.179> effect<00:02:04.209> it's

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
the woz more of an after effect it's

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.499 
the woz more of an after effect it's
more<00:02:04.659> or<00:02:04.720> less<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.869> filter<00:02:05.530> to<00:02:05.560> begin<00:02:05.890> with<00:02:06.509> but

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
more or less a filter to begin with but

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:08.940 
more or less a filter to begin with but
anyway<00:02:07.869> this<00:02:08.019> is<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.200> really<00:02:08.470> cool<00:02:08.590> pal<00:02:08.799> you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
not just a one-trick pony you can do a

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.589 
not just a one-trick pony you can do a
lot<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.370> stuff<00:02:12.580> with<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.760> just<00:02:13.030> put<00:02:13.330> it<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.540> your

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
lot of stuff with it just put it on your

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.160 
lot of stuff with it just put it on your
board<00:02:13.810> dial<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.260> in<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:16.170> recommendation

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
board dial it in and my recommendation

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.259 
board dial it in and my recommendation
is<00:02:17.260> switch<00:02:18.130> up<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.489> down<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.760> YouTube<00:02:19.060> and

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
is switch up and down in YouTube and

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:20.880 
is switch up and down in YouTube and
find<00:02:19.480> out<00:02:19.599> exactly<00:02:19.720> what<00:02:20.200> this<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.500> do<00:02:20.590> before

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
find out exactly what this can do before

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.500 
find out exactly what this can do before
you<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.130> it<00:02:21.250> because<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.880> may<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.090> more<00:02:22.329> than

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you get it because it may be more than

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.390 
you get it because it may be more than
you<00:02:22.600> think<00:02:22.750> anyway<00:02:23.680> my<00:02:23.829> name<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.010> Brian<00:02:24.220> and

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
you think anyway my name is Brian and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.949 
you think anyway my name is Brian and
