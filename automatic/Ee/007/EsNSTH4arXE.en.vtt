 Olympic helfant 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:15.809
 missed after I finished the pontomobi said cleto 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.060
 I wanted to bring an idea of ​​5 thousand Brazil is not the same first as me 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.039
 I made and maintained freedom 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.749
 that was one thing freedom is my trip back to the world, I went to 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.179
 fatima slopes to santiago de compostela buy a stop now 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.519
 super jerusalem aircraft and very high 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.320
 I'll make a good recovery in time. 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.770
 because I 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.570
 I made the round the world I believe that this is mentally is because I wanted 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.920
 Why did you have this dream? 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.240
 and I think that's why I got it 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.240
 but I think in which took office a big news thing I imagined how many 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 people have travel issues 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.060
 How many people have dreams about them? 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.970
 the phone stays 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.140
 it's just every haul walking she asks that these people have to try 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.030
 perform this type of sound 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.270
 so I think 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.800
 who wants to start this 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.180

 of some of the roads somebody made 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 where you can not go back in that line of information and tension 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.159
 Mali not here not here you take a region 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.210

 recently I do not know this new day that I wanted 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.479
 the way of faith 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.170

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.639
 but it is as good of these measures as 7h Brazil stayed less than a year 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.579

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.849
