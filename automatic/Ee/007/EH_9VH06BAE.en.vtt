00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.580
 hello everyone is nicole and I you 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.920
 welcome to this 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.560
 fourth part of the tutorial on the basics 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.810
 of html in this part we will 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.250
 learn how to make forms so 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.960
 the forms what is it good 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.510
 these are text boxes 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.760
 I will show you at the end of the text or 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.580
 then buttons to send something 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.750
 thing so I'm going to introduce you the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.690
 three 3 come out today so for 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.400
 start this tutorial going in vain this 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.770
 form earlier we will insert some 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:49.520
 form tags so fo or rmc we're going 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.210
 put a method and viale and then there 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.210
 we put post 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:00.020
 and then a little further down we will be close 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:02.690
 shape like this so here we will 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.460
 find that there is nothing yet because 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 we just put the place where we were going 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.200
 put a drop so the places where 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.869
 we will be able to insert text 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.060
 we have not yet put the text boxes 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:20.270
 so we will create the first input type 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.539
 here is the type so we will start 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.140
 by the text 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:30.640
 we will give him a name for this area on 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.849
 will call it text 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.050
 and then here we can put a value 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:38.289
 hockey downstream what it is this 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.039
 which will last from pre written in our box 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:50.959
 so we will write your text 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:52.819
 here it is updated and there is a zone 

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:57.140
 text with a mark and your text 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:59.650
 here so here I can create that 's it 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.760
 that where 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:09.220
 jeans all we want the equal etc 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:13.630
 and we can also if you do not want anything 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.640
 m I advise you story better 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.890
 you find there in all our coding 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.900
 because created a lot of coding on 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.510
 try my nights elysées the number of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.590
 lines and texts so you can 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.190
 remove this value it will give the same 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.450
 thing 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.100
 there will be nothing ready written so that 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:40.180
 it was the first one that moves will 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.630
 put br and we go to the second one 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:47.160
 tastes 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:52.660
 it's going to be a good size password 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:56.590
 like this launay we will call it mdb 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:03.640
 for password and go the wolves we do not 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:08.860
 not going to put that if I update 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:12.370
 has here a first text box and if 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:18.870
 I write a vast fort that you do not see 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:26.590
 not that nobody sees then 3rd input 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:30.100
 here it's going to be a button so a button 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:37.580
 we are going to display the silencers we are going to 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:45.200
 the line a beam equal sype equal 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:49.730
 suv is mait the nîmes we will call it 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.860
 sent no I am sent 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.840
 and here we force value because if we 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.060
 do not put vaduz look at what is 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.470
 pass an usual bep if we do not put 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.600
 finally normally if we are not 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:06.180
 value there nothing that is displayed here 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.910
 apparently it comes up with a 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.040
 upper case so here we go 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.859
 talk I advise you anyway 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:19.139
 add value equal and then sent here 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.919
 I'm just on a test so we're going 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.600
 put in English 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:27.950
 send I ask who's taking them ah 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:35.729
 well here are two who will give the value 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:41.220
 so we will write sent I update 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:47.669
 therefore see also imagine I write is not 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:50.400
 kwal forgive a password and send 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.590
 so we can process the form with 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.200
 php wings 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:58.229
 it will be the subject of future tutorial I 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.229
 do not know when I 'll do it and that's it 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:04.800
 so that's the end of this tutorial 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.750
 about the form I do not know 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.210

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.960

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:17.220
 so I'm going to update here 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.070
