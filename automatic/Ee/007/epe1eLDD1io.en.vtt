gel and I'm gonna put a little bit

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.140 
gel and I'm gonna put a little bit
underneath<00:04:55.780> and<00:04:56.229> then<00:04:56.710> line<00:04:57.129> my<00:04:57.460> eyes<00:04:57.729> with<00:04:57.759> it

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
underneath and then line my eyes with it

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.480 
underneath and then line my eyes with it
it<00:04:58.360> gives<00:04:58.629> like<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:58.930> really<00:04:59.289> cute<00:04:59.740> cool<00:05:00.099> pop

it gives like a really cute cool pop

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.369 
it gives like a really cute cool pop
that<00:05:01.060> I<00:05:01.090> really<00:05:01.389> like<00:05:01.599> especially<00:05:01.960> towards

00:05:02.369 --> 00:05:02.379 
that I really like especially towards

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:03.779 
that I really like especially towards
the<00:05:02.439> inner<00:05:02.650> corner<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:03.189> think<00:05:03.430> it<00:05:03.520> really

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
the inner corner I think it really

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.850 
the inner corner I think it really
completed<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.479> eye<00:05:04.539> look<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.050> I<00:05:05.529> wish<00:05:05.680> I<00:05:05.800> can

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
completed the eye look and I wish I can

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.649 
completed the eye look and I wish I can
wear<00:05:06.099> this<00:05:06.219> like<00:05:06.400> all<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.729> time<00:05:06.939> but<00:05:07.210> I'm<00:05:07.479> just

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:07.659 
wear this like all the time but I'm just

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.540 
wear this like all the time but I'm just
not<00:05:08.020> into<00:05:08.349> glitter<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.740> an<00:05:08.860> everyday<00:05:09.099> basis

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
not into glitter on an everyday basis

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.559 
not into glitter on an everyday basis
but<00:05:09.729> it<00:05:09.819> looks<00:05:09.939> so<00:05:10.180> good<00:05:10.360> for<00:05:10.539> this<00:05:10.629> look<00:05:10.840> so

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:12.569 
but it looks so good for this look so

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:14.790 
but it looks so good for this look so
then<00:05:13.569> I<00:05:13.599> saw<00:05:13.870> these<00:05:14.020> when<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.289> was<00:05:14.379> checking<00:05:14.590> out

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
then I saw these when I was checking out

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.439 
then I saw these when I was checking out
and<00:05:15.009> they're<00:05:15.129> just<00:05:15.159> these<00:05:15.400> like<00:05:15.610> eye<00:05:15.759> crystals

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
and they're just these like eye crystals

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:17.519 
and they're just these like eye crystals
and<00:05:16.659> you<00:05:16.719> can<00:05:16.870> pretty<00:05:17.020> much<00:05:17.110> put<00:05:17.409> them

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:17.529 
and you can pretty much put them

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:18.990 
and you can pretty much put them
anywhere<00:05:17.770> on<00:05:17.860> your<00:05:17.949> face<00:05:18.279> it's<00:05:18.610> said<00:05:18.789> to<00:05:18.819> put

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
anywhere on your face it's said to put

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.730 
anywhere on your face it's said to put
them<00:05:19.150> on<00:05:19.240> your<00:05:19.360> eyelid<00:05:19.750> but<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.169> didn't<00:05:20.439> want<00:05:20.560> to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
them on your eyelid but I didn't want to

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.649 
them on your eyelid but I didn't want to
and<00:05:21.009> it<00:05:21.729> said<00:05:21.909> to<00:05:22.000> put<00:05:22.090> them<00:05:22.240> on<00:05:22.330> a<00:05:22.360> clean

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:22.659 
and it said to put them on a clean

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.689 
and it said to put them on a clean
surface<00:05:22.900> and<00:05:23.439> I<00:05:23.560> already<00:05:23.680> had<00:05:23.889> makeup<00:05:24.189> on<00:05:24.310> so<00:05:24.669> I

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
surface and I already had makeup on so I

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.339 
surface and I already had makeup on so I
decided<00:05:25.150> to<00:05:25.240> try<00:05:25.479> it<00:05:25.539> anyway<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.080> it<00:05:26.139> worked

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
decided to try it anyway and it worked

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.320 
decided to try it anyway and it worked
out<00:05:26.469> pretty<00:05:26.529> well<00:05:26.770> some<00:05:27.729> of<00:05:27.759> them<00:05:27.939> didn't<00:05:28.210> go

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
out pretty well some of them didn't go

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.820 
out pretty well some of them didn't go
on<00:05:28.509> but<00:05:28.719> for<00:05:28.840> the<00:05:28.900> most<00:05:29.110> part<00:05:29.379> they<00:05:29.469> did<00:05:29.680> you

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
on but for the most part they did you

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.409 
on but for the most part they did you
can<00:05:29.979> see<00:05:30.159> it<00:05:30.219> took<00:05:30.370> up<00:05:30.520> some<00:05:30.669> of<00:05:30.789> my<00:05:30.879> makeup<00:05:31.090> too

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
can see it took up some of my makeup too

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.269 
can see it took up some of my makeup too
but<00:05:31.750> I<00:05:31.990> thought<00:05:32.409> it<00:05:32.500> looked<00:05:32.589> really<00:05:32.770> cool<00:05:32.889> so

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:33.279 
but I thought it looked really cool so

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:35.100 
but I thought it looked really cool so
then<00:05:34.000> I'm<00:05:34.120> just<00:05:34.150> gonna<00:05:34.360> put<00:05:34.659> a<00:05:34.690> little<00:05:34.900> bit

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
then I'm just gonna put a little bit

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.899 
then I'm just gonna put a little bit
black<00:05:35.379> eyeliner<00:05:35.860> underneath<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.639> glitter

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
black eyeliner underneath the glitter

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.209 
black eyeliner underneath the glitter
just<00:05:37.360> to<00:05:37.569> make<00:05:37.810> sure<00:05:37.979> everything<00:05:38.979> ties

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:39.219 
just to make sure everything ties

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:40.860 
just to make sure everything ties
together<00:05:39.520> and<00:05:40.060> drag<00:05:40.240> it<00:05:40.389> down<00:05:40.509> a<00:05:40.539> little<00:05:40.719> bit

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
together and drag it down a little bit

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.689 
together and drag it down a little bit
underneath<00:05:41.169> the<00:05:41.379> eye<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.650> think<00:05:41.949> black<00:05:42.400> just

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
underneath the eye I think black just

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.459 
underneath the eye I think black just
looks<00:05:42.909> better<00:05:43.089> for<00:05:43.330> pictures<00:05:43.659> sometimes<00:05:43.960> it

00:05:44.459 --> 00:05:44.469 
looks better for pictures sometimes it

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.860 
looks better for pictures sometimes it
makes<00:05:44.949> my<00:05:45.099> eyes<00:05:45.129> pop<00:05:45.310> a<00:05:45.639> little<00:05:45.879> bit<00:05:46.000> more<00:05:46.180> then

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
makes my eyes pop a little bit more then

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.260 
makes my eyes pop a little bit more then
of<00:05:47.050> course<00:05:47.319> all<00:05:47.800> season<00:05:48.129> mascara<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.909> would

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
of course all season mascara I would

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.999 
of course all season mascara I would
also<00:05:49.389> probably<00:05:49.839> recommend<00:05:50.110> using<00:05:50.500> fake

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
also probably recommend using fake

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.529 
also probably recommend using fake
eyelashes<00:05:51.639> just<00:05:51.669> because<00:05:52.029> it's<00:05:52.180> Halloween

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
eyelashes just because it's Halloween

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.029 
eyelashes just because it's Halloween
and<00:05:52.659> you<00:05:52.779> want<00:05:52.930> to<00:05:52.990> go<00:05:53.110> all<00:05:53.289> out<00:05:53.500> so<00:05:53.830> I<00:05:53.860> think

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 
and you want to go all out so I think

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:55.379 
and you want to go all out so I think
fake<00:05:54.370> eyelashes<00:05:54.819> would<00:05:54.940> look<00:05:55.060> really<00:05:55.270> pretty

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
fake eyelashes would look really pretty

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:56.780 
fake eyelashes would look really pretty
with<00:05:55.719> this<00:05:55.839> look<00:05:56.050> as<00:05:56.199> well

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:56.790 
with this look as well

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:03.070 
with this look as well

for<00:06:04.080> my<00:06:04.199> lips<00:06:04.410> I'm<00:06:04.650> going<00:06:05.040> to<00:06:05.370> use<00:06:05.580> a<00:06:05.850> Rimmel

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
for my lips I'm going to use a Rimmel

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.600 
for my lips I'm going to use a Rimmel
lipstick<00:06:06.990> in<00:06:07.169> the<00:06:07.260> colour<00:06:07.440> frosted<00:06:08.160> and<00:06:08.430> it's

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
lipstick in the colour frosted and it's

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.180 
lipstick in the colour frosted and it's
just<00:06:08.790> a<00:06:08.850> really<00:06:09.150> nude<00:06:09.440> golden<00:06:10.440> color<00:06:10.740> but<00:06:11.160> I

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
just a really nude golden color but I

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.500 
just a really nude golden color but I
think<00:06:11.400> it<00:06:11.490> goes<00:06:11.610> really<00:06:11.880> well<00:06:12.000> with<00:06:12.150> the<00:06:12.389> eyes

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
think it goes really well with the eyes

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.450 
think it goes really well with the eyes
and<00:06:12.840> the<00:06:12.900> skin<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.620> just<00:06:13.770> keeps<00:06:14.040> everything

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
and the skin and just keeps everything

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.760 
and the skin and just keeps everything
that<00:06:14.610> golden<00:06:15.120> kind<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.479> Greek<00:06:15.840> almost<00:06:16.620> like<00:06:16.710> a

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
that golden kind of Greek almost like a

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.350 
that golden kind of Greek almost like a
Greek<00:06:17.010> statue<00:06:17.280> like<00:06:17.580> your<00:06:17.760> golden<00:06:18.180> Greek

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
Greek statue like your golden Greek

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.659 
Greek statue like your golden Greek
statue<00:06:18.690> but<00:06:19.199> I<00:06:19.470> don't<00:06:20.010> know<00:06:20.100> I<00:06:20.130> think<00:06:20.310> it<00:06:20.520> looks

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
statue but I don't know I think it looks

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.310 
statue but I don't know I think it looks
really<00:06:20.760> good<00:06:21.150> with<00:06:21.300> it<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.660> then<00:06:21.750> I<00:06:21.840> also<00:06:21.990> am

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.320 
really good with it and then I also am

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.230 
really good with it and then I also am
putting<00:06:22.470> a<00:06:22.560> little<00:06:22.710> bit<00:06:22.889> of<00:06:22.979> glitter<00:06:23.220> just<00:06:24.000> in

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.180 
putting a little bit of glitter just in
the<00:06:24.630> middle<00:06:24.990> because<00:06:25.500> I<00:06:25.530> think<00:06:25.919> it<00:06:26.010> really

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
the middle because I think it really

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.010 
the middle because I think it really
draws<00:06:26.550> attention<00:06:26.729> to<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.300> middle<00:06:27.449> of<00:06:27.690> your

make<00:06:58.199> one<00:06:58.260> but<00:06:58.830> I<00:06:59.100> think<00:06:59.729> this<00:06:59.940> makeup<00:07:00.330> looks

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600

so<00:07:00.840> good<00:07:01.020> for<00:07:01.199> a<00:07:01.229> Greek<00:07:01.380> goddess

so good for a Greek goddess
the<00:07:02.070> headpiece<00:07:02.280> really<00:07:02.789> completes<00:07:03.180> it<00:07:03.360> and

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:03.539 
the headpiece really completes it and

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:05.060 
the headpiece really completes it and
