00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

for<00:00:00.870> this<00:00:00.989> step<00:00:01.319> what<00:00:01.860> we're<00:00:01.979> going<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> do<00:00:02.310> is

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
for this step what we're going to do is

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.760 
for this step what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.820> install<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.870> spindle

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
we're going to install the spindle

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.330 
we're going to install the spindle
bearings<00:00:04.799> into<00:00:05.960> the<00:00:07.069> bushing<00:00:08.069> that<00:00:08.220> we

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
bearings into the bushing that we

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.770 
bearings into the bushing that we
installed<00:00:08.550> when<00:00:08.880> we<00:00:09.000> glued<00:00:09.210> together<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
installed when we glued together the

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.709 
installed when we glued together the
z-axis<00:00:10.019> assembly<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.420> so<00:00:12.420> you're<00:00:12.540> going<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
z-axis assembly and so you're going to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.870 
z-axis assembly and so you're going to
need<00:00:12.840> two<00:00:13.019> bearings<00:00:13.440> these<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.679> our<00:00:13.920> four<00:00:14.309> ZZ

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
need two bearings these are our four ZZ

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.210 
need two bearings these are our four ZZ
art<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> size<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> bearing<00:00:17.070> and

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
art for is the size of the bearing and

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580 
art for is the size of the bearing and
then<00:00:17.340> z<00:00:17.550> seems<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.270> has<00:00:18.420> these<00:00:18.660> metal

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
then z seems that has these metal

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.529 
then z seems that has these metal
shields<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.250> either<00:00:20.400> side<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:21.000> balls<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
shields on either side of the balls and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.720 
shields on either side of the balls and
what<00:00:22.109> those<00:00:22.260> do<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> prevent<00:00:22.890> any<00:00:23.130> dust<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.550> any

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
what those do is prevent any dust or any

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.290 
what those do is prevent any dust or any
contaminants<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.539> get<00:00:24.689> into<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.080> bearing<00:00:25.380> and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
contaminants to get into the bearing and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.460 
contaminants to get into the bearing and
the<00:00:27.300> package<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.840> bearing<00:00:28.109> looks<00:00:28.289> like

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the package for the bearing looks like

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.410 
the package for the bearing looks like
this<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:29.160> if<00:00:29.820> you're<00:00:29.970> looking<00:00:30.090> for<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this so if you're looking for the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.460 
this so if you're looking for the
bearings<00:00:30.660> you<00:00:30.720> can't<00:00:30.900> find<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.170> look<00:00:31.320> for

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
bearings you can't find them look for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.950 
bearings you can't find them look for
the<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.679> boxes<00:00:32.099> instead<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
the little boxes instead and then the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
the little boxes instead and then the
last<00:00:34.079> part<00:00:34.410> we're<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
last part we're going to use this is the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
last part we're going to use this is the
quarter<00:00:36.210> inch<00:00:36.329> diameter<00:00:36.750> spindle<00:00:37.140> shaft<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
quarter inch diameter spindle shaft and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.069 
quarter inch diameter spindle shaft and
the<00:00:38.090> spindle<00:00:39.090> strap<00:00:39.270> should<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> hole<00:00:40.050> in

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the spindle strap should have a hole in

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.920 
the spindle strap should have a hole in
one<00:00:40.290> end<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.360> if<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.540> spindle<00:00:42.780> Chuck

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
one end and if your spindle Chuck

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.000 
one end and if your spindle Chuck
doesn't<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> hole<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.620> one<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> we'll

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
doesn't have a hole in one and we'll

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.520 
doesn't have a hole in one and we'll
have<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> drill<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.200> but<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.350> not

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
have to drill it and but it's not

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.720 
have to drill it and but it's not
critical<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.010> step<00:00:47.250> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> holes<00:00:47.579> in

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
critical for the step of the holes in

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
critical for the step of the holes in
there<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.239> how<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.629> recognize

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
there but that's how you can recognize

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.400 
there but that's how you can recognize
this<00:00:49.200> particular<00:00:49.649> Shack<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.410> compound

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this particular Shack in the compound

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.720 
this particular Shack in the compound
we're<00:00:52.590> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> use<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.039> whole<00:00:53.190> berries<00:00:53.550> in

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
we're going to use the whole berries in

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810 
we're going to use the whole berries in
is<00:00:53.910> locked<00:00:54.210> tight<00:00:54.360> 638<00:00:55.160> the<00:00:56.160> same<00:00:56.370> compound

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
is locked tight 638 the same compound

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.189 
is locked tight 638 the same compound
that<00:00:56.940> we<00:00:57.030> use<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.300> hold<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.660> lead<00:00:57.809> screws<00:00:58.050> on

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that we use to hold the lead screws on

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
that we use to hold the lead screws on
to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.500> motors<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.670> what<00:00:59.940> we're<00:01:00.059> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> do

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
to the motors so what we're going to do

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
to the motors so what we're going to do
is<00:01:01.190> first<00:01:02.190> just<00:01:02.820> slip<00:01:03.030> both<00:01:03.510> bearings<00:01:04.430> onto

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is first just slip both bearings onto

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
is first just slip both bearings onto
the<00:01:05.549> shaft<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.450> might<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.020> force

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the shaft it might take a little force

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.660 
the shaft it might take a little force
which<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:08.189> baguette<00:01:08.430> for<00:01:08.549> it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
which is kind of little baguette for it

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.200 
which is kind of little baguette for it
and<00:01:08.790> you'll<00:01:08.880> get<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.320> that's<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.590> and<00:01:11.460> then

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.510 

that's<00:01:15.840> two<00:01:16.110> or<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.710> we<00:01:16.799> have<00:01:16.950> both<00:01:17.130> bearings

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
that's two or so we have both bearings

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.770 
that's two or so we have both bearings
on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.420> shaft<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:20.150> look<00:01:21.150> at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.360> inside

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
on the shaft here and look at the inside

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.680 
on the shaft here and look at the inside
of<00:01:21.840> your<00:01:22.490> spindle<00:01:23.490> bushing<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.600> what

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
of your spindle bushing here and what

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.380 
of your spindle bushing here and what
you're<00:01:24.810> looking<00:01:24.930> for<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.590> any<00:01:26.070> glue<00:01:26.760> on<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
you're looking for is any glue on the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.780 
you're looking for is any glue on the
inside<00:01:27.720> surface<00:01:28.140> here<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.580> make<00:01:29.580> sure<00:01:29.729> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
inside surface here and make sure you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.130 
inside surface here and make sure you
clean<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.060> off<00:01:30.270> before<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.690> attend<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.049> this

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
clean that off before you attend to this

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.950 
clean that off before you attend to this
otherwise<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:32.070> won't<00:01:32.220> have<00:01:32.460> any<00:01:32.550> luck<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
otherwise you won't have any luck so the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.420 
otherwise you won't have any luck so the
goal<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.440> what<00:01:34.710> we're<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.130> we're

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
goal is what we're going to do we're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.389 
goal is what we're going to do we're
going<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.580> apply<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.149> thin<00:01:36.450> skin<00:01:37.190> block<00:01:38.190> pets

bottom<00:01:46.259> where<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.530> bearings<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.950> going<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
bottom where the bearings are going to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.190 
bottom where the bearings are going to
be<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.330> we're<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.539> going<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> slip<00:01:49.050> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
be and then we're just going to slip the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.630 
be and then we're just going to slip the
bearings<00:01:49.470> into<00:01:49.619> place<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> loctite<00:01:50.580> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
bearings into place and the loctite is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
bearings into place and the loctite is
going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> lock<00:01:50.970> them<00:01:51.210> down<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:52.350> suggest<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
going to lock them down I suggest that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.820 
going to lock them down I suggest that
before<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.810> apply<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.410> lock<00:01:55.619> type

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
before you actually apply the lock type

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.400 
before you actually apply the lock type
to<00:01:55.950> any<00:01:56.070> surfaces<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.810> attempt<00:01:58.289> to

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
to any surfaces that you attempt to

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.249 
to any surfaces that you attempt to
install<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.310> bearings<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.929> push

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
install the bearings in here and push

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.469 
install the bearings in here and push
them<00:02:01.410> all<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.710> way<00:02:01.800> through<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.390> this

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
them all the way through so you see this

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.940 
them all the way through so you see this
one<00:02:03.660> start<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.899> come<00:02:04.050> out<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.289> top<00:02:04.320> here<00:02:04.800> and

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
one start to come out the top here and

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.040 
one start to come out the top here and
still<00:02:05.160> have<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:05.369> one<00:02:05.550> on<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> bottom<00:02:06.050> what

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
still have this one on the bottom what

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.419 
still have this one on the bottom what
I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> do<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.619> just<00:02:07.649> kind<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.009> pen<00:02:08.250> sit

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
I'm going to do is just kind of pen sit

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.580 
I'm going to do is just kind of pen sit
with<00:02:08.550> my<00:02:08.700> hands<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.269> that<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.170> bearings

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
with my hands so that now the bearings

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.560 
with my hands so that now the bearings
are<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:11.039> flush<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.910> top<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.390> bottom

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
are just flush with the top and bottom

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.140 
are just flush with the top and bottom
they're<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.290> down<00:02:13.739> inside<00:02:14.220> there<00:02:14.550> just<00:02:14.940> even

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
they're not down inside there just even

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.960 
they're not down inside there just even
wet<00:02:15.360> edges<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.340> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.459> kind<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.850> that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
wet edges and you can kind of see that

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.000 
wet edges and you can kind of see that
right<00:02:18.090> there<00:02:18.410> it's<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.500> nutty<00:02:19.680> kind<00:02:19.890> of

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
right there it's a nutty kind of

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.039 
right there it's a nutty kind of
familiar<00:02:20.190> with<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.549> we'll<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.540> go<00:02:21.930> ahead

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
familiar with that we'll just go ahead

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.170 
familiar with that we'll just go ahead
and<00:02:22.200> actually<00:02:22.530> apply<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> loctite<00:02:23.579> too<00:02:23.820> will

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and actually apply the loctite too will

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.420 
and actually apply the loctite too will
do<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.570> bottom<00:02:25.470> one<00:02:25.590> first<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.100> then<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> top

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
do the bottom one first and then the top

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.699 
do the bottom one first and then the top
one<00:02:26.489> will<00:02:26.730> be<00:02:26.820> exactly<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.269> same<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.560> I'm

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
one will be exactly the same so I'm

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.199 
one will be exactly the same so I'm
going<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> just<00:02:29.070> slide<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> steps<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.970> little

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
going to just slide the steps a little

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.080 
going to just slide the steps a little
bit<00:02:30.329> so<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.630> bearing<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:30.900> exposed<00:02:34.940> get<00:02:35.940> your

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
bit so the bearing is exposed get your

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.580 
bit so the bearing is exposed get your
lock<00:02:36.209> tight<00:02:36.420> open

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
lock tight open

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.349 
lock tight open
and<00:02:38.590> then<00:02:38.799> I'm<00:02:39.579> just<00:02:39.730> going<00:02:39.879> to<00:02:39.999> take<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.150> really

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
and then I'm just going to take a really

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.629 
and then I'm just going to take a really
thin<00:02:40.719> skin<00:02:41.109> and<00:02:41.409> just<00:02:41.499> apply<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.189> outside

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:42.639 
thin skin and just apply to the outside

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.000 
thin skin and just apply to the outside
edge<00:02:42.909> of<00:02:43.120> the<00:02:43.180> bearing<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.749> and<00:02:43.930> just<00:02:44.560> just

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
edge of the bearing here and just just

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.679 
edge of the bearing here and just just
be<00:02:45.129> clear<00:02:45.370> I'm<00:02:45.609> not<00:02:45.639> putting<00:02:46.060> anything<00:02:46.329> on<00:02:46.569> the

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
be clear I'm not putting anything on the

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.209 
be clear I'm not putting anything on the
shaft<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.139> all<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.439> shack<00:02:47.650> will<00:02:47.889> still<00:02:48.069> be

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
shaft at all the shack will still be

00:02:48.219 --> 00:03:04.570 
shaft at all the shack will still be
able<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.400> slide<00:02:48.639> after<00:02:48.879> this

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.160 

alright<00:03:05.240> this<00:03:05.420> is<00:03:05.480> one<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.900> things<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
alright this is one of the things that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.940 
alright this is one of the things that
doesn't<00:03:06.530> take<00:03:06.650> very<00:03:06.830> much<00:03:06.950> to<00:03:07.520> do<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> good<00:03:07.850> job

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
doesn't take very much to do a good job

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.700 
doesn't take very much to do a good job
so<00:03:09.950> I'm<00:03:10.010> just<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.280> to<00:03:10.370> slip<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:12.230> bottom

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
so I'm just going to slip this bottom

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.500 
so I'm just going to slip this bottom
bearing<00:03:12.980> into<00:03:13.160> place<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:16.420> let<00:03:17.420> it

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
bearing into place here and just let it

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.140 
bearing into place here and just let it
stay<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:18.050> what<00:03:18.770> I'll<00:03:18.890> do<00:03:19.070> is<00:03:19.280> I'll<00:03:19.310> let<00:03:20.000> this

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
stay and what I'll do is I'll let this

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.450 
stay and what I'll do is I'll let this
bottom<00:03:20.480> bearing<00:03:20.750> sit<00:03:20.990> for<00:03:21.260> about<00:03:21.350> 20<00:03:22.190> or<00:03:22.280> 30

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
bottom bearing sit for about 20 or 30

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.370 
bottom bearing sit for about 20 or 30
minutes<00:03:22.820> for<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> lock<00:03:23.270> tech<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.630> set<00:03:23.840> up<00:03:23.960> and

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
minutes for the lock tech to set up and

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.320 
minutes for the lock tech to set up and
then<00:03:24.860> once<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.190> bottom<00:03:25.490> one<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.700> completely

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
then once the bottom one is completely

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.540 
then once the bottom one is completely
in<00:03:26.540> place<00:03:26.840> I'm<00:03:27.500> just<00:03:27.770> going<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:27.920> slip<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.340> top

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
in place I'm just going to slip the top

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:30.790 
in place I'm just going to slip the top
without<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.970> top<00:03:29.420> apply<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.350> lock<00:03:30.590> tight

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
without the top apply the lock tight

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.110 
without the top apply the lock tight
around<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.130> edge<00:03:31.280> of<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:31.460> top<00:03:31.700> one<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:31.970> then

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
around the edge of the top one and then

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.660 
around the edge of the top one and then
slide<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:32.510> back<00:03:32.780> into<00:03:33.020> the<00:03:33.140> top<00:03:33.430> just<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.520> same

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
slide it back into the top just the same

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.850 
slide it back into the top just the same
way<00:03:34.820> we<00:03:34.910> did<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.180> bottom<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.690> if<00:03:36.500> you're<00:03:36.710> good

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
way we did the bottom and if you're good

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.140 
way we did the bottom and if you're good
you<00:03:37.040> can<00:03:37.070> probably<00:03:37.460> do<00:03:37.550> them<00:03:37.700> both<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:38.000> one

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
you can probably do them both in one

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.700 
you can probably do them both in one
step<00:03:38.390> but<00:03:38.660> I<00:03:38.720> recommend<00:03:39.020> doing<00:03:39.230> them<00:03:39.440> one<00:03:39.560> at<00:03:39.650> a

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
step but I recommend doing them one at a

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.530 
step but I recommend doing them one at a
time<00:03:39.950> what<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:40.760> don't<00:03:40.940> want<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.210> have<00:03:41.330> happen

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
time what you don't want to have happen

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.780 
time what you don't want to have happen
is<00:03:41.840> for<00:03:42.080> you<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.530> lock<00:03:42.709> tight<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.280> and<00:03:43.670> then

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
is for you the lock tight on it and then

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.130 
is for you the lock tight on it and then
the<00:03:43.880> Baron<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.240> slightly<00:03:44.450> into<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.780> bushing

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
the Baron is slightly into the bushing

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.350 
the Baron is slightly into the bushing
past<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.590> edge<00:03:45.770> or<00:03:46.130> the<00:03:46.160> bushing<00:03:46.580> somewhere

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
past the edge or the bushing somewhere

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.000 
past the edge or the bushing somewhere
in<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.540> middle<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.020> then<00:03:48.140> stick<00:03:48.590> because

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
in the middle and then stick because

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.740 
in the middle and then stick because
then<00:03:49.820> it<00:03:49.910> will<00:03:50.090> support<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.510> shaft

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
then it will support the shaft

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.210 
then it will support the shaft
adequately<00:03:51.260> in<00:03:51.560> the<00:03:51.650> milling<00:03:51.890> machine<00:03:52.130> will

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
adequately in the milling machine will

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.100 
adequately in the milling machine will
work<00:03:52.400> so<00:03:53.090> go<00:03:53.240> ahead<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.420> do<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.660> bottom<00:03:53.959> one

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
work so go ahead to do the bottom one

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.980 
work so go ahead to do the bottom one
let<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:54.530> cure<00:03:54.770> turn<00:03:55.580> it<00:03:55.730> around<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.360> do<00:03:56.840> the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:56.990 
let it cure turn it around and do the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.240 
let it cure turn it around and do the
top<00:03:57.140> one<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:57.650> I'm<00:03:57.740> just<00:03:57.890> going<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.070> sit<00:03:58.220> here

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
top one it so I'm just going to sit here

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.120 
top one it so I'm just going to sit here
and<00:03:58.370> wait<00:03:58.610> on<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.850> top<00:03:59.090> one<00:03:59.830> until<00:04:00.830> after<00:04:01.040> the

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
and wait on the top one until after the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.350 
and wait on the top one until after the
bottom<00:04:01.340> of<00:04:01.459> secured<00:04:01.730> it's<00:04:01.880> an<00:04:01.970> exact<00:04:02.209> same

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
bottom of secured it's an exact same

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.360 
bottom of secured it's an exact same
process<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:03.080> at<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.740> end<00:04:03.770> of<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.070> step<00:04:04.340> you

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
process so at the end of this step you

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.430 
process so at the end of this step you
should<00:04:04.490> have<00:04:04.760> both<00:04:05.000> the<00:04:05.270> bottom<00:04:05.600> and<00:04:05.720> on<00:04:05.930> top

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
should have both the bottom and on top

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.470 
should have both the bottom and on top
bearings<00:04:06.860> lock<00:04:07.040> tied<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.340> into<00:04:07.459> place<00:04:07.730> but

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
bearings lock tied it into place but

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:09.880 
bearings lock tied it into place but
once<00:04:08.660> they're<00:04:08.870> cured<00:04:09.170> you<00:04:09.320> can<00:04:09.470> pull<00:04:09.800> the

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
once they're cured you can pull the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.550 
once they're cured you can pull the
shaft<00:04:10.160> out<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.640> set<00:04:10.820> it<00:04:10.970> aside<00:04:11.060> for<00:04:11.480> when<00:04:12.470> we

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
shaft out and set it aside for when we

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.740 
shaft out and set it aside for when we
