when energy was really inexpensive and
no<00:00:03.620> one<00:00:03.770> cared<00:00:04.100> about<00:00:04.940> the<00:00:05.330> costs<00:00:05.779> of<00:00:05.870> energy

people<00:00:08.000> were<00:00:08.120> using<00:00:08.360> it<00:00:08.629> freely<00:00:08.900> but<00:00:09.139> as<00:00:09.320> the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:09.470 
people were using it freely but as the

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.169 
people were using it freely but as the
cost<00:00:09.650> of<00:00:09.889> energy<00:00:10.010> has<00:00:10.340> gone<00:00:10.519> up<00:00:10.730> and<00:00:11.030> the

cost of energy has gone up and the
global<00:00:11.420> warming<00:00:11.750> has<00:00:11.990> become<00:00:12.349> a<00:00:12.380> reality<00:00:12.590> no

people<00:00:13.820> are<00:00:14.000> concerned<00:00:14.420> about<00:00:14.990> that<00:00:15.290> kind<00:00:15.590> of

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 
people are concerned about that kind of

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.009 
people are concerned about that kind of
thing<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:16.129> as<00:00:16.429> we<00:00:16.609> improve<00:00:16.909> the<00:00:17.480> building

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:18.019 
thing and as we improve the building

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:20.559 
thing and as we improve the building
envelopes<00:00:18.589> and<00:00:18.980> and<00:00:19.339> the<00:00:19.880> building<00:00:20.300> science

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:20.569 
envelopes and and the building science

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:24.159 
envelopes and and the building science
when<00:00:21.019> we<00:00:21.140> build<00:00:21.699> we're<00:00:22.699> reducing<00:00:23.089> the<00:00:23.720> the

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:24.169 
when we build we're reducing the the

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.859 
when we build we're reducing the the
need<00:00:24.349> for<00:00:24.560> energy<00:00:24.649> the<00:00:25.159> building's<00:00:25.869> actually

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
need for energy the building's actually

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.719 
need for energy the building's actually
can<00:00:27.140> be<00:00:27.319> designed<00:00:27.679> in<00:00:27.919> such<00:00:27.949> a<00:00:28.159> way<00:00:28.279> as<00:00:28.460> they

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:28.729 
can be designed in such a way as they

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:36.670 
can be designed in such a way as they
need<00:00:29.119> less<00:00:29.659> and<00:00:29.839> less<00:00:29.929> energy

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.920 

from<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> lead<00:00:38.010> point<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.490> view<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.720> that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
from a lead point of view we think that

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
from a lead point of view we think that
if<00:00:40.170> somebody<00:00:40.800> was<00:00:41.100> interested<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.760> pursuing

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
if somebody was interested in pursuing

if somebody was interested in pursuing
lead<00:00:42.770> certification<00:00:43.770> we'd<00:00:44.280> either<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.790> lead

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
lead certification we'd either be a lead

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.840 
lead certification we'd either be a lead
silver<00:00:45.390> or<00:00:45.870> lead<00:00:45.900> gold<00:00:46.620> well<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.400> think<00:00:47.520> that

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
silver or lead gold well I think that

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.080 
silver or lead gold well I think that
what<00:00:48.120> lead<00:00:48.450> does<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.500> look<00:00:49.650> at<00:00:49.830> a<00:00:50.090> holistic

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
what lead does is to look at a holistic

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
what lead does is to look at a holistic
approach<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.710> sustainable<00:00:52.710> design<00:00:52.890> most

people<00:00:54.090> think<00:00:54.270> about<00:00:54.650> energy<00:00:55.650> use<00:00:56.030> as<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
people think about energy use as the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.439 
people think about energy use as the
primary<00:00:57.570> driver<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:58.620> there's<00:00:58.860> also<00:00:59.120> land<00:01:00.120> use

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

materials that you don't use let's say

materials that you don't use let's say
you're<00:01:12.509> using<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.930> whole<00:01:13.140> four<00:01:13.410> by<00:01:13.530> eight<00:01:13.710> sheet

you're using a whole four by eight sheet

you're using a whole four by eight sheet
of<00:01:14.100> plywood<00:01:14.310> instead<00:01:14.940> of<00:01:15.450> having<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.140> cut<00:01:16.410> lots

of materials that's less waste you're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.050 
of materials that's less waste you're
using<00:01:18.899> less<00:01:19.680> material<00:01:20.190> so<00:01:20.640> making<00:01:20.910> sure

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
using less material so making sure

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.120 
using less material so making sure
throughout<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> process<00:01:22.140> those<00:01:22.619> kinds<00:01:23.040> of

throughout the process those kinds of

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.040 
throughout the process those kinds of
decisions<00:01:23.430> were<00:01:23.820> considered<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.660> that<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
decisions were considered and that the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.290 
decisions were considered and that the
whole<00:01:25.200> thing<00:01:25.470> was<00:01:25.649> not<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> waste<00:01:26.640> generator<00:01:27.119> in

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
whole thing was not a waste generator in

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.420 
whole thing was not a waste generator in
the<00:01:27.330> factory<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.680> much<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> site

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the factory or or as much on the site

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.840 
the factory or or as much on the site
and<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:30.270> RB<00:01:30.660> really<00:01:31.560> helped<00:01:31.920> us<00:01:32.040> because

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and again RB really helped us because

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
and again RB really helped us because
their<00:01:33.180> construction<00:01:33.899> process<00:01:34.440> was<00:01:34.649> flexible

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
their construction process was flexible

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.779 
their construction process was flexible
enough<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.720> incorporate<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.990> lot<00:01:37.649> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> ideas

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
enough to incorporate a lot of the ideas

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.450 
enough to incorporate a lot of the ideas
that<00:01:38.820> we<00:01:39.149> were<00:01:39.330> interested<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:40.170> pursuing<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that we were interested in pursuing I

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
that we were interested in pursuing I
think<00:01:41.760> in<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> future<00:01:42.000> we'll<00:01:42.840> also<00:01:43.080> start

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
think in the future we'll also start

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.840 
think in the future we'll also start
realizing<00:01:44.729> some<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> benefits<00:01:45.240> of

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
realizing some of the benefits of

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
realizing some of the benefits of
mass-producing<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.600> factory<00:01:49.170> work

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
mass-producing and the factory work

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
mass-producing and the factory work
environment<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.000> have<00:01:51.150> tighter<00:01:51.420> quality

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
environment you can have tighter quality

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.710 
environment you can have tighter quality
control<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.700> less<00:01:54.000> waste<00:01:54.330> You

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
control you can have less waste You

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
control you can have less waste You
certainly<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.200> less<00:01:55.560> site<00:01:55.860> disruption<00:01:56.549> when

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
certainly have less site disruption when

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.340 
certainly have less site disruption when
you're<00:01:56.820> building<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.360> factory<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.170> think

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
you're building in a factory and I think

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
you're building in a factory and I think
in<00:01:58.470> some<00:01:58.530> ways<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.070> work<00:01:59.250> environment<00:01:59.939> for

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
in some ways the work environment for

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.990 
in some ways the work environment for
the<00:02:00.540> workers<00:02:00.750> can<00:02:01.290> be<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> safer<00:02:01.979> cleaner<00:02:02.580> and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
the workers can be a safer cleaner and

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.440 
the workers can be a safer cleaner and
more<00:02:03.030> productive<00:02:03.479> place<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.450> modular

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
more productive place the modular

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.509 
more productive place the modular
industry<00:02:06.869> in<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.170> ways<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.590> ahead<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:07.920> what

showing that the developers that are

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.890 
showing that the developers that are

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
building green have higher rents and

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.470 
building green have higher rents and
that<00:04:12.409> their<00:04:12.620> condominium<00:04:13.310> sell<00:04:13.790> quicker<00:04:14.120> and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
that their condominium sell quicker and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.379 
that their condominium sell quicker and
businesses<00:04:15.349> are<00:04:15.590> choosing<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.100> go<00:04:16.459> to<00:04:16.519> office

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
parks and office buildings that have

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.319 
parks and office buildings that have
built<00:04:19.400> green<00:04:19.759> because<00:04:20.000> they<00:04:20.090> know<00:04:20.209> the

built green because they know the

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.570 
built green because they know the

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
operating costs are real savings so I

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.740 
operating costs are real savings so I
