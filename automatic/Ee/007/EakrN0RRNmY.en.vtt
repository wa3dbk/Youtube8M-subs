little<00:00:12.200> bit<00:00:12.320> about<00:00:12.679> sweeping<00:00:13.420> 7th<00:00:14.420> chord

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
little bit about sweeping 7th chord

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.960 
little bit about sweeping 7th chord
arpeggios<00:00:15.410> now<00:00:16.129> sweeping<00:00:16.460> 7th<00:00:16.789> chord

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
arpeggios now sweeping 7th chord

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.579 
arpeggios now sweeping 7th chord
arpeggios<00:00:17.359> feel<00:00:17.599> a<00:00:17.630> little<00:00:18.019> bit<00:00:18.199> different

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:18.589 
arpeggios feel a little bit different

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.439 
arpeggios feel a little bit different
than<00:00:18.710> sweeping<00:00:18.949> try<00:00:19.369> out<00:00:19.550> our<00:00:19.579> pages<00:00:20.029> because

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
than sweeping try out our pages because

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.899 
than sweeping try out our pages because
you<00:00:21.019> have<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.319> little<00:00:21.679> bit<00:00:21.919> more<00:00:22.130> of<00:00:22.489> up<00:00:22.730> and

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:22.909 
you have a little bit more of up and

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.460 
you have a little bit more of up and
down<00:00:23.119> strokes<00:00:23.509> instead<00:00:23.779> of<00:00:24.079> just<00:00:24.199> regular

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
down strokes instead of just regular

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.559 
down strokes instead of just regular
like<00:00:24.800> down<00:00:24.979> down<00:00:25.159> down<00:00:25.399> down<00:00:25.429> or<00:00:25.819> up<00:00:26.029> up<00:00:26.210> up<00:00:26.359> up

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:26.569 
like down down down down or up up up up

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.649 
like down down down down or up up up up
so<00:00:27.339> it<00:00:28.339> feels<00:00:28.550> more<00:00:28.849> kind<00:00:29.089> of<00:00:29.149> like<00:00:29.269> a<00:00:29.300> hybrid

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:29.659 
so it feels more kind of like a hybrid

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.749 
so it feels more kind of like a hybrid
picking<00:00:30.109> than<00:00:30.499> it<00:00:30.589> does<00:00:30.769> sweep<00:00:31.130> picking<00:00:31.369> a

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
picking than it does sweep picking a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.509 
picking than it does sweep picking a
regular<00:00:32.509> alternate<00:00:33.019> picking<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.100> let<00:00:34.280> me<00:00:34.370> play

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
regular alternate picking so let me play

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.490 
regular alternate picking so let me play
an<00:00:34.640> example<00:00:34.760> for<00:00:35.269> you<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.629> then<00:00:36.170> I'll<00:00:36.289> show

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
an example for you and then I'll show

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.720 
an example for you and then I'll show
you<00:00:36.530> how<00:00:36.710> the<00:00:36.769> right<00:00:37.039> hand<00:00:37.309> works<00:00:37.489> on<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:42.730> so

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
you how the right hand works on it so

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.919 
you how the right hand works on it so
let<00:00:43.879> me<00:00:43.910> teach<00:00:44.149> you<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.420> shape<00:00:44.690> with<00:00:44.870> your

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:44.929 
let me teach you the shape with your

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:47.380 
let me teach you the shape with your
left<00:00:45.170> hand<00:00:45.379> first<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:46.010> then<00:00:46.609> we'll<00:00:46.999> get<00:00:47.210> into

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
left hand first and then we'll get into

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.119 
left hand first and then we'll get into
the<00:00:47.719> mechanics<00:00:48.050> of<00:00:48.440> what<00:00:48.499> our<00:00:48.620> right<00:00:48.829> hand<00:00:49.039> is

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
the mechanics of what our right hand is

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.160 
the mechanics of what our right hand is
doing<00:00:49.249> it's<00:00:49.640> basically<00:00:50.089> this<00:00:50.390> arpeggio<00:00:50.780> right

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
doing it's basically this arpeggio right

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.349 
doing it's basically this arpeggio right
here<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.410> c-shape<00:00:51.949> arpeggio<00:00:54.909> all<00:00:55.909> you're<00:00:56.269> going

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
here a c-shape arpeggio all you're going

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.419 
here a c-shape arpeggio all you're going
to<00:00:56.420> do<00:00:56.659> is<00:00:56.899> add<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:57.499> seventh<00:00:57.949> the<00:00:58.249> major

00:00:58.419 --> 00:00:58.429 
to do is add the seventh the major

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:01.450 
to do is add the seventh the major
seventh<00:00:58.969> of<00:00:59.120> that<00:00:59.839> arpeggio<00:01:00.499> that<00:01:00.769> you<00:01:01.249> major

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
seventh of that arpeggio that you major

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.360 
seventh of that arpeggio that you major
arpeggio<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.390> that<00:01:02.539> chord<00:01:03.159> so<00:01:04.159> what<00:01:04.280> you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
arpeggio to that chord so what you

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.219 
arpeggio to that chord so what you
basically<00:01:04.670> have<00:01:04.909> is<00:01:05.119> just<00:01:05.509> adding<00:01:05.689> a<00:01:05.810> d<00:01:05.990> sharp

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
basically have is just adding a d sharp

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.109 
basically have is just adding a d sharp
to<00:01:06.350> it<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:06.829> if<00:01:06.950> your<00:01:07.159> third<00:01:07.340> finger<00:01:07.549> comes<00:01:07.909> up

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
to it so if your third finger comes up

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.380 
to it so if your third finger comes up
and<00:01:08.299> grabs<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.920> 6th<00:01:10.460> fret<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:10.939> your<00:01:11.329> a<00:01:11.360> string

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
and grabs the 6th fret on your a string

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.850 
and grabs the 6th fret on your a string
that's<00:01:14.390> gonna<00:01:14.570> be<00:01:14.689> your<00:01:14.750> 7th<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:15.290> then<00:01:15.740> you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
that's gonna be your 7th and then you

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.590 
that's gonna be your 7th and then you
can<00:01:15.979> play<00:01:16.219> the<00:01:16.490> next<00:01:16.939> three<00:01:17.060> notes<00:01:17.210> just<00:01:17.509> like

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
can play the next three notes just like

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.350 
can play the next three notes just like
you<00:01:17.840> would<00:01:17.990> a<00:01:18.020> regular<00:01:18.200> a<00:01:18.759> major<00:01:19.759> arpeggio

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
you would a regular a major arpeggio

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.350 
you would a regular a major arpeggio
with<00:01:20.719> a<00:01:20.750> C<00:01:20.930> shape

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.060 

then<00:01:25.360> you're<00:01:25.450> gonna<00:01:25.540> add<00:01:25.810> this<00:01:26.290> d-sharp<00:01:26.740> again

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
then you're gonna add this d-sharp again

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:34.290 
then you're gonna add this d-sharp again
right<00:01:27.250> here<00:01:29.400> that's<00:01:30.400> your<00:01:30.520> E<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:34.030> finished

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
right here that's your E and finished

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.490 
right here that's your E and finished
off<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.570> apes'<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.960> like<00:01:35.230> you<00:01:35.350> would

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
off the apes' you like you would

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.980 
off the apes' you like you would
normally<00:01:35.910> so<00:01:36.910> let's<00:01:37.240> take<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> look<00:01:37.600> at<00:01:37.840> the

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
normally so let's take a look at the

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.840 
normally so let's take a look at the
right<00:01:38.200> hand<00:01:38.230> and<00:01:38.680> see<00:01:39.160> how<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.400> affects<00:01:39.460> our

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
right hand and see how this affects our

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.140 
right hand and see how this affects our
picking<00:01:40.180> on<00:01:40.300> this<00:01:40.420> hand<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.640> I'm<00:01:42.730> starting

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
picking on this hand so I'm starting

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.850 
picking on this hand so I'm starting
this<00:01:43.300> very<00:01:43.570> first<00:01:43.780> note<00:01:43.960> the<00:01:44.110> seventh<00:01:44.500> I<00:01:44.620> start

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
this very first note the seventh I start

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.170 
this very first note the seventh I start
on<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:44.950> seventh<00:01:45.340> just<00:01:45.550> because<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.970> like<00:01:46.090> the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
on the seventh just because I like the

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.890 
on the seventh just because I like the
way<00:01:46.270> it<00:01:46.360> sounds

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
way it sounds

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.710 
way it sounds
and<00:01:46.990> it's<00:01:47.760> convenient<00:01:48.760> easy<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.300> get<00:01:49.450> just

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
and it's convenient easy to get just

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.110 
and it's convenient easy to get just
robbed<00:01:49.900> below<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> e<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.890> root<00:01:51.130> start<00:01:52.000> with<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
robbed below the e the root start with a

00:01:52.120 --> 00:02:17.670 
robbed below the e the root start with a
Down<00:01:52.270> stroke<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:17.110> you've<00:02:17.230> probably<00:02:17.380> noticed

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
Down stroke so you've probably noticed

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.040 
Down stroke so you've probably noticed
that<00:02:18.130> these<00:02:18.700> arpeggios<00:02:18.940> feel<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.600> little<00:02:19.840> bit

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
that these arpeggios feel a little bit

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.570 
that these arpeggios feel a little bit
different<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.650> me<00:02:20.800> they<00:02:20.980> feel<00:02:21.160> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.459> like

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
different to me they feel kind of like

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.690 
different to me they feel kind of like
I'm<00:02:21.790> playing<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.120> pentatonic<00:02:22.480> scale<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.700> an

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I'm playing a pentatonic scale and an

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.760 
I'm playing a pentatonic scale and an
arpeggio<00:02:25.390> all<00:02:25.630> at<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> same<00:02:26.080> time<00:02:26.140> because<00:02:26.740> I

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
arpeggio all at the same time because I

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.710 
arpeggio all at the same time because I
have<00:02:26.980> some<00:02:27.310> up-down<00:02:27.850> parts<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> have

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
have some up-down parts and then I have

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.570 
have some up-down parts and then I have
some<00:02:28.959> parts<00:02:29.260> where<00:02:29.980> I'm<00:02:30.100> doing<00:02:30.250> all

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
some parts where I'm doing all

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.259 
some parts where I'm doing all
downstrokes

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
downstrokes

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.880 
downstrokes
or<00:02:31.360> all<00:02:31.510> up<00:02:31.720> strokes<00:02:32.050> too<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.769> be<00:02:32.860> aware

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
or all up strokes too so just be aware

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.949 
or all up strokes too so just be aware
that<00:02:33.130> when<00:02:33.610> you're<00:02:33.730> learning<00:02:33.910> any<00:02:34.690> kind<00:02:34.900> of

that when you're learning any kind of
seventh<00:02:35.320> arpeggio
