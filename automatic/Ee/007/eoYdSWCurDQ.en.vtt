videos about this previously before but
I<00:02:04.740> don't<00:02:05.640> think<00:02:05.909> there's<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> be

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299

texture<00:02:06.810> packs<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.409> update<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.829> think

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
texture packs in this update I think

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
texture packs in this update I think
it's<00:02:08.369> just<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.700> support<00:02:09.239> they're<00:02:09.509> just

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
it's just the support they're just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.229 
it's just the support they're just
building<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.289> up<00:02:10.440> slowly<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> slowly<00:02:11.310> until

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
building it up slowly and slowly until

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.880 
building it up slowly and slowly until
they<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.660> pretty<00:02:13.140> much<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
they can pretty much it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.710 
they can pretty much it
as<00:02:14.040> many<00:02:14.250> techno<00:02:14.610> packs<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:14.970> they<00:02:15.240> won<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:15.690> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
as many techno packs as they won for the
