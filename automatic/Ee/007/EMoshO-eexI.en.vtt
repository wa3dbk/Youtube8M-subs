00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 so together I am your pressure of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.180
 nails go out manuals so often 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.830
 pointer like me 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 I get not measured things easy 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 I've been destined for two years 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.179
 i practice and they just do not want to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
 fold 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.940
 I have a balance for that now 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.439
 board built a great part to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.359
 Exercise balance and do it 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.880
 really fun in the evening while watching TV 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.680
 just a round in balance board 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.050
 Now you can do some moves 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.830
 look at it and then you start right away 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830
 with the construction management 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.559
 so you need a multiplex plate 12 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.379
 mm of course you can finish and 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.920
 let Baumarkt cut and a 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.750
 pipe 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.700
 I'm here so'n patrol you have to 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.440
 look perhaps baumarkt gets 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 where films are wound up by the customer 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:14.200
 maybe give a little bit of glue 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.000
 shopping and under circumstances one more 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.890
 jigsaw if you want to have around beautiful 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 I have it at home now 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.619
 tailored 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.450
 the boards but everyone had Baumarkt 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.430
 a station where he will cut later 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.509
 the main board can therefore have 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.869
 I now made 70 cm long 25 cm wide 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.960
 and there are left from right no matter how 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.090
 stapler on it about 4 cm wide 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.610
 the fabrics simply with wood glue 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.950
 coat 1 corner with screw clamps 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 nice to press to cure that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.979
 whole 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.410
 they are very important because I fall 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.940
 Do not tie that up on your nose later 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.320
 board out of the box 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:59.770
 shoot then I just like that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.509
 a box taken as a template for the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.759
 corner badge easy for the one 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.289
 a little prettier if you want to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.610
 example, I can not get home 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.149
 you could be that easy too 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.450
 to let 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:13.450
 then it just stays square totally does not matter yes 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 the jigsaw now becomes the corners where 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.200
 and blessings 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.650
 the edges can then something else 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 be sanded I have now for it 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.240
 a grinder but just one 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.850
 bit of sandpaper does it all 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.320
 just as easily in the construction market in arch 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.270
 You can buy sandpaper 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.250
 pull over such a block of wood as 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.900
 berth 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.810
 the piece of wood so that you too there 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.850
 The balance board grip has again 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.950
 a lot of grip you need the proxy 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:50.250
 resin here again from herb text 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.610
 partly the whole mission on the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.170
 balance board beautifully brushing and 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.880
 then we need our reason again 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.150
 our mineral that I have in me 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.440
 Homemade salt spreader made pure 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.680
 and it is now just a fresh one 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.390
 epoxy interspersed and then again 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.340
 exactly how to cure with the glue 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.590
 In that case it will take a day 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.180
 yes and then our balance board 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.180
 already done and let's go
