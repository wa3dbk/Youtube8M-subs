00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.790 

good<00:01:11.700> sound<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.840> sound<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.260> used<00:01:13.560> is

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
good sound the sound they used is

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.390 
good sound the sound they used is
actually<00:01:14.100> i<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.390> was<00:01:15.390> picked<00:01:15.659> very<00:01:15.870> well

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
actually i think was picked very well

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.590 
actually i think was picked very well
helicopter<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:20.000> version<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
helicopter so this version or this is a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.670 
helicopter so this version or this is a
different<00:01:21.900> length<00:01:21.990> o<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.229> come<00:01:22.410> in<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
different length o to come in from the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.250 
different length o to come in from the
top<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.520> bottom<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.180> from<00:01:24.570> left<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
top to the bottom and from left to the

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.570 
top to the bottom and from left to the
right<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.760> have<00:01:26.850> twice<00:01:27.090> as<00:01:27.119> many<00:01:27.390> enemies

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
right so you have twice as many enemies

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:40.580 
right so you have twice as many enemies
twice<00:01:29.580> as<00:01:29.759> challenging<00:01:38.810> and<00:01:39.810> first<00:01:40.380> time<00:01:40.530> I

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
twice as challenging and first time I

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.719 
twice as challenging and first time I
played<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.800> version<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.280> didn't<00:01:41.490> know<00:01:41.580> they

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
played this version I didn't know they

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.930 
played this version I didn't know they
were<00:01:41.850> coming<00:01:41.880> from<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.300> top<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:43.229> lost

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
were coming from the top and I lost

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.499 
were coming from the top and I lost
about<00:01:44.940> five<00:01:45.330> or<00:01:45.509> six<00:01:45.770> heart<00:01:47.000> around<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.240> just

my<00:03:10.290> pattern<00:03:10.740> here<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:13.790> shouldn't<00:03:14.790> have<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:14.970> keep

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
my pattern here I shouldn't have to keep

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.730 
my pattern here I shouldn't have to keep
running<00:03:20.900> from<00:03:21.900> where<00:03:22.110> to<00:03:22.170> come<00:03:22.350> down<00:03:22.500> from<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
running from where to come down from the

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.300 
running from where to come down from the
top<00:03:23.270> you<00:03:24.270> have<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.600> focus<00:03:24.810> your<00:03:25.110> Tesla<00:03:25.950> towers

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
top you have to focus your Tesla towers

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.160 
top you have to focus your Tesla towers
down<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.030> middle<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.360> across<00:03:27.660> the<00:03:27.900> middle

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
down the middle and across the middle

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.040 
down the middle and across the middle
for<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> helicopters<00:03:29.970> and<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.690> blimps<00:03:30.960> that

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
for the helicopters and the blimps that

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.250 
for the helicopters and the blimps that
come<00:03:31.230> across<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:33.120> they<00:03:33.690> come<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.050> from<00:03:34.230> the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
come across but they come in from the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.540 
come across but they come in from the
top<00:03:34.760> here<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.060> from<00:03:36.209> the<00:03:36.330> side<00:03:36.540> here<00:03:36.840> so<00:03:37.550> what

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
top here and from the side here so what

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.940 
top here and from the side here so what
I<00:03:38.580> do<00:03:38.670> is<00:03:38.850> I<00:03:39.570> bring<00:03:39.780> them<00:03:39.900> up<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.410> over<00:03:42.950> and

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
I do is I bring them up and over and

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.360 
I do is I bring them up and over and
down<00:03:44.010> over<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:45.770> they<00:03:46.770> actually<00:03:46.950> merge

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
down over and they actually merge

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.199 
down over and they actually merge
together<00:03:48.590> right<00:03:49.590> here<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.459> then<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.850> becomes

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
together right here so then it becomes

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.930 
together right here so then it becomes
one<00:03:51.870> line<00:03:52.110> of<00:03:52.140> enemies<00:03:52.800> instead<00:03:53.010> of<00:03:53.160> two<00:03:53.640> lines

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:10.050 

all<00:03:59.940> right<00:04:00.090> there<00:04:00.240> when<00:04:00.360> one<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.630> bumps

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.690 

you<00:04:10.690> definitely<00:04:10.959> need<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.800> goo<00:04:12.160> gun<00:04:12.310> is<00:04:12.459> to

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
you definitely need the goo gun is to

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.030 
you definitely need the goo gun is to
slow<00:04:12.940> down<00:04:13.150> these<00:04:13.390> powerful<00:04:14.349> enemies<00:04:14.860> or

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
slow down these powerful enemies or
