00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:14.340
 nightwash i have in school otto 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.740
 waalkes imitation and I found it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.449
 sensational and my parents mean it 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 would have been great if you too 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.150
 what would have understood at that time I knew 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.800
 not yet that one can speak loudly 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.080
 should do something funny on the stage 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.590
 But I already had the feeling there 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.940
 talent is definitely the special 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.340
 I was almost in my pants 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 because testament like me too 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.399
 for years before theater plays it is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 just like that with own texts on the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.350
 to go stage is totally exciting 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.969
 because you are so naked in front and me 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.739
 I really could only imagine 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 either the people are resting completely 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.710
 or needed with eggs i could myself 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 would have come so slowly she could 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.129
 you can not imagine anything else and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.660
 it was somehow in Berlin in the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.570
 apparently in front of twelve people and he us 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.340
 laughed a little organized so that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.840
 That's the day I always go 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.160
 twelve people have feverishly feigned so 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.629
 laugh a bit and of course mean 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.820
 second occurs at the kÃ¶lner also for 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.860
 stage and there is really great 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.140
 works and from there I knew 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.140
 has what needs yet to make 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.000
 Yes, well, I have psychology 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.770
 but I'm studying now 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.940
 actually right after my studies 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.050
 I put myself on the stage that 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.340
 means I now long to me as 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.110
 I worked psychologists then 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.550
 but still so about me 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.620
 to keep water longer time than 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.630
 Kummerkasten Aunt worked that way 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.820
 youth counselor as well as dr summer that was 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 quite nice but it was in principle 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.230
 end of study so mid-foot phase 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.360
 I realized that I have to 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.530
 I should do perfect timing 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.440
 if you have learned advice for the exam 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.420
 but then I have to go through that 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.370
 Not at all so what I took with me 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.260
 have also made the psychology study 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.480
 I believe that is the curiosity 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.460
 on people or just questioning 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.260
 why do people do that and that benefits me 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.660
 Of course, for the stage but what 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.700
 As far as gags go, it's often like that where I am 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:07.320
 said hammer and vice versa I think alas 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.850
 you can do it raging people 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 So that's really what it has 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.810
 In the meantime I have more and more 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.090
 but for sure but you know it exactly 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.090
 It's never an exciting job 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 that happens every time you do it yourself 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.770
 then stays relaxed then are the 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.480
 people also relaxed so it can 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.500
 This is a surprise 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.910
 if somehow it always works 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.110
 works well but if you have one 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.180
 then has a bit of stage experience 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.560
 you do not get so irritated anymore 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.560
 and then it's alright 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.040
 I started here I have 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.560
 I really started mine 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.010
 very first steps also at nightwash 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 actually done and reggae will that 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.250
 I'm sure I'll tell you later 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.410
 sat in the first row and then 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.290
 synonymous times the third record or something 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.850
 then it was special was 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.490
 and always that's not really 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.800
 that the only show was the one 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:06.390
 that did not change at all 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.540
 it was always a great mood it was 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.190
 always quite a young ones 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.150
 people it has always overturned the beer 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.510
 but it was all the way 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.950
 open-minded audience and it is that 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 has not changed and the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.220
 spirit of something throughout the years 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.750
 not lost and find that 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.489
 I'm so special about it as well then 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.650
 there were so many people in my television 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.870
 also made it big are the plaintive 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.090
 was discovered in spite of everything 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.090
 it's always the same in the live shows 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.130
 I say it's just a special one 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.590
 young open-minded student 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.120
 audience I started at the age of 27 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.709
 means that was of course then so of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.690
 My themes always fit that 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.100
 somehow and that is still the case now 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.530
 that i still stay that is im 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.900
 audience which totally understands me where i am 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.209
 I then sometimes sat earlier 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.070
 in any cultural events 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.660
 the possible 70-year-old stop 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.769
 sometimes just not certain topics 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.480
 have understood where I first 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.100
 I never had to explain in Altach 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.100
 what explain that was always clear 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.030
 of that I was firmly convinced and 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.709
 I think sometimes must be convinced 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.040
 you have to believe in yourself otherwise that will 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.800
 Nothing 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.229
 because you always have these too 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.940
 points where it does not go so well 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.310
 I can really say it is then 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.169
 important that someone has one 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.810
 always supported that was with me crack 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.889
 deuser absolutely does not always have 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.370
 always supported behind me 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.750
 been 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.960
 I'll be eternally grateful for that 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:33.490
 and that helps a lot, of course 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.250
 you really have to be first and foremost 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:41.290
 also believe in yourself always out 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.419
 Trying to try it out I was 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.250
 Shut up and I had then 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.229
 actually in front of the perfect number 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.729
 Silent room to write something 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.350
 not work you have to get out and man 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:51.580
 have to look if it works and then 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.780
 Really people are looking for a man 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.000
 together can work where you 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.410
 you also trust them 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.720
 takes pieces of advice and simple one 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.550
 feel for it and you have to for it 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.410
 You have to burn for it when you are addicted 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.389
 then you go on and fight 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.160
 and there are also people who have that 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.479
 but it is not somehow 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.669
 and then you just have it 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.080
 I think that's important 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.669
 that one just makes it when 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.750
 no worse than people do that 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.210
 I was also interested in something 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:19.169
 that irritated me sometimes that dirt 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.169
 I always with me around 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 olympic stadium no i want me 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:29.190
 I still want more like that 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.900
 I play that program that's mine 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.880
 plan I'm doing more now 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.530
 psychological topics and my next one 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.630
 Program will be over communication 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.130
 between men women go or rejoice 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.410
 I'm really into it and I want to 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.570
 simply an ever larger audience for 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.350
 win me and and on and on 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.030
 play 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.030
 that is what it really wants 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.070
 So I think I find it I find 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.110
 Luke wonderful it is for me anyway 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:57.780
 At the moment, it's just sad because of it 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.070
 just such an era is now with it 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.570
 Of course it also comes to an end because of me 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.000
 but that was never the only thing 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:05.910
 has changed Bosch and there is one 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.320
 Of course, too, and therefore I am 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.840
 me too, of course 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:11.520
 sentimental today but lukas really great 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.850
 colleague i like him a lot and i wish 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.850
 him all the best
