is<00:00:32.669> not<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:32.820> yet<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.110> it's<00:00:34.260> doing

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
is not there yet so the way it's doing

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.200 
is not there yet so the way it's doing
it<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.680> through<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> duct<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.059> does<00:00:36.180> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
it is through a duct now what does it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.150 
it is through a duct now what does it
does<00:00:36.450> let<00:00:36.899> me<00:00:36.989> show<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:39.469> duct<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.680> typically

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
does let me show you a duct is typically

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.209 
does let me show you a duct is typically
a<00:00:41.340> tube<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.899> what<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> does<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.620> goes<00:00:43.829> from

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
a tube and what it does is it goes from

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.639 
a tube and what it does is it goes from
your<00:00:44.340> range<00:00:44.760> hood<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> fan<00:00:46.140> steps<00:00:46.500> up

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
your range hood and as a fan steps up

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.410 
your range hood and as a fan steps up
air<00:00:46.890> takes<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> through<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.760> duct<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
air takes it through the duct and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.520 
air takes it through the duct and
hopefully<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> end<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.170> duct<00:00:49.379> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
hopefully the end of this duct is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.770 
hopefully the end of this duct is
happening<00:00:49.920> outside<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.610> your<00:00:50.700> kitchen<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
happening outside of your kitchen and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.810 
happening outside of your kitchen and
what's<00:00:52.680> happening<00:00:53.039> is<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.430> actually<00:00:53.640> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
what's happening is when it actually is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
what's happening is when it actually is
effectively<00:00:54.180> used<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.559> air<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.829> has

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
effectively used all that air that has

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
effectively used all that air that has
like<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> nasty<00:00:57.059> smells<00:00:57.390> from<00:00:57.660> cooking<00:00:58.109> some

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
like the nasty smells from cooking some

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.639 
like the nasty smells from cooking some
oils<00:00:59.070> impurities<00:00:59.640> is<00:01:00.059> being<00:01:00.480> dumped<00:01:00.960> outside

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
oils impurities is being dumped outside

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
oils impurities is being dumped outside
so<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.460> won't<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:02.760> stay<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.359> or<00:01:03.809> affect

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
so it won't actually stay up or affect

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.550 
so it won't actually stay up or affect
your<00:01:04.229> kitchen<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.619> any<00:01:04.739> way<00:01:05.360> now<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.229> way<00:01:07.380> this

your kitchen in any way now the way this
is<00:01:07.710> done<00:01:07.890> ideally<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> hopefully<00:01:09.450> in<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.260> of

is done ideally is hopefully in kind of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.960 
is done ideally is hopefully in kind of

this duct actually in your kitchen and

this duct actually in your kitchen and
the<00:01:14.490> reason<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.360> typically

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
the reason for that is typically

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.899 
the reason for that is typically
branches<00:01:16.409> will<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> nice<00:01:16.950> beautiful<00:01:17.460> duct

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909

actually installing ducting in your
kitchen<00:01:48.210> make<00:01:49.110> sure<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.979> most

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
kitchen make sure you take the most

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
kitchen make sure you take the most
direct<00:01:50.520> route<00:01:51.000> possible<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> outside<00:01:52.350> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
direct route possible to the outside of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.080 
direct route possible to the outside of
your<00:01:52.560> kitchen<00:01:52.920> or<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.399> outside<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.790> your<00:01:53.970> home

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
your kitchen or the outside of your home

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
your kitchen or the outside of your home
the<00:01:55.049> shorter<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> better<00:01:55.729> that's<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.880> best

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the shorter the better that's the best

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.370 
the shorter the better that's the best
way<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.240> actually<00:01:57.630> maximize<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.229> efficiency

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
way to actually maximize the efficiency

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.649 
way to actually maximize the efficiency
of<00:01:58.680> suction<00:01:59.119> second<00:02:00.119> thing<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.299> consider<00:02:00.390> too

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
of suction second thing to consider too

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.630 
of suction second thing to consider too
is<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.920> want<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> have<00:02:02.250> too<00:02:02.520> many

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
is that you don't want to have too many

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270 
is that you don't want to have too many
curves<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.810> more<00:02:04.020> turns<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.680> create<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
curves the more turns you create in

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.210 
curves the more turns you create in
deducting<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.290> less<00:02:07.290> suction<00:02:07.649> power<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:08.009> get

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
deducting the less suction power you get

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.880 
deducting the less suction power you get
every<00:02:08.879> little<00:02:09.000> churn<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.660> have

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
every little churn is going to have

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.559 
every little churn is going to have
significant<00:02:10.460> decrease<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:11.360> suction

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
significant decrease in a suction

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.050 
significant decrease in a suction
arrangement<00:02:12.200> so<00:02:12.770> let's<00:02:12.920> go<00:02:13.040> short<00:02:13.400> and<00:02:13.550> let's

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
arrangement so let's go short and let's

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.480 
arrangement so let's go short and let's
go<00:02:14.150> direct
