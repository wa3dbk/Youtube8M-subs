00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
which is great because nobody wants

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.490 
which is great because nobody wants
breakouts<00:01:03.670> basically<00:01:04.540> with<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:04.780> portion

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.880 
your face dead skin cells will
accumulate<00:01:07.719> in<00:01:08.049> them<00:01:08.259> and<00:01:08.469> then<00:01:08.619> there's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
accumulate in them and then there's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.590 
accumulate in them and then there's
build-up<00:01:09.369> and<00:01:09.670> that's<00:01:09.820> basically<00:01:10.090> one<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:10.539> the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
build-up and that's basically one of the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.819 
build-up and that's basically one of the
things<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:10.869> can<00:01:11.020> cause<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.439> break<00:01:11.560> out

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
silicon silicon bristles one of the

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.660 
silicon silicon bristles one of the
things<00:01:37.780> basically<00:01:38.679> it<00:01:39.009> has<00:01:39.100> these<00:01:39.280> silicon

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
things basically it has these silicon

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.099

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.880 
so in the long run it's cheaper than a
clarisonic<00:01:43.780> because<00:01:44.170> of<00:01:44.289> the<00:01:44.350> clarisonic

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
clarisonic because of the clarisonic

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.469 
clarisonic because of the clarisonic
you're<00:01:45.009> buying<00:01:45.219> basically<00:01:45.909> four<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.329> five

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
you're buying basically four to five

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.300 
you're buying basically four to five
brush<00:01:46.719> heads<00:01:46.929> a<00:01:47.020> year<00:01:47.229> depending<00:01:47.409> on<00:01:47.859> how<00:01:48.249> you

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
brush heads a year depending on how you

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.489 
brush heads a year depending on how you
use<00:01:48.429> your<00:01:48.549> use<00:01:48.969> it<00:01:49.149> and<00:01:49.359> with<00:01:50.109> this<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:50.289> never

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
use your use it and with this you never

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.109 
use your use it and with this you never
have<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.889> replace<00:01:50.920> it<00:01:51.310> or<00:01:51.340> buy<00:01:51.520> any<00:01:51.759> more<00:01:51.880> brush

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.989 
have to replace it or buy any more brush
heads<00:01:52.329> so<00:01:52.479> that's<00:01:52.659> that's<00:01:52.899> a<00:01:53.049> win<00:01:53.520> in<00:01:54.520> addition

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:54.999 
heads so that's that's a win in addition

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:57.149 
heads so that's that's a win in addition
to<00:01:55.149> that<00:01:55.329> so<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.079> has<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.229> cleaning<00:01:56.649> vase<00:01:56.889> which

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
biggest difference for me that I notice

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.809 
biggest difference for me that I notice
with<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.180> that<00:02:16.210> it's<00:02:16.450> more

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
with this is that it's more

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.569 
with this is that it's more
these<00:02:17.090> bristles<00:02:17.359> are<00:02:17.689> more<00:02:18.019> gentle<00:02:18.499> on<00:02:18.680> my

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
these bristles are more gentle on my

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:21.610 
these bristles are more gentle on my

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.610 
face then even the softest clarisonic
brush<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.609> that's<00:02:23.269> why<00:02:23.510> this<00:02:24.079> is<00:02:24.260> one<00:02:24.409> my<00:02:24.590> heart
