iTunes library and all of its files to
an<00:00:12.290> external<00:00:12.740> drive<00:00:12.860> it's<00:00:13.639> best<00:00:13.879> to<00:00:13.969> do<00:00:14.120> this

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
an external drive it's best to do this

an external drive it's best to do this
the<00:00:14.690> iTunes<00:00:15.200> way<00:00:15.499> because<00:00:15.950> they<00:00:16.100> keep<00:00:16.280> all<00:00:16.490> of

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:16.520 
the iTunes way because they keep all of

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
in their own library and if you don't do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.430 
in their own library and if you don't do
it<00:00:22.310> through<00:00:22.520> their<00:00:22.670> process<00:00:23.240> then<00:00:24.140> you<00:00:24.290> can

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:24.440 
it through their process then you can

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.470 
it through their process then you can

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
folder location that is the first step

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.200 
folder location that is the first step
so<00:00:54.530> in<00:00:54.710> this<00:00:54.859> case<00:00:55.159> I'm<00:00:55.429> going<00:00:55.609> to<00:00:55.699> be<00:00:55.879> moving

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210

it to an external drive that I have
called<00:00:58.489> video<00:00:58.909> drive<00:00:59.239> because<00:01:00.199> I<00:01:00.319> also<00:01:00.559> save

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
called video drive because I also save

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.270 
called video drive because I also save
videos<00:01:01.249> on<00:01:01.489> that<00:01:01.670> same<00:01:02.030> external<00:01:03.019> drive<00:01:03.350> I'm

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
videos on that same external drive I'm

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.670 
videos on that same external drive I'm
going<00:01:04.580> to<00:01:04.640> create<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:05.020> folder<00:01:06.020> called<00:01:06.409> iTunes

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
going to create a folder called iTunes

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:17.230 
going to create a folder called iTunes
files<00:01:11.649> and<00:01:13.329> I'm<00:01:14.329> going<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:15.040> put<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:16.850> click<00:01:17.090> on

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
files and I'm going to put you click on

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.459 
files and I'm going to put you click on
open<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.780> then<00:01:17.840> now<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:19.189> is<00:01:19.369> my<00:01:19.549> new<00:01:20.469> iTunes

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
open and then now that is my new iTunes

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.310 
open and then now that is my new iTunes
media<00:01:21.829> folder<00:01:22.399> location<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:23.960> that's<00:01:24.110> the

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
media folder location so that's the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.859 
media folder location so that's the
first<00:01:24.560> step<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:25.070> to<00:01:25.729> update<00:01:25.969> your<00:01:26.240> iTunes

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
first step is to update your iTunes

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.109 
first step is to update your iTunes
library<00:01:28.479> media<00:01:29.479> folder<00:01:29.840> location<00:01:30.880> now<00:01:31.880> that's

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
library media folder location now that's

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.760 
library media folder location now that's
gonna<00:01:32.270> be<00:01:32.509> going<00:01:32.719> through<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.140> updating

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
gonna be going through this updating

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.539 
gonna be going through this updating
iTunes<00:01:33.950> library<00:01:34.689> once<00:01:35.689> that's<00:01:35.960> complete<00:01:36.649> the

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
iTunes library once that's complete the

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.190 
iTunes library once that's complete the
next<00:01:37.759> step<00:01:37.939> is<00:01:38.829> you're<00:01:39.829> going<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.189> organize

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
next step is you're going to organize

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.870 
next step is you're going to organize
your<00:01:42.200> library<00:01:42.979> and<00:01:43.100> what<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.399> does<00:01:43.579> is<00:01:43.759> it

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
your library and what that does is it

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.910 
your library and what that does is it
makes<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.210> copy<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.659> all<00:01:44.899> of<00:01:45.109> your<00:01:45.200> iTunes<00:01:45.560> files

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
makes a copy of all of your iTunes files

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.669 
makes a copy of all of your iTunes files
and<00:01:46.280> moves<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:48.049> the<00:01:48.229> external<00:01:48.770> library

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
and moves that to the external library

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:56.200 
and moves that to the external library
and<00:01:52.600> what<00:01:53.600> I'm<00:01:53.780> going<00:01:54.079> to<00:01:54.140> do<00:01:54.350> here<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:55.039> go<00:01:56.000> up

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
and what I'm going to do here is go up

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:04.350 
and what I'm going to do here is go up
to<00:01:57.850> file<00:02:00.009> library<00:02:01.299> organize<00:02:02.299> library

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
to file library organize library

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.880 
to file library organize library
and<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.110> case<00:02:05.350> I'm<00:02:05.650> going<00:02:05.800> to

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
and in this case I'm going to

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.800 
and in this case I'm going to
consolidate<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.700> files<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.300> this<00:02:07.480> will<00:02:07.660> put

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
consolidate the files and this will put

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.050 
consolidate the files and this will put
all<00:02:08.020> of<00:02:08.229> these<00:02:08.410> files<00:02:08.679> on<00:02:09.070> to<00:02:09.399> my<00:02:09.700> external

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
all of these files on to my external

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.840 
all of these files on to my external
drive<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> what<00:02:12.070> you'll<00:02:12.190> see<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:12.730> is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
drive and so what you'll see here is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570 
drive and so what you'll see here is
that<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.120> copying<00:02:13.570> all<00:02:13.750> of<00:02:13.900> these<00:02:14.020> files<00:02:14.580> to

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
that it's copying all of these files to

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.900 
that it's copying all of these files to
my<00:02:15.730> external<00:02:16.090> drive<00:02:17.070> again<00:02:18.070> what<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> did<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
my external drive again what I did is I

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.290 
my external drive again what I did is I
went<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.840> file<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:21.820> go<00:02:22.030> over<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:24.000> library<00:02:25.000> and

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
went to file you go over to library and

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.180 
went to file you go over to library and

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.010 
have a fairly large library but it will
