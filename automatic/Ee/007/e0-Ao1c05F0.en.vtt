00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:27.830

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.219 

so<00:01:28.840> I<00:01:28.869> went<00:01:29.080> got<00:01:29.290> another<00:01:29.560> Negroni<00:01:31.229> compare

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
so I went got another Negroni compare

so I went got another Negroni compare
these<00:01:32.409> two<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:34.420> undergrown<00:01:34.930> II<00:01:39.360> seem<00:01:40.360> pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
these two is undergrown II seem pretty

00:01:40.570 --> 00:02:02.760 
these two is undergrown II seem pretty
similar<00:01:40.990> I<00:01:42.780> try<00:01:43.780> this<00:01:44.789> brownie

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.319 

there's<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.460> difference<00:02:03.579> doesn't<00:02:04.000> seem<00:02:04.210> to

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
there's the difference doesn't seem to

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.260 
there's the difference doesn't seem to
be<00:02:04.420> a<00:02:04.450> space<00:02:04.810> here<00:02:05.140> in<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:05.350> middle<00:02:05.590> of<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
be a space here in the middle of the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:14.690 
be a space here in the middle of the
Rhonda<00:02:07.270> Day<00:02:07.420> Bardo<00:02:12.150> Rhonda<00:02:13.150> does<00:02:13.330> seem<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.750> be

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
Rhonda Day Bardo Rhonda does seem to be

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:29.449 
Rhonda Day Bardo Rhonda does seem to be
more<00:02:15.700> round

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.940 

I'm<00:02:29.909> really<00:02:30.180> hard<00:02:30.360> pressed<00:02:30.629> of<00:02:30.900> taste<00:02:31.830> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
I'm really hard pressed of taste the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:40.610 
I'm really hard pressed of taste the
difference<00:02:32.310> between<00:02:32.640> these<00:02:32.819> two<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:39.620> think

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
difference between these two I think

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.670 
difference between these two I think
they're<00:02:40.739> Negroni<00:02:45.110> has<00:02:46.110> an<00:02:46.260> additional

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
they're Negroni has an additional

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.789 
they're Negroni has an additional
sweetness<00:02:46.950> associated<00:02:47.790> with<00:02:47.879> the<00:02:48.030> skin<00:02:48.299> that

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
sweetness associated with the skin that

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.670 
sweetness associated with the skin that
the<00:02:49.799> Rondo<00:02:50.280> does<00:02:50.489> not<00:02:50.760> seem<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.560> at<00:02:52.560> least

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
the Rondo does not seem to have at least

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.270 
the Rondo does not seem to have at least
that<00:02:52.890> one<00:02:53.780> maybe<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.959> Ron<00:02:55.650> doesn't<00:02:55.920> Dave<00:02:56.159> I

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
that one maybe that Ron doesn't Dave I

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.250 
that one maybe that Ron doesn't Dave I
don't<00:02:56.310> need<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.819> another<00:02:56.849> day<00:02:57.329> another<00:02:57.870> couple
