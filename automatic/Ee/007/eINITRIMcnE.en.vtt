00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
help a little bit and my wave of light

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
help a little bit and my wave of light
generally<00:02:04.439> is<00:02:04.710> gonna<00:02:05.009> two<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.430> three<00:02:05.670> shot

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
generally is gonna two or three shot

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.300 
generally is gonna two or three shot
most<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> white<00:02:06.600> mobs<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.680> I'll<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.160> give

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
most of the white mobs so I'll just give

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
most of the white mobs so I'll just give
you<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.459> quick<00:02:08.610> preview<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.869> how<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> build

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
you a quick preview of how the build

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.350 
you a quick preview of how the build
works

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.970 

so<00:02:14.360> basically<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.930> idea<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:15.410> to<00:02:15.680> spam

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
so basically the idea is just to spam

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.070 
so basically the idea is just to spam
wave<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.430> light<00:02:16.610> as<00:02:16.850> much<00:02:17.150> as<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.420> can<00:02:17.630> so<00:02:17.840> once

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
wave of light as much as you can so once

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.050 
wave of light as much as you can so once
you<00:02:18.170> get<00:02:18.260> your<00:02:18.320> vortexes<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.460> three<00:02:19.730> stacks

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
you get your vortexes to three stacks

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.010 
you get your vortexes to three stacks
you're<00:02:20.300> going<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.480> notice<00:02:20.600> your<00:02:20.780> spreader

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
you're going to notice your spreader

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.470 
you're going to notice your spreader
each<00:02:21.140> end<00:02:21.320> goes<00:02:21.470> up<00:02:21.500> quite<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> bit<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:23.360> you<00:02:23.450> want

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
each end goes up quite a bit so you want

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.090 
each end goes up quite a bit so you want
to<00:02:23.630> go<00:02:23.720> ahead<00:02:23.780> and<00:02:23.960> aggro<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.380> entire<00:02:24.680> room<00:02:24.920> on

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
to go ahead and aggro the entire room on

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.640 
to go ahead and aggro the entire room on
the<00:02:25.190> crip<00:02:25.370> runs<00:02:26.110> sure<00:02:27.110> many<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.500> are

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the crip runs sure many of you are

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.960 
the crip runs sure many of you are
familiar<00:02:27.770> with<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.460> so<00:02:28.610> I'll<00:02:28.670> just<00:02:28.820> show<00:02:28.940> you

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
familiar with this so I'll just show you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.430 
familiar with this so I'll just show you
kind<00:02:29.210> of<00:02:29.240> how<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.420> build<00:02:29.660> works<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.290> real

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
kind of how the build works for it real

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:38.070 
kind of how the build works for it real
quick<00:02:35.560> because<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.920> room<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.550> packed

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
quick because this room is so packed

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.500 
quick because this room is so packed
with<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:39.590> know<00:02:39.740> mob<00:02:39.980> density<00:02:40.520> that's<00:02:41.270> one

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
with you know mob density that's one

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.570 
with you know mob density that's one
reason<00:02:41.690> I<00:02:41.900> prefer<00:02:42.050> serenity<00:02:42.890> as<00:02:43.070> opposed<00:02:43.460> to

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
reason I prefer serenity as opposed to

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.100 
reason I prefer serenity as opposed to
tempest<00:02:43.970> rush<00:02:44.240> I<00:02:44.420> really<00:02:44.690> feel<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:44.870> you

could do it either just depends on your
playstyle<00:02:47.390> I<00:02:48.350> just<00:02:48.890> like<00:02:49.100> it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
playstyle I just like it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.180 
playstyle I just like it

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.450 
situation I get hit boxed in I'm able to
serenity<00:02:59.900> so<00:03:00.260> I<00:03:00.290> don't<00:03:00.530> get<00:03:00.680> frozen<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.310> just

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
serenity so I don't get frozen and just

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:13.510 
serenity so I don't get frozen and just
kind<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.640> working<00:03:01.910> my<00:03:02.000> way<00:03:02.030> out

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.790 

this<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.330> pretty<00:03:14.540> much<00:03:14.600> exactly<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:15.380> type<00:03:15.770> of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
this is pretty much exactly the type of

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.070 
this is pretty much exactly the type of
situation<00:03:16.520> that<00:03:16.910> I<00:03:17.210> wouldn't<00:03:17.600> want<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> be<00:03:17.960> in

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
situation that I wouldn't want to be in

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.510

without<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.830> serenity<00:03:19.900> lots<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.140> CCE<00:03:21.620> vortex

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
without the serenity lots of CCE vortex

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:31.390 
without the serenity lots of CCE vortex
lasers<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:24.320> kind<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.590> get<00:03:24.740> out<00:03:24.890> of<00:03:25.040> this

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.309 

but<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.120> can<00:03:32.269> see<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.599> the<00:03:32.720> build<00:03:32.900> does<00:03:33.079> work

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
but you can see that the build does work

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.720 
but you can see that the build does work
well<00:03:33.560> even<00:03:34.489> with<00:03:34.720> empowered<00:03:35.720> wave<00:03:36.700> which<00:03:37.700> is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
well even with empowered wave which is
