00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in the eighteenth century anatomical models 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.529
 used for educational purposes have 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 however widespread it was 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.360
 unique pieces carved in wax 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 which made them expensive and fragile to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.450
 nowadays they are made of plastic and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.400
 they are found in schools of 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:24.090
 medicine doctor's offices and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:25.650
 even art schools this model of a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.680
 human torso has twenty pieces 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.240
 removable the front the sides and the back 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.009
 all offer points of view 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.850
 different about the internal structure and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.850
 external body 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.719
 each part of the model is molded 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.770
 separately in polymer resin 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.350
 plastic workers pour the resin 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
 in the various nickel molding here is the 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.110
 mold of a skull cap is the one 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110
 of a heart 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.909
 the two molds that forms part of the 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.159
 body and then joined Auxerre 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.940
 then place in the gas oven set to 2 125 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:13.009
 degrees celsius as the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.330
 heat penetrates them the resin overlap 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.040
 their inner surface so 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.259
 uniform 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.229
 after about 10 to 12 minutes the mussels 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.049
 come out of the oven burning workers 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.520
 spray them with water to cool them 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.210
 then opened them and removed the pieces 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.210
 hot pours 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:43.060
 here are the pole muscles freshly 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:52.570
 pulled out of the mold the cross section 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:54.430
 of a heart an arm and a leg that the 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.290
 workers place on a form of plaster 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.930
 heat resistant for her 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.760
 cool down by keeping the appearance evolved to 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.500
 using a needle a father worker 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.930
 this resin in order to evacuate the air 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.440
 imprisoned and thus prevent the piece 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.840
 is breaking 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.399
 he loses any small holes for 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.430
 the pins that will hold the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.170
 various parts together 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.730
 each part is painted by hand so 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.310
 to highlight its main 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.290
 characteristics 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.739
 an artist carefully paints the veins 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.000
 in blue on that leg and then use some 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:32.800
 yellow for nerve endings and 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 red for the arteries even the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.000
 toe nails are colored 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.160
 before assembling the model the workers 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.740
 must insert pins 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.580
 metallic in each part they 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.580
 will reach them 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.750
 the artist can now complete the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.210
 painting the arteries on this muscle of 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.850
 poles the gray areas represent the 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.890
 ligaments 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.510
 she then focuses on the head you 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.710
 es first denying the eyes to give a 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.710
 semblance of life to the model 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:24.640
 everything is in the details the touch 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.390
 finale gives the impression that the eyes 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.390
 are alive 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.890
 the parties are in their place and in a 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.439
 hot oven for about 15 minutes 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.000
 so that the plastic soften the 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:44.360
 model will thus be easier to 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.040
 to assemble a fixed worker here the head 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.349
 on an inserted metal pin 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.209
 in the torso 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.379
 she places the brain in the skull and 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.379
 covers it with the cap 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.109
 then they place muscles on the 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.250
 arm insert the ankle into a hole 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.250
 of the corresponding part 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.530
 she adds bis is a muscle that 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.780
 help to move the hand and finally the 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.950
 deltoid the muscle that raises the arm to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.950
 the shoulder joint 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.430
 the worker wrapped tape 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:29.330
 around the arm to maintain the 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.949
 components and fixed to the torso of 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.780
 hooks and nickel-plated fasteners 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:39.919
 keep the parts removable 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:43.009
 place on the model assembled this model 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.770
 muscular scale measures 1 m 38 cm 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.389
 it includes 45 separate pieces all 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.389
 anatomically accurate 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.509
 the human body is really a 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.509
 extraordinary structure
