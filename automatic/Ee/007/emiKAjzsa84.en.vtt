00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.190
 - To get rid of your internal gas, we will try and repeat 15. &lt;br&gt; - How many times? 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.160
 Fifteen times! 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.120
 - Will delete the last call number, you understand? &lt;br&gt; - Yes. 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.850
 Let's Begin . 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.190
 One Two... 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.050
 - To make a loud noise to get rid of your gas. &lt;br&gt; - Five, six ... 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.520
 - Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.980
 - Thirteen, Fourteen, &lt;br&gt; - However, 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.490
 fifteen. 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.970
 Fifteen .. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sorry. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 fifteen. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.910
 &lt;i&gt; Limit the miracle of the first set. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.930
 - Do not say the last number, right? - Yes. 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.960
 Yeah . 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.460
 - Again, we will try with ten. How many times? &lt;br&gt; - Ten times. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.300
 - We will do fifteen times. How many times? &lt;br&gt; Fifteen times. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.980
 Eleven times. Let's Begin . 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 One, 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.190
 Two, 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.340
 Three, &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; I became a troubled Amber. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.970
 Seven, 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.600
 Eight, nine, 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.380
 ten. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.270
 Eleven? 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120
 We will do nine times of physical training. How often? &lt;I&gt; To improve the training focus &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.500
 Nine times. 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100
 One of his ten. How many times? &lt;br&gt; Eleven times. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.970
 Thirteen times. Begin. &lt;I&gt; The last count is correct. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.570
 &lt;i&gt; There is a trap in the count appeal, unknown to Amber. &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.990
 Do not utter the last number, right? 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.140
 How many times have I asked you to count? &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Do not utter the last number &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.030
 Do not utter the last number. 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.530
 Ummmam ... 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.240
 You did not understand what I said to her. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.040
 Apprentice # 4 Amber, she's confused. 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.190
 Ten times, then fifteen times. 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.010
 Fifteen times, then eleven times. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Embedded Amber &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.840
 &lt;i&gt; Amber is confused &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.800
 - Trainee. - Yes. 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.440
 Yeah 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000
 Last number Eleven clearly called 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.760
 The rest of the trainees, right? 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.250
 - Yes, that's right. &lt;br&gt; - We'll try again. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.690
 We will try again. 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.930
 Apprentice # 4 Amber, still do not understand. 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.840
 The squad leader called eleven times the previous time 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 - I mean repeating the last number &lt;br&gt; - Yes. 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.200
 I see. 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.270
 - We will do five times, you understand? &lt;br&gt; - Yes. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Three times. 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.230
 Start 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.300
 One, two, &lt;i&gt; for Amber, this numbering is more difficult than chemical training. &lt;/ I&gt; 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.980
 &lt;i&gt; Will this be a success? &lt;/ i&gt;
