little bit of training some of the I
wanted<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.020> point<00:01:50.290> out<00:01:50.470> some<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.830> nuances

wanted to point out some of the nuances

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.680 
wanted to point out some of the nuances
of<00:01:51.460> what<00:01:51.610> was<00:01:51.909> actually<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.330> on<00:01:53.340> one<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.460> the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
of what was actually going on one of the

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.560 
of what was actually going on one of the
one<00:01:55.690> of<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.869> key<00:01:56.619> points<00:01:57.610> of<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:57.940> exercise

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
one of the key points of the exercise

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.020 
one of the key points of the exercise
was<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.350> entry<00:01:59.860> on<00:02:00.039> the<00:02:00.190> hook<00:02:00.369> so<00:02:00.580> if<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.820> was<00:02:00.970> a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
was the entry on the hook so if it was a

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.550 
was the entry on the hook so if it was a
hook<00:02:01.180> from<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.479> arm<00:02:01.690> I<00:02:01.960> was<00:02:02.140> moving<00:02:02.409> in<00:02:02.530> with

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
hook from this arm I was moving in with

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.279 
hook from this arm I was moving in with
my<00:02:02.890> elbow<00:02:03.250> or<00:02:03.659> rather<00:02:04.659> often<00:02:04.929> they<00:02:05.170> were

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
my elbow or rather often they were

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.469 
my elbow or rather often they were
working<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.740> elbow<00:02:05.979> into<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.369> body<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:07.360> then

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
working the elbow into the body and then

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.930 
working the elbow into the body and then
getting<00:02:07.720> an<00:02:07.899> attachment<00:02:08.200> point<00:02:08.940> obviously

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
getting an attachment point obviously

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.100 
getting an attachment point obviously
because<00:02:10.090> he's<00:02:10.209> not<00:02:10.300> going<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.479> let<00:02:10.660> me<00:02:10.810> just

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110

twist on it for our street fighting

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.220 
twist on it for our street fighting
purposes<00:03:31.069> we<00:03:31.790> may<00:03:32.030> do<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.659> set<00:03:32.900> him<00:03:33.110> up

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
stun him pretty good if it works if it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.490 
stun him pretty good if it works if it

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.710 
strikes and our general rule of thumb is
if<00:05:20.300> I<00:05:21.110> try<00:05:21.380> to<00:05:21.440> technique<00:05:21.860> and<00:05:22.070> it<00:05:22.190> fails

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
if I try to technique and it fails

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.310 
if I try to technique and it fails
abandons<00:05:23.720> a<00:05:23.840> technique

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
abandons a technique

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.770 
abandons a technique
and<00:05:24.410> move<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.680> to<00:05:24.860> something<00:05:25.190> else<00:05:25.310> very<00:05:25.780> often

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
and move on to something else very often

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.630 
and move on to something else very often
if<00:05:26.930> we're<00:05:27.110> doing<00:05:27.230> some<00:05:27.530> type<00:05:27.680> of<00:05:27.710> rapid<00:05:28.310> like<00:05:28.460> a

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:28.640 
if we're doing some type of rapid like a

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.120 
if we're doing some type of rapid like a
neck<00:05:28.940> hold<00:05:29.210> and<00:05:29.480> he<00:05:30.080> manages<00:05:30.500> to<00:05:30.680> escape<00:05:30.800> I

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
neck hold and he manages to escape I

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.220 
neck hold and he manages to escape I
want<00:05:31.340> to<00:05:31.430> kelabra<00:05:31.670> him<00:05:31.970> right<00:05:32.300> away<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.780> want<00:05:33.170> to

that fist is right there ready and there
goes<00:06:09.050> my<00:06:09.230> combinations<00:06:10.150> in<00:06:11.150> some<00:06:11.420> of<00:06:11.540> the

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
goes my combinations in some of the

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.150 
goes my combinations in some of the
earlier<00:06:11.960> series<00:06:12.260> we<00:06:12.560> saw<00:06:12.740> some<00:06:12.950> hand

this<00:06:15.710> is<00:06:15.890> where<00:06:16.070> this<00:06:16.220> was<00:06:16.430> factored<00:06:16.820> in<00:06:16.940> again

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
this is where this was factored in again

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.040 
this is where this was factored in again
he<00:06:18.160> people<00:06:19.160> who<00:06:19.220> that<00:06:19.370> look<00:06:19.550> at<00:06:19.730> me<00:06:19.910> boom<00:06:20.660> I
