00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.690
 Nine people I'm standing there gets 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.670
 a kind of battlefield 4 beta short tips 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.859
 should be the melee as they go their 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.330
 make the start here as the kind as you 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.949
 theirs now also have one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.550
 single sum and thus the same 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.380
 presence in sight, such as cobra 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 quixote or reflex left we have that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.730
 solo is taking a lot of the bottom 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.769
 screen path has a relatively wide 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.079
 edge and a rather small field in the middle 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.880
 to the goal you have a point and to 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.800
 a circle around and difference to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.079
 two little dots that a bit 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 we can help on distance 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.600
 the hd 33 does not quite take it down 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.410
 as much as the fee but always 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 still enough 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.520
 the edge is a little further from hartz iv 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.440
 the middle also gets a little bigger 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 and the rand is slightly thinner obenrum 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 as the polo to the goal, it also offers 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.050
 again a point plus in the circle 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.789
 the outside now has these two 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.559
 small dots down there underneath 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.710
 Overall, I think of the two 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.180
 the hd 33 is a bit better because of that 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.340
 ratio in the middle just another piece 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320
 is bigger and it is not quite as much of 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.640
 takes away the screen 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.310
 but there are three others like them 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.570
 theirs in all matters even better 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.119
 find this hollo sight 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.100
 it had left to the reflex in 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 the middle to the cobra and right 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.970
 that cody will take down the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 three do not target too much 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.810
 the reflex, of course, takes the most 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.390
 away then comes the cobra and then that 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.460
 cody of the reflex may still sting 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 a little bit out but between 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.180
 the cobra and the colony do not rule 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.369
 big difference is the outer one 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.380
 Of course, when reflex again clearly on 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 greatest that of cobra mio is the 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.689
 relatively similar to july is minimal on the outside 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.299
 wider than the cobra for that kuoni 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.460
 but the advantage in the field in the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.170
 center that there is greatest that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.119
 reflex is cobra yes he is both 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 circular disabled small field 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.890
 and the loo is rather hexagonal 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.350
 and it makes it a bit bigger 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.729
 As always , the cobra has its own goal 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.369
 maybe three would strike me 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.840
 appear a little smaller than 13 that 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.610
 reflex again has a point and that 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.700
 coni has the same point this is 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.410
 also a little smaller than mp3 but 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.180
 to the point I personally think 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.040
 aim a little better than this 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.110
 That's why I like it 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.540
 Trio also best with it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.010
 half the largest field in the middle has little 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.960
 screen takes away this 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.730
 relatively precise point has the goal 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.380
 so if you have that kilo of freedom in 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.660
 the beta or halt in the main game is a 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.100
 Emma likes to take it up me 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.780
 can only recommend it and see you 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.290
 Hopefully the next video has you guys 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830
 like 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.830
 three people
