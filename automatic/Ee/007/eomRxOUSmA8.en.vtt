00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:05.590
 for years I was not asking where they could have gotten the 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.070
 Jehovah's Witnesses 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.519
 some ideas are absolutely twisted 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.939
 to produce that way your bible 

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:15.939
 there is no bible as they are 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.109
 a libya changes the texts like this 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:21.999
 this had been an original inspiration of his or had he based himself on 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:23.269
 something 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.749
 and during the rest of the questions 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.289
 up to here I discovered it in an absolutely casual way 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.090
 when the witnesses of jehovah mention their crooked translation of juan 1 to 1 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.530
 they only rely on another version that is the same version is the version 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.140
 one month a reactor according to them was a Catholic priest 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.490
 I was looking for the yohannes grever version 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.430
 Removing Roma with Santiago as we say in Spain 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 to see if he could find how someone had been able to translate jammal like them 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.100
 the new Testament 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.970
 india casually the grever yuan version fell into my hands 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.150
 yesterday a curious version because the author said he had received with 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.470
 special help when it came to translating your version you could read what it says 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.350
 yohannes grever 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.540
 of its production a solution that looks like a drop of water to another opa 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.380
 of water 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 to the version of the new world the version of the witnesses of jehová 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.760
 in the prologue of his translation of the new testament yohannes anticipate says 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.780
 A) Yes 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.550
 many contradictions 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.230
 between those that appear the old rolls and the new testament arose 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.050
 if it were a subject of the graiver rations of the constant relations of 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.730
 graiver 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.310
 well said 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.770
 grever found that what he thought and what they saw the new 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.860
 testament was different so he prayed asking villa 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.790
 see who cried while having a villa 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.240
 operations that were answered 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.180
 the discrepancies clarified by the world spirit of God 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.930
 grebber's wife once 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.670
 pluna andes world the world spirit of god 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.230
 It was often the instrument to give the correct answers 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.780
 from the spiritual messengers to the pastor read 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.859
 Yohanan Grever had been a Catholic priest but then he became 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:14.539
 explicit 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.529
 and he had to translate somehow not a will and he found that the 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:22.149
 well damaged Syrian macondo with his spiritualist teachings 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.629
 He also believed that Christ was a created being and that the Archangel Michael 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:29.339
 he did not believe either to hell or to the immortality of the soul 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.569
 with the production of the new testament of his territory he found himself with 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.919
 that was different 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:37.119
 so he asked for guidance 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:39.999
 and as his wife in a spirit medium 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:44.149
 peña to the spirits that clarify how he had to produce review his new 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.179
 will 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.479
 and the spirits told him 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.339
 and something identical to the translation of the fire witnesses came out 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:57.260
 and they knew that the jehovah witnesses actually grever was a spiritist 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.419
 appears in different publications of them 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.419
 I understand that he was indeed a spiritualist 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.639
 in the talaia of February 15, 1956 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:12.620
 on page 111 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.449
 a paragraph 11 says well 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:20.870
 is very clear in those points where the texas rt kreder cre 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.809
 they did not help in their translation 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:27.099
 but even though they knew he was a spiritualist 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:30.539
 Although they knew there was a demonic spirit, they had helped him in 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.319
 its translation 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.889
 sustained promotion of the new world 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.409
 wants to indicate to the spiritualist version to read 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:40.549
 and it seems that we started 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.829
 to finish tying ends 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.769
 about who bunge is that society witnesses wish 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.769
 in that sense that is pretty clear enough 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.500
 I hope it is not a pure question of theological speculation we are 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:03:59.669
 it is simply an academic discussion 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.669
 what is at stake is much more important 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:07.509
 the avda Bible that there is only one god 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.529
 and it is that all 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:11.729
 we will have to appear one day before that god 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.989
 none of us will be able to say anything 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.219
 Renato were also interested in how he tells us moral standards that he has 

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:19.689
 Traveled to us 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:23.189
 but at the end of the day we were so interested in becoming one of 

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:25.749
 us and die on the cross 

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:28.620
 what the bible says is that for centuries 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.219
 this senior man 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:34.989
 francesca is inspired by the holy spirit showed clearly of 

00:04:34.989 --> 00:04:36.260
 repeated way 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.260
 that the god himself the holder of the iron bar mop 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.460
 he was not going to wash his hands with us sending archangel simple bread 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.219
 not at all a good neighbor 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.340
 the men are interested but we are not going so much as to complicate the 

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:54.169
 existence I am very comfortable in the sky and we enter is very well as to 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:56.080
 go down to earth 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.779
 therefore will send you dialing 

00:04:58.779 --> 00:05:02.449
 the bible says that it is indeed god himself incarnated 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.580
 and he did it for each and every one of us 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.580
 I do not think all of us also wicket 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.759
 during years 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.650
 I was not asking 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.779
 where they could have taken the witnesses of jehovah 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:18.779
 even so they are already absolutely twisted 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.659
 to produce that way your bible 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.720
 there is no bible as they are 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.909
 a bible we change this is like this 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:30.229
 this had been an original inspiration of his or had been based on 

00:05:32.059 --> 00:05:34.550
 and during the rest of the questions 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.069
 up to here I discovered it in an absolutely casual way 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.869
 when the witnesses of jehovah mention their crooked translation of juan 1 to 1 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.490
 only 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.419
 if they support in another version that is the same version that version 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.490
 one month a problem 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:52.290
 that according to them
