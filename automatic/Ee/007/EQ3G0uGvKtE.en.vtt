00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.289
 gravity falls full of secrets it's not in 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.119
 this city probably everyone knew that there is 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.759
 many puzzles that you can 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.489
 decide which whole world you don't have to scratch 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.599
 let's start an investigation and they lead 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:32.029
 notice what you can 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.960
 unraveled hidden codecs secret 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.879
 cipher inside 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:41.149
 go through hot silk stock and i wanted 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.699
 it is shorter to say so and found pears 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:50.510
 secret door secret behind both this 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:51.559
 crazy cool creepy this secret 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.719
 wax museum 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.589
 they are just as alive except hello 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:03.409
 this past 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:04.940
 your uncle staff in this series is the SOS 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:08.750
 hidden room full 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.390
 terrible wax figures my doing 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.930
 wax figure wall imagine you 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.930
 me 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.770
 but someone steals his head 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.969
 dipper and mable are investigating 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:32.009
 to find out who cut off the head 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:37.380
 waxy wall we congratulate dug up 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.090
 mystery and now we bury words but for 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.130
 let's start our investigation 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.899
 from the initial screensaver gravity falls she 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 reveals some interesting things 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:56.060
 the very end of the screensaver we can notice 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.560
 picture with different characters here it is 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.500
 this image only appears on 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.219
 instant and it contains many 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.799
 secret let's see this mysterious 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.190
 page contains 10 characters around 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.900
 triangular creature in the hat 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.170
 each character refers to a specific 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.030
 character rule and falls let's 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.350
 look at these trash characters falling 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:28.730
 star and pine well it's time to say jar 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.110
 with a secret carrot 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.659
 yes keep chewing on my sweater let's 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.640
 let's start with a shooting star the only thing 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.549
 the place where we can see this symbol 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.890
 mable sweater 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:46.250
 the shooting star of this mable is now 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:50.440
 consider pine so what do you think where 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:55.220
 we could see this character wait a minute 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:57.530
 exactly on the dipper cap he lost his 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.319
 green cap during a battle with a dwarf 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.739
 and got a new beat in the fall store 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:07.810
 gift shop mystery pine this dipper 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:15.170
 looks fine and I'll take 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:18.040
 hook cat well what about the symbol and this 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 pretty tricky 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.329
 check out dimmer 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.780
 I successfully struck my face this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.730
 symbol 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.250
 there is also one of the winds 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.040
 maybe lama is mine too my what are you 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:35.060
 think it remains a mysterious secret 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.980
 incoming desolation have learned that 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.730
 cryptogram can be seen during 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.139
 final credits and dipper what do you think 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:48.889
 false glitter or llama wool wide for you 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.849
 and the lamas are their greatest free nature 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.859
 easy to miss 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:58.669
 so look carefully osiba 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:04:01.239
 dipper is about to read 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.040
 cryptograms you need a special cipher 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.060
 cipher is a way to hide important information 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.950
 from others 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.510
 only the one who has the key can 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.139
 read the secret message 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.760
 this is caesar's cipher using caesar's cipher you 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.250
 can decipher the message in 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.530
 cryptogram sit down and you have 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.160
 letter s 3 letters and left on 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.320
 alphabet 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.610
 be careful moving three letters 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:29.219
 alphabetically right 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.180
 red letters code black decryption 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:35.289
 let's look at an example 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:39.520
 use ciphers take letters 2wd 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:43.240
 cue using Caesar cipher three letters 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:45.310
 back you get stan can you 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.050
 decipher the cryptogram at the end of the credits 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.819
 we are here to interrogate the man given 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.819
 forester in the killing of wax scene 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:14.250
 let's decode the place he's still in 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.250
 ventilation he's still ventilation 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:22.169
 finally we are the only cardboard cut 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.169
 women reporter shandra same mayo 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.349
 time at the front confirm that this 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.449
 many strange tears closed the case 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:33.400
 things happened about these fools we 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.009
 uncovered secret dipper symbols and 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.349
 mable and using a special cipher we 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:41.319
 deciphered the cryptogram and found out that 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.569
 he's still venting what 's on 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:51.760
 the next series of successful solving 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:54.300
 secret is not what it seems 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.300
 sen
