headstock of my guitar here basically it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
headstock of my guitar here basically it
attaches<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.160> headstock<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.360> clamps

attaches to the headstock and it clamps
down<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.410> strings<00:00:25.770> what<00:00:26.040> it<00:00:26.130> does<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
down on the strings what it does it

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.490 
down on the strings what it does it
without<00:00:26.490> fretting<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.660> basically

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
without fretting it out and basically

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.070 
without fretting it out and basically
what<00:00:28.650> it's<00:00:28.770> designed<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.850> to<00:00:30.539> dampen

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
what it's designed to do is to dampen

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.439 
what it's designed to do is to dampen
the<00:00:31.350> open<00:00:31.740> strings<00:00:32.129> it<00:00:32.430> doesn't<00:00:32.790> affect<00:00:33.150> it

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:33.449 
the open strings it doesn't affect it

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:35.299 
the open strings it doesn't affect it
doesn't<00:00:34.290> affect<00:00:34.559> your<00:00:34.680> playing<00:00:35.010> when<00:00:35.220> you're

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
doesn't affect your playing when you're

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.200 
doesn't affect your playing when you're
fretting<00:00:39.470> but<00:00:40.470> what<00:00:40.769> it<00:00:40.860> will<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.460> will

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
fretting but what it will do is will

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:50.750 
fretting but what it will do is will
keep<00:00:48.290> it<00:00:49.290> will<00:00:49.409> keep<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.860> open<00:00:50.190> strings<00:00:50.519> from

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
keep it will keep the open strings from

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.750 
keep it will keep the open strings from
ringing<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.350> lets<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.129> basically

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
ringing out and it lets you it basically

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.000 
ringing out and it lets you it basically
acts<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.269> like<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.510> third<00:00:54.900> hand<00:00:55.229> it<00:00:55.500> helps<00:00:55.650> a<00:00:55.860> lot

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
acts as like a third hand it helps a lot

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.100 
acts as like a third hand it helps a lot
with<00:00:56.159> your<00:00:56.339> muting<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.239> really<00:00:57.750> good<00:00:57.930> for

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
with your muting it's really good for

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.780 
with your muting it's really good for
tapping<00:00:58.409> runs<00:00:58.830> or<00:00:59.159> if<00:00:59.280> you're<00:00:59.400> doing<00:00:59.519> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.760> of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
tapping runs or if you're doing a lot of

tapping runs or if you're doing a lot of
legato<00:01:00.210> style<00:01:00.659> playing<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.620> here's<00:01:01.830> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
legato style playing so here's a

legato style playing so here's a
close-up<00:01:02.159> of<00:01:02.400> the<00:01:02.460> string<00:01:02.820> dampener<00:01:03.269> as<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
close-up of the string dampener as you

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.690 
close-up of the string dampener as you
can<00:01:04.440> see<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.799> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> cool<00:01:05.129> things<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.549> it

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
can see one of the cool things about it

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.850 
can see one of the cool things about it
is<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> clamps<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.320> guitar<00:01:07.650> it's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is it just clamps on the guitar it's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
is it just clamps on the guitar it's
really<00:01:08.190> easy<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.460> take<00:01:09.210> off<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.110> doesn't

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
really easy to take off it doesn't

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.859 
really easy to take off it doesn't

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
can do with the string damper that it

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
can do with the string damper that it
really<00:01:29.729> helps<00:01:30.030> out<00:01:30.179> with
