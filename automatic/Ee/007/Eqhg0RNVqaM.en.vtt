00:05:45.869 --> 00:05:45.879 
think you're likely to be long a bit

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:51.720 
think you're likely to be long a bit
doesn't<00:05:46.419> matter

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.890 

and<00:05:52.150> water<00:05:52.750> bows<00:05:53.080> I<00:05:53.710> think<00:05:54.070> there's<00:05:54.220> three<00:05:54.460> I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900

00:05:54.900 --> 00:06:01.260 
and water bows I think there's three I
have<00:05:55.900> no<00:05:55.990> idea<00:05:56.260> how<00:05:56.350> many<00:05:56.410> I<00:06:00.030> just<00:06:01.030> dropped

them<00:06:01.360> on<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.630> side<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.230> you<00:06:02.320> can<00:06:02.410> actually<00:06:02.560> see

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
them on the side so you can actually see

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.720 
them on the side so you can actually see
them<00:06:03.100> that<00:06:03.400> I<00:06:03.640> think<00:06:04.120> they're<00:06:04.240> on<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.360> back
