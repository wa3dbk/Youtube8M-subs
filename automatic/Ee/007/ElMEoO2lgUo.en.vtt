00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
playing bad towards the end of the game

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.900 
playing bad towards the end of the game
and<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.620> was<00:03:41.710> just<00:03:41.950> so<00:03:42.160> weird<00:03:42.190> i<00:03:42.610> don't<00:03:42.640> know

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
and it was just so weird i don't know

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.050 
and it was just so weird i don't know
the<00:03:43.570> team<00:03:43.870> i<00:03:44.170> think<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.160> team<00:03:45.340> actually<00:03:45.580> looks

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
the team i think the team actually looks

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.610 
the team i think the team actually looks
amazing<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.570> paper<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:46.900> I<00:03:47.140> think<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.410> team

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
amazing on paper like I think the team

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.740 
amazing on paper like I think the team
is<00:03:47.800> probably<00:03:48.610> one<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.120> best<00:03:49.270> ones<00:03:49.540> I've

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
is probably one of the best ones I've

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.300 
is probably one of the best ones I've
Billy<00:03:49.990> that's<00:03:50.260> really<00:03:50.620> good<00:03:50.830> it's<00:03:51.010> got<00:03:51.160> some

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
Billy that's really good it's got some

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.150 
Billy that's really good it's got some
great<00:03:51.520> players<00:03:51.850> mostly<00:03:52.780> high<00:03:52.990> rated<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:54.040> it's

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
great players mostly high rated and it's

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.140 
great players mostly high rated and it's
probably<00:03:54.370> one<00:03:54.520> of<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.670> most<00:03:54.760> solid<00:03:55.060> offensive

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
probably one of the most solid offensive

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.199 
probably one of the most solid offensive
ever<00:03:55.630> used<00:03:55.870> but<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.860> was<00:03:57.040> just<00:03:57.070> weird<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.670> don't

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
ever used but it was just weird I don't

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
thought bringing the scrub daughter

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.370 
thought bringing the scrub daughter
anyway<00:04:18.100> because<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.459> really<00:04:19.180> think<00:04:19.420> it's<00:04:20.200> a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
anyway because I really think it's a

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.170 
anyway because I really think it's a
good<00:04:20.410> team<00:04:20.770> and<00:04:20.980> obviously<00:04:21.640> can't<00:04:21.880> prove<00:04:22.120> that

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
good team and obviously can't prove that

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.670 
good team and obviously can't prove that
because<00:04:22.690> I<00:04:22.750> didn't<00:04:22.900> do<00:04:22.990> very<00:04:23.050> well<00:04:23.260> but<00:04:23.470> I<00:04:23.530> just

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
because I didn't do very well but I just

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.320 
because I didn't do very well but I just
tells<00:04:23.830> me<00:04:24.100> i<00:04:24.130> think<00:04:24.580> if<00:04:24.700> you<00:04:24.729> guys<00:04:25.060> use<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
tells me i think if you guys use the

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.740 
tells me i think if you guys use the
team

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
team

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.720 
team
I'll<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.260> absolutely<00:04:26.590> fine<00:04:26.890> but<00:04:27.280> it<00:04:27.400> cost<00:04:27.610> me

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
I'll be absolutely fine but it cost me

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.330 
I'll be absolutely fine but it cost me
around<00:04:27.820> about<00:04:28.140> 150,000<00:04:29.140> coins<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.070> didn't

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
around about 150,000 coins and I didn't

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.070 
around about 150,000 coins and I didn't
score<00:04:30.580> some<00:04:30.760> decent<00:04:31.120> girls<00:04:31.240> like<00:04:31.420> Falcao<00:04:31.870> and

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
score some decent girls like Falcao and

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.390 
score some decent girls like Falcao and
Cavani<00:04:32.350> Cavani<00:04:32.740> was<00:04:32.920> actually<00:04:33.160> a<00:04:33.190> lot<00:04:33.340> better

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
Cavani Cavani was actually a lot better

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.970 
Cavani Cavani was actually a lot better
than<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.450> thought<00:04:34.480> by<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.230> end<00:04:35.440> up<00:04:35.590> conceding

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
than I thought by just end up conceding

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.430 
than I thought by just end up conceding
more<00:04:36.310> goals<00:04:36.580> to<00:04:36.790> med<00:04:36.940> school<00:04:36.970> and<00:04:37.480> I<00:04:38.170> think

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
more goals to med school and I think

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.020 
more goals to med school and I think
that's<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.710> problem<00:04:38.890> I<00:04:39.190> don't<00:04:39.520> think<00:04:39.820> it's<00:04:39.940> the

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
that's a problem I don't think it's the

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.820 
that's a problem I don't think it's the
defense<00:04:40.330> i<00:04:40.450> think<00:04:40.690> it<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.900> just<00:04:41.080> firstly<00:04:41.620> me

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
defense i think it is just firstly me

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.190 
defense i think it is just firstly me
we're<00:04:42.400> gonna<00:04:42.610> give<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:43.150> seven<00:04:43.660> point<00:04:43.930> five

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:44.200 
we're gonna give it a seven point five

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.980 
we're gonna give it a seven point five
out<00:04:44.500> of<00:04:44.530> 10<00:04:44.920> for<00:04:44.950> 150k<00:04:45.670> it's<00:04:46.270> not<00:04:46.450> too<00:04:46.600> bad<00:04:46.750> and

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
out of 10 for 150k it's not too bad and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.100 
out of 10 for 150k it's not too bad and
honestly<00:04:47.410> Falcao<00:04:47.980> and<00:04:48.250> Cavani<00:04:49.030> are<00:04:49.330> really

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
honestly Falcao and Cavani are really

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.870 
honestly Falcao and Cavani are really
really<00:04:50.350> good<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.800> high<00:04:50.980> high<00:04:51.220> work<00:04:51.430> rate<00:04:51.460> on

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
really good the high high work rate on

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.850 
really good the high high work rate on
Cavani<00:04:52.270> didn't<00:04:53.080> matter<00:04:53.170> it's<00:04:53.410> all<00:04:53.500> like<00:04:53.680> he

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
Cavani didn't matter it's all like he

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.890 
Cavani didn't matter it's all like he
was<00:04:53.980> always<00:04:54.220> in<00:04:54.430> the<00:04:54.520> box<00:04:54.700> and<00:04:54.880> always<00:04:55.600> ready

and<00:04:58.630> it's<00:04:58.960> just<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.320> was<00:04:59.440> weird<00:04:59.620> I<00:04:59.890> just<00:05:00.190> I

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
and it's just it was weird I just I

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.950 
and it's just it was weird I just I
can't<00:05:00.640> act<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:01.060> explain<00:05:01.300> why<00:05:01.480> I'm<00:05:01.600> literally

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
can't act to explain why I'm literally

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.500 
can't act to explain why I'm literally
lost<00:05:02.169> for<00:05:02.350> words<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.800> can't<00:05:03.280> explain<00:05:03.370> what<00:05:04.330> went

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
lost for words I can't explain what went

wrong<00:05:04.690> with<00:05:04.810> this<00:05:04.930> team<00:05:05.140> like<00:05:05.380> I<00:05:05.620> really<00:05:06.310> don't

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
wrong with this team like I really don't

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.400

know<00:05:06.580> it<00:05:06.850> doesn't<00:05:07.150> make<00:05:07.270> any<00:05:07.570> sense<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:08.050> think

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.159

it<00:05:08.680> was<00:05:09.160> just<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.580> actual<00:05:10.060> fact<00:05:10.330> that<00:05:10.960> i<00:05:10.990> can

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
it was just the actual fact that i can

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.720 
it was just the actual fact that i can
see<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.410> more<00:05:11.680> goals<00:05:12.010> than<00:05:12.130> i<00:05:12.280> could<00:05:12.490> scroll
