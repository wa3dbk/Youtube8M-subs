00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
300 2.8 lens I find this to be a little

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.169 
300 2.8 lens I find this to be a little
bit<00:00:48.739> lighter<00:00:49.039> I<00:00:49.339> don't<00:00:49.730> know<00:00:49.789> if<00:00:49.850> it's<00:00:50.030> because

00:00:50.169 --> 00:00:50.179 
bit lighter I don't know if it's because

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:52.479 
bit lighter I don't know if it's because
of<00:00:50.359> the<00:00:50.480> carbon<00:00:50.809> hood<00:00:51.199> or<00:00:51.350> other<00:00:51.530> parts<00:00:52.010> inside

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
of the carbon hood or other parts inside

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.200 
of the carbon hood or other parts inside
but<00:00:53.269> I<00:00:53.719> find<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.469> be<00:00:54.499> pretty<00:00:54.769> manageable

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
but I find this to be pretty manageable

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.619 
but I find this to be pretty manageable
and<00:00:56.210> easy<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:56.629> use<00:00:56.659> so<00:00:57.319> it<00:00:57.440> weighs<00:00:57.679> in<00:00:58.010> at<00:00:58.629> six

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
and easy to use so it weighs in at six

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.860

we've<00:02:17.620> got<00:02:17.800> your<00:02:18.010> autofocus<00:02:18.850> here<00:02:19.120> your<00:02:19.540> focus

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
we've got your autofocus here your focus

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.020 
we've got your autofocus here your focus
limiter<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.910> VR<00:02:22.920> okay<00:02:23.920> so<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.520> can<00:02:24.700> set<00:02:24.910> it

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
limiter your VR okay so you can set it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.390 
limiter your VR okay so you can set it
for<00:02:25.180> normal<00:02:25.420> or<00:02:25.780> for<00:02:26.440> if<00:02:26.500> you're<00:02:26.650> on<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.800> tripod

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
for normal or for if you're on a tripod

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.060 
for normal or for if you're on a tripod
I<00:02:27.640> think<00:02:28.540> that's<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:28.960> you're<00:02:29.110> doing<00:02:29.290> hand

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
I think that's what if you're doing hand

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.760 
I think that's what if you're doing hand
moving<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> lot<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> sideways<00:02:31.350> and<00:02:32.350> things<00:02:32.590> like

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
moving a lot of sideways and things like

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.240 
moving a lot of sideways and things like
that<00:02:33.150> your<00:02:34.150> memory<00:02:34.450> recall<00:02:34.930> and<00:02:35.260> your<00:02:35.800> sound

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
that your memory recall and your sound

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280 
that your memory recall and your sound
on<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.210> on<00:02:37.300> as<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> can<00:02:37.780> see<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.170> but

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
on and on as you can see that but

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.900 
on and on as you can see that but
they're<00:02:38.770> made<00:02:38.890> from<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.130> beautiful<00:02:39.520> carbon

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
they're made from a beautiful carbon

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.660 
they're made from a beautiful carbon
fiber<00:02:40.320> material<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> food<00:02:41.830> section<00:02:42.160> here

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
fiber material in the food section here

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.120 
fiber material in the food section here
and<00:02:43.620> obviously<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.920> not<00:02:44.950> something

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and obviously this is not something

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.190 
and obviously this is not something
you'd<00:02:45.670> want<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:45.910> be<00:02:46.030> hand-holding<00:02:46.810> although
