test

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.440 
test
it's<00:01:24.470> just<00:01:25.190> consists<00:01:25.580> of<00:01:25.700> a<00:01:25.789> simple<00:01:26.090> paddle

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's just consists of a simple paddle

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.660 
it's just consists of a simple paddle
that<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.890> squirt<00:01:28.130> milk<00:01:28.280> from<00:01:28.580> each

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
that you see squirt milk from each

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.999 
that you see squirt milk from each
quarter<00:01:29.030> into<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:30.170> there's<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.440> solution

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
quarter into and then there's a solution

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.940 
quarter into and then there's a solution
that<00:01:31.490> you<00:01:31.880> add<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.539> milk<00:01:32.720> equal<00:01:33.560> parts<00:01:33.830> a

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
that you add to the milk equal parts a

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.039 
that you add to the milk equal parts a
one-to-one<00:01:34.220> ratio

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
one-to-one ratio

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.230 
one-to-one ratio
what<00:01:36.049> what<00:01:36.409> it<00:01:36.500> does<00:01:36.679> is<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.670> solution<00:01:38.000> from

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
what what it does is the solution from

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.449 
what what it does is the solution from
the<00:01:38.420> CMT<00:01:38.990> reacts<00:01:39.799> with<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.100> white<00:01:40.250> blood

00:01:40.449 --> 00:01:40.459 
the CMT reacts with the white blood

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:42.760 
the CMT reacts with the white blood
cells<00:01:40.520> in<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.090> milk<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:41.780> when<00:01:42.140> when<00:01:42.500> there's<00:01:42.709> a

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
cells in the milk so when when there's a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.980 
cells in the milk so when when there's a
high<00:01:43.399> somatic<00:01:43.970> cell<00:01:44.179> count<00:01:44.209> in<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.630> milk<00:01:44.810> it

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
high somatic cell count in the milk it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.229 
high somatic cell count in the milk it
will<00:01:45.140> react<00:01:45.470> in<00:01:45.679> the<00:01:45.800> melt<00:01:45.979> will<00:01:46.160> show<00:01:46.310> up<00:01:46.550> so

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:47.239 
will react in the melt will show up so

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:49.419 
will react in the melt will show up so
so<00:01:47.810> what<00:01:47.959> you<00:01:48.050> look<00:01:48.229> for<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.649> and<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.250> good

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
so what you look for is and in a good

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.460 
so what you look for is and in a good
clean<00:01:49.700> cow<00:01:49.910> they<00:01:50.209> know<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.780> viscosity<00:01:51.140> is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
clean cow they know the viscosity is

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.619 
clean cow they know the viscosity is
going<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.979> stay<00:01:52.129> the<00:01:52.280> same<00:01:52.459> as<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.819> milk<00:01:53.030> the

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:53.629 
going to stay the same as the milk the

00:01:53.629 --> 00:01:55.749 
going to stay the same as the milk the
thicker<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:54.140> it<00:01:54.289> gets<00:01:54.500> is<00:01:54.769> the<00:01:55.310> higher<00:01:55.580> the

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
thicker that it gets is the higher the

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.150 
thicker that it gets is the higher the
cell<00:01:55.970> count<00:01:56.179> is<00:01:56.330> going<00:01:56.479> to<00:01:56.690> be<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.560> what<00:01:57.830> we<00:01:58.009> do

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
cell count is going to be so what we do

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.520 
cell count is going to be so what we do
is<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:58.910> look<00:01:59.300> for<00:01:59.539> the<00:01:59.629> cows<00:01:59.780> we<00:02:00.080> screen<00:02:00.379> out

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
is just look for the cows we screen out

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.499 
is just look for the cows we screen out
every<00:02:00.860> cow<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:01.069> comes<00:02:01.550> fresh<00:02:01.849> we<00:02:02.179> screener

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
every cow that comes fresh we screener

what the quarter Melchor does is this

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.850 
what the quarter Melchor does is this
normally<00:02:29.720> you've<00:02:29.870> got<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.050> milking<00:02:30.440> cow<00:02:30.470> where

normally you've got a milking cow where

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.399 
normally you've got a milking cow where
the<00:02:31.069> amount<00:02:31.610> goes<00:02:31.819> into<00:02:32.090> four<00:02:32.269> quarters<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
the amount goes into four quarters so

to<00:03:12.200> utilize<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.890> second<00:03:13.280> pipeline<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.110> this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
to utilize that second pipeline and this

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.140 
to utilize that second pipeline and this
simple<00:03:15.500> little<00:03:15.620> thing<00:03:15.920> here<00:03:16.250> has<00:03:16.730> become<00:03:16.970> a

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
simple little thing here has become a

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.500 
simple little thing here has become a

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.320 
paddle in my opinion is the absolutely
best<00:03:48.890> management<00:03:49.370> tool<00:03:49.700> that<00:03:49.820> a<00:03:49.940> farmer<00:03:50.300> can

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
best management tool that a farmer can

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:56.070 
best management tool that a farmer can
have<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:51.020> them<00:03:51.140> out<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.500> outside<00:03:51.950> ray

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.930 

and<00:03:56.230> then<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.530> just<00:03:56.680> swirl<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.130> around<00:03:57.190> and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
and then you just swirl it around and

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.320 
and then you just swirl it around and
you<00:03:58.120> look<00:03:58.270> for<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.570> one<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:58.840> Joe

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.360 

okay<00:04:04.200> so<00:04:04.410> this<00:04:04.530> one<00:04:05.070> is<00:04:05.100> obviously<00:04:05.610> elbow<00:04:06.180> I

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
okay so this one is obviously elbow I

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.370 
okay so this one is obviously elbow I
felt<00:04:08.370> often<00:04:09.000> we<00:04:09.090> use<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.420> B<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:09.690> get<00:04:09.870> up<00:04:10.050> like<00:04:10.080> in

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
felt often we use it B to get up like in

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.880 
felt often we use it B to get up like in

that the pasteurizer or or to warm up
the<00:04:19.609> Bell<00:04:19.790> then<00:04:20.150> I'll<00:04:20.690> follow<00:04:20.930> this<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.320> the

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
the Bell then I'll follow this to the

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.230 
the Bell then I'll follow this to the
Barrow<00:04:21.650> I<00:04:21.739> heat<00:04:22.040> it<00:04:22.070> up<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.730> then<00:04:22.910> I've<00:04:23.030> got<00:04:23.210> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
Barrow I heat it up and then I've got a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.600 
Barrow I heat it up and then I've got a
water<00:04:23.600> line<00:04:23.870> from<00:04:24.230> here<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.860> the<00:04:24.980> gas<00:04:25.190> building

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
water line from here to the gas building

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:38.020

that<00:04:25.790> pumps<00:04:26.090> it<00:04:26.210> over

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.019 

the<00:04:39.030> gap

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.219 

you<00:04:46.029> know<00:04:46.090> healthy<00:04:46.479> cows<00:04:46.689> don't<00:04:46.960> fluctuate

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
you know healthy cows don't fluctuate

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.980 
you know healthy cows don't fluctuate
much<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:47.889> SoCal<00:04:48.340> cows<00:04:49.060> are<00:04:49.210> under<00:04:49.449> stress<00:04:49.719> when

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
much in SoCal cows are under stress when

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.379 
much in SoCal cows are under stress when
their<00:04:50.169> nutrition<00:04:50.979> changed<00:04:51.879> dramatically

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
their nutrition changed dramatically

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.019 
their nutrition changed dramatically
when<00:04:52.960> their<00:04:53.110> environment<00:04:53.560> changes<00:04:54.039> you<00:04:54.969> know

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:55.029 
when their environment changes you know

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:56.070 
when their environment changes you know
that's<00:04:55.210> when<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.479> cell<00:04:55.689> count<00:04:55.900> really

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
that's when the cell count really

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.519 
that's when the cell count really
fluctuates<00:04:56.680> but<00:04:56.860> if<00:04:56.979> you<00:04:57.099> can<00:04:57.279> focus<00:04:57.520> on<00:04:57.879> on

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
fluctuates but if you can focus on on

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:00.779 
fluctuates but if you can focus on on
feeding<00:04:59.529> the<00:04:59.650> cows<00:04:59.889> right<00:05:00.039> keeping<00:05:00.699> them

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789

stress-free clean and good other prep
with<00:05:04.360> good<00:05:05.259> practices<00:05:05.439> you<00:05:06.009> know<00:05:06.039> your<00:05:06.310> cell

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
with good practices you know your cell

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.010 
with good practices you know your cell
counts<00:05:06.819> generally<00:05:07.210> you're<00:05:07.330> gonna<00:05:07.479> stay

really<00:05:08.289> consistent<00:05:08.949> what<00:05:09.279> do<00:05:09.340> you<00:05:09.460> average

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
really consistent what do you average

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.920 
really consistent what do you average
well<00:05:11.800> after<00:05:12.159> we<00:05:12.279> averaged<00:05:12.669> about<00:05:12.969> 60,000

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
well after we averaged about 60,000

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.219 
well after we averaged about 60,000
through<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.229> year<00:05:15.419> you<00:05:16.419> know<00:05:16.509> probably<00:05:16.930> this

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
through the year you know probably this

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.659 
through the year you know probably this
year<00:05:17.289> we<00:05:17.560> might<00:05:17.740> be<00:05:17.919> able<00:05:18.039> to<00:05:18.129> be<00:05:18.279> a<00:05:18.310> little<00:05:18.580> bit

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
year we might be able to be a little bit

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.239 
year we might be able to be a little bit
lower<00:05:18.849> because<00:05:19.319> we<00:05:20.319> sold<00:05:20.499> off<00:05:20.710> a<00:05:20.740> lot<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.159> our

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:21.249 
lower because we sold off a lot of our

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:23.100 
lower because we sold off a lot of our
nurse<00:05:21.430> Cal's<00:05:21.699> last<00:05:21.999> year<00:05:22.270> and<00:05:22.479> so<00:05:22.779> now<00:05:22.930> we're

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
nurse Cal's last year and so now we're

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.619 
nurse Cal's last year and so now we're
holding<00:05:23.439> out<00:05:23.560> some<00:05:23.589> cows<00:05:24.009> that<00:05:24.449> some<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.569> these

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:25.629 
holding out some cows that some of these

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:27.269 
holding out some cows that some of these
cows<00:05:25.900> are<00:05:26.110> feeding<00:05:26.379> the<00:05:26.589> calves<00:05:26.830> probably

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
cows are feeding the calves probably

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.709 
cows are feeding the calves probably
have<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.460> self<00:05:27.699> kind<00:05:27.879> of<00:05:28.060> two<00:05:28.330> or<00:05:28.449> three<00:05:28.479> hundred

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:28.719 
have a self kind of two or three hundred

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:30.450 
have a self kind of two or three hundred
thousand<00:05:29.319> but<00:05:29.499> they're<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.860> highest<00:05:29.979> ones<00:05:30.339> I

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
thousand but they're the highest ones I

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.129 
thousand but they're the highest ones I
got<00:05:30.669> so<00:05:30.939> that's<00:05:31.150> who's<00:05:31.330> feeding<00:05:31.689> the<00:05:31.900> calves

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
got so that's who's feeding the calves

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.399 
got so that's who's feeding the calves
so<00:05:32.849> I<00:05:33.849> mean<00:05:34.029> you<00:05:34.479> know<00:05:34.539> and<00:05:34.719> I<00:05:34.749> think<00:05:34.990> you<00:05:35.139> know

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
so I mean you know and I think you know

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.320 
so I mean you know and I think you know
a<00:05:35.469> lot<00:05:35.560> of<00:05:35.710> people<00:05:36.009> ask<00:05:36.189> me<00:05:36.430> what's<00:05:36.639> the<00:05:36.819> secret

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
a lot of people ask me what's the secret

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.450 
a lot of people ask me what's the secret
to<00:05:37.719> you<00:05:38.259> know<00:05:38.379> having<00:05:38.620> a<00:05:38.770> little<00:05:38.979> cell<00:05:39.189> count

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
to you know having a little cell count

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.189 
to you know having a little cell count
and<00:05:39.610> I<00:05:39.819> don't<00:05:39.879> think<00:05:40.240> there<00:05:40.419> is<00:05:40.449> you<00:05:40.900> know<00:05:40.990> one

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
and I don't think there is you know one

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.409 
and I don't think there is you know one
thing<00:05:41.409> I<00:05:41.589> mean<00:05:41.740> we<00:05:41.889> all<00:05:42.069> are<00:05:42.400> good<00:05:42.969> farmers

everyone be here but there's just a lot
of<00:05:45.370> little<00:05:45.610> things<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:46.389> I've<00:05:46.990> been

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
of little things that I've been

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.929 
of little things that I've been
fortunate<00:05:47.529> enough<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.889> be<00:05:48.129> on<00:05:48.159> enough<00:05:48.520> farms

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:48.939 
fortunate enough to be on enough farms

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.909 
fortunate enough to be on enough farms
to<00:05:49.149> pick<00:05:49.389> up<00:05:49.569> all<00:05:49.960> the<00:05:50.289> good<00:05:50.439> things<00:05:50.649> that
