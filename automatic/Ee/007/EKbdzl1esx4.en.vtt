00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the fourth-quarter come that you really

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
to hit that next gear and you don't lose

a<00:02:37.660> lot<00:02:37.840> better<00:02:38.110> than<00:02:38.319> other<00:02:38.410> people<00:02:38.740> off<00:02:38.890> I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
a lot better than other people off I

a lot better than other people off I
hate<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.090> way<00:02:40.240> it<00:02:40.330> makes<00:02:40.450> you<00:02:40.540> feel<00:02:40.630> at<00:02:41.110> the

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
time but it's probably one of the most
