00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.340

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.090
 become the nicest 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.450
 that seems a lot 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.720
 valve is monster 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.790
 I have of course 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.560
 really a lot 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.810
 yes it is the first time sitting next to me I want to lay something special 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.340
 so will have a place 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.660
 done a lot of new things 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.260
 yes maybe what would be a change 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.390
 put in a new jacket 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.390
 they still have numbers from the beginning of my career that 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.630
 who do have the potential to actually be there again 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.759
 reclaim in the workshops 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.519
 I then took a double took 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.149
 it became 9 

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:31.099
 and not now I am again time to stop the prince news is coming 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.649
 that's not me here either afterwards 

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:37.249
 how important goal for 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.079
 the gun is just for me 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:44.599
 nijhof who then just makes a new track and those that had 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.859
 a bit for you trying to get warm 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.119
 after this there is always something the nma big role do you want anyway 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.859
 only when the album comes out 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.209
 the standard that caused work was open to you in what you do 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.179
 I love her melodic too slow side we are quickly on 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.829
 pure i say that 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.569
 I don't care much when building to prevent eating ppo fruit 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.739
 the city 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.739
 you can also expect 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.390
 if someone dropped essentially from the death of a patient patient and always too 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.459
 born early 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.759
 every euro the seat when it is not so I am anti dirk van tichelt 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:30.149
 but lack is possible 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:32.759
 you can see that on a belly unveiling site 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.259
 festivals where countries 

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:37.259
 hard for but also and keep wet tells 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.979
 if that kind on the field there is a lot between people seeing this role 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.979
 You know beforehand that we have never stood it was hectic 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:48.639
 in the long term 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.349
 think today hear church building running 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.349
 that's how big the sound is 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.869
 Yes that 

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:59.869
 yes that makes countries look a bit risky 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.409
 I don't have a stage fright 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.849
 it is 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.459
 but it is a bit of it 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.459
 da silva also had a big festive touch with small clubs 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:14.759
 we remained that otherwise usually margins 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:17.090
 do you get on stage freely and bent 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.949
 the answer is with closing and 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.129
 then you may actually stick your head products for the first time 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.729
 less turns exits so there is a cd player an ancien fitting 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.479
 the man was on the trail 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.479
 I see it building up
