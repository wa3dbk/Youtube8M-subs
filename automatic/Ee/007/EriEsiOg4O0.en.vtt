00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.920
 then you never mattis the vitis in the field 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.930
 interesting thing we say let's say 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.020
 just this year is the new herbicide 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.350
 glyphosate based lens and brakes 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.470
 cannes 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:35.320
 as we see in this sign 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 characteristics of the formulated dl are 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.280
 those of having a selectivity 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.860
 extraordinary a bit in all cultures 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.570
 obviously including the screw is 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.360
 an equally interesting activity 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.100
 especially on some ruderals like the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.550
 mauve that are difficult to control 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.940
 with the other bcd you can see 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.130
 also the witness obviously a lot 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.850
 grass and product results 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:04.030
 right in the vine here next then 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.509
 another novelty of maxime and vineyard one 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.580
 bubi rimate tebuconazole mixture us 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.770
 we say made just for the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.790
 tolerance issues 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.369
 resistant to the three solos to others 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.770
 let's say products as it is coming out 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.050
 lately the dosage is a liter e 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.430
 half two per hectare of formulated 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.810
 commercial 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.940
 and here you see practically the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.009
 product features 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.619
 the most interesting thing about this 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.990
 formulated is the application extremely 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.630
 early just in the early stages 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.550
 vegetative of the vine to take advantage of to the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.130
 maximum activity obviously the news 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.869
 they are not limited to lens and vineyard 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.220
 we also have some interesting news 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.200
 line speech on late blight lives 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.390
 where we believe and here we are in Veneto 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.539
 in the region par excellence of the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.640
 peronospora the four bet as principal 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.709
 defense actor and clear that in 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.720
 we have this kind of calendar 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:01.410
 inserted two faul pet interventions 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.360
 at the beginning in the first vegetative phases 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.179
 even for the speech also scoliosis 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.679
 we know that the fall peta an activity 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.950
 very interesting on scoliosis for then 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.920
 keep the quantum based products 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.590
 divi network in the central part e 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.050
 end with lisa io that another novelty 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.670
 a case- based product families 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.310
 this is a type of line if there 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.110
 move eventually to the other 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.510
 sign we also see another line 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.050
 always available with martin products 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.330
 sheen 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.390
 another line always to be regulated 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.100
 in fact we see the opening with two of 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.890
 we will put the carbamates in it 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.230
 particular to then hold in the part 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.770
 central dimetomorph interventions 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.630
 polpet quantum f that's the thing 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.110
 extremely interesting right from the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.810
 2014 and have the opportunity after the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.820
 dimetomorf to use a mixture of 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.400
 dimetomorf plus 100 families 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.950
 isaiah to then close with the solitaire 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.440
 in the seventh application in this 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.900
 particular case it is clear that maxim has 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.030
 approved these own different lines 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.430
 to address even in terms of 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.990
 regulating product limits la 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.770
 integrated defense we say and effective the 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.770
 as effective as possible
