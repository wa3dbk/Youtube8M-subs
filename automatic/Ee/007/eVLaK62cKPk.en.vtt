I'm just gonna dip one by one and it's

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.699 
I'm just gonna dip one by one and it's
important<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.329> you<00:02:36.629> open<00:02:37.019> up<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.439> caps

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
important that you open up the caps

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.210 
important that you open up the caps
before<00:02:38.340> because<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.590> water<00:02:40.590> marbling<00:02:40.799> you

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
before because for water marbling you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.830 
before because for water marbling you
kind<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.519> have<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.819> go<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.299> bit<00:02:42.540> fast

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
kind of have to go a little bit fast

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.640 
kind of have to go a little bit fast
otherwise<00:02:43.819> it<00:02:44.819> tends<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.269> dry<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:46.290> that's<00:02:46.439> not

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
otherwise it tends to dry and that's not

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.550 
otherwise it tends to dry and that's not
gonna<00:02:46.799> be<00:02:46.980> good<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.930> for<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.109> look<00:02:49.319> I

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
gonna be good and for this look I

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.229 
gonna be good and for this look I
actually<00:02:49.739> want<00:02:50.220> quite<00:02:51.889> few<00:02:52.889> drops<00:02:53.189> of<00:02:53.489> each

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
actually want quite few drops of each

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.929 
actually want quite few drops of each
color<00:02:54.599> so<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.500> it<00:02:55.889> builds<00:02:56.129> up<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.549> bullseye

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
color so that it builds up the bullseye

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.990 
color so that it builds up the bullseye
nicely<00:02:57.870> I<00:03:00.919> want<00:03:01.919> to<00:03:02.010> do<00:03:02.129> it<00:03:02.250> near<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.609> water

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
nicely I want to do it near the water

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.330 
nicely I want to do it near the water
so<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.709> polish<00:03:05.189> didn't<00:03:05.489> sink<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:06.000> bottom

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
so the polish didn't sink to the bottom

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.240 
so the polish didn't sink to the bottom
and<00:03:08.340> I<00:03:08.689> actually<00:03:09.689> already<00:03:10.200> tested<00:03:10.739> East<00:03:10.980> to

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
and I actually already tested East to

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.849 
and I actually already tested East to
beforehand<00:03:11.939> before<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.359> even<00:03:12.810> started<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.829> I

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
beforehand before I even started it so I

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.710 
beforehand before I even started it so I
know<00:03:13.980> that<00:03:14.159> they<00:03:14.519> work<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:15.209> well<00:03:15.480> together

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
know that they work really well together

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.110 
know that they work really well together
and<00:03:16.019> they<00:03:16.409> spread<00:03:16.769> properly<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.579> water

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.250 

this<00:03:25.690> is<00:03:25.900> my<00:03:26.140> fourth<00:03:26.590> drop<00:03:27.010> of<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.519> silver<00:03:28.260> and

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
this is my fourth drop of the silver and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.039 
this is my fourth drop of the silver and
I<00:03:29.379> need<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.799> definitely<00:03:30.670> do<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.180> few<00:03:31.569> more<00:03:32.879> drops

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
I need to definitely do a few more drops

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:51.190 
I need to definitely do a few more drops
to<00:03:35.049> build<00:03:35.349> it<00:03:35.470> up<00:03:35.560> nicely

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.920 

so<00:03:51.800> you<00:03:51.860> do<00:03:52.099> need<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.340> wait<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:52.970> tell<00:03:53.209> the

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
so you do need to wait and tell the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.010 
so you do need to wait and tell the
color<00:03:54.230> completely<00:03:55.540> Express<00:03:56.540> out<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.930> the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
color completely Express out in the

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.380 
color completely Express out in the
water<00:03:57.260> before<00:03:57.860> you<00:03:58.160> drop<00:03:58.520> in<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.819> next<00:03:59.120> drop

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
water before you drop in the next drop

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.040 
water before you drop in the next drop
because<00:03:59.900> otherwise<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:01.880> my<00:04:02.060> mix<00:04:02.360> and<00:04:02.810> that's

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
because otherwise in my mix and that's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.990 
because otherwise in my mix and that's
not<00:04:03.230> gonna<00:04:03.410> be<00:04:03.500> that's<00:04:03.950> gonna<00:04:04.220> be<00:04:04.489> like<00:04:04.970> a

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
not gonna be that's gonna be like a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.940 
not gonna be that's gonna be like a
messy<00:04:05.330> look<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.050> you<00:04:06.110> don't<00:04:06.349> want<00:04:06.530> that<00:04:06.709> I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
messy look so you don't want that I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.040 
messy look so you don't want that I
think<00:04:07.700> this<00:04:07.850> is<00:04:08.000> gonna<00:04:08.150> be<00:04:08.239> my<00:04:08.450> last<00:04:08.630> drop<00:04:09.020> of

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
think this is gonna be my last drop of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.860 
think this is gonna be my last drop of
orange<00:04:09.910> and<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.000> have<00:04:11.209> enough<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.750> that

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
orange and I have enough of that

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.920 
orange and I have enough of that
bullseye<00:04:12.470> build<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.830> think<00:04:16.750> that's<00:04:17.750> good

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
bullseye build so I think that's good

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.080 
bullseye build so I think that's good
enough<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.590> I'm<00:04:19.280> gonna<00:04:19.370> go<00:04:19.639> ahead<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:19.850> draw

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
enough and I'm gonna go ahead and draw

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.240 
enough and I'm gonna go ahead and draw
my<00:04:20.239> design<00:04:20.600> quickly<00:04:21.079> I'm<00:04:21.769> actually<00:04:21.950> gonna

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.129 
my design quickly I'm actually gonna
turn<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.820> cup<00:04:23.060> because<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.540> like<00:04:23.870> these

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139
