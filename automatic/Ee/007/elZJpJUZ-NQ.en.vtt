stats<00:00:02.669> as<00:00:03.570> you<00:00:03.959> can<00:00:04.080> see<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> get<00:00:04.440> Sonya<00:00:04.799> way

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
stats as you can see I get Sonya way

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.309 
stats as you can see I get Sonya way
earlier<00:00:05.759> than<00:00:05.819> i<00:00:06.120> usually<00:00:06.299> do<00:00:06.629> know<00:00:06.779> just

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
earlier than i usually do know just

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.100 
earlier than i usually do know just
because<00:00:07.470> how<00:00:07.919> good<00:00:08.160> it<00:00:08.250> is<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.990> well<00:00:09.990> it

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
because how good it is and how well it

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.280 
because how good it is and how well it
works<00:00:10.320> with<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.650> new<00:00:10.800> room<00:00:11.040> setup<00:00:11.429> that<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.639> use

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
works with the new room setup that I use

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.410 
works with the new room setup that I use
so<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.380> gonna<00:00:13.500> be<00:00:13.860> actually<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.330> going<00:00:15.330> a

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
so I'm gonna be actually a going a

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.960 
so I'm gonna be actually a going a
little<00:00:15.540> bit<00:00:15.660> more<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.929> depth<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.490> if

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
little bit more in depth on that so if

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570 
little bit more in depth on that so if
I'm<00:00:18.119> women<00:00:18.330> versus<00:00:18.600> ad<00:00:18.779> i<00:00:19.140> use<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.410> out<00:00:19.859> scaling

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
I'm women versus ad i use on out scaling

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.689 
I'm women versus ad i use on out scaling
armor<00:00:20.910> instead<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.039> flat<00:00:23.039> armor<00:00:23.430> because

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
armor instead of flat armor because

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.820 
armor instead of flat armor because
scaling<00:00:24.660> helps<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.109> scale<00:00:25.500> through<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.740> late

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
scaling helps you scale through the late

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.790 
scaling helps you scale through the late
game<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> armor<00:00:27.359> runes<00:00:27.570> for<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.560> seals

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
game and the armor runes for the seals

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.690 
game and the armor runes for the seals
are<00:00:28.949> actually<00:00:29.310> nerfed<00:00:29.550> pretty<00:00:30.650> hard<00:00:31.650> if<00:00:32.160> you

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
are actually nerfed pretty hard if you

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.549 
are actually nerfed pretty hard if you
think<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:32.940> it<00:00:33.090> I<00:00:33.329> mean<00:00:33.540> look<00:00:33.570> at<00:00:33.809> this<00:00:33.930> if

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
think about it I mean look at this if

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.990 
think about it I mean look at this if
you<00:00:34.680> only<00:00:34.800> use<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.070> one<00:00:35.219> armor<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.730> used<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
you only use you one armor it used to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.889 
you only use you one armor it used to
give<00:00:36.120> 1.41<00:00:37.309> so<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.340> think<00:00:38.579> these<00:00:38.730> new<00:00:39.000> seals<00:00:39.750> are

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
give 1.41 so I think these new seals are

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.940 
give 1.41 so I think these new seals are
much<00:00:40.050> better<00:00:40.640> imo<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.809> go<00:00:42.960> zhonya's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
much better imo and if you go zhonya's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.680 
much better imo and if you go zhonya's
that<00:00:44.280> also<00:00:44.489> gives<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.789> armor<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that also gives your armor so you get to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
that also gives your armor so you get to
go<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.649> got<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> go<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.100> late<00:00:47.280> game<00:00:47.460> and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
go you got to go for late game and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.010 
go you got to go for late game and
you're<00:00:47.760> good<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> go<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.210> early<00:00:48.570> game<00:00:48.719> because

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
you're good to go on early game because

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.569 
you're good to go on early game because
you<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.410> zhonya's<00:00:49.800> after<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.340> finish

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you have your zhonya's after you finish

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
you have your zhonya's after you finish
your<00:00:50.610> death<00:00:50.820> fire<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:52.050> course<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.440> paper<00:00:52.710> level

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
buffed in this patch the scaling health

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.109 
buffed in this patch the scaling health
is<00:01:05.790> very<00:01:06.030> viable<00:01:06.420> now<00:01:07.220> of<00:01:08.220> course<00:01:08.700> movement

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
is very viable now of course movement

know why use movement sequence it's to
catch<00:01:13.260> up<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:13.710> enemies<00:01:14.340> better<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.060> course

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
catch up on enemies better and of course

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.600 
catch up on enemies better and of course
to<00:01:15.600> Rome<00:01:16.170> effectively<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.070> back<00:01:17.280> in<00:01:17.430> lane

to Rome effectively get back in lane

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.630 
to Rome effectively get back in lane
faster<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.619> works<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.310> well<00:01:20.460> with

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
faster and it just works so well with
