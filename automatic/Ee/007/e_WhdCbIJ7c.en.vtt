enough<00:02:52.170> even<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.160> little<00:02:53.340> bit<00:02:53.540> we<00:02:54.540> have<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
enough even a little bit we have to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.160 
enough even a little bit we have to
convert<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.680> would<00:02:56.010> two<00:02:56.250> planks<00:02:56.550> BAM<00:02:57.239> okay
