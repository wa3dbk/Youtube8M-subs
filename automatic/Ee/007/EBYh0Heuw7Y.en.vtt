00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 the production of tomatoes has a large 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.690
 importance in the national economy 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 we visited a family production that 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.429
 produces some varieties like tomato 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.650
 yellow cherry 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.440
 following the father's teachings 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.859
 producer luli mar is one of the children of 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.900
 and is a clear example of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:27.810
 succession in the field 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.810
 the first one I planted blue 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 seif hashid who was born thanks to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.270
 work and dedication of all farming 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.899
 Tomato is producing with a lot of 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.350
 quality as major entrepreneurs in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.980
 the family produces vegetables and 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.280
 tomato culture three months ago 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.510
 implanted a new variety the tomato 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.109
 yellow cherry is warm rustic climate 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 You do not need secondment. 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.910
 tasty and has high productivity if 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.700
 want variety new agenda to introduce 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.799
 in the market which is the yellow cherry tomato 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.229
 it has its peculiarity the question of 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.580
 not to have been a tastier tomato 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.640
 much sweeter 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.659
 already the first copies of the tomato 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.770
 Persimmon in Brazil came from Peru and Bolivia. 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.439
 Ecuador 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.140
 this variety is best suited for 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.930
 diets and also for the prevention of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.079
 in addition to contributing to the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.890
 reducing the risks of the occurrence of 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.820
 cancer of the esophagus has effect 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.810
 direct protector against free radicals 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:45.899
 involved in approximately 40 diseases 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.659
 cultivating this variety requires careful 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.520
 the producer 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.860
 few can not even produce because 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.229
 it has an ease in relaxing 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.509
 much in the foot of it requires a fertilization more 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.329
 special is making it better 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.469
 lighting best fertilization stacking 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.930
 As you can see, it has the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.159
 sturdier dog tomato 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.930
 which weighs a lot 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.940
 then this greatly influences production 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.410
 khaki tomato but automatic in 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970
 relation to others in favor of one 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.290
 best tastes you have 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 tomato santa cruz was once one of the most 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 marketed 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.450
 this variety produces large fruits 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 weighing between 130 and 150 grams could 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.510
 be cultivated in several regions 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.540
 brazilian 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:35.160
 this variety presents a great 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.960
 resistance cracks pests and diseases 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.320
 without the variety santa cruz a 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.570
 variety that was already very commercial 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.730
 today it no longer has as much power 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.250
 with so many others because the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:50.880
 tomato is more sensitive to the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.790
 easier and I've already rejected the trade 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.650
 a little he has another market 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.370
 select why not take excellent 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.980
 independent taste of variety 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.930
 according to Mr. Francisco, a process 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.340
 of cultivation is the same 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.880
 everything here is simple but the dedication 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.450
 turns simplicity into productivity 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.530
 the seed is sown in the trays and after 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.620
 five days 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.590
 the seed thrives and then the second 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.050
 Pass is to bring this seedling that pops up 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.900
 this is the ideal size it already 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.110
 with 14 leaf passes more or less in 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.480
 around 18 to 20 cm and from now on the 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.790
 final process of it here now in the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.660
 stacking process says low 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.110
 the bassan 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.739
 today the property uses a very 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.130
 modern for both irrigation and 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:50.070
 application and the tomato has good 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.600
 sun and water in quantity 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.549
 correct 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.560
 every form of plant feeding goes 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.140
 be conducted in the water of the system of 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.450
 irrigation with drip us to 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.120
 accuracy up to 98% 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.950
 so it saves water and also hand 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.959
 of work that is at the same time doing 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.810
 the call is making enough in the plant 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:13.080
 with the reduction of spacing between 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.650
 plants and with proper management the number 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.709
 exceeded all expectations 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:22.200
 the productivity result here is 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.180
 above the national average 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.220
 today we are here with the expectation 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.430
 around 200 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.040
 nothing per hectare and at the level of Brazil that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.510
 is estimated at that time around 120 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.920
 up to 160 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.170
 so we are well above average 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.610
 national then I am very satisfied 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:40.340
 with the quality of the product we have a 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.070
 excellent quality product here is 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.210
 with 96 field days 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.770
 so I'm very pleased with the 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.750
 productivity but we also made a 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.220
 work well accompanied the control 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.290
 well done on time and on time 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.820
 fertilization all at once is this 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.160
 it favors cultural treatment 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.490
 main factor in having an answer 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.820
 from now to luli sea and lord 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.820
 Francis, what you see today is the fruit of 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.980
 a lot of work on the market the price 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.820
 has hit prices 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:13.300
 traded up to R $ 100 per share. 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.300
