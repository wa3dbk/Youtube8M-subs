00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 here in sÃ£o paulo is a very strong heat 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.509
 it has not rained for some time and the 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 our drinking water tanks 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.639
 are almost at the end 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.519
 So today I'm going to teach you a way to 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.420
 save more than 2,000 liters of water 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.130
 per year using practically a real 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 so let's make a quick account myself 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 I'll calculate how much a faucet 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.039
 dripping throws out of water in a year 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.220
 because this is a problem if 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.910
 you did not have what you got in your 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.439
 House 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:40.649
 I'll leave the beque here under the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.829
 faucet dripping for an hour on a 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.920
 time dripping tap or more or less 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:51.989
 250 milliliters know when she would spend 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.379
 one day I will modify 250 times 24 that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.989
 of the six thousand milliliters 6 liters of water 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.110
 in a day to know how to conjugate is a year 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:06.780
 will multiply by 365 that gives 2.190 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.060
 liters of water in one year 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 it is obvious that this will depend on the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.560
 frequency of tap dripping or 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 be as the drops fall for now more 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
 in that frequency that was seen of more than 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.310
 2 thousand liters of water, how can we 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.680
 solve this is very simple, just change 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.659
 a very simple line that stands 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.640
 there inside the tap is a little rubber 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.229
 very little happens that not all of the 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 Faucet uses the same type of rubber 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.579
 So we had to find out what the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.159
 kind of rubber that has our faucet 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.100
 where to disassemble faucet 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.930
 Come on, the first thing is to close the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.820
 general house registration 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.220
 if you do not know what the general registry is 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.680
 with the record that closes the tap is just 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.820
 close all records until you stop 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.170
 of tap water 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.729
 I'm going to disassemble this faucet here. 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.970
 because it is a kind of faucet more 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.470
 common that the kitchen then the first 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 I'm going to take this cap off with a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.939
 little crevice inside the cap 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.369
 There is a screw in June. I'm going to take this one. 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.710
 for me too 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.439
 this screw will be released. 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.450
 part here which is where people holding 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.860
 a personal look pulling taking care 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.130
 not to lose the screw 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.970
 in this piece already leaves next to the road book to 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.340
 this other piece here and then just take it 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.200
 this part here and I will use a 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.150
 mouth 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.850
 water that came out that also that the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:31.890
 Record has already stopped here. 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.930
 that can be changed 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.030
 when you have the inside of the 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.950
 tap in the hands just take it here 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.040
 in a construction material store and 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870
 If you do not 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.850
 you can leave the faucet disassembled 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.440
 because it may be that other faucets 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.220
 House owns no record of you 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.680
 closed 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.530
 Just take a picture of this little girl and take it. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.200
 here in Sao Paulo costs 60 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.900
 good cents when you have 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.739
 It's only you, my love. 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:09.840
 here again and assemble the 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:12.060
 more videos that help you 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.720

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.910
 where it was published 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.459
 I will indicate here two videos and also 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.540
 speak of economy and of this relationship with 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.280
 environment

 recycled paper at home all very cool 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.250
 because the paper is very good to stay 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.590
 almost perfect 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.080
 common enough and on your side here

 I download the crazy way and slow it down 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.040
 the amount of water spent in the 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.760
