happens after that initiation you do not

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.060 
happens after that initiation you do not
develop<00:01:52.280> a<00:01:52.520> tumor<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:53.450> after<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.530> have<00:01:54.829> an

develop a tumor if after you have an

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.520 
develop a tumor if after you have an
initiator<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.359> add<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.140> promoter<00:01:59.380> here<00:02:00.380> you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
initiator you add a promoter here you

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.730 
initiator you add a promoter here you
create<00:02:00.859> a<00:02:00.920> change<00:02:01.340> in<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.060> cell<00:02:02.499> you<00:02:03.499> don't

create a change in the cell you don't

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.950 
create a change in the cell you don't
change<00:02:04.009> it<00:02:04.219> it<00:02:04.429> doesn't<00:02:04.700> go<00:02:05.030> here<00:02:05.479> you<00:02:05.539> create

change it it doesn't go here you create

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.670 
change it it doesn't go here you create
a<00:02:06.049> change<00:02:06.289> now

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
a change now

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.650 
a change now
and<00:02:06.800> a<00:02:06.830> promoter<00:02:07.430> which<00:02:08.090> induces

to add that promoter shortly after it or

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.550

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
tumor there are circumstances in which

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.210

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
tumor but the important thing to

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.729 
tumor but the important thing to
remember<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:42.140> that<00:02:42.170> if<00:02:42.440> you<00:02:42.560> have<00:02:44.739> initiators

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
remember is that if you have initiators

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.229 
remember is that if you have initiators
without<00:02:46.070> promoters<00:02:46.489> they<00:02:46.640> won't<00:02:46.820> grow<00:02:47.000> and

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
without promoters they won't grow and

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.610 
without promoters they won't grow and
there<00:02:47.390> are<00:02:47.450> a<00:02:47.510> number<00:02:47.570> of<00:02:47.840> initiators<00:02:48.440> and

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
there are a number of initiators and

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.199 
there are a number of initiators and
promoters<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.040> have<00:02:49.220> been<00:02:49.340> described<00:02:49.760> this

pathogenesis of retinal blastoma this is

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.270 
pathogenesis of retinal blastoma this is
a<00:04:58.150> tumor<00:04:58.870> which<00:04:59.020> usually<00:04:59.200> appears<00:04:59.740> in<00:04:59.979> young

children in which the retinal cells
cells<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.860> the<00:05:05.950> retina<00:05:05.979> get<00:05:06.789> transformed<00:05:07.300> and

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
cells in the retina get transformed and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.640 
cells in the retina get transformed and
you<00:05:07.570> get<00:05:07.720> a<00:05:07.750> malignant<00:05:08.320> tumor<00:05:08.349> of<00:05:08.770> the<00:05:08.970> RBI

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
you get a malignant tumor of the RBI

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.500 
you get a malignant tumor of the RBI
these<00:05:11.650> individuals<00:05:12.460> carry<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.720> somatic

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
these individuals carry a somatic

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.589 
these individuals carry a somatic
mutation<00:05:16.510> from<00:05:17.200> the<00:05:18.060> from<00:05:19.060> one<00:05:19.389> of<00:05:19.510> the

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
mutation from the from one of the

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:23.250 
mutation from the from one of the
parents<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.410> is<00:05:20.800> an<00:05:21.039> autosomal<00:05:21.460> dominant<00:05:22.330> so

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
parents it is an autosomal dominant so

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.650 
parents it is an autosomal dominant so
therefore<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.800> only<00:05:24.039> need<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.430> have<00:05:24.580> one<00:05:25.300> copy

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
therefore you only need to have one copy

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:31.770 
therefore you only need to have one copy
of<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:27.150> ugly<00:05:28.150> of<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:29.320> mutant<00:05:29.710> gene<00:05:30.780> what

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
of the ugly of the mutant gene what

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.589 
of the ugly of the mutant gene what
happens<00:05:32.200> is<00:05:32.349> that<00:05:32.380> these<00:05:33.190> individuals<00:05:34.180> are<00:05:34.330> at

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
happens is that these individuals are at

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.890 
happens is that these individuals are at
high<00:05:34.930> risk<00:05:34.960> because<00:05:35.830> they<00:05:36.430> have<00:05:36.729> a<00:05:36.970> mutant

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
high risk because they have a mutant

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.279 
high risk because they have a mutant
army<00:05:38.020> gene<00:05:38.800> which<00:05:39.419> in<00:05:40.419> all<00:05:40.660> of<00:05:40.870> their<00:05:41.020> cells

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289 
army gene which in all of their cells

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.629 
army gene which in all of their cells
and<00:05:41.590> if

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 
and if

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:45.179 
and if
have<00:05:42.969> some<00:05:43.419> additional<00:05:43.930> mutation<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:44.800> comes

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:45.189 
have some additional mutation that comes

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:47.760 
have some additional mutation that comes
and<00:05:45.370> often<00:05:45.669> it<00:05:45.759> comes<00:05:45.969> early<00:05:46.479> in<00:05:46.599> life<00:05:46.810> you<00:05:47.560> can

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
and often it comes early in life you can

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.309 
and often it comes early in life you can
get<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.009> cell<00:05:48.310> which<00:05:48.580> now<00:05:48.789> has<00:05:49.090> two<00:05:49.629> copies<00:05:49.900> of

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 
get a cell which now has two copies of

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.309 
get a cell which now has two copies of
the<00:05:50.680> of<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.819> mutated<00:05:52.300> gene<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.689> so<00:05:53.169> these

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
the of the mutated gene and so these

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.709 
the of the mutated gene and so these
individuals<00:05:54.039> have<00:05:54.219> a<00:05:54.249> very<00:05:54.699> high<00:05:55.060> frequency

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
individuals have a very high frequency

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.260 
individuals have a very high frequency
of<00:05:55.990> tumors<00:05:56.319> to<00:05:56.439> the<00:05:56.560> retina<00:05:56.919> they<00:05:57.370> also<00:05:57.610> have

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
of tumors to the retina they also have

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.209 
of tumors to the retina they also have
high<00:05:58.509> frequency<00:05:59.080> of<00:05:59.319> other<00:05:59.620> tumors<00:06:00.069> including

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:00.219 
high frequency of other tumors including

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.489 
high frequency of other tumors including
ovarian<00:06:00.909> cancers<00:06:01.270> that<00:06:01.300> will<00:06:01.719> that<00:06:02.199> occur

00:06:02.489 --> 00:06:02.499 
ovarian cancers that will that occur

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:05.429 
ovarian cancers that will that occur
later<00:06:02.770> in<00:06:02.919> life<00:06:02.949> so<00:06:03.699> this<00:06:04.060> rbg<00:06:04.779> was<00:06:04.810> one<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.319> the

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:05.439 
later in life so this rbg was one of the

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.640 
later in life so this rbg was one of the
first<00:06:05.800> genes<00:06:06.159> that<00:06:06.370> was<00:06:06.749> discovered<00:06:07.749> as<00:06:07.870> being

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
first genes that was discovered as being

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.519 
first genes that was discovered as being
an<00:06:08.860> inherited<00:06:09.779> cancer<00:06:12.090> predisposition<00:06:13.529> but

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:14.529 
an inherited cancer predisposition but

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:17.189 
an inherited cancer predisposition but
you<00:06:14.680> need<00:06:14.919> to<00:06:15.099> have<00:06:15.279> an<00:06:15.629> additional<00:06:16.629> change<00:06:16.990> in

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
you need to have an additional change in

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.809 
you need to have an additional change in
the<00:06:17.289> cell<00:06:17.469> in<00:06:17.620> order<00:06:17.889> to<00:06:18.009> manifest<00:06:18.279> the<00:06:18.550> tumor

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
the cell in order to manifest the tumor

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.480 
the cell in order to manifest the tumor
there<00:06:19.330> is<00:06:19.569> also<00:06:19.750> a<00:06:19.960> sporadic<00:06:20.560> form<00:06:21.039> in<00:06:21.279> which

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
there is also a sporadic form in which

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.809 
there is also a sporadic form in which
you<00:06:21.849> have<00:06:21.879> to<00:06:22.210> have<00:06:22.560> two<00:06:23.560> hits<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:24.219> the<00:06:24.340> cell<00:06:24.610> in

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:24.819 
you have to have two hits to the cell in

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:28.980 
you have to have two hits to the cell in
order<00:06:25.389> to<00:06:25.569> somehow<00:06:25.810> get<00:06:26.469> a<00:06:26.680> mutation<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.990> in

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
order to somehow get a mutation I in

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.070 
order to somehow get a mutation I in
both<00:06:29.830> copies<00:06:30.189> of<00:06:30.580> the<00:06:31.090> gene<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.750> reason<00:06:32.020> these

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
both copies of the gene the reason these

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.749 
both copies of the gene the reason these
people<00:06:32.409> have<00:06:32.529> such<00:06:32.710> a<00:06:32.740> high<00:06:33.009> incidence<00:06:33.279> of

people have such a high incidence of

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.519 
people have such a high incidence of
tumor<00:06:34.089> is<00:06:34.210> because<00:06:34.539> they<00:06:34.719> already<00:06:34.870> have<00:06:35.319> one

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:35.529 
tumor is because they already have one

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.739 
tumor is because they already have one
mutated<00:06:36.009> copy<00:06:36.219> before<00:06:36.430> they<00:06:36.789> start<00:06:38.370> okay<00:06:39.749> in
