00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.490 

I<00:00:04.759> was<00:00:05.759> also<00:00:05.879> doing<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.600> sitting<00:00:07.259> gains

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
I was also doing a video sitting gains

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.620 
I was also doing a video sitting gains
last<00:00:07.799> night<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.940> thought<00:00:09.059> I'd<00:00:09.179> oil<00:00:09.330> product

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
last night and I thought I'd oil product

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.720 
last night and I thought I'd oil product
video<00:00:09.809> here<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> should<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.309> set<00:00:11.550> gain

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
video here so I should have a set gain

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.640 
video here so I should have a set gain
this<00:00:11.969> crossovers<00:00:12.599> all<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.170> just<00:00:13.380> well

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
this crossovers all that just well

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.580 
this crossovers all that just well
pretty<00:00:13.799> much<00:00:13.889> sitting<00:00:14.130> in<00:00:14.280> amp<00:00:15.320> now<00:00:16.320> I'm<00:00:16.440> not

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
pretty much sitting in amp now I'm not

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.220 
pretty much sitting in amp now I'm not
expert<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.130> don't<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> scope<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.630> don't<00:00:19.080> have

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
expert I don't have a scope I don't have

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.220 
expert I don't have a scope I don't have
a<00:00:19.260> DD<00:00:19.590> one<00:00:20.090> this<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.270> purely<00:00:21.510> sitting<00:00:21.990> gains

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
a DD one this is purely sitting gains

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.859 
a DD one this is purely sitting gains
with<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> screwdriver<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.850> by<00:00:24.150> year<00:00:24.420> thought

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
with the screwdriver and by year thought

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.710 
with the screwdriver and by year thought
over<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> Colossus<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.269> I'm<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.420> gonna<00:00:27.539> do

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
over the Colossus and I'm not gonna do

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240 
over the Colossus and I'm not gonna do
any<00:00:27.900> music<00:00:28.199> here<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.650> set<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> game

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
any music here actually set the game

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.540 
any music here actually set the game
show<00:00:29.730> hadn't<00:00:30.090> do<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> okay<00:00:30.630> so<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.279> what<00:00:32.309> they

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
show hadn't do it okay so so what they

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.420 
show hadn't do it okay so so what they
mean<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.420> main<00:00:33.630> thing<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:34.340> here<00:00:35.340> we

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
mean that's my main thing so here we

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.930 
mean that's my main thing so here we
have<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:36.140> low-pass<00:00:37.140> filter<00:00:37.370> so<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> low-pass

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
have a low-pass filter so a low-pass

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
have a low-pass filter so a low-pass
filter<00:00:39.510> cuts<00:00:40.500> off<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:41.070> frequencies<00:00:41.610> below

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
filter cuts off the frequencies below

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.340 
filter cuts off the frequencies below
this<00:00:42.120> point<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.980> 35<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> 250<00:00:45.059> so<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.840> think

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this point so it's 35 to 250 so we think

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.590 
this point so it's 35 to 250 so we think
here<00:00:46.739> okay<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.879> obviously<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.329> be<00:00:48.450> between

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
here okay is obviously gonna be between

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.360 
here okay is obviously gonna be between
these<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:49.800> gonna<00:00:49.890> be<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> hundred

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
these so it's gonna be like a hundred

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.639 
these so it's gonna be like a hundred
and<00:00:50.670> thirty<00:00:52.460> Hertz<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:54.149> here<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.260> I've<00:00:55.410> turned

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and thirty Hertz up here so I've turned

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
and thirty Hertz up here so I've turned
it<00:00:55.860> down<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.430> where<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.780> probably

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it down to where I think it's probably

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.029 
it down to where I think it's probably
around<00:00:58.230> 90<00:00:58.680> Hertz

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
around 90 Hertz

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.029 
around 90 Hertz
okay<00:01:00.059> that's<00:01:00.690> where<00:01:00.899> anything<00:01:01.440> below<00:01:01.710> 90

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
okay that's where anything below 90

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.860 
okay that's where anything below 90
hurts<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.430> subs<00:01:02.670> don't<00:01:02.910> even<00:01:03.090> pick<00:01:03.180> up<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
hurts my subs don't even pick up now the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.780 
hurts my subs don't even pick up now the
subsonic<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.739> other<00:01:04.890> hand<00:01:05.100> is<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> added

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
subsonic on the other hand is that added

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
subsonic on the other hand is that added
one<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.000> most<00:01:06.330> amps<00:01:06.780> well<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> lot<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.650> amps

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
one at most amps well a lot of amps

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.310 
one at most amps well a lot of amps
won't<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> thing<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.780> if<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> go

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
won't have and so the thing is if you go

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.620 
won't have and so the thing is if you go
I<00:01:10.350> want<00:01:10.740> everything<00:01:10.920> below<00:01:11.250> 90<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:12.450> means

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
I want everything below 90 that means

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.390 
I want everything below 90 that means
the<00:01:12.720> amp<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.049> play<00:01:13.229> five<00:01:13.590> Hertz<00:01:13.830> 10<00:01:14.189> Hertz

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
the amp will play five Hertz 10 Hertz

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.020 
the amp will play five Hertz 10 Hertz
and<00:01:14.700> stuff<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.720> which<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:17.430> can't<00:01:17.670> hear

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and stuff like that which you can't hear

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.850 
and stuff like that which you can't hear
and<00:01:18.210> he's<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:18.960> gonna<00:01:19.140> damage<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.650> subs

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and he's just gonna damage your subs

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.190 
and he's just gonna damage your subs
from<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.460> know<00:01:20.580> probably<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.080> can

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
from you you know probably so what I can

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.320 
from you you know probably so what I can
do<00:01:22.439> here<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.890> cut<00:01:23.280> off<00:01:23.430> those<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:24.090> really

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
do here is cut off those really really

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.990 
do here is cut off those really really
low<00:01:24.540> ones<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.380> I've<00:01:25.500> set<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:26.000> probably

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
low ones so I've set this probably

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.539 
low ones so I've set this probably
around<00:01:27.210> 1820<00:01:28.049> Hertz<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.950> anything<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
around 1820 Hertz so anything that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.090 
around 1820 Hertz so anything that
really<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.240> low<00:01:30.600> he<00:01:31.380> just<00:01:31.680> doesn't<00:01:32.070> even

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
really really low he just doesn't even

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
really really low he just doesn't even
play<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:33.240> over<00:01:33.450> here<00:01:33.540> again<00:01:34.110> these<00:01:34.320> two

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
play them then over here again these two

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
play them then over here again these two
things<00:01:34.829> most<00:01:35.460> amps<00:01:35.790> might<00:01:35.939> have<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.720> can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
things most amps might have now I can

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
things most amps might have now I can
choose<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> frequency<00:01:37.530> where<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.460> wanted<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
choose a frequency where I wanted to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.719 
choose a frequency where I wanted to
kind<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.150> boost<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.869> slightly<00:01:40.280> so<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.549> I've

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
kind of boost just slightly so all I've

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.700 
kind of boost just slightly so all I've
chose<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.810> 35<00:01:43.320> Hertz

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
chose is about it's about 35 Hertz

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.010 
chose is about it's about 35 Hertz
okay<00:01:44.490> 30<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.909> 30<00:01:45.119> kicked<00:01:45.390> or<00:01:45.540> something<00:01:45.930> like

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
okay 30 so 30 kicked or something like

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.590 
okay 30 so 30 kicked or something like
that<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.470> I've<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.579> boosted<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.479> by

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that and I've you know boosted it by

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.340 
that and I've you know boosted it by
maybe<00:01:49.369> 1/2<00:01:50.369> decibels<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:51.659> right<00:01:51.840> I<00:01:51.990> mean

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
maybe 1/2 decibels all right I mean

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.080 
maybe 1/2 decibels all right I mean
compared<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> rest<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:53.670> selling

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
compared to the rest of it now selling

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420 
compared to the rest of it now selling
this<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.270> will<00:01:54.570> create<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.560> boost<00:01:55.799> most

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
this thing will create the boost most

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.010 
this thing will create the boost most
things<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> bass<00:01:57.090> boost<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.899> will

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
things will have a bass boost that will

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.219 
things will have a bass boost that will
just<00:01:58.320> create<00:01:58.560> clipping<00:01:59.460> and<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.689> mean<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:01.110> know

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
just create clipping and I mean you know

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.800 
just create clipping and I mean you know
in<00:02:01.350> distortion<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> go<00:02:02.310> too<00:02:02.369> far<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.329> right

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
in distortion if you go too far so right

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.359 
in distortion if you go too far so right
there<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.200> probably<00:02:04.320> fine<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.070> only<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
there it's probably fine it's only a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
there it's probably fine it's only a
quarter<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:06.180> any<00:02:06.450> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.140> go<00:02:07.290> much<00:02:07.439> higher

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
quarter about any if you go much higher

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.279 
quarter about any if you go much higher
together<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.520> cause<00:02:09.000> problems<00:02:09.450> and

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
together probably cause problems and

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
together probably cause problems and
then<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.129> another<00:02:11.370> thing<00:02:11.580> motor<00:02:11.819> might

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
then this is another thing motor might

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.490 
then this is another thing motor might
have<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> bandwidth<00:02:12.780> there's

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
have a bandwidth there's

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.410 
have a bandwidth there's
means<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.800> can<00:02:13.830> choose<00:02:14.160> how<00:02:14.430> wide<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.790> want<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.300> to

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
means I can choose how wide I want it to

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.050 
means I can choose how wide I want it to
be<00:02:15.710> from<00:02:16.710> this<00:02:16.860> frequency<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.550> it'll<00:02:17.760> kind<00:02:17.970> of

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
be from this frequency so it'll kind of

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.030 
be from this frequency so it'll kind of
what<00:02:18.780> it'll<00:02:18.930> look<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.080> on<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.380> charter<00:02:19.830> didn't

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
what it'll look like on a charter didn't

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.160 
what it'll look like on a charter didn't
peak<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.030> come<00:02:21.480> down<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.020> you're

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
peak and then it come down so you're

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.530 
peak and then it come down so you're
like<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.440> these<00:02:22.620> are<00:02:22.800> 2<00:02:22.950> DB<00:02:23.250> bit<00:02:23.460> boost<00:02:23.790> and

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
like how these are 2 DB bit boost and

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.330 
like how these are 2 DB bit boost and
then<00:02:24.690> it<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.930> know<00:02:25.050> comes<00:02:25.440> down<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.770> inside

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
then it you know comes down the inside

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
then it you know comes down the inside
so<00:02:26.790> I've<00:02:26.970> went<00:02:27.210> about<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> quarter<00:02:28.410> mean<00:02:28.620> just

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
so I've went about a quarter mean just

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.770 
so I've went about a quarter mean just
over<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.850> far<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.180> phase<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.390> guys<00:02:30.630> I

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
over as far as the phase you guys I

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.360 
over as far as the phase you guys I
never<00:02:30.990> used<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.350> phase<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.860> be<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.070> this<00:02:32.160> side

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
never used the phase to be on this side

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.280 
never used the phase to be on this side
was<00:02:32.520> leaving<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.820> 0<00:02:33.090> I<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.690> played<00:02:33.959> with<00:02:33.990> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
was leaving on 0 I have played with it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.110 
was leaving on 0 I have played with it
and<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.890> always<00:02:35.040> find<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.459> sounds<00:02:35.700> better

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
and I always find it sounds better

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.780 
and I always find it sounds better
it<00:02:36.360> sounds<00:02:36.780> bloody<00:02:37.470> all<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> same<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.550> I<00:02:38.580> just

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
it sounds bloody all the same so I just

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.760 
it sounds bloody all the same so I just
leave<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.060> 0<00:02:39.360> then<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.470> level

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
leave it on 0 then we have the level

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.840 
leave it on 0 then we have the level
which<00:02:41.550> is<00:02:41.730> again<00:02:42.260> now<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.470> gain<00:02:43.709> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.430> set

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
which is again now you gain you can set

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.790 
which is again now you gain you can set
to<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.180> pre<00:02:45.420> fault<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.930> head<00:02:46.080> unit<00:02:46.230> which

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
to the pre fault of the head unit which

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.410 
to the pre fault of the head unit which
is<00:02:46.950> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.400> I've<00:02:47.550> done<00:02:47.580> here<00:02:47.970> mine's<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
is kind of what I've done here mine's a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.990 
is kind of what I've done here mine's a
4.5<00:02:49.020> bolt<00:02:49.320> head<00:02:49.530> unit<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.310> I've<00:02:50.520> set<00:02:50.760> it<00:02:50.790> around

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
4.5 bolt head unit so I've set it around

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.840 
4.5 bolt head unit so I've set it around
for<00:02:51.480> 4.5<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.590> dead<00:02:52.830> middle<00:02:53.160> okay<00:02:53.700> it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
for 4.5 which is dead middle okay it's

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.600 
for 4.5 which is dead middle okay it's
just<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.209> little<00:02:54.239> over<00:02:55.100> or<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.190> can<00:02:56.310> set<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.580> to

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
just a little over or you can set it to

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.070 
just a little over or you can set it to
either<00:02:56.820> way<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.330> also<00:02:57.540> sounded<00:02:57.959> pretty

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
either way and it also sounded pretty

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.510 
either way and it also sounded pretty
good<00:02:58.200> so<00:02:58.620> that's<00:02:58.739> why<00:02:58.920> I've<00:02:59.040> said<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
good so that's why I've said it to you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.490 
good so that's why I've said it to you
because<00:02:59.640> to<00:03:00.420> me<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:00.930> where<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.170> sounded

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
because to me this is where it sounded

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.460 
because to me this is where it sounded
about<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.770> best<00:03:02.360> and<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.840> also<00:03:04.020> kind<00:03:04.320> of

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
about the best and this is also kind of

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.320 
about the best and this is also kind of
kind<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.070> matches<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.610> with<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.910> head<00:03:06.060> units

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
kind of matches it with the head units

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.650 
kind of matches it with the head units
préval<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:07.260> guys<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.830> 4-channel<00:03:08.370> amp<00:03:08.660> now

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
préval now guys are a 4-channel amp now

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.949 
préval now guys are a 4-channel amp now
over<00:03:09.989> here<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.680> have<00:03:10.890> a<00:03:11.130> low-pass<00:03:11.730> filter

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
over here we have a low-pass filter

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.229 
over here we have a low-pass filter
again<00:03:12.959> which<00:03:13.320> means<00:03:13.670> if<00:03:14.670> you<00:03:14.790> set<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.060> on<00:03:15.209> that

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
again which means if you set it on that

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.970 
again which means if you set it on that
because<00:03:15.930> there's<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.170> fortune<00:03:16.320> or<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.739> set<00:03:16.860> on

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
because there's a fortune or you set on

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.530 
because there's a fortune or you set on
low<00:03:17.130> pass<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.519> only<00:03:17.730> going<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> play<00:03:18.269> like

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
low pass is only going to play like

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.570 
low pass is only going to play like
really<00:03:19.140> low<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.500> know<00:03:19.620> sub<00:03:19.890> frequencies<00:03:20.459> and

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
really low you know sub frequencies and

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.850 
really low you know sub frequencies and
stuff<00:03:20.790> wall<00:03:21.750> pass<00:03:21.989> means<00:03:22.350> it's<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.769> play

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
stuff wall pass means it's going to play

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.310 
stuff wall pass means it's going to play
everything<00:03:23.610> okay<00:03:24.390> that's<00:03:24.630> what<00:03:24.750> all<00:03:24.900> passes

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.930 
for this is going to play everything and
then<00:03:28.410> we've<00:03:28.560> got<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.739> high-pass<00:03:29.130> which<00:03:29.640> means

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
then we've got a high-pass which means

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.150 
then we've got a high-pass which means
it<00:03:30.239> does<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.630> opposite<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.049> over<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.739> and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
it does the opposite of over here and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.320 
it does the opposite of over here and
instead<00:03:32.430> of<00:03:32.580> cutting<00:03:32.850> off<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.150> high

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
instead of cutting off the high

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.479 
instead of cutting off the high
frequencies<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.590> thing<00:03:34.830> cuts<00:03:35.040> off<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.310> lows

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
frequencies this thing cuts off the lows

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.640 
frequencies this thing cuts off the lows
now<00:03:36.680> on<00:03:37.680> this<00:03:37.860> amp<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.459> can<00:03:38.489> set<00:03:38.910> that<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.650> 50

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
now on this amp you can set that to 50

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.949 
now on this amp you can set that to 50
at<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.010> lowest<00:03:41.519> now<00:03:42.299> I've<00:03:42.420> got<00:03:42.630> it<00:03:42.660> set<00:03:42.930> to

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
at the lowest now I've got it set to

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.340 
at the lowest now I've got it set to
around<00:03:43.230> 60<00:03:43.769> 65<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:45.030> I'd<00:03:45.180> my<00:03:45.510> speakers<00:03:46.019> the

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
around 60 65 so I'd my speakers the

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.710 
around 60 65 so I'd my speakers the
mid-range<00:03:46.680> don't<00:03:47.130> play<00:03:47.370> 65<00:03:48.060> Hertz<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.510> lower

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
mid-range don't play 65 Hertz or lower

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.310 
mid-range don't play 65 Hertz or lower
okay<00:03:49.440> well<00:03:49.799> they<00:03:49.920> play<00:03:50.070> 65<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.820> above<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.840> you

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
okay well they play 65 and above and you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.580 
okay well they play 65 and above and you
can<00:03:52.440> set<00:03:52.620> that<00:03:52.709> all<00:03:52.860> way<00:03:52.980> up<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.370> 500<00:03:53.549> and<00:03:54.590> well

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
can set that all way up to 500 and well

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.270 
can set that all way up to 500 and well
that's<00:03:55.769> what<00:03:55.860> that<00:03:55.980> is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that's what that is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.390 
that's what that is
and<00:03:56.430> that's<00:03:57.360> why<00:03:57.540> I've<00:03:57.660> got<00:03:57.780> on<00:03:57.900> high<00:03:58.079> pass

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
and that's why I've got on high pass

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.620 
and that's why I've got on high pass
then<00:03:59.400> we've<00:03:59.519> got<00:03:59.640> your<00:03:59.760> punchy<00:04:00.120> 2<00:04:00.299> which<00:04:00.510> is

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
then we've got your punchy 2 which is

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.150 
then we've got your punchy 2 which is
pretty<00:04:00.780> much<00:04:00.870> a<00:04:00.989> bass<00:04:01.230> boost<00:04:01.440> again<00:04:01.739> as<00:04:02.070> you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
pretty much a bass boost again as you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.560 
pretty much a bass boost again as you
can<00:04:02.280> seen<00:04:02.459> there<00:04:02.730> I've<00:04:02.910> set<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.299> about<00:04:03.360> a

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
can seen there I've set it to about a

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.850 
can seen there I've set it to about a
quarter<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:05.930> then<00:04:06.930> we've<00:04:07.079> got<00:04:07.230> your<00:04:07.380> gain<00:04:07.560> and

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
quarter and then we've got your gain and

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:08.990 
quarter and then we've got your gain and
this<00:04:07.920> one's<00:04:08.130> different<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.610> doesn't<00:04:08.850> have<00:04:08.970> a

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
this one's different it doesn't have a

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.090 
this one's different it doesn't have a
voltage<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.690> just<00:04:09.840> has<00:04:09.959> numbers<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.799> this<00:04:10.920> one

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
voltage and just has numbers so this one

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.850 
voltage and just has numbers so this one
you're<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.489> going<00:04:11.610> to<00:04:11.730> do<00:04:11.820> by<00:04:12.000> ear<00:04:12.269> and<00:04:12.870> by

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
you're really going to do by ear and by

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.969 
you're really going to do by ear and by
ear<00:04:14.480> I've<00:04:15.480> said<00:04:15.810> it<00:04:15.959> I<00:04:16.079> think<00:04:16.290> it's<00:04:16.440> about<00:04:16.680> to

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
ear I've said it I think it's about to

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.370 
ear I've said it I think it's about to
about<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> third<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.810> way<00:04:18.959> up<00:04:19.140> it's

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
about a third and the way up it's

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.830 
about a third and the way up it's
pointing<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:19.890> 5<00:04:20.130> okay<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.690> probably

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
pointing to the 5 okay so I was probably

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.330 
pointing to the 5 okay so I was probably
a<00:04:21.959> little<00:04:22.109> more<00:04:22.349> on<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.560> 3rd<00:04:22.770> but<00:04:23.190> it's

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
a little more on the 3rd but it's

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.890 
a little more on the 3rd but it's
definitely<00:04:23.669> not<00:04:23.910> at<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.479> 12<00:04:24.750> o'clock

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
definitely not at the 12 o'clock

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.120 
definitely not at the 12 o'clock
position<00:04:25.340> because

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
position because

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.950 
position because
at<00:04:27.340> the<00:04:27.490> 12<00:04:27.730> o'clock<00:04:27.910> position<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.570> gets<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.810> lot

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
at the 12 o'clock position it gets a lot

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960 
at the 12 o'clock position it gets a lot
louder<00:04:29.260> which<00:04:30.010> this<00:04:30.130> means<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.550> that's<00:04:30.820> why

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
louder which this means that that's why

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.730 
louder which this means that that's why
it's<00:04:31.090> putting<00:04:31.270> out<00:04:31.390> its<00:04:31.510> power<00:04:31.750> but<00:04:32.470> my

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
it's putting out its power but my

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.870 
it's putting out its power but my
speakers<00:04:33.100> might<00:04:33.220> be<00:04:33.310> able<00:04:33.460> to<00:04:33.520> handle<00:04:33.760> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
speakers might be able to handle the

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.430 
speakers might be able to handle the
amount<00:04:33.910> of<00:04:34.120> how<00:04:34.300> that<00:04:34.540> ant<00:04:34.720> puts<00:04:34.930> out<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.350> the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
amount of how that ant puts out and the

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.600 
amount of how that ant puts out and the
exact<00:04:35.740> same<00:04:35.920> thing<00:04:35.980> on<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.370> other<00:04:36.400> side

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
exact same thing on the other side

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.490 
exact same thing on the other side
because<00:04:37.000> it's<00:04:37.150> a<00:04:37.180> four<00:04:37.360> channel<00:04:37.570> and<00:04:38.380> you<00:04:38.470> can

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
because it's a four channel and you can

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.260 
because it's a four channel and you can
see<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.860> have<00:04:39.010> two<00:04:39.160> games<00:04:39.400> you<00:04:39.640> have<00:04:39.820> two<00:04:40.000> of

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
see I have two games you have two of

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.850 
see I have two games you have two of
everything<00:04:40.480> I've<00:04:40.750> set<00:04:41.020> them<00:04:41.080> all<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.380> same<00:04:41.530> as

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
everything I've set them all the same as

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.820 
everything I've set them all the same as
close<00:04:42.100> as<00:04:42.250> I<00:04:42.340> can<00:04:42.400> get<00:04:42.640> and<00:04:43.260> also<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.410> have<00:04:44.680> it<00:04:44.770> on

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
close as I can get and also I have it on

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
it when it gets to a point where it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.090 
it when it gets to a point where it
sounds<00:05:10.360> different<00:05:10.810> all<00:05:11.110> of<00:05:11.170> a<00:05:11.260> sudden<00:05:11.560> just

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
sounds different all of a sudden just

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.470 
sounds different all of a sudden just
back<00:05:12.280> it<00:05:12.460> off<00:05:12.520> a<00:05:12.580> little<00:05:12.760> and<00:05:13.000> keep<00:05:13.180> it<00:05:13.330> about

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
back it off a little and keep it about

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.420 
back it off a little and keep it about
there<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:14.080> that's<00:05:14.680> that's<00:05:14.950> for<00:05:15.160> you<00:05:15.280> gain<00:05:15.900> and

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
there and that's that's for you gain and

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.680 
there and that's that's for you gain and
for<00:05:18.430> your<00:05:18.550> low-pass<00:05:18.820> that's<00:05:19.210> easy

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 
for your low-pass that's easy

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.300 
for your low-pass that's easy
just<00:05:20.110> choose<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.350> frequency<00:05:20.560> think<00:05:21.010> yourself

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
just choose a frequency think yourself

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.370 
just choose a frequency think yourself
what<00:05:21.760> don't<00:05:21.940> you<00:05:22.000> like<00:05:22.240> as<00:05:22.630> I<00:05:22.690> said<00:05:22.990> for<00:05:23.200> mine

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
what don't you like as I said for mine

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.160 
what don't you like as I said for mine
I've<00:05:23.920> said<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.310> about<00:05:24.520> 65<00:05:25.180> Hertz<00:05:25.480> so<00:05:26.080> the

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:26.170 
I've said it about 65 Hertz so the

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:28.230 
I've said it about 65 Hertz so the
speakers<00:05:26.470> don't<00:05:26.620> go<00:05:26.830> below<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.460> and<00:05:27.640> for

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
speakers don't go below that and for

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.160 
speakers don't go below that and for
here<00:05:28.480> I<00:05:28.720> set<00:05:29.230> it<00:05:29.350> around<00:05:29.530> 80<00:05:30.370> 90<00:05:31.060> okay<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:31.930> there

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.170 
here I set it around 80 90 okay so there

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.570 
here I set it around 80 90 okay so there
is<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.320> bit<00:05:32.530> where<00:05:32.710> they<00:05:32.830> do<00:05:32.890> cross<00:05:33.250> over<00:05:33.460> each

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
is a bit where they do cross over each

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.310 
is a bit where they do cross over each
other<00:05:33.910> I<00:05:34.120> think<00:05:34.690> that<00:05:34.780> clears<00:05:35.050> about

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
other I think that clears about

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.620 
other I think that clears about
everything<00:05:35.680> up<00:05:35.800> on<00:05:36.490> how<00:05:36.670> to<00:05:36.730> do<00:05:36.940> it<00:05:37.090> it's<00:05:37.540> not

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
everything up on how to do it it's not

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.920 
everything up on how to do it it's not
that<00:05:37.810> hard<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.910> know<00:05:40.450> it's<00:05:40.630> read<00:05:40.780> your

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
that hard you know it's read your

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.750 
that hard you know it's read your
manuals<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:41.440> as<00:05:41.590> these<00:05:42.040> different<00:05:42.520> manuals

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
manuals but as these different manuals

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.370 
manuals but as these different manuals
have<00:05:42.910> different<00:05:43.240> things<00:05:43.360> that<00:05:43.630> manual<00:05:44.230> says

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
have different things that manual says

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.860 
have different things that manual says
do<00:05:44.590> bayi<00:05:44.770> that<00:05:45.430> manual<00:05:45.760> says<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:46.090> match<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:46.840> to

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
do bayi that manual says to match it to

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.370 
do bayi that manual says to match it to
your<00:05:46.990> area<00:05:47.290> or<00:05:47.500> whatever<00:05:47.680> so
