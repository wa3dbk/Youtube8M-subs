piranha tank which is fully planted as

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.970 
piranha tank which is fully planted as
you<00:00:12.509> can<00:00:12.660> see<00:00:13.370> I<00:00:14.370> have<00:00:15.240> four<00:00:15.299> red-bellied

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
you can see I have four red-bellied

you can see I have four red-bellied
piranhas<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.369> planted<00:00:18.029> tank<00:00:18.289> with<00:00:19.289> dirt

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
piranhas in my planted tank with dirt

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.470 
piranhas in my planted tank with dirt
underneath<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.850> aquatic<00:00:21.750> soil<00:00:22.939> and<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.300> just

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
underneath the aquatic soil and I just

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.200 
underneath the aquatic soil and I just
wanted<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.720> share<00:00:24.930> some<00:00:25.350> thoughts<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:26.210> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
wanted to share some thoughts on the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.730 
wanted to share some thoughts on the
pros<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.599> cons<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:28.050> having<00:00:28.230> red-bellied

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
pros and cons of having red-bellied

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.820 
pros and cons of having red-bellied
piranhas<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.429> fully<00:00:30.330> planted<00:00:30.599> tank<00:00:30.960> as<00:00:31.560> mine

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
piranhas in a fully planted tank as mine

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.160 
piranhas in a fully planted tank as mine
I<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:33.030> four<00:00:33.180> red<00:00:33.329> bellies<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:33.989> see

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
I have four red bellies as you can see

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.799 
I have four red bellies as you can see
and<00:00:34.820> the<00:00:35.820> aquarium<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.420> about<00:00:37.280> 100<00:00:38.280> gallon

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
and the aquarium is about 100 gallon

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.500 
and the aquarium is about 100 gallon
although<00:00:40.100> we<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.489> slightly<00:00:42.090> different

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
although we do have a slightly different

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.810 
although we do have a slightly different
measurement<00:00:42.980> in<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.100> part<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> world

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
measurement in this part of the world

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.430 
measurement in this part of the world
anyway<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.840> it's<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.410> size<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:48.440> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
anyway so it's about that size and the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.090 
anyway so it's about that size and the
plants<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.719> low-maintenance<00:00:51.719> plants<00:00:52.440> which

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
plants are low-maintenance plants which

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.760 
plants are low-maintenance plants which
require<00:00:53.570> really<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.840> much<00:00:54.960> light<00:00:55.230> because

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
require really not much light because

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.430 
require really not much light because
the<00:00:56.430> red-bellied<00:00:56.760> piranhas<00:00:57.180> do<00:00:57.870> get<00:00:58.109> stressed

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the red-bellied piranhas do get stressed

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.470 
the red-bellied piranhas do get stressed
from<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.710> bright<00:00:58.949> tank<00:00:59.190> light<00:00:59.460> so<00:01:00.300> I've

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
from a bright tank light so I've

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.140 
from a bright tank light so I've
basically<00:01:00.829> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.039> see<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.609> lamp<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
basically as you can see that the lamp I

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.780 

have<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.890> full<00:01:08.070> amount<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> sunlight

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
have the the full amount of sunlight

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.859 
have the the full amount of sunlight
intensity<00:01:10.430> which<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.549> turn<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.150> 10

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
intensity which I turn on for about 10

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.230 
intensity which I turn on for about 10
hours<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> day<00:01:13.200> on<00:01:13.619> average<00:01:14.600> so<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:16.409> plants<00:01:16.770> are

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
hours a day on average so the plants are

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.950 
hours a day on average so the plants are
low<00:01:18.240> maintenance<00:01:18.450> low<00:01:19.229> light<00:01:19.530> plants<00:01:20.960> and

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
low maintenance low light plants and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
low maintenance low light plants and
with<00:01:22.500> no<00:01:22.619> co2<00:01:24.860> now<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.920> pros<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.490> cons<00:01:26.700> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
with no co2 now the pros and cons is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.789 
with no co2 now the pros and cons is
that<00:01:26.850> obviously<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> pros<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.080> just

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that obviously the pros is that just

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.289 
that obviously the pros is that just
like<00:01:28.920> any<00:01:29.070> other<00:01:29.220> planted<00:01:29.670> tank<00:01:29.850> of<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
like any other planted tank of it and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
like any other planted tank of it and
with<00:01:30.390> any<00:01:30.600> other<00:01:30.689> fish<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.710> plants<00:01:32.070> act<00:01:32.220> as<00:01:32.400> a

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
with any other fish the plants act as a

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.850 
with any other fish the plants act as a
natural<00:01:33.119> filtration<00:01:33.479> so<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.560> keep<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
natural filtration so they keep the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.219 
natural filtration so they keep the
water<00:01:35.040> clean<00:01:35.189> they<00:01:35.549> absorb<00:01:36.180> fish<00:01:37.020> waste

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
water clean they absorb fish waste

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.609 
water clean they absorb fish waste
excess<00:01:38.100> nutrients<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.689> on<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.500> keeps

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
excess nutrients and so on so it keeps

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.590 
excess nutrients and so on so it keeps
the<00:01:40.740> water<00:01:40.920> clean<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:42.030> course<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.329> looks

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
the water clean and of course it looks

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.810 
the water clean and of course it looks
much<00:01:42.780> more<00:01:42.930> natural<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.680> plants<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
much more natural to have plants in the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.609 
much more natural to have plants in the
tank<00:01:45.060> than<00:01:45.299> having<00:01:45.570> no<00:01:46.140> plans<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.590> just

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
tank than having no plans and just

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.770 
tank than having no plans and just
having<00:01:46.920> fish<00:01:47.100> swimming<00:01:47.909> around<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
having fish swimming around it's you

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.719

I do enjoy having a planted tank with

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.639 
I do enjoy having a planted tank with

gets cloudy and brown you again and you
have<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.940> replant<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.959> you're<00:03:18.140> basically

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
have to replant it and you're basically

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.460 
have to replant it and you're basically
starting<00:03:18.620> from<00:03:18.980> from<00:03:19.430> zero<00:03:19.989> and<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.140> can<00:03:21.350> be

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
starting from from zero and that can be

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.710 
starting from from zero and that can be
very<00:03:21.500> frustrating<00:03:23.350> so<00:03:25.150> unless<00:03:26.150> you<00:03:26.420> are<00:03:26.450> ready

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
very frustrating so unless you are ready

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.080 
very frustrating so unless you are ready
to<00:03:27.220> put<00:03:28.220> in<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.400> effort<00:03:28.489> print<00:03:28.940> the<00:03:29.060> work<00:03:29.269> of

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
to put in the effort print the work of

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.640 
to put in the effort print the work of
just<00:03:32.090> accepting<00:03:32.600> some<00:03:32.780> frustrations<00:03:33.380> at

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
just accepting some frustrations at

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.840 
just accepting some frustrations at
times<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.989> unwilling<00:03:35.989> to<00:03:36.049> replant<00:03:36.670> as<00:03:37.670> you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
times and unwilling to replant as you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.740 
times and unwilling to replant as you
see<00:03:38.120> fit<00:03:39.940> then<00:03:40.940> it's<00:03:41.299> fine

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
see fit then it's fine

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.789

and I do enjoy having planted tank with
red<00:03:45.950> bellies<00:03:46.310> but<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:48.560> you<00:03:48.709> are<00:03:48.799> really<00:03:49.160> into

aquatic plants and and so on then then I

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.370 
aquatic plants and and so on then then I

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
do not recommend bad bellies because

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.300 
do not recommend bad bellies because
they<00:03:57.889> will<00:03:58.540> sometimes<00:03:59.650> mess<00:04:00.650> it<00:04:00.829> up<00:04:00.920> as<00:04:01.160> they
