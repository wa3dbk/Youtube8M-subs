them<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.650> time<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.090> soccer<00:01:23.300> ruse<00:01:23.680> I<00:01:24.680> kind<00:01:25.640> of

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
them this time the soccer ruse I kind of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.160 
them this time the soccer ruse I kind of
like<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.030> soccer<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.390> Bruges<00:01:26.660> and<00:01:26.690> have<00:01:26.930> a<00:01:26.960> big

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
like the soccer in Bruges and have a big

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.170 
like the soccer in Bruges and have a big
soft<00:01:27.410> spot<00:01:27.680> for<00:01:27.920> him<00:01:28.070> but<00:01:28.220> Serbia<00:01:28.820> was<00:01:28.940> pretty

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
soft spot for him but Serbia was pretty

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.820 
soft spot for him but Serbia was pretty
impressive<00:01:29.510> in<00:01:29.720> qualification<00:01:30.440> so<00:01:30.650> I<00:01:30.680> think

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830

Group F so easy for Italy right now I

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.990 
Group F so easy for Italy right now I
have<00:02:07.620> to<00:02:07.770> say<00:02:07.920> their<00:02:08.100> odds<00:02:08.280> are<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.640> down<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
have to say their odds are going down in

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.110 
have to say their odds are going down in
Vegas<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> winning<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.750> all<00:02:09.869> because<00:02:10.289> of<00:02:10.320> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
Vegas of winning it all because of the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880 
Vegas of winning it all because of the
such<00:02:12.120> an<00:02:12.270> easy<00:02:12.420> group<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.200> sheep<00:02:13.410> shaggers

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
such an easy group the sheep shaggers

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
such an easy group the sheep shaggers
may<00:02:14.190> be<00:02:14.250> one<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.610> worst<00:02:14.790> team<00:02:15.180> new<00:02:15.360> zealand

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
may be one of the worst team new zealand

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.000 
may be one of the worst team new zealand
of<00:02:15.780> course<00:02:15.990> might<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.650> one<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> worst

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
of course might be one of the worst

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.880 
of course might be one of the worst
teams<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.050> I<00:02:19.050> guess<00:02:19.530> I'm<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.740> with

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
teams in there and I guess I'm go with

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
teams in there and I guess I'm go with
slovakia<00:02:20.490> over<00:02:21.030> pairs<00:02:21.330> why<00:02:21.540> but<00:02:21.840> that's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
slovakia over pairs why but that's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.820 
slovakia over pairs why but that's
pretty<00:02:22.110> much<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.350> coin<00:02:22.590> flip

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.390 

root<00:02:25.580> G<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.780> group<00:02:27.080> of<00:02:27.260> death<00:02:27.350> how<00:02:28.160> can<00:02:28.370> you

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
have a group of death when you have the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.600 
have a group of death when you have the
missile<00:02:30.110> launchers<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.530> there<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.980> mean<00:02:31.250> North

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
yeah they're probably even worse than

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.680

Group<00:03:01.350> H<00:03:01.560> sets<00:03:02.160> up<00:03:02.280> very<00:03:02.490> nicely<00:03:02.730> for<00:03:03.030> Spain

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
Group H sets up very nicely for Spain

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.240 
Group H sets up very nicely for Spain
not<00:03:03.510> as<00:03:03.630> quite<00:03:03.840> as<00:03:04.170> nice<00:03:04.380> as<00:03:04.590> Italy<00:03:04.890> but<00:03:05.010> Spain

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
not as quite as nice as Italy but Spain

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.500 
not as quite as nice as Italy but Spain
should<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.490> no<00:03:05.700> problem<00:03:06.060> getting<00:03:06.150> out<00:03:06.390> of

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
should have no problem getting out of

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.780 
should have no problem getting out of
this<00:03:06.570> group<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.080> I<00:03:07.620> think<00:03:07.680> chili<00:03:08.400> did<00:03:08.610> really

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
this group and I think chili did really

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.460 
this group and I think chili did really
well<00:03:08.880> in<00:03:09.030> South<00:03:09.240> American<00:03:09.720> qualifying<00:03:10.230> so

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
well in South American qualifying so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.080 
well in South American qualifying so
right<00:03:10.620> now<00:03:10.650> I<00:03:10.800> say<00:03:11.040> chili<00:03:11.310> he's<00:03:11.520> probably<00:03:11.790> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
right now I say chili he's probably the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.970 
right now I say chili he's probably the
one<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.360> will<00:03:12.450> make<00:03:12.570> it<00:03:12.690> out<00:03:12.810> all<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.140> Swiss

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
one that will make it out all the Swiss

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.980 
one that will make it out all the Swiss
aren't<00:03:14.280> that<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.640> hopefully<00:03:15.180> under<00:03:15.630> estimate

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
aren't that and hopefully under estimate

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.280 
aren't that and hopefully under estimate
it's<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.200> point<00:03:16.440> or<00:03:16.500> two<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.770> CONCACAF<00:03:17.280> but

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
it's a point or two for CONCACAF but

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.940 
it's a point or two for CONCACAF but
that's<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.640> okay<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:21.020> summer<00:03:22.020> is<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.710> far

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
that's it okay to summer is not that far

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.710 
that's it okay to summer is not that far
off<00:03:22.980> what<00:03:23.520> do<00:03:23.580> you<00:03:23.640> think<00:03:23.880> about<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.120> draw<00:03:24.330> who
