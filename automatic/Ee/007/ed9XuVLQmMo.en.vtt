00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.679 
still have that voiceover saved like on
my<00:00:27.900> computer<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.980> without<00:00:29.369> well<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.420> have

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
my computer really without well I have

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.590 
my computer really without well I have
the<00:00:31.040> completed<00:00:32.040> video<00:00:32.460> file<00:00:32.790> but<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.090> didn't

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the completed video file but I didn't

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.139 
the completed video file but I didn't
save<00:00:33.870> like<00:00:34.110> each<00:00:34.860> individual<00:00:35.550> audio<00:00:35.850> track

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
save like each individual audio track

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.830 
save like each individual audio track
those<00:00:36.360> those<00:00:36.809> files<00:00:37.020> are<00:00:37.200> huge<00:00:37.410> yeah<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.840> think

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
those those files are huge yeah I think

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
those those files are huge yeah I think
it'd<00:00:39.989> be<00:00:40.020> pretty<00:00:40.230> funny<00:00:40.530> if<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.770> just<00:00:40.950> imported

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it'd be pretty funny if I just imported

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.229 
it'd be pretty funny if I just imported
that<00:00:41.840> and<00:00:42.840> inserted<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.739> here<00:00:44.160> yeah<00:00:44.640> instead

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that and inserted that here yeah instead

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.660 
that and inserted that here yeah instead
of<00:00:45.329> actually<00:00:45.660> doing<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.579> bit

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
of actually doing it that a little bit

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.670 
of actually doing it that a little bit
uh<00:00:47.899> best<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.350> something<00:00:50.960> yeah<00:00:51.960> that'd<00:00:52.649> be

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
uh best of or something yeah that'd be

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.790 
uh best of or something yeah that'd be
lazy<00:00:53.100> yeah<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.210> actually<00:00:54.420> no<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.020> reality<00:00:55.170> if
