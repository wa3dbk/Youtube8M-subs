is is what I would call a granny gear so
I'm<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.890> first<00:02:05.070> gear<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:06.500> when<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.530> take

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
I'm in first gear right now when I take

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.279 
I'm in first gear right now when I take
off<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.399> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> shift<00:02:08.910> fairly<00:02:09.660> soon<00:02:09.959> after

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
off I'm going to shift fairly soon after

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.960 
off I'm going to shift fairly soon after
I<00:02:10.649> take<00:02:11.610> off<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.690> that's<00:02:13.290> how<00:02:13.440> I<00:02:13.700> handle<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I take off and that's how I handle the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.150 
I take off and that's how I handle the
granny<00:02:15.209> gear<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.870> rest<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.319> shifting<00:02:17.010> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
granny gear the rest of the shifting is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.430 
granny gear the rest of the shifting is
is<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:18.060> can<00:02:18.090> go<00:02:18.420> ahead<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.600> show<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> camera

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
is you can go ahead and show the camera

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.390 
is you can go ahead and show the camera
down<00:02:19.590> here<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.250> see<00:02:20.459> when<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.700> shift<00:02:21.060> I

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.210 

probably<00:02:26.400> shifted

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
probably shifted

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:47.580 
probably shifted
like<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.760> you'll<00:02:29.000> see<00:02:29.060> in<00:02:29.270> a<00:02:29.360> second

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.620 

I<00:02:48.480> guess<00:02:49.480> replace<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.080> brakes<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.450> they're

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
I guess replace the brakes so they're

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.309 
I guess replace the brakes so they're
operating<00:02:53.230> well<00:02:54.750> see<00:02:55.750> if<00:02:55.840> I<00:02:55.930> can<00:02:56.020> get<00:02:56.170> this

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
operating well see if I can get this

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.430 
operating well see if I can get this
shift<00:02:57.130> time<00:02:57.459> well<00:03:00.150> yeah<00:03:01.150> there<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.510> is<00:03:01.599> you

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
shift time well yeah there it is you

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
shift time well yeah there it is you
just<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.890> do<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.069> just<00:03:03.400> take<00:03:04.300> off<00:03:04.540> and

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
just have to do it just take off and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.729 
just have to do it just take off and
swallowing

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.770 

really<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.549> can<00:03:09.700> take<00:03:09.879> off<00:03:10.060> in<00:03:10.269> second<00:03:10.659> gear

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
really you can take off in second gear

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.720 
really you can take off in second gear
and<00:03:10.959> a<00:03:10.989> lot<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.170> people<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:11.859> just<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.519> deal

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
and a lot of people do that just to deal

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.089 
and a lot of people do that just to deal
with<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.180> since<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:13.659> not<00:03:13.810> sacred<00:03:14.099> they

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
with that since it's not sacred they

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.789 
with that since it's not sacred they
also<00:03:15.280> have<00:03:15.640> a<00:03:15.670> double<00:03:16.269> clutching<00:03:16.870> that<00:03:16.900> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
also have a double clutching that that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:24.380 
also have a double clutching that that
they<00:03:18.310> show<00:03:18.579> also

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.040 

we'll<00:03:24.900> get<00:03:25.020> going<00:03:25.080> on<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.620> little<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:25.950> of<00:03:26.100> half

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
we'll get going on a little bit of half

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.740 
we'll get going on a little bit of half
go<00:03:28.050> ahead<00:03:28.200> and<00:03:28.350> turn<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.530> off
