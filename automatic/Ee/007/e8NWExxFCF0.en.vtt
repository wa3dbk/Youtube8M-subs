they<00:01:14.790> had<00:01:15.030> word<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.390> they<00:01:15.720> were<00:01:15.780> looking

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
they had word that they were looking

over<00:01:16.890> those<00:01:17.070> dogs<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> were<00:01:17.820> aggressive

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
over those dogs that were aggressive

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.149 
over those dogs that were aggressive
because<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.290> felt<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.680> they<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.100> be

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
because they felt that they would not be

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.219 
because they felt that they would not be
able<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.759> successfully<00:01:21.180> put<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.840> in<00:01:21.990> homes

able to successfully put them in homes

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.649 
able to successfully put them in homes
so<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> met<00:01:23.700> them<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.240> found<00:01:24.420> out

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
so when I met them and they found out

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.020 
so when I met them and they found out
what<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:24.930> did<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.590> they<00:01:25.740> realized<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.790> they

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
what I did then they realized that they

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.910 
what I did then they realized that they
were<00:01:27.090> able<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:28.049> those<00:01:28.259> dogs<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:28.770> they

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
were able to take those dogs that they

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.190 
were able to take those dogs that they
were<00:01:28.979> skipping<00:01:29.310> over<00:01:29.579> before<00:01:30.150> descending<00:01:30.960> him

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.020 
were skipping over before descending him
to<00:01:31.380> rehabilitation<00:01:31.710> so<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.700> they<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.000> be

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030

to rehabilitation so that they can be
adopted<00:01:33.390> out<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.170> most<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> dogs<00:01:35.520> that

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
adopted out and most of the dogs that

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.910 
adopted out and most of the dogs that
they<00:01:35.880> had<00:01:36.150> were<00:01:36.420> aggressive<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.409> other<00:01:37.590> dogs

really not a new way of thinking it is a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.240 
really not a new way of thinking it is a
very<00:02:45.150> old<00:02:45.240> ancient<00:02:45.900> way<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.350> communicating

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
very old ancient way of communicating

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.930 
very old ancient way of communicating
with<00:02:47.580> dogs<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> way<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.459> nature

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
with dogs but it is a way that nature

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.850 
with dogs but it is a way that nature
has<00:02:51.180> intended<00:02:51.600> dogs<00:02:51.989> to<00:02:52.290> process<00:02:52.709> information

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
has intended dogs to process information

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.570 
has intended dogs to process information
and<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.330> once<00:02:54.600> they<00:02:54.780> saw<00:02:55.050> that<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.830> ability<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
and so once they saw that the ability to

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.970 
and so once they saw that the ability to
work<00:02:56.790> with<00:02:57.030> dogs<00:02:57.470> because<00:02:58.470> in<00:02:58.620> rehabilitation

we find out what it is a dog can do and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.979 
we find out what it is a dog can do and
then<00:03:02.250> we<00:03:02.370> find<00:03:02.670> out<00:03:02.820> why<00:03:03.030> he's<00:03:03.270> not<00:03:03.450> doing<00:03:03.840> it

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
then we find out why he's not doing it

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.260 
then we find out why he's not doing it
and<00:03:04.170> once<00:03:04.950> they<00:03:05.160> saw<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.489> difference<00:03:06.060> in<00:03:06.239> the

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
command the presence of such well I have

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.860 
command the presence of such well I have
found<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.510> long<00:03:31.410> time<00:03:31.920> ago<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.570> nature<00:03:33.570> has

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
found a long time ago that nature has

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.900 
found a long time ago that nature has
instructed<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.680> dog<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.160> process<00:03:35.700> information

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
instructed a dog to process information

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.380 
instructed a dog to process information
differently<00:03:37.070> than<00:03:38.070> the<00:03:38.280> way<00:03:38.310> humans<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.209> to

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
differently than the way humans like to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.870 
differently than the way humans like to
do<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.720> we<00:03:40.350> tend<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.709> think<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.610> simple

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
do it we tend to think that a simple

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.420 
do it we tend to think that a simple
training<00:03:42.330> which<00:03:42.870> is<00:03:43.080> sit<00:03:43.320> stay<00:03:43.620> calm<00:03:43.980> heel

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
training which is sit stay calm heel

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.229 
training which is sit stay calm heel
down<00:03:44.820> follow<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:46.489> training<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:47.730> a<00:03:47.760> dog<00:03:48.000> and

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
down follow is training for a dog and

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.360 
down follow is training for a dog and
that's<00:03:48.360> all<00:03:48.540> that<00:03:48.570> they<00:03:48.840> need<00:03:49.110> but<00:03:49.860> I<00:03:49.890> found

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
that's all that they need but I found

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.820 
that's all that they need but I found
that<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.970> teach<00:03:51.180> a<00:03:51.360> dog<00:03:51.600> to<00:03:51.660> do<00:03:52.230> something<00:03:52.709> that

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
that to teach a dog to do something that

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.580 
that to teach a dog to do something that
he<00:03:53.040> already<00:03:53.190> knows<00:03:53.670> how<00:03:53.940> to<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.360> is<00:03:54.660> wasting<00:03:55.500> a

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
he already knows how to do is wasting a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280 
he already knows how to do is wasting a
lot<00:03:55.739> of<00:03:55.799> valuable<00:03:56.459> time<00:03:56.489> as<00:03:57.060> opposed<00:03:57.900> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
lot of valuable time as opposed to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.090 
lot of valuable time as opposed to
working<00:03:58.830> with<00:03:59.040> them<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.549> way<00:03:59.700> nature<00:04:00.000> says

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
working with them the way nature says

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.160 
working with them the way nature says
nature<00:04:02.100> for<00:04:02.459> examples<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.420> were<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.959> word

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
nature for examples that were the word

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.280 
nature for examples that were the word
sit<00:04:04.560> or<00:04:04.799> down<00:04:05.450> nature<00:04:06.450> tells<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.780> doctor<00:04:07.140> down

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
sit or down nature tells a doctor down

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.199 
sit or down nature tells a doctor down
for<00:04:07.560> two<00:04:07.709> reasons<00:04:07.950> one<00:04:08.459> because<00:04:08.670> you're<00:04:09.000> tired

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
for two reasons one because you're tired

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.670 
for two reasons one because you're tired
and<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.750> others<00:04:10.019> because<00:04:10.200> you're<00:04:10.500> being

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
and the others because you're being

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.470 
and the others because you're being
dominated<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.489> generally<00:04:11.970> that's<00:04:12.180> on<00:04:12.360> the

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
dominated and generally that's on the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.410 
dominated and generally that's on the
back<00:04:12.690> but<00:04:13.620> when<00:04:13.769> we<00:04:13.950> say<00:04:14.190> down<00:04:14.519> is<00:04:14.850> not<00:04:15.180> for

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
back but when we say down is not for

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.960 
back but when we say down is not for
those<00:04:15.540> reasons<00:04:15.859> so<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:17.010> dog<00:04:17.220> does<00:04:17.430> not<00:04:17.459> feel

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
those reasons so the dog does not feel

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.930 
those reasons so the dog does not feel
that<00:04:18.299> he<00:04:18.390> needs<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.609> that's<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
that he needs to down and so that's the

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.460 
that he needs to down and so that's the
problem<00:04:21.209> that<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.630> have<00:04:21.840> there<00:04:22.140> been<00:04:22.169> many

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
problem that we have there been many

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.580 
problem that we have there been many
books<00:04:22.890> written<00:04:23.130> on<00:04:23.370> training<00:04:24.470> but<00:04:25.470> we're

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
books written on training but we're

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.000 
books written on training but we're
still<00:04:25.770> having<00:04:26.039> problems<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.550> dogs
