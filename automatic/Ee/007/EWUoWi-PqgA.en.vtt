00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.909
 hi all guys it's good you don't 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.910
 this new video in which I present you and 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:09.940
 mistletoe how to use the reds on mac 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.550
 in fact, this has come out a few days ago 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.650
 application also on the memory world 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.080
 before it could only be started 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.270
 on windows pc and for those who don't know 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.510
 this application allows you to put 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.510
 in trend of is more our device 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.670
 this allows you to do it also reds no 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.369
 so it tends to be on mac and you can 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.819
 already do this operation however air ed 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.690
 indeed has a particular property the 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:39.280
 takes more than redsnow many times is 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.409
 faulty and therefore does not work like 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.989
 it should while that of air and has 

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.940
 always worked perfectly because 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.309
 It can be useful to put in that is 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.870
 plus a device many will know it and 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.179
 many others not 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.999
 then it has to do with the downgrade like 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:56.920
 you know a downgrade serves as it says 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:59.019
 the name go back to firmware 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.319
 let's take an example if I on my ipod 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:04.750
 touch ohio they 6.1 point 3 and I want 

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:05.320
 go back to s6 point 1.2 to do the 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.680
 jailbreak 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.240
 I have to downgrade the downgrade 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.180
 I made a video that explains precisely 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.490
 how do you perform it look at it like that 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.490
 for those who have no idea what yes means 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.430
 which was a bit of ideas involves two phases 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.610
 the first is the creation of the firmware 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.310
 customizable and unfortunately this is possible 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.400
 do still only on windows and the second one 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.500
 phase is use to the reds to put the 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.480
 our device embodies of is more in 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.090
 how much if we put it in ten 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.610
 normal itunes would recognize the 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.760
 modified firmware and it would give an error 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.700
 while putting it in this dfu mode 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.409
 particular I repeat to call takes dfu 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.900
 itunes recognizes the firmware as 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.340
 original by apple and restores the 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.100
 our device 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.290
 now you will tell me but if it's not on mac 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.090
 still possible to create the firmware 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.250
 customized because it is created with a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.860
 program that is called to the faiths and is not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.040
 still available for mac that makes sense 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:09.159
 download to the reds on their machines 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.030
 I say it makes sense because we could 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:11.950
 very well 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.870
 send from our friend who has a 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.350
 computer windows and create the movie 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970
 customized save it on a stick 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.400
 take it home and copy it to the hard 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.069
 disk of our mac so if ours 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.810
 device should crash and then 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:28.150
 we will be forced to make a restoration but 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.250
 we didn't want to miss the jailbreak not 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 we will have to return to our friend e 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.170
 use to reds to put it in plein 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.340
 by a few but we could easily 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.580
 would open it to stand up and more 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.280
 take the firmware created with the pc 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.500
 windows not our machine as well 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.350
 virtual also and restore with itunes 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.959
 directly from our mac and now vi 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.700
 I show you exactly how to do it 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.660
 but before starting I remind you that 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.810
 air and is compatible only with ipod 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.560
 fourth generation touch iphone 4 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.230
 iphone 3gs and ipad 1 all the others 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.660
 devices are not supported as 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.170
 you see ai red is not an application but it is 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.640
 a command rir file but not 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.890
 be afraid of procedures really 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.470
 simple as first thing we go up 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.470
 utility applications and open the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.049
 terminal of our mac we connect the 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.480
 our computer device e 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.730
 drag the file air and inside 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.180
 of the terminal and after that we send 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.860
 air will start the program and now we 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.260
 we will have to put our dfu in 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.540
 device to do it we get pressed 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.540
 the home and power buttons for 10 seconds 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:46.690
 and after 10 seconds we release the button 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.820
 power and continue to hold 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.010
 only the home button for another 10 15 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.959
 seconds 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.750
 ok now i can also release e 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:58.989
 look forward to look at exploiting with 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.420
 perfect wayne line when it appears 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.549
 this writing air and will have finished the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.970
 Our device will be affecting dfu 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:09.280
 stage now we open itunes and try to 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.620
 make a restore as you can see us 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.570
 the device now we hold the 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.970
 alt key of our keyboard e 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.269
 we click on the restore and select 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:22.990
 the firmware modified with ai faith 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.500
 we click open and now it will speed up the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.060
 part 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 I put it back on top 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.790
 itunes bar is precisely this will be one 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.590
 part speeded up the process in reality 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.590
 two about 10 15 minutes 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.280
 perfect lit up now i will run the 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.740
 initial configuration also here as 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:49.229
 you see it has speeded up the part and how 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:55.330
 see going to general settings 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:57.370
 info are on ios 6.1 10b 144 and this 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.500
 process was done with my mac 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.270
 so I hope this video is there 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.800
 liked it and that it was useful as
