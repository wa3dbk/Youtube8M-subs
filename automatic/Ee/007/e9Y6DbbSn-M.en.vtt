00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:12.230
 this is the most anticipated fashion show 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.209
 by inmates of women's prison a 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.160
 work that exposes its achievements to 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.289
 finalize the vocational courses that 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.710
 they receive during the year that they are 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.960
 participating now 50 models and 17 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.279
 designers we for questions of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.369
 football what we try to do is 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.439
 courses staggered in such a way that they 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.290
 can give more coverage to the greater 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.120
 number of inmates here the colorful and 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.250
 Creativity was uncovered 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.250
 on the women's prison walkway 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.949
 but for this event to be a reality 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.070
 the inmates took an arduous job 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.320
 for some months even minutes 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.980
 before his presentation we have 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.559
 about a month doing the 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.180
 dresses and modeling and all this what 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.150
 arming 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.280
 for about two months the convictions 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.650
 for their faults are long but the 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.270
 inmates try to make it less difficult 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.660
 and they even talk about a second 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.470
 opportunity 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 I am 17 months old 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.670
 and how many the truth 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.550
 of 30 because crimes 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.990
 I do not serve 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.700
 but you feel that this is 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.820
 helping also to reinsert itself already in the 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.280
 goddess 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.020
 because I thought if so she would not have 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.030
 an opportunity to stay that if we 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.150
 we are adapting that they just want 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.040
 an opportunity they want people 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.770
 family friends and society 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.080
 same believe in him however they have to 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.660
 to serve a sentence has to fulfill it 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 but I would not need a total lie if 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.950
 they show a change they can enjoy 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.229
 of a benefit that the law allows each 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.119
 category was evaluated by a jury that 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.759
 He described different aspects as 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.259
 style and design coordination for the
