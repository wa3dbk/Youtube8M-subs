00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I've been working with this I found it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.630 
I've been working with this I found it
anywhere<00:01:06.299> between<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:07.130> 1.8<00:01:08.130> megabits<00:01:08.610> per

3325<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.400> think<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.790> max<00:01:11.970> I'd<00:01:12.150> ever<00:01:12.299> saw<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.600> was

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
3325 I think the max I'd ever saw it was

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.499 
3325 I think the max I'd ever saw it was
4.5<00:01:13.170> or<00:01:13.500> five<00:01:13.710> so<00:01:13.979> needless<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> say<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> 4G

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
4.5 or five so needless to say for 4G

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.740 
4.5 or five so needless to say for 4G

speed<00:01:18.990> standpoint<00:01:19.729> but<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> does<00:01:21.000> have<00:01:21.409> 4G<00:01:22.409> LTE

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

but<00:01:30.150> still<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.960> do<00:01:31.079> get<00:01:31.259> 4G<00:01:31.590> LTE<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.100> so<00:01:32.310> they

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
but still you do get 4G LTE or so they

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.039 
but still you do get 4G LTE or so they

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
each one of the texts like for example

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.740 
each one of the texts like for example
there's<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> lot<00:03:35.520> of<00:03:35.550> noise<00:03:35.820> around<00:03:36.120> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
borders of each one of these letters so

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:39.920 
borders of each one of these letters so
keep<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.850> mind<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.360> not<00:03:39.420> anything<00:03:39.750> to
