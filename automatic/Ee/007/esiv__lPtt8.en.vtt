 Window giant hamburger fries tours part of popcorn to the 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.810
 Wearing the neck then was once the savior for me when people in the cinema 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.640

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.880
 Pure party 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.170

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.480

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.650
 Thomas different and tried 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.170
 to meet but they are crazy two grown up here 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.930
 but sometime into the wide world out of Daniel Mau 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.270
 and yet very young come back he is the reason that 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.050
 maybe her mother who used to work for her 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.810
 in the countryside or Wollny providers so Schell Kenny country 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.130
 geographically and I have good time to carry 4 billion 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.240
 but there too 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.840
 and there I have not heard early because of that 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.930
 but can rest well 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.860
 I was not worried that a similar goal would be possible 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.910
 Secure painter 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.170

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.300
 a very small tactical foul 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.680
 This service is for movie theaters for cars it is like a dream 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 Of course, the big hollywood classics also learned a lot 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.200

 now while they come here 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:20.189
 the filmmaker is still in the cinema at some 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.920
 the West German Hauser where is the old problem and therefore could 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.769
 my whole for Bucher where he is on the 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.969

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.719
 Lorenzen in May lower grade on that Marco Steiner 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.820

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:46.229
 They learn their dreams here in the context of an earlier marriage before they do not 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.739
 to feel the urge 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.939
 to go out into the wide world again, that we too the third time 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:51.819

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:03.729
 I think it's still told 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:08.679
 what should I do in the matter is then almost directly before the 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:09.240
 door 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.090

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.289
