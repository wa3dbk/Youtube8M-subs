 season to see that and that I had announced 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.539

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 the friend of the maintenance is there was 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 extended for a few hours I had 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.560
 no time to do it so she 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.090
 will be available tomorrow I'll blow you 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.590
 give matuidi blaise right now 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.939
 now right now the review of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.019
 blaise so you have the statins they 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 are in parades I invite you 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.450
 to pause their master in art 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.620
 to better observe them for those who 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.120
 want to buy credits or assets 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.410
 a point like 5% in the elections and that 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.340
 fatma credit code delivered in the five 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.930
 minutes after the purchase 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.399
 according to available stocks 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 the information in the description you 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 could see that the matuidi blaise he 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 was exactly in the same team as 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.600
 the box and hot the caseta a review 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.710
 that you can you can find 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.879
 already on the channel as it is 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.379
 available since just now 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.579
 so the blaze match hesitating what 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.050
 what can be said of him at the level of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 his price 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.859
 168 fly credit reviews 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.250
 ie Thursday exactly 16h it is 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.750
 estimated at 160 me credit and bah it remains 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
 a price still high enough 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.619
 but considering the quality of the game less 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 that's bothering me once again 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.610
 I do not mind putting so much on a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.680
 player like that it's true it's 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.180
 rather a defensive player it's not the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.049
 player who will score goals and who will 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.330
 make assists 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.950
 although at the level of the pass quality 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.180
 and a big plus but it's not him who 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.920
 will you score goals that's for sure 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.450
 so at the level of the negative points because 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.140
 that there are still some sound 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.330
 positioning 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.860
 so I make him play relayer 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.840
 blaise matuidi I play it in 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 torchbearer and as a relayer he 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.650
 rises enormously that's really good it's 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.079
 realistic because we dream it shows 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.640
 a lot it's a box to box but some 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.979
 time he finds himself at positions that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.090
 maximum he finds himself scorer in fact 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.009
 defect in full match they find themselves 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.329
 scorer and it's not necessarily his 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.240
 role especially that he also does not have the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.460
 end the statistics for to score 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 goals and times I find it's 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.610
 placed anyhow so that's his 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 positioning I was obliged to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.979
 put in the negative points 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.659
 by the way on all versions 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.799
 matuidi that's something I found 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.540
 it's the positioning it really was 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.280
 bad then the two stars gestures 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.600
 techniques although it's true that good 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.130
 it's not his role in him either 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.079
 ask not to do skill in all 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.250
 the two-star senses technical gesture that 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.959
 still it is rather 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.310
 disgusting and choice that technically 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.680
 technically he has a big stadium in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.950
 l1 86 on the map so it's when 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.440
 even 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.730
 but still rather well but 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.110
 here are two floors technical gesture it's 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.580
 really bad you can not do it 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.810
 gesture when even if matuidi blues do not 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.670
 not necessarily technical gestures 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.140
 there you are really more than limit and 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.090
 I was forced to put it rating of 7 to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.560
 10 technique is disgusting then 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.970
 at the pro level positive because we have 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 nevertheless, there are still a lot 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.980
 especially positive points at the level of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.420
 the stadium stats defensive so the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.790
 defensive stages rather so already his 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.319
 speed he in 83 years speed on the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.269
 map even though I did not really understand it 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.440
 I was really expecting a big up like 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.330
 last year it seems like the year 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.660
 last he had finished at 85 on the 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.069
 map 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.110
 it is eaten and big nonsense in it 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.000
 is he had 83 speed but I 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.540
 was expecting a bigger up to the level 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.030
 speed 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.410
 even if 83 years ago speed as more than 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.239
 correct for those who will do it I 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.470
 recuperator it's good and for those who 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.180
 are going to play relay runner this is 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.159
 perfect 83 speed it's largely 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.569
 sufficient 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:04.379
 physically physically he has stats 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.580
 Just huge 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.519
 he is really very good about his 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:11.519
 86 legs in strength with 1.94 in 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.170
 balance so inevitably he never falls 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.640
 and it is rather he who moves 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.610
 the players I moved really a lot 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.440
 a lot of players at the level of everything 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.209
 who is this at the games head is good 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.879
 so it's not trying not from above 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.900
 offensive level it is rather of which 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.920
 defensively whatever he is going to be he's going 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.740
 to be important 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.500
 in the aerial game dutil 1 92 years at the 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.000
 with 1.86 without precision of the head 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.319
 so that's how I said 86 years 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.080
 accuracy of the head me I not the 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.940
 everything found in everything that was trick 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.920
 offensive but defensively he takes 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 a lot of balloons of the head after the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.450
 interesting stats for a player from 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.170
 this quality there defensively what 95 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.569
 in aggression 99 years because the interception 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.920
 94 years old standing tackle and 83 tackle slipped 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.150
 so it's really very interesting 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.489
 to recover balloons 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.050
 if you like like me play on everything 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.880
 what is anticipation etc 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.470
 it's really the player you need 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.819
 it is very good pass quality and 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.810
 you could see that ends on a 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.280
 decisive pass in view that I have not 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.540
 marked with him so the cia already from 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.880
 balance sheet but I'm still going to talk about 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.470
 does the pass quality and the a86 one 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.060
 goes on the map and it feels 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.380
 really a lot he has a very good foot 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.630
 left so for the raises that's 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.979
 really very very interesting and he 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.500
 still makes some openings 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.269
 interesting enough that turns into 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.310
 time we pass decisive so the blaise 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.850
 matuidi tots you have the record before 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.500
 your eyes 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.850
 so at the level of the negative points like 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.889
 I said the positioning I find that 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.180
 sometimes he found himself 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.650
 a little anywhere on the ground it's 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.720
 true that his strong strong contribution 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.780
 these ford ford contributions make that bah 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.220
 he is brought to move everywhere 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.600
 but sometimes it moves a little too much by 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.610
 all like Thursday of the times they are 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.680
 find scorer in right winger in 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.210
 sink left and it's not necessarily this 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.410
 that we ask him the two floors and 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.419
 technique even if it's more 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.800
 anecdotally than anything else he's 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.380
 really disgusting technically what 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.370
 it's even if he has stats for 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.660
 technically it's still bad and 2 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.860
 star technical gesture you are obliged to 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.789
 put it in the east in the currencies 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.350
 in the negative points 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.240
 then on the positive points 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.260
 because there is really going to be some 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.479
 not bad so more stupid speed his speed 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.160
 is more than ok finally this very very 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.289
 very good for a recovery medium 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.660
 middle center me I play it mc 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:14.729
 mans mdc it's the same frei fractales 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.830
 do not worry that way his 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.030
 physical that's really where he is the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.820
 more impressive 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.120
 his physique is 86 in strength 94 in 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.860
 balance 96 in agility I know it's 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.450
 perfect it's perfect for one for one 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.669
 guy who is at the heart of the game and who is 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.110
 there to recover balloons marking 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.100
 he's a good stat at marking he's 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.660
 often pressing the wearer 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.630
 balloon also thanks to his stats in 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.380
 aggressiveness so 195 in aggression 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.240
 effect that he is still trying 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.080
 to pull the shirt he's still in 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.700
 trying to cut the 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.040
 paths of the passes and that's not it 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.710
 bad goethe is very beautiful head game 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.090
 defensively defensively defended 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.010
 it's not bad again it's even 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:52.600
 very well if he gets a lot of 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.220
 balloons of the head I took the ball to 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.930
 luiz gustavo I take the example of 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.460
 medium recuperator rather big same 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.200
 yaya touré I came across binds tower 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.370
 and it was not the top but I should 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.110
 took balloons of the head so that 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.300
 it is rather interesting tackle slipped 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.620
 tackle of you especially the tackle of 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.300
 interesting butcher because the tackle 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.310
 slipped I do not have I have not tested 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:12.280
 but enormously moore tackle is in 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.400
 really feels that stat 1 94 years old it's 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.200
 94- year-old tackle of taste frankly 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.850
 I'm my feet, what's wrong? 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.080
 its pass quality a very very good 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.220
 pass quality then I put the 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.810
 punching power because there is a 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.580
 big stadium that I shot a few times 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.630
 I tried some long shock 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.770
 went off anyway but that 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.060
 was going very hard so I still 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.860
 had to choose striking power 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:31.210
 we are going to put it in more and so 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.530
 I put a 19 on 20 years a very good 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.670
 note i'm not going to stand up surely not 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.849
 what will meet again is what I have 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.610
 set to dd rossi adelaja touré 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.899
 and all and all conceded alone 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.689
 recuperator that I did for the 

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:44.860
 moment when tots and motta also motta he has 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:46.959
 not they will vote I will not get up 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.129
 but also maybe it's no I 

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.240
 know more but still is it here 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:51.610
 I will not come to you because there is better 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.300
 but 19 out of 20 that's it's a very 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.429
 very good note 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.490
 I remember that the cif I had put a 

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:58.599
 14th rank 14 - 15 so we feel 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.580
 really a big difference knowing 

00:06:58.599 --> 00:07:02.589
 that the stif is a May 14 after with 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.360
 the time I had never froze 

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.589
 with whom does even more so maybe 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.089
 that with time she would have taken it 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:08.439
 would have taken a lot more and as I have 

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:10.809
 said here it has a price this at a price 

00:07:08.439 --> 00:07:12.159
 rather interesting again we have 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:14.709
 less than 200 miles from the first day 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:16.209
 so it's been pretty cool that's 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:18.550
 rather cool and its precious to go down 

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:20.199
 by the weekend this is stéphane 24 11 am 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.939
