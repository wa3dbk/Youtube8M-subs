 when this one is like you 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.390
 know but true if you follow me 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.540
 on the value chain on the networks 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.699
 this year we are the muse of the 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.610
 brand vivelle dop for refills 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.619
 who are the colors and we had 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.140
 you already talked about it here 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 you must have the wood an analogy envy 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.170
 to insert it in this video because 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.050
 we thought it really did 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.790
 was going too well that match is really 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.020
 all too well and so here we go 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.380
 explain a little bit 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.810
 apply it how to also bring it to the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.610
 times in chest food time or you 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:36.400
 give some ideas and excess party 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:37.810
 for the video to start my 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.060
 transformation I'm going to apply the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.350
 create alone in the hair so tie way 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.790
 and dye so I have the chalk verb 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.620
 safia the violet focused and it exists in 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.150
 four colors so I apply it 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.100
 just on my tips in Thai honda is 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.350
 really very crudely same 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.240
 without a mirror and it makes a really a 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.040
 very very nice rendering without needing 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 to have knowledge in hairdressing 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.700
 curtains apply it directly to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.540
 finger and that can withdraw right from the 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.130
 first shampoo 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.660
 so it's convenient for an event 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.480
 really special and there for a tom day 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.770
 blur it was just the ideal I fixed 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.330
 then all using a spray 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.050
 styling to prevent the color from 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.490
 go away 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.930
 and here I am, I have my hair 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:16.120
 dyed in blue aimed at preparing 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.070
 pancakes a little health I start to 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.480
 mix corn flour so 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.820
 beware it's not wheat flour 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.190
 I also mix stevia for 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.530
 replace the sugar a pinch of sodium 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.870
 a pinch of salt then I also put 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.709
 of the coconut oil that I make 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.080
 melt in the microwave 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.970
 as well as soymilk then one 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.250
 mix everything in a container 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.500
 is doing very well and the preparation should 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.239
 to be a bit thick I'm also preparing a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.670
 raspberry coulis so I mix 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.300
 raspberry water is a little syrup 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.670
 agave 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.350
 in a saucepan that I make back 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.270
 then over low heat stirring time 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.680
 in time and that's it I can cook 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:55.320
 the pancakes then pour the coulis 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.320
 on it and it will be really delicious 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.990
 this family 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.770
 to have a decor at the atom blur I 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.960
 choose a bed with plenty of 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.400
 cushions in slightly neutral tones 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.320
 in white tones in shades 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.640
 beiges and then I put this tray 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.500
 breakfast that I found in a 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.720
 gray dress right next to my house with 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.430

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.950
 esata and that's the decor it's really a 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.950
 blur thoroughly 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.770
 but OK 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.840

 side of her face that she braided 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.210

 car she braided until May 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.020
 then she put crises for 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.120
 hair on the a13 to raise a little the 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.530
