to play as a cop
the<00:00:18.540> idea<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.560> you're<00:00:19.800> playing<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the idea here is that you're playing a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.890 
the idea here is that you're playing a
hot<00:00:20.340> pursuit<00:00:20.520> event<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.509> chase<00:00:21.720> down

hot pursuit event you get to chase down
the<00:00:21.960> racers<00:00:22.470> your<00:00:22.950> objective<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.610> shut

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
the racers your objective is to shut

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
the racers your objective is to shut
down<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.509> race<00:00:24.689> before<00:00:25.259> the<00:00:25.500> racers<00:00:25.890> cross

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
down the race before the racers cross

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.980 
down the race before the racers cross
the<00:00:26.220> finish<00:00:26.520> line<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.939> that<00:00:27.270> involves<00:00:27.840> you

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
the finish line so that involves you

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.200 
the finish line so that involves you
chasing<00:00:28.829> down<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.099> racers<00:00:29.489> and<00:00:29.700> basically

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
chasing down the racers and basically

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.489 
chasing down the racers and basically

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:32.499 
smashing it
