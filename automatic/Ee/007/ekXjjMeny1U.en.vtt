00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and purchase this on eBay it's just

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.900 
and purchase this on eBay it's just
basically<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.880> leather<00:00:15.240> case<00:00:15.660> with<00:00:15.770> red

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
basically a leather case with red

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.439 
basically a leather case with red
stitching<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.619> could<00:00:19.890> put<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:21.000> key<00:00:21.270> on

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
stitching that I could put this key on

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.450 
stitching that I could put this key on
I've<00:00:21.930> dropped<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> few<00:00:22.800> times<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I've dropped this a few times so I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.189 
I've dropped this a few times so I
figured<00:00:23.970> I'd<00:00:24.869> better<00:00:25.050> protect<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
figured I'd better protect this so that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.950 
figured I'd better protect this so that
how<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.650> place<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.359> figured<00:00:30.929> this

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
how do we place that but I figured this

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.080 
how do we place that but I figured this
was<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.710> it's<00:00:32.040> about<00:00:32.219> 20<00:00:32.550> bucks<00:00:35.090> it

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
was what it was it's about 20 bucks it

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.139 
was what it was it's about 20 bucks it

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.730 

Hey

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.830 

plus<00:01:25.980> that's<00:01:26.310> n<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:27.480> this<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.490> put<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.420> into

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
plus that's n take this and put it into

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:43.140 
plus that's n take this and put it into
the<00:01:30.960> slot

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.970 

and<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.630> guess<00:01:44.810> you<00:01:45.020> don't<00:01:45.260> have<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.650> use<00:01:45.830> this

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
and I guess you don't have to use this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:54.399 
and I guess you don't have to use this
but

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.440 

this<00:01:54.770> was

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.660 

so<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.320> will<00:02:01.530> snap<00:02:01.740> back<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.220> right<00:02:02.369> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
so this will snap back and right there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.630 
so this will snap back and right there
and<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.240> go<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.720> that

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
and this will go for that

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.260 
and this will go for that
and<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.880> see<00:02:06.060> all<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.299> holes<00:02:06.689> right<00:02:06.869> here<00:02:07.470> but

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
and you see all the holes right here but

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.770 
and you see all the holes right here but
then<00:02:09.270> put<00:02:09.599> this<00:02:09.869> screw<00:02:10.319> back<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.800> here

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.020 

screw<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.930> back<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:20.850> should

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
screw this back on then you should

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.809 
screw this back on then you should
probably

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
probably

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.679 
probably
get<00:02:23.420> something<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> lock<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.069> down<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.569> it

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
get something to lock this down so it

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.580 
get something to lock this down so it
doesn't<00:02:26.989> come<00:02:27.079> apart<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.720> so<00:02:30.049> there<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.379> have

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
doesn't come apart and so there you have

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
doesn't come apart and so there you have
it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060
