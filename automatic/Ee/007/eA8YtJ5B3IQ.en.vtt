00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.150
 thing 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.010
 some kind of green nonsense and then we are the same 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.870
 procedure we do all three times 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.840

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:54.460
 we have 4 of these things and 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:56.970
 what do we do next we throw everything away 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.430
 four of these things in one place then 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.640
 throw away 9 blocks of iron and and and 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.010
 and throw two blocks of stone and we 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.550
 two blocks of red stone appear and 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.740
 we have such a star here 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.050
 it turns out that we have and need 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.740
 build a small mechanism and before 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.910
 than do this let me a lot 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.170
 let's get ready because we have to 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.390
 fight our altron my 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.970
 try to win but not try 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.950
 my really win but still 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:39.940
 need to prepare take the diamond set 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.810
 so let's find a bow so arrows 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.810
 apples will not charm on 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.600
 izichah do it so I did not take I 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.020
 took apples 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.020
 like this 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.209
 we are all ready 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.709
 what we do let's answer from our 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.569
 designs away so she doesn't 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.870
 hurt and then you never know what can 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:11.310
 happen and build our mechanism four 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:15.379
 block iron set here so here 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.989
 between the blocks of red stone 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:20.569
 in the middle is our sea lantern and 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.549
 throw a star 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.469
 so here it happens I forgot 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:33.620
 enable game mod including our day mod 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:34.829
 eat apple and here it is our altron 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.699
 appears 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:40.919
 it's not him this is the bot he called 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:43.109
 Altron himself he is now we are on 

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:46.379
 let's see him but here he is just 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.510
 flew here he is our altron he is in no way 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:51.870
 different from the rest of their 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.719
 subordinates who try us 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:57.150
 win but I think we will beat them earlier 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:04:01.229
 than they have us here and now this happens 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:04.259
 that's how it looks and let's speed it up 

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:07.879
 a little bit of this process so you soon 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.879
 saw my told 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.960
 here 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.960

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:57.370
 we all defeated our altron he died 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.370
 I heard such a distinctive sound and after 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.980
 his death we lose his head 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.990
 as a trophy he is pretty strong 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.340
 by the way hike you my diamond armor 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:13.890
 most hurt helmet nevertheless 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.890
 this is by the way a good replacement we can wear 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.500
 altron's head instead of our helmet and 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:27.130
 it looks like this so let's 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:30.430

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.950
