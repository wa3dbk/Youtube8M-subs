00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.950

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.440
 place that when his book came out 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.250

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.360
 You'll get to see us both. 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.310

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.720
 leave red 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.030
 come on skin but do what right Speck 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.530
 I hope it's good and worth it. 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.319
 books that are not continuations I 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.880
 I bought the deconstruction of marabÃ¡ and 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.430
 there are already a lot of people saying that it 's a lot 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.010
 Good, I speak the truth, I do not know anything 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.849
 about this book I know that the beloved there 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.170
 There are certain visions hallucinations I know 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:06.110
 people do not know if she's really 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.269
 seeing things you just imagining 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.830
 being a hallucination is the only thing that 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.079
 I know the book, I do not want to do it either. 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.540
 but because it interests me if 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.359
 for surfing when it looks good there 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.269
 against not knowing the story but 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.519
 I do not think it's cool then ii the fifth 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.829
 wave of 1500 and that is already complicated 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.720
 here in Brazil I do not know why 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.940
 bursts but also a lot of other book 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.180
 people said very well I know it's about 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.190
 aliens and that the alien attacks 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.810
 came in waves that each one walks cause 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.730
 some kind of thing 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.730
 one of them left everything dark and ended 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.680
 With electricity the blockage I know a lot 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.870
 thing but they must have realized I never know 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.109
 So much about the book when I buy it. 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.980
 It's everyone wants to know I do not want 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.989
 to discover 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.359
 while I 'm wrong because it seems to me 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.489
 very cool maybe it's next to me 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.049
 read not sure not i'm not 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.329
 saying that I'm still thinking 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:04.010
 think many options that I have to 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:06.620
 now discredited him to eat and deny 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.290
 mixture that I'm not mistaken will be 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.260
 applied by the concept 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.730
 here in Brazil i do not remember the title anymore 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.140
 I do not know when it will be 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.000
 complicated already has title and I will look for 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.680
 and I'll leave it down there for you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.930
 they know why they do not want to be 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.810
 now what I know about this book that 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:26.080
 is spent in a spaceship that is 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.789
 falling and they fall planet and these two 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.669
 apparently they are the only ones 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:33.400
 survivors of this accident 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.530
 I do not know the Brazilian anymore because 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.720
 The mouthguard did not stop talking about him. 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.400
 so it's like a million video 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.860
 where does she talk about this book? 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.720
 I said then I need piglets right then 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:45.910
 Let me buy it because it looks cool. 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.840
 he's a lot of people talking about him then 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:53.020
 Is not there, and finally, from here, you only realize. 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.849
 called mary and person who tells 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.880
 story of a girl who can not remember the 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:05:00.070
 name and I do not have a name that also 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.650
 A princess and her father wanted to get married. 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.800
 she with someone with a prince and walk with 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.199
 someone like prince and she wanted to get married 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.479
 with him so she ran away from this I did not 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.880
 deceived him and sent murderer behind her and 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:16.120
 Prince goes after her but we 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.889
 You never know who a prince is. 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.169
 killer type so we'll read the 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:23.620
 history and do not know who is who 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:26.740
 I think the neuf book was well understood 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.229
 and it seemed cool, so it should be a 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.990
 surprise when it comes to the end and people 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.800
 find out who the prince is who 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.630
 killer 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.460
 obviously it will have a triangle 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.930
 loving but not'm not care 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.289
 nevertheless with this book because the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.720
 sasha doha bookshop speaks a lot of it and 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.699
 she mentioned him in books that go 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.370
 blow your mind the video of her that she 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.250
 Talk about this so curious and I bought 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.680
 because I'm impulsive and I bought 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.449
 So, this is what some people are for today. 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.880
 I should be more or less 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:01.419
 year is now free new good 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:04.150
 time for somebody else in the most 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:06.909
 Otherwise this way is only better is 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:08.569
 because dollar money I think I go 

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.279
 end up having to do 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.559
 about English here for this channel because 

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:14.389
 they have many things in English here then 

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:16.039
 I'm thinking, I think you 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.709
 honestly I think I'll do more like 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:21.499
 They're still just planning this, I'm going 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.869
