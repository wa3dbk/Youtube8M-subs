one<00:02:24.010> thing<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.280> would<00:02:24.519> say<00:02:24.550> a<00:02:25.000> little<00:02:25.209> bit<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
one thing I would say a little bit of a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.030 
one thing I would say a little bit of a
negative<00:02:25.930> but<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.230> would<00:02:26.410> improve<00:02:26.769> with

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
negative but that would improve with

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.490 
negative but that would improve with
time<00:02:27.069> it's<00:02:27.550> not<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> deal<00:02:27.940> breaker<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:29.200> is

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
time it's not a deal breaker is this is

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.860 
time it's not a deal breaker is this is
sort<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.190> slightly<00:02:30.519> misaligned<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.569> front

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
sort of slightly misaligned to the front

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.990 
sort of slightly misaligned to the front
and<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:33.220> purely<00:02:33.519> because<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
and that's just purely because it's a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.210 
and that's just purely because it's a
brand<00:02:34.269> new<00:02:34.360> case<00:02:34.720> once<00:02:35.349> it's<00:02:35.560> been<00:02:35.739> used<00:02:35.950> for<00:02:36.130> a

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
brand new case once it's been used for a

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.190 
brand new case once it's been used for a
little<00:02:36.310> while<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:37.120> all<00:02:37.330> portion<00:02:37.870> here<00:02:38.080> will

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
little while this all portion here will

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.960 
little while this all portion here will
give<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> little<00:02:38.739> bit<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.400> front<00:02:39.670> flap

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
give a little bit and the front flap

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.210 
give a little bit and the front flap
will<00:02:40.239> move<00:02:40.660> over<00:02:41.019> a<00:02:41.200> little<00:02:41.319> bit<00:02:41.500> more<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:41.980> it

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
will move over a little bit more as it

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.509 
will move over a little bit more as it
seemed<00:02:42.549> to<00:02:42.670> just<00:02:42.790> fit<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.090> little<00:02:43.360> bit<00:02:43.450> nicer

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
seemed to just fit a little bit nicer
