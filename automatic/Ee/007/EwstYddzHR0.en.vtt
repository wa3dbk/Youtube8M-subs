00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
basically I had to download a program

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.660 
basically I had to download a program
and<00:00:54.690> install<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.410> had<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.340> an<00:00:56.460> account

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and install it I had to make an account

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.729 
and install it I had to make an account
here<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.449> very<00:00:57.870> freakin<00:00:58.410> easy

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
here it was very freakin easy

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.700 
here it was very freakin easy
anyway<00:00:59.399> so<00:01:00.030> I've<00:01:00.449> downloaded<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.530> program

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
anyway so I've downloaded the program

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.759 
anyway so I've downloaded the program
and<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.750> that's<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.809> minecraft<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.589> this

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
and it's that's not minecraft that this

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.990 
and it's that's not minecraft that this
is<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.949> program<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:05.549> let<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.790> close<00:01:05.939> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
is the program but let me close that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
is the program but let me close that
quickly<00:01:06.299> it's<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.500> three<00:01:07.770> files<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.490> run

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
quickly it's these three files you run

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.200 
quickly it's these three files you run
the<00:01:08.790> exe<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.799> you<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.340> program<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the exe and you this is the program so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.570 
the exe and you this is the program so
what<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.570> have<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> very<00:01:13.890> very<00:01:14.280> simple

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
what you have to do is very very simple

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.560 
what you have to do is very very simple
