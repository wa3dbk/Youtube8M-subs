 the men walked along the shore of the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.410
 lagoon with its net bag or in its 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.090
 canoes were sailing and fishing 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.800
 numerous creatures that had 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.420
 conversation with the water 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.250
 women and children who do not 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.110
 they participated in water activities 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.360
 they sold the fruit of fishing and 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.580
 elderly people who surrounded the riverbank while 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 they followed carpets and baskets with the plant 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.380
 of touré some fished since early 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.560
 there were few who preferred fishing 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.720
 nocturnal sitting in his field the fisherman 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.300
 away from the shore he prepared his 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 implements but the fishing routine 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.010
 as night and day was encouraged with 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.170
 the mystery at the turn of a channel is 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.630
 outlined the shadow of an islet 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.060
 large outgoing stone perhaps a boat of 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.490
 plant roots through the mist 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.370
 late of the sunrise a silhouette on the 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.410
 islet seemed to call it was a woman 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 He stopped combing his long hair 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.610
 and I called her breasts to the air what 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.430
 they called the man he looked at the creature 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.290
 more and more immersed in the dream a 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.120
 flower necklace adorned his chest and 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.640
 over the forehead shone something 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.530
 like a crown the fishermen 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.750
 they gave in calling that appearance the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.450
 ironed water creature owner and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.110
 lady of science the ironed was the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.660
 mother and creator of everything there was 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.940
 I used to appear I know how an earthly woman 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.950
 although education is the bottom half of 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.620
 his body was transformed into a tail of 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.040
 black viper the iron na if she was a woman 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.600
 she preened and made long braids 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.180
 the birds came to perch on their 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.100
 head and on her bare shoulders she 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.710
 he raised his legs to relieve the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.140
 wonders of the aquatic fauna of his 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.930
 waist lost jumping fish 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.300
 frogs and water and lots he said to 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.459
 fisherman with persuasive accent almost 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.100
 in love I want you to go live 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.220
 with me to the center of the lagoon the man 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.290
 dumb and fearful nominated to answer the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.989
 vision of that creature loved it 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.850
 and cloud your understanding finally 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.520
 He managed to turn his canoe around and 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.060
 rowing in a hurry he returned to his dwelling 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.920
 on the islet floated a glow 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.470
 some more daring fishermen had 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.300
 conversation with the ironed the owner 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.739
 of the waters with great frequency was 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.100
 good with them and I proposed 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.870
 placidly passed the times one day 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.790
 they came to the valley that surrounded the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.680
 lagoon hundreds of men's eyes 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.290
 color of the sky the clear skin and the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.330
 face covered with hair some brought 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.640
 colossal beasts and irons and others a 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.350
 object they called cross not 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.269
 they understood the story of the goddess 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.940
 when they heard her tell the villagers 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.489
 ribereños were terrified of the tail of 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.950
 black viper peaking his cross said 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.799
 that this was a bad thing related to the 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.540
 demon and his dark underground kingdom the 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.400
 lake activity followed its course 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.680
 thanks to tradition and the powerful 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 flow of the nine waters 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.360
 neither did the legends that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.400
 they wove around the plate but with 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.229
 the passing of time the ancients 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.620
 gentlemen from overseas managed 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.900
 intro 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.639
 in fishermen and other people the 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.400
 idea that the water lady had 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:37.889
 fish tail and not snake tail to that 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.500
 creature called her mermaid came the 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.330
 rains came winters children 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.410
 from then they grew and became 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 Elderly the elderly became dust 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.580
 Innumerable suns crossed the sky and 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.350
 under the sky almost nobody remembered 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.180
 the creature fishtail that 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.639
 appeared to the fishermen between 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.770
 mist of the dawn not only that but 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.870
 that almost nobody knew that in a good 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.120
 by motorcycle there on the dry plain 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.310
 there had been freshwater sailboats and a 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.919
 extensive lagoon a beautiful lagoon and 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.199
 maternal only the potters continued 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:11.910
 with the sacred office molding with the 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.590
 mud small figures that kept 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.750
 reminiscences of the iron na 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.669
 prodigious of the creature that had been 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.639
 in ancient times the owner and mistress of 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.129
 the nine waters 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:24.560
 the existence will be true or will be a lie 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.539
 of the sirens will be that there are many 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:28.960
 things that we have not seen or 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.550
