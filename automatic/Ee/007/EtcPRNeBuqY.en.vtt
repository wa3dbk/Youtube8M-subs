 Hey 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:23.020
 Next , I would like to practice the movement of turns often used in the house genre a little 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:27.010
 It is a turn, but basically I take a rhythm while taking steps while doing a step. 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.119
 Because often use Surutto I mean of you would like to make it a little lecture 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.210
 At first it is movement, but lift the foot from the right foot 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.390
 From Lower 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.970
 Open one leg 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 Once again I open it from the city 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:45.690
 Raise and open 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.880
