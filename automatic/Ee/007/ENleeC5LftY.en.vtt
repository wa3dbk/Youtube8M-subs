00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello everyone, welcome shop 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.130
 sledge class 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 wanted a new sport collection yes 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.790
 please today we will consider 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.010
 gloves from the new collection from the company 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.010
 u and sport and this model eliminator 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 absolute mushroom and what is worth noting that 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.539
 new collection in the company of sport is like 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.699
 the previous collection is made very 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.820
 I like bright colors this time 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.740
 let's take a closer look at them 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 much has changed the previous model 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 that they have a fit with the size of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.020
 latex but all major 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.530
 characteristics that could you 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530
 interest 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.730
 therefore considered goalkeeper 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.379
 Gloves from the company are digging now 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 consider another German 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.350
 manufacturer also specializing 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.480
 on about the sky equipment with regards to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.430
 reluctance 2 rocker on hand let's 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 let's see what happens here and sticky 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.329
 here are not made by itself 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.460
 not in the middle so you are unlikely 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.260
 scratch and lats on the index finger 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.850
 when putting on 2 gloves on hand though 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.770
 Of course in this regard, the company role 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 much more convenient to perform helps 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.369
 mechanism and there in general with this question 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.180
 no though i'm glove 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 easy enough to put on the hand and 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.100
 let me first show you these 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.100
 gloves closer 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.429
 well and let's consider all their main 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.500
 4mm latex specifications 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.420
 absolutely mowed down trying top 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.729
 latex sports company suitable for 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 games in any weather and absolutely any 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.689
 level this is naturally the one over with which 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.700
 used by professionals around 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.039
 the world in particular, for example, and coal rice 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560
 and other similar goalkeepers 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.799
 naturally it will be much better too 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.329
 latex aqua soft but how can you 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.340
 understand any professional 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.209
 goalkeeper gloves can not be so 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.869
 bad too because they are intended 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:07.060
 professionals who play 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.429
 naturally in any weather though 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.170
 some manufacturers for example their 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.540
 main profile areas still is 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.700
 dry weather in particular nike and 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.140
 so 4 millimeter latex absolute 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.629
 grip + large on a soft lining 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.430
 the thickness of the gloves here is small i wouldn't 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.110
 there was nothing super thick but 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.120
 superfine they absolutely can not call it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.200
 There is here such a thickness that I am very 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.360
 I like it optimally 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.459
 and for shock absorbing and for great 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.470
 feelings of the ball blood here negative had 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.269
 of the rear part of course completely 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.069
 made of latex in the back also lunge 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.660
 soft lined gloves are very nice 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.819
 felt on the hands and nothing fetters 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 vegetable movements are soft and again 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.600
 I repeat very much I love so thick 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.299
 gloves and in my opinion optimal 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.370
 regards to ventilation here are special and not so 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.380
 much since you are on vin cut negative to 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.870
 but no less so that the gloves were 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.400
 breathing made textile inserts on 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.709
 index finger that go along 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.989
 until the end of the thumb is also on 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.609
 the back of the gloves therefore ventilation 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.349
 Basically there is enough well seals 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.250
 yourself easy enough thousands 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.299
 so there will be no problems with it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.950
 standard length of clasps path of 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.810
 exile wrist problems with landing on 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.700
 no hand on this clasp of course 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.709
 you can do the painting according to your 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.630
 desire by the way with regards to the clutch shifted 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.010
 this is wolford 's signature glove 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.000
 which you get out of the packaging and 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.000
 going on guys following 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.320
 I think you can hear perfectly how 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.200
 gloves now stick to each other 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:30.850
 it does not know is not typical for many 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.380
 manufacturers do not know why u and sports 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.450
 this is how it happens therefore by 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.250
 Essentially gloves can be applied immediately as 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.590
 only you bought ie bought and or 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.970
 immediately into battle 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.590
 there is no protection for weak data gloves 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.090
 regards size here 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 interesting point this particular 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.540
 model size 80 half and can 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.360
 say that to my eight these 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.010
 gloves sit like that i mean i 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.480
 Now I do not really imagine how it will be on 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.260
 my hand here we take to since 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.990
 here 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.700
 my fingers are already stuck in the tips 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.680
 glove fingers and after so i 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.840
 I think that their being a little uncomfortable yes 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.000
 of course the thumb has a small 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.650
 the stock here here it is but in general to me 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.530
 very comfortable in size of eight with 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.870
 half i guess i would 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.550
 recommended a network of gloves to the floor 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.870
 bigger size but overall i think 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.000
 that the eight will just sit 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.280
 perfect tight in hand i am landing like that 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.290
 I do not like fans of a perfect tight fit 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.270
 I advise you to take the size in size 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.540
 landing size troop larin on my 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.010
 the look is just perfect and i would i 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.310
 preferred exactly where the floor 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.690
 razmerchik more well, and perhaps all that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.030
 wanted to tell now let's all this 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.950
 Union measures a four-meter ax and 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.050
 latex from sport then latex absolute mushroom 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.270
 Does it fit any level and into any 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.680
 the weather is natural rain the best water 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.330
 aqua soft but it is professional 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.630
 gloves or what so many problems not 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.419
 will be 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.710
 this i can say from my own experience 4 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:49.180
 millimeter plus made soft 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.860
 lining the back of course 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.680
 entirely made of latex sadit 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.260
 also the lining is made extremely negative 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.060
 optimally to the glove thickness round 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.800
 there is also a great feeling of the ball and and 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.400
 impact cancellation exactly page on 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.750
 high enough 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.490
 standard abundant clasp on board 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.980
 fixes wrists and problems by landing on 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.480
 they are not on this clasp of course you 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.310
 You can make your application 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.680
 optional protective data inserts 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.419
 There are no gloves and with regards to the size of this 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.130
 specific model size eight with 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.080
 half in my opinion perfect 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.650
 landing on my eight so i would 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.990
 recommended to take on the floor size 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.060
 more fans of a perfect tight fit 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.900
 take times the size to death on 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.000
 take eight 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.310
 eight but overall I would recommend 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.120
 take on the floor razmerchik more to me on 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.039
 My view is such a fit is perfect overall 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.550
 that's all i wanted to tell you again 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.070
 I will note 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.160
 i'm very design very cool color 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.590
 so -called turquoise tiffany dvizhek 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.180
 but they absolutely i would say 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.620
 brightly colored many company correction 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.030
 the sport itself I would not have what is 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.490
 big difference from the previous model 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.560
 porthole its causes measles also 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.139
 It was the past these need only she was 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.580
 yellow green colors the most difference is not 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.530
 so much can be a little different 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.880
 the lining is made but the print is hanging on 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.539
 very cool deserve your 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.820
 attention 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.889
 therefore recommends try all who
