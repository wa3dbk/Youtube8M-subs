00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone and today in this review I 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.580
 I would like to tell you about e 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 a book called dns airtab ich 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.210
 &amp; ich 601 as usual I will begin with the monthly 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.070
 characteristics and move on to technical 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.990
 Kit found here such a convenient 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:26.189
 cover that fastens our electronic 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.570
 book with 3 clips 2 clips on top and 1 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:38.879
 the clip from the bottom is also bundled with us 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 there is a micro usb and charging electronic 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:44.640
 e-book book is very subtle by 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.989
 compared with iphone 3g s 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:52.050
 we see a huge difference very subtle and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.170
 very easy to hold in your hands 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.750
 it's plastic but what's unpleasant is it 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.440
 imprints are left but also if we 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.610
 we carry this e-book in the case then 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.780
 Signet fu no we will not, and 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.210
 the e-book will hold very 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.010
 well will not fall out in general very 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.220
 well fixed also on the face 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.479
 side and above we have an interface 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.140
 buttons this lock button and power on 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.740
 turning off the tablet is the entrance to the USB flash drive 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.509
 micro and micro and this is micro usb to 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 microusb and under the most snakes and under charging 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:39.680
 on the front we have buttons 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.409
 switch pages back and forth 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.720
 also context menu buttons 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.040
 home 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 the button is the joystick and the back button 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.030
 This button and do not know the key 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.659
 used because nowhere is it 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.689
 valid 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.670
 maybe later we will also learn about 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.530
 technical specifications 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.439
 we have here is a type of display e-ink 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 600 resolution by 800 points on the right 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.950
 800 by 600 points 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:16.110
 6 inches diagonal 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.049
 memory memory we have two gigabytes 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.510
 internal and ram 64 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.629
 megabyte 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.870
 we also have battery life 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.299
 here at thousands of 400 milliamps hours what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.659
 good enough for this electronic 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.390
 books as its owner said 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:39.090
 how she bought it 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.120
 the first time she charged her and after that 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.390
 a month and a half she went with her and every 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.910
 day 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.450
 I read for 30 minutes in total 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.519
 is 22 and a half hours but how 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.170
 declared by the manufacturer this book 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.299
 must withstand 40 hours 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.519
 make some conclusions what this 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.530
 the book is still very good so as in 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.690
 its price segment and these are two with 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.629
 half a thousand we can't find 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.810
 a similar e-book about the pros and 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.849
 cons pros it is very cheap 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.829
 two and a half thousand it seems to me 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.989
 great price for e-book 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.569
 also used here are electronic 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.470
 ink that helps or rather 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.940
 from them our eyes do not get tired and very 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.569
 nice to read as if we read 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:30.690
 normal book minus and there is no lifefire 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:33.569
 but you need to remember that this book is 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.720
 book it is used to 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.310
 we read they were sitting on the internet for something 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.980
 more if we want to surf the internet 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:45.290
 the plot is easier to buy a tablet 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.310
 also cons 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.519
 all the same to the minuses I would take the battery 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.950
 still declared 40 and working 22 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.659
 it is not a plus it is - well, in general, that's all 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.760
