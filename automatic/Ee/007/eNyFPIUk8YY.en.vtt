00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.400 

I<00:00:07.120> started<00:00:08.120> by<00:00:08.240> planing<00:00:08.720> two<00:00:08.960> boards<00:00:09.290> of

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
I started by planing two boards of

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.459 
I started by planing two boards of
poplar<00:00:09.830> so<00:00:10.220> that<00:00:10.430> they<00:00:10.610> were<00:00:10.670> flush<00:00:11.090> and<00:00:11.469> then

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:12.469 
poplar so that they were flush and then

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.330 
poplar so that they were flush and then
I<00:00:12.500> marked<00:00:13.010> on<00:00:13.330> each<00:00:14.330> of<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:14.900> boards<00:00:15.800> the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
I marked on each of the boards the

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:42.880 
I marked on each of the boards the
outline<00:00:16.730> of<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:17.270> blade

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.920 

then<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> use<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.250> site<00:00:44.730> rizal's<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.510> chisel

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
then I use the site rizal's to chisel

00:00:45.930 --> 00:01:44.139 
then I use the site rizal's to chisel
out<00:00:46.019> the<00:00:46.710> shape<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> blade<00:00:47.309> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.059> wood

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.410 

once<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.270> got<00:01:45.390> close<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:47.119> shape<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
once I got close to the shape of the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.980 
once I got close to the shape of the
hibachi

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
hibachi

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.460 
hibachi
I<00:01:49.140> started<00:01:49.710> test-fitting<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:51.140> look<00:01:52.140> at<00:01:52.289> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
I started test-fitting it look at it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.330 
I started test-fitting it look at it
test<00:01:53.460> fit<00:01:53.729> which<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.720> little<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.289> test<00:01:56.130> fit

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
test fit which is a little more test fit

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
test fit which is a little more test fit
which<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.939> little<00:01:57.270> more<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.659> kept<00:01:58.350> doing<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
which is a little more I kept doing that

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:42.520 
which is a little more I kept doing that
until<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.429> got<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.179> right

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.370 

a<00:02:42.560> little<00:02:43.520> oil<00:02:43.700> on<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> blade<00:02:44.390> shows<00:02:45.140> where

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
a little oil on the blade shows where

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.350 
a little oil on the blade shows where
the<00:02:45.500> high<00:02:45.650> spots<00:02:45.950> are<00:02:46.190> and<00:02:46.460> I<00:02:46.970> can<00:02:47.150> chisel

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the high spots are and I can chisel

00:02:47.360 --> 00:03:02.080 
the high spots are and I can chisel
those<00:02:47.660> down<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.260> they<00:02:48.410> don't<00:02:48.590> touch<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.860> blade

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.470 

you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.960 

I<00:03:13.660> glued<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.959> clamped<00:03:14.989> it<00:03:15.410> together<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.010> then

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
I glued and clamped it together and then

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.750 
I glued and clamped it together and then
once<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.930> glue<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.170> dry<00:03:18.319> I<00:03:18.890> took<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.550> to<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
once the glue is dry I took it to the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:54.300 
once the glue is dry I took it to the
grinder<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:21.200> started<00:03:21.530> shaping<00:03:21.950> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.300 

I<00:03:57.540> marked<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.750> chiseled<00:03:59.230> out<00:03:59.350> the<00:03:59.620> spot<00:04:00.040> for

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:53.440 
and the end piece to the saya and then
let<00:04:46.720> them<00:04:46.870> dry
