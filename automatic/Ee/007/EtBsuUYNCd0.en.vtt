if that was a game that that's
definitely<00:01:34.750> one<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.110> would<00:01:35.320> really<00:01:35.590> like

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
definitely one that I would really like

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.920 
definitely one that I would really like
to<00:01:35.920> get<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:36.159> my<00:01:36.250> collection<00:01:36.460> boxed<00:01:37.210> in<00:01:37.329> nice

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
condition so that'll be my answer for

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.690 
condition so that'll be my answer for
that<00:01:40.360> one<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:41.079> next<00:01:41.350> question<00:01:41.500> is<00:01:42.009> totally

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
that one the next question is totally

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.240 
that one the next question is totally
off<00:01:42.850> topic<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.570> video<00:01:43.810> games<00:01:43.869> I<00:01:44.290> guess<00:01:44.530> but<00:01:45.100> it

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
off topic for video games I guess but it

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.130 
off topic for video games I guess but it
says<00:01:45.490> what<00:01:45.969> is<00:01:46.060> your<00:01:46.180> favorite<00:01:46.630> kind<00:01:46.899> of

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
says what is your favorite kind of

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800 
says what is your favorite kind of
potato<00:01:47.590> chips<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:48.280> I'm<00:01:48.969> gonna<00:01:49.090> bend<00:01:49.689> the

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
potato chips and I'm gonna bend the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:50.999 
potato chips and I'm gonna bend the
rolls<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.170> this<00:01:50.320> one<00:01:50.469> a<00:01:50.500> little<00:01:50.619> bit<00:01:50.860> too

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
rolls on this one a little bit too

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.920 
rolls on this one a little bit too
because<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.579> guess<00:01:52.149> they're<00:01:52.329> not<00:01:52.450> technically

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
because I guess they're not technically

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.530 
because I guess they're not technically
potato<00:01:53.649> chips<00:01:53.979> but<00:01:54.520> my<00:01:54.670> favorite<00:01:55.060> my<00:01:55.509> favorite

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
potato chips but my favorite my favorite

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.480 
potato chips but my favorite my favorite
chips<00:01:56.110> would<00:01:56.439> be<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:58.000> barbecue<00:01:58.950> fritos<00:01:59.950> there

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
chips would be the barbecue fritos there

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
chips would be the barbecue fritos there
like<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.789> little<00:02:00.820> twisty<00:02:01.509> barbecue<00:02:02.049> frito

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.980 
like the little twisty barbecue frito
chips<00:02:02.770> and<00:02:03.039> I<00:02:03.909> guess<00:02:04.180> technically<00:02:04.659> there<00:02:04.960> are

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
chips and I guess technically there are

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.870 
chips and I guess technically there are
corn<00:02:05.320> chips<00:02:05.649> but<00:02:06.219> those<00:02:06.640> would<00:02:06.789> be<00:02:06.850> my

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
corn chips but those would be my

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.640 
corn chips but those would be my
favorite<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.479> if<00:02:07.539> I<00:02:07.659> had<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.320> stick<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:08.620> the

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:08.650 
favorite and if I had to stick to the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
cream and onion potato chips so that

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.170 
would be
that<00:02:13.689> answer<00:02:14.049> and<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.739> third<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.219> is<00:02:15.430> another
