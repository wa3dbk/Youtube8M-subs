00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
start by making a base of 14 so take

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.440 
start by making a base of 14 so take
three<00:00:09.750> pieces<00:00:10.040> and<00:00:11.040> put<00:00:11.940> them<00:00:11.969> together<00:00:12.269> like

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
three pieces and put them together like

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
three pieces and put them together like
this<00:00:14.570> I'm<00:00:15.570> going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.809> make<00:00:15.960> four<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> these<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
this I'm going to make four of these and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:33.340 
this I'm going to make four of these and
white<00:00:22.340> and<00:00:23.869> then<00:00:24.869> ten<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> these<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.500> black

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.060 

now<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.980> connect<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> white<00:00:35.550> ones<00:00:40.070> and

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
now can I now connect the white ones and

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
now can I now connect the white ones and
then<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> black<00:00:46.370> then<00:00:47.370> connect<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.820> into<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
then the black then connect them into a

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.930 
then the black then connect them into a
circle

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.760 

now<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> white<00:00:58.200> bit<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
now you can see the white bit is on a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.190 
now you can see the white bit is on a
slant<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.880> want<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> go<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.810> then<00:01:00.960> and

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
slant you want it to go out and then and

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.260 
slant you want it to go out and then and
so<00:01:01.770> where<00:01:01.950> it<00:01:02.040> goes<00:01:02.190> out<00:01:02.430> remove<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.060> last

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so where it goes out remove that last

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.150 
so where it goes out remove that last
piece<00:01:04.700> replace<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.910> black<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.890> where<00:01:08.100> it

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
piece replace with black and where it

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.460 
piece replace with black and where it
goes<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.550> you<00:01:08.880> want<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.120> to<00:01:09.240> go<00:01:09.360> out<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.380> you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
goes in you want it to go out so you

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.650

pieces you're going to add a row of
three<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.539> then<00:01:36.690> two

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.870 

now<00:01:45.920> fill<00:01:46.130> up<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.399> body<00:01:46.579> with<00:01:46.880> black

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
now you're going to add one inverted row

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.170 
now you're going to add one inverted row
instead<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.190> putting<00:02:08.399> a<00:02:08.490> piece<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.790> like<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
instead of putting a piece on like this

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.950 
instead of putting a piece on like this
turn<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.200> around<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.540> straight<00:02:12.780> side

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
turn it around so the straight side

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.900 
turn it around so the straight side
faces<00:02:13.320> you<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.710> just<00:02:14.190> used<00:02:14.370> white<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.790> could

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910
