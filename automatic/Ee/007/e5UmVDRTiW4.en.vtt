Good day, or night, or whatever it is now. I'm in nice town Ontario, California.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:22.140
We got to America just a couple of hours ago. Well, The Summit 2 starts on the next day.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:43.780
And we are just here. There were quite a hard days, DreamLeague finished on Saturday, so on Sunday at 6am we left Jönköping. 5 hours by bus to Stockholm, then 3 hours to Kyiv, so we arrived in Kyiv on Sunday at 6pm.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:55.300
And 6am on Monday - we fly to Los Angeles. Now we're tired, exhausted, however, during the flight Kyiv-Paris we met NS.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.860
He'll help us here in LA. So, our big and cheery crowd got on the 11-hours flight Paris-LA.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:17.540
It was fun, food was tasty, there was no space. Story of every long flight. Anyway, we're tired but we cannot sleep, because we're shooting this video at 5pm or something.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:28.980
Anyway, it's still early and we cannot sleep. But we desperately want to! Nevertheless, there are still few hours to stay awaken and we'll try to manage.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:37.420
