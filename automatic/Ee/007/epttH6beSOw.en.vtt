00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
iPhone right now okay so here's a case

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.249 
iPhone right now okay so here's a case
it's<00:01:26.580> not<00:01:26.729> 3d<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> oil<00:01:27.780> would<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.049> so

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's not 3d as that the oil would be so

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's not 3d as that the oil would be so
it's<00:01:28.380> not<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> hard<00:01:28.890> case<00:01:29.070> but<00:01:29.369> it's<00:01:29.579> still

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
it's not like a hard case but it's still

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.539 
it's not like a hard case but it's still
a<00:01:29.790> good<00:01:30.000> quality

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
a good quality

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.499 
a good quality
apparently<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> move<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.060> like<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.210> or

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
apparently if you move it like this or

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.880 
apparently if you move it like this or
something<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> arms<00:01:34.290> are<00:01:34.409> supposed<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> pop

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
something that arms are supposed to pop

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.149 
something that arms are supposed to pop
out<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:36.150> guess<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.540> okay<00:01:36.860> so<00:01:37.860> here's<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
out which I guess is okay so here's the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.660 
out which I guess is okay so here's the
back<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:39.210> pretty<00:01:39.750> cheap<00:01:40.079> quality<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.520> to

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
back it's pretty cheap quality I have to

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.039 
back it's pretty cheap quality I have to
say<00:01:41.820> compared<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.450> stitch<00:01:42.689> one<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
say compared to my stitch one that I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.740 
say compared to my stitch one that I
have<00:01:43.200> currently<00:01:43.670> my<00:01:44.670> stitch<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.329> actually

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
have currently my stitch one is actually

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
have currently my stitch one is actually
hard<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.640> easier<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> use<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.950> think<00:01:49.950> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
hard so it's easier to use I think this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
hard so it's easier to use I think this
is<00:01:50.399> actually<00:01:50.579> broken<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.930> okay<00:01:52.140> since

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
is actually broken but it's okay since

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.050 
is actually broken but it's okay since
it<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.680> three<00:01:52.860> ball<00:01:53.040> three<00:01:53.340> dollars<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it was on three ball three dollars in I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
it was on three ball three dollars in I
can't<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.630> complain<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:56.270> here's<00:01:57.270> your

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
can't really complain so here's your

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.560 
can't really complain so here's your
Akuma<00:01:57.930> case<00:01:58.310> if<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.430> were<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.670> rate<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.060> based

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
Akuma case if I were to rate it on based
