00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.060
 happy 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.219
 welcome to a new guide video 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.160
 because this time I bring you a 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.529
 new video or a tutorial for why x 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.779
 and well surely many of 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.910
 you will already know this trick or 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.029
 tutorial or whatever you want to call it but 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.170
 well, it never hurts to explain 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.529
 a video about him because there's always 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.019
 people who do not know it so good we go 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.640
 to see this video you get consists of 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.110
 change in our ability is 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.629
 pokemon to all those we can that 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.800
 I have a double ability but I do not mind 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.649
 I mean hidden ability 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.840
 when I say skills for example a 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
 pokÃ©mon that has besides the bible 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.989
 hidden two normal skills is good 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 for now I'm going to teach an example and 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.220
 everything but good the object of which I am 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.500
 speaking is called capsule skill and it 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.870
 get in the mansion battle for 200 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.640
 points for 200 points screen is the most 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.949
 everyone's face and it's this one that 's this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.110
 that is here in my case I already have a 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.550
 but we can see that it allows us 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.520
 change the skill to all those 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.479
 pokemon that they possess then be 22 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.729
 different skills for example let's 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.539
 to look at the screen below we are going to 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.630
 teach a soldier that I wanted came out 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.679
 perfect without co if everything but not me 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.110
 He came out with the skill that I wanted 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.450
 we can see that there is a shell but 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.360
 what I want is chained then 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.000
 so as not to keep raising what of the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.310
 capsule skill is the best I 'm going 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.830
 to teach for example we go to bag 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.259
 Its an object 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.700
 in the kit and it's down here and it 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.640
 call capsule skill as we can see 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.399
 what says capsule that allows them to change 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.950
 pokemon skills that possess two well 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.150
 I put use and now pulse on top of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.890
 helder 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.200
 and it tells me that you want it to be 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.030
 of going to be chained and that's 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.040
 perfect because it's very easy because it's 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.170
 go and that's it the skill has always been 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.190
 changed chained and we're going to verify 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.000
 this we go to pokemon helder data and 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.690
 let's see if it has changed 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.830
 chained and in effect there is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.170
 chained increase the frequency of 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.270
 multiple movements and that's how simple 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.270
 you have to follow can go opening 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.020
 real eggs that is a bit expensive 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.790
 about 200 battle points is pretty 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.070
 complicated to get but good never 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 it is of more to know is this option worth 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.110
 which is new in the sixth generation 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.490
 well here I say goodbye guys I hope 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.230
