00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
his final pokemon brandon giant go for

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.709 
his final pokemon brandon giant go for
the<00:05:09.889> hydro<00:05:10.129> pump<00:05:10.310> um<00:05:11.349> well<00:05:12.349> I<00:05:12.379> die<00:05:12.710> obviously

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 
the hydro pump um well I die obviously

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:16.779 
the hydro pump um well I die obviously
so<00:05:14.719> now<00:05:15.379> I<00:05:15.409> go<00:05:15.770> for<00:05:15.889> my<00:05:15.919> Norman<00:05:16.250> was<00:05:16.370> home<00:05:16.610> and

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
so now I go for my Norman was home and

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:18.490 
so now I go for my Norman was home and
he<00:05:16.849> goes<00:05:17.300> for<00:05:17.449> hydro<00:05:17.719> pump<00:05:17.839> so<00:05:18.050> that<00:05:18.080> means<00:05:18.379> he

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
he goes for hydro pump so that means he

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.550 
he goes for hydro pump so that means he
was<00:05:18.650> choice<00:05:18.919> backs<00:05:19.189> and<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:21.110> that's<00:05:21.259> why<00:05:21.409> he

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
was choice backs and so that's why he

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.809 
was choice backs and so that's why he
couldn't<00:05:21.740> go<00:05:21.860> for<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.039> ice<00:05:22.129> beam<00:05:22.400> if<00:05:22.610> not<00:05:22.789> I

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
couldn't go for the ice beam if not I

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.240 
couldn't go for the ice beam if not I
would<00:05:23.029> lost<00:05:23.360> but<00:05:24.139> since<00:05:24.650> he<00:05:24.710> was<00:05:24.830> choice<00:05:25.039> pecs

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
would lost but since he was choice pecs

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.339 
would lost but since he was choice pecs
he<00:05:26.089> missed<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.330> hydro<00:05:26.629> pump<00:05:26.779> even<00:05:27.169> though<00:05:27.229> I'm

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:27.349 
he missed the hydro pump even though I'm

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:29.350 
he missed the hydro pump even though I'm
pretty<00:05:27.379> sure<00:05:27.620> would<00:05:27.740> resist<00:05:28.069> hydro<00:05:28.430> pump<00:05:28.550> but

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
pretty sure would resist hydro pump but

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.610 
pretty sure would resist hydro pump but
anyway<00:05:29.599> I<00:05:29.629> go<00:05:29.839> for<00:05:29.960> the<00:05:30.020> dragon<00:05:30.259> media<00:05:30.409> hora<00:05:30.529> as
