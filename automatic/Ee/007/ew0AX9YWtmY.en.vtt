really cool and she's really amazing at
makeup<00:00:56.930> and<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.109> today<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> recreated<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.340> look

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
makeup and so today I recreated a look

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
makeup and so today I recreated a look
that<00:01:00.180> she<00:01:00.449> did<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.899> definitely<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.440> inspired

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that she did it definitely is inspired

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
that she did it definitely is inspired

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.690 
the crease a little deeper in the crease
than<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.260> did<00:04:36.440> with<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.710> first<00:04:36.740> colors<00:04:37.400> and

just kind of fluff that up into the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.940 
just kind of fluff that up into the
brown<00:04:41.360> color<00:04:41.690> so<00:04:42.050> it<00:04:42.170> blended<00:04:42.560> up<00:04:42.680> really

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
brown color so it blended up really

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.310 
brown color so it blended up really
nicely<00:04:43.160> and<00:04:43.700> sort<00:04:44.420> of<00:04:44.480> had<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.660> really<00:04:45.140> nice

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
nicely and sort of had a really nice

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.150 
nicely and sort of had a really nice
fade<00:04:45.650> from<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.430> gray<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.330> light<00:04:47.510> brown

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
fade from the gray to the light brown

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.100 
fade from the gray to the light brown
after<00:04:49.160> that<00:04:49.580> I<00:04:49.610> took<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.390> pressed<00:04:50.780> pigment

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
after that I took the pressed pigment

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.740

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
a 215 which as always like I say I

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.240 
a 215 which as always like I say I
really<00:04:59.720> recommend<00:05:00.230> getting<00:05:00.500> this<00:05:00.800> brush<00:05:01.070> to

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
really recommend getting this brush to

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.860 
really recommend getting this brush to
use<00:05:01.370> of<00:05:01.520> the<00:05:01.580> first<00:05:01.850> pigment<00:05:02.300> so<00:05:02.420> it<00:05:02.480> works<00:05:02.690> a

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
use of the first pigment so it works a

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.050 
use of the first pigment so it works a
lot<00:05:02.990> better<00:05:03.230> than<00:05:03.320> any<00:05:03.680> other<00:05:03.920> brush<00:05:04.160> I'm<00:05:04.820> just
