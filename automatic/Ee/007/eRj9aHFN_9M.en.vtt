now hitting when Hilary's came out one
of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> biggest<00:01:13.110> things<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.799> they

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
of the biggest things was that they

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
of the biggest things was that they
didn't<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> br<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.479> had<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.810> DMR<00:01:16.530> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
didn't have a br they had a DMR the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.820 
didn't have a br they had a DMR the
designated<00:01:17.280> marksman<00:01:18.270> rifle<00:01:18.439> and<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.680> of

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
designated marksman rifle and a lot of

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679 
designated marksman rifle and a lot of
people<00:01:19.979> were<00:01:20.369> very<00:01:20.430> skeptical<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.450> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
people were very skeptical about this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.899 
people were very skeptical about this
but<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> know<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.650> makes<00:01:22.860> sense<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> halo

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but you know it makes sense in the halo

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.899 
but you know it makes sense in the halo
like<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.650> was<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.189> prequel<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
like more that it was the prequel to

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.940 
like more that it was the prequel to
halo<00:01:27.240> 1<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:27.900> didn't<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.650> BR

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
halo 1 so they didn't have the BR

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.640 
halo 1 so they didn't have the BR
backhand<00:01:29.430> one<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.390> they<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.840> DMR<00:01:31.439> which

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
backhand one so they had the DMR which

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.580 
backhand one so they had the DMR which
is<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.540> don't<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.689> older<00:01:34.110> brother<00:01:34.470> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is the I don't know older brother I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.649 
is the I don't know older brother I
guess<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> BR<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.939> predecessor<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
guess to the BR it's the predecessor to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
guess to the BR it's the predecessor to
the<00:01:36.780> BR<00:01:37.170> if<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.439> will<00:01:38.030> and<00:01:39.229> a<00:01:40.229> lot<00:01:40.860> of<00:01:40.890> people

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
the BR if you will and a lot of people

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.770 
the BR if you will and a lot of people
were<00:01:41.310> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> skeptical<00:01:41.820> about<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.240> DMR<00:01:42.600> but

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
were kind of skeptical about the DMR but

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.910 
were kind of skeptical about the DMR but
after<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> while<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> know<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.439> got<00:01:43.560> used<00:01:43.770> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
after a while you know you got used to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
after a while you know you got used to
it<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.390> BMR<00:01:45.390> was<00:01:45.570> not<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> bad<00:01:45.930> gun<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.380> mean

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it the BMR was not a bad gun I mean

the<00:03:37.949> way<00:03:38.099> through<00:03:38.609> pushers<00:03:38.970> described<00:03:39.389> it<00:03:39.540> is

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
the way through pushers described it is

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.869 
the way through pushers described it is
they<00:03:39.810> say<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.229> the<00:03:40.409> BR<00:03:40.979> is<00:03:41.280> better<00:03:41.579> for<00:03:41.760> like

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
they say that the BR is better for like

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.599 
they say that the BR is better for like
close<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.750> mid-range<00:03:43.169> battles<00:03:43.919> and<00:03:44.129> the<00:03:44.190> DMR

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
close to mid-range battles and the DMR

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.729 
close to mid-range battles and the DMR
is<00:03:44.760> better<00:03:45.120> from<00:03:45.329> mid-to-long<00:03:46.109> range<00:03:46.139> battle

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
is better from mid-to-long range battle

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.289 
is better from mid-to-long range battle
so<00:03:46.889> which<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.129> tend<00:03:47.489> to<00:03:47.549> agree<00:03:47.609> with<00:03:47.970> with<00:03:48.209> the

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
so which I tend to agree with with the

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.750 
so which I tend to agree with with the
way<00:03:48.389> they<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.629> the<00:03:48.750> gun<00:03:48.900> setup<00:03:49.579> but<00:03:50.579> that's

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
way they have the gun setup but that's

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.909 
way they have the gun setup but that's
not<00:03:50.879> to<00:03:51.120> say<00:03:51.299> that<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.659> DMR<00:03:52.260> can't<00:03:52.620> kill

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
not to say that the DMR can't kill

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.189 
not to say that the DMR can't kill
people<00:03:53.280> at<00:03:53.370> close<00:03:53.609> range<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.269> mean<00:03:54.840> sure<00:03:55.049> it

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
people at close range I mean sure it

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.960 
people at close range I mean sure it
doesn't<00:03:55.500> put<00:03:55.650> out<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.919> bullets<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.669> BR

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
doesn't put out the bullets that the BR

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.789 
doesn't put out the bullets that the BR
does<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:57.900> still<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.319> can<00:03:58.470> spend<00:03:58.709> the

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.110 
does but it's still you can spend the
trigger<00:03:59.040> and<00:03:59.159> you<00:03:59.280> can<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.579> out<00:03:59.729> quite<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.030> few

think people will be using the BR more
when<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.940> game<00:04:43.150> first<00:04:43.180> comes<00:04:43.720> out<00:04:43.900> now<00:04:44.860> that

when the game first comes out now that
being<00:04:45.250> said<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.850> think<00:04:45.910> after<00:04:46.330> your<00:04:46.570> games<00:04:46.750> been

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.260 
being said I think after your games been
out<00:04:47.140> for<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.440> while<00:04:47.590> and<00:04:48.000> you're<00:04:49.000> gonna<00:04:49.120> have

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.880 
feel which ones they like and all that I
think<00:05:02.530> there<00:05:02.680> could<00:05:02.919> be<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.540> big<00:05:04.540> switch<00:05:04.900> from

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
think there could be a big switch from

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.130 
think there could be a big switch from
the<00:05:06.040> BR<00:05:06.400> to<00:05:06.669> the<00:05:06.760> DMR<00:05:07.240> now<00:05:07.720> there's<00:05:07.900> always

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
the BR to the DMR now there's always

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.870 
the BR to the DMR now there's always
going<00:05:08.260> to<00:05:08.320> be<00:05:08.380> those<00:05:08.530> kinds<00:05:08.860> of<00:05:08.919> just<00:05:09.220> be<00:05:09.669> our

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
going to be those kinds of just be our

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.790 
going to be those kinds of just be our
only<00:05:10.090> native<00:05:10.570> Slugger<00:05:10.900> BR<00:05:11.290> and<00:05:11.500> they're<00:05:11.650> never

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
only native Slugger BR and they're never

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.590 
only native Slugger BR and they're never
going<00:05:12.040> to<00:05:12.130> let<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.280> go<00:05:12.490> which<00:05:12.760> is<00:05:12.880> cool<00:05:13.060> how

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
going to let it go which is cool how

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.620 
going to let it go which is cool how
long<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:13.930> BR<00:05:14.550> I'm<00:05:15.550> just<00:05:15.940> saying<00:05:16.150> that<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.510> think

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
long the BR I'm just saying that I think

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.659 
long the BR I'm just saying that I think
personally<00:05:17.350> that<00:05:17.440> DMR<00:05:18.240> will<00:05:19.890> possibly<00:05:20.890> be<00:05:21.430> the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
personally that DMR will possibly be the

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.420 
personally that DMR will possibly be the
more<00:05:21.970> use<00:05:22.120> done<00:05:22.419> I'm<00:05:23.110> skeptical<00:05:23.979> to<00:05:24.070> say<00:05:24.220> that

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
more use done I'm skeptical to say that

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.800 
more use done I'm skeptical to say that
because<00:05:24.520> I<00:05:24.700> honestly<00:05:24.910> don't<00:05:25.360> know<00:05:25.479> I<00:05:25.570> haven't

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
because I honestly don't know I haven't

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.240 
because I honestly don't know I haven't
used<00:05:26.080> you<00:05:26.229> and<00:05:26.500> this<00:05:26.650> is<00:05:26.710> all<00:05:27.010> just

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
used you and this is all just

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.040 
used you and this is all just
speculation<00:05:27.340> from<00:05:28.090> videos<00:05:28.419> that<00:05:28.600> I<00:05:28.630> have<00:05:28.840> seen

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
speculation from videos that I have seen

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.950 
speculation from videos that I have seen
and<00:05:30.000> yeah<00:05:31.000> I'm<00:05:31.150> hoping<00:05:31.450> this<00:05:31.570> will<00:05:31.750> raise<00:05:31.900> a

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
and yeah I'm hoping this will raise a

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.719 
and yeah I'm hoping this will raise a
pretty<00:05:32.380> good<00:05:32.590> discussion<00:05:33.070> in<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:33.250> comments<00:05:33.669> I

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
pretty good discussion in the comments I

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.159 
pretty good discussion in the comments I
really<00:05:34.090> want<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.270> know<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.540> guys<00:05:34.690> think<00:05:34.930> kind

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
really want to know you guys think kind

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:36.960 
really want to know you guys think kind
of<00:05:35.260> subject<00:05:35.680> about<00:05:35.860> which<00:05:35.919> gun<00:05:36.400> is<00:05:36.640> better

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
of subject about which gun is better

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.640 
of subject about which gun is better
which<00:05:37.540> gun<00:05:37.750> you<00:05:37.960> guys<00:05:38.110> are<00:05:38.229> going<00:05:38.350> to<00:05:38.410> be<00:05:38.470> using

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
which gun you guys are going to be using

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:40.530 
which gun you guys are going to be using
on<00:05:38.860> launch<00:05:39.100> day<00:05:39.190> which<00:05:39.850> guns<00:05:40.120> you'll<00:05:40.360> think

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
on launch day which guns you'll think

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.050 
on launch day which guns you'll think
you'll<00:05:40.720> be<00:05:40.840> using<00:05:41.080> in<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:42.040> couple<00:05:42.460> months<00:05:42.640> after

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
you'll be using in a couple months after

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.700 
you'll be using in a couple months after
launch<00:05:43.210> day<00:05:43.510> um<00:05:45.450> you<00:05:46.450> know<00:05:46.630> let<00:05:47.229> me<00:05:47.320> let<00:05:47.620> me

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
launch day um you know let me let me

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.710 
launch day um you know let me let me
know<00:05:47.830> I'm<00:05:48.070> really<00:05:48.700> curious<00:05:49.060> to<00:05:49.270> find<00:05:49.360> out<00:05:49.660> i

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
know I'm really curious to find out i

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.600 
know I'm really curious to find out i
think<00:05:49.960> i<00:05:50.260> will<00:05:50.410> be<00:05:50.500> using<00:05:50.650> the<00:05:50.950> BR<00:05:51.130> for<00:05:51.550> the

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
think i will be using the BR for the

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.510 
think i will be using the BR for the
most<00:05:51.820> part<00:05:52.120> probably<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.500> DMR<00:05:53.950> on<00:05:54.070> bigger<00:05:54.250> map

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
most part probably the DMR on bigger map

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.310 
most part probably the DMR on bigger map
so<00:05:54.760> i<00:05:54.789> mean<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.510> just<00:05:55.690> makes<00:05:55.900> sense<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.229> be

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
so i mean it just makes sense to be

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.650 
so i mean it just makes sense to be
using<00:05:56.470> them<00:05:56.650> bigger<00:05:56.860> maps<00:05:57.130> but<00:05:57.430> like<00:05:57.610> I'm<00:05:58.330> apps

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
using them bigger maps but like I'm apps

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.880 
using them bigger maps but like I'm apps
like<00:05:58.960> home<00:05:59.260> oh<00:06:01.050> I'm<00:06:02.050> forgetting<00:06:02.470> map<00:06:02.650> names

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
like home oh I'm forgetting map names

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.990 
like home oh I'm forgetting map names
are<00:06:03.100> now

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
are now

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.070 
are now
like<00:06:05.000> this<00:06:05.150> map<00:06:05.360> that<00:06:05.540> they're<00:06:05.720> playing<00:06:05.930> on

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 
like this map that they're playing on

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.750 
like this map that they're playing on
right<00:06:06.230> now<00:06:06.260> vortex<00:06:06.800> this<00:06:06.980> is<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.220> good<00:06:07.400> deal<00:06:07.550> all

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
right now vortex this is a good deal all

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.120 
right now vortex this is a good deal all
mad<00:06:07.940> because<00:06:07.970> it<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.330> quite<00:06:08.540> a<00:06:08.570> big<00:06:08.780> map<00:06:09.080> but<00:06:10.010> on

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:10.130 
mad because it is quite a big map but on

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.070 
mad because it is quite a big map but on
smaller<00:06:10.490> maps<00:06:10.730> like<00:06:10.940> Haven<00:06:11.480> we're<00:06:11.750> sure<00:06:11.900> i'll

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
smaller maps like Haven we're sure i'll

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.280 
smaller maps like Haven we're sure i'll
be<00:06:12.110> using<00:06:12.350> the<00:06:12.560> DMR<00:06:13.010> or<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.970> BR<00:06:14.240> excuse<00:06:14.510> me<00:06:14.630> but
