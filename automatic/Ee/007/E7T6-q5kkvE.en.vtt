00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.569
 certainly 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.360
 the new types of treatment in the 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.220
 clinical practice is enough 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.080
 revolutionaries are fa 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.640
 because a way is administered 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.540
 rather simple that they have few 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:22.760
 immediate reactions on the web that 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:25.250
 the only commercial drug in this 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.689
 moment all over the world will shortly be 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.619
 commercial in the united states another 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.500
 drug that mechanization 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.180
 slightly different in melanoma but only 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.700
 therefore after treatment with ipilimumab 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.880
 in the coming months we can still see the GDP 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.140
 the names as the reference drug in 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.340
 first and second treatment line of the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.450
 melanoma can give reactions 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.040
 quite important kind of 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.450
 activation of immunity at the level of 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.010
 then gastrointestinal system of the 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.810
 policies that can be a problem 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.760
 for the sick and must know how to be 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.250
 managed with cortisone 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.750
 at rather high doses in the 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.030
 very large majority of cases yes 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.380
 they solve quite simply is 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.950
 clear that you have to have experience on 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.530
 this is because if one does not know this 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.150
 detail of having to use cortisone of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.829
 knowing how to manage the patient hydrate him 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.450
 etc. and sometimes also 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.759
 admit it in cases where the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.380
 situation worsens can be a 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.460
 problem however this is one 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.870
 manifestation of the minority of cases 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.090
 in most cases they are seen 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:29.060
 these these this disease that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.250
 initially it does not seem to regress but then 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.250
 or at 4 times it even seems to get worse 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.560
 but they are fake 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.780
 no improvements or deterioration because 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 then in a few months the mafia 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.580
 it stabilizes itself to begin to like and yes 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.280
 understands that this reaction is one 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.479
 reaction character of consequent to the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.020
 fact that the system cells 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.700
 immune go to infiltrate the masses 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.030
 tumor and then initially the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.010
 swell this is the fact is then 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.200
 what striking that after a year 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.390
 after two years after three patient years 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.750
 they are alive and well and have done 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.640
 a therapy that lasted two months e 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.270
 therefore a treatment that lasted little 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.830
 which can be comparable to a 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.560
 surgery that lasts a few 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.209
 now and if it works it heals a sick person in 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.370
 these cases exactly that lasts a few 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.560
 weeks can put the patient in 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.030
 conditions of having an illness below 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.430
 check for several years and this is it 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 the real novelty of these drugs is 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.810
 he said that in recent years oncology 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.760
 has achieved great progress and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:37.459
 it is true we discovered and put in 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.250
 marketed within a few years 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.350
 I would say a few months 45 drugs in tumors 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.680
 of the kidney that until a few years ago did not 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.019
 they had no drug 2 in tumors 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.510
 gastrointestinal type the gist he did not have 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.340
 no therapy 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.290
 antibodies in my breast cancer 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.659
 in colon cancer therefore definitely 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.099
 we had a large number of 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.650
 drugs that have begun to change 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.530
 the natural history of these diseases 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.019
 but this is the first time we have 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.599
 we see drugs that give a long time 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.430
 survival without progression 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.780
 disease and perhaps in some cases one 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
 healing in patients with the disease 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.069
 as severe as melanoma than when you 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.750
 presents presented in a manner 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.069
 widespread did not allow a planing 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.069
 over a few months for the sick
