 Hello 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.230
 and surely you hear a lot of echo because 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.599
 to play the wii we have to put 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.669
 super far and expensive I do not have any 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.099
 way to bring the microphone closer to the 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.020
 ordinates so that nothing is what is 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.340
 guys we do not have more mole I guess 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.310
 less echo will be heard and a 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.250
 little bit like before theory we knew 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.840

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.350
 so I've done an extra game today 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.140
 because if it does not always go also the 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.289
 first part of the videos with stones 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.289
 precious 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.070
 is that it is a red puzzle game of 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.399
 pool is clear that they are made to 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.399

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.120

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.850

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.980

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.969

 had is that I have time to see it if it is 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.819
 that moved it before but it's worth 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.500
 to take up as a gift to break 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.500
 to get better 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.800

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.690

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.090
 no no no 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.560
 but very rebellious 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.560
 good of what you want 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.099
 around 3 4 4 but there was no 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.099
 enough 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.340
 but because I call myself a cheat of not being 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.870
 as the subscribers who has a wife 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.739
 hacker with j 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.739
 Chan Chan 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.970
 because they dwell 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:45.030
 and has returned the lie 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.030
 to cheat 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 we are not going to false 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:04:01.250
 plus 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.250
 no no 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.890
 God 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.270
 we go 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.750
 come come come to ride gloves no 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.750
 before 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.550
 but as here 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.810
 it's not worth I want to close those that are 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.380
 at the table cut the table because not fair 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.639
 I want to close it 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.199
 the yellow 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.199
 to 0 him 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.840
 is here 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:56.260
 and this is where I'm going to get a little bit though 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.260
 not though we have the crap 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.340
 I stay with her 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:14.249
 what are you say champion 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:17.519
 come come and let me catch that I caught 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.610
 a piara caught prada bar and they touch 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:22.500
 plus 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.500
 because they are less of me 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.819
 and how do I think that closing it now yes tomato 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:51.000
 the denouement is because we see in cloud 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:54.860
 because today he is taking out too much already 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.860
 it's true that back was also without hands 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.360
 or two 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:02.129
 and in effect we are holding as 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.309
 champions 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:07.679
 You have to die because I have to die 

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:12.379
 because it 's in disgusting sadiq dynamic 

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:12.379
 you do not just have to die and fuck see 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.610
 ay ay ay 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.210
 what makes me that connected 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.430
 Of course you're going to catch the one you're going to 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.430
 pillar 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:36.889
 objective modernity girl you do not know no 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.889
 I know 

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.680
 with stars 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:49.569
 what according to my theory 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:55.740
 now you must edit what there is not 

00:06:52.719 --> 00:06:55.740
 something of his people 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.460
 teeny that 's basically because if 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.900
 we did not do the minigames we would be 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:14.080
 with time I the same part and the second 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:14.080
 first game from here 

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.430
 many many many already know what it is 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.520
 more common 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:30.199
 and see you in the video 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.199
 until other years
