00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.740
 new video review by hifi test thanks 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.099
 mp3 ipod and co is the mobile music 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.259
 listen to presenters today and more to a topic 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.539
 because but what do I do if I just 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.529
 not alone on my headphones 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.599
 but would like to enjoy my music 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.420
 together with others the Japanese 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.860
 manufacturer sharp has a like me 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.500
 find quite striking answer for im 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.520
 program namely the gx m10 and the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.610
 I want something from you today 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.100
 Imagine the gags M10 sees herself 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.540
 in the tradition of the boxer from the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.340
 eighties even if the design 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.570
 certainly has been significantly updated 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.090
 That may not be for everyone 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.980
 thing there you can argue about it 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.140
 However, is not disputed that there would be the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.490
 yes we are here a tremendously stable and 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.010
 solid construction have the whole thing 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.580
 taken together is a little over seven 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.050
 kilo 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.840
 that means I have in any case something in 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.000
 the hand or 7 on the shoulder when I 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.590
 on the way 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.820
 central element is the alpha dog here 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.800
 behind this well protected behind 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.970
 this flap 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.580
 we have a cd drive about it 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.530
 built next door and even a usb 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.790
 connection 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.170
 There is also a special feature too 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.300
 I can explain them that way for one thing 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.909
 use a usb sticks mp3 here 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.340
 files or wma files I can though 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.600
 also connecting my ipad is whole 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.370
 practically because logically, that fits 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.380
 ipad do not fold this flap when i am 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.500
 that with the normal dog connector 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.150
 here afterwards ipad also as 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.560
 Use music weather and therefore the good 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.970
 piece in the grass not easier with the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.050
 park volumes also represented one 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.750
 convenient holder for the device 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.010
 we also have rds capable and ukw radio 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.140
 save with 40 stations 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.940
 and if that's not enough music yet 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.950
 I should also be able to mine 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.850
 connect guitar and microphone and 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.850
 make music yourself 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.549
 that goes either solo or together with 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.900
 the music of any audio source 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.049
 something very practical for practicing 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.049
 is 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:11.940
 at home I run the gxr p10 all the way 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.700
 normal on a power cord to the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.200
 On the way I can go 10 large 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.019
 batteries used then for some 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.970
 hours of music track has measured more than 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.970
 reasonable volume even listen 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.950
 can and a connection for a 12 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.160
 volt adapter cable so for example in the 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.080
 Car use is also driving who now 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.390
 the gags m10 would be especially show 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.019
 and nothing behind it sees itself 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.180
 deceived 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.310
 this modern interpretation of the boom 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.700
 box with the name absolutely fair and 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.230
 can really loud really loud 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.549
 The manufacturer gives 1250 watts 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.340
 total performance to that is certainly 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.599
 clearly exaggerated but overall 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.700
 there is already an achievement here 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.329
 The fall in love with the mobile 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.650
 use is more than sufficient 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.120
 Shortly to the construction we have two broadband 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.579
 to radiate each forward 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.989
 on the sides two woofers the 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.450
 By the way, also lit are what a 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.090
 nice plant effect gives the whole leads 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.260
 course to a bit basslastigen 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.370
 sound is the whole but so 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.019
 that's really not true 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.120
 exaggerated is I'm also six 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.069
 different equalizer presets with those 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.620
 we adjust the whole thing a bit 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.700
 can and the gags m10 mastered just 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.799
 even the soft tones 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.819
 but when I turn on then comes 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.780
 just right, what a short out 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.790
 word of service 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.090
 I can actually do all the functions 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.299
 select sources directly on the device 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.040
 playback control goes further afield 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.500
 it stops with the remote control in the 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.540
 scope of delivery is included 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.160
 summarized points the gags m10 just 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.150
 not just with a distinctive design and 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.090
 gimmicks like the lit ones 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.859
 bass speaker but also with 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 a great flexibility and a 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:53.160
 excellent quality from the radio over 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.959
 the cd all the way to ipad and ipod i can 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.510
 Listening to music on the go, just like at home 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.169
 i can connect my guitar and 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.310
 make music yourself and above all 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.870
 really have a lot of fun 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.130
 at least I had one during the test 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.760
 lots of fun and i hope you can 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.560
 just like that 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.650
 Thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.650
 next 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.509
