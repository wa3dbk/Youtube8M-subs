good I have tied onto the additional
garage<00:03:14.590> I<00:03:14.620> got<00:03:14.890> two<00:03:15.070> pipes<00:03:15.520> on<00:03:15.700> three<00:03:15.850> so<00:03:16.030> I

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
garage I got two pipes on three so I

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.610 
garage I got two pipes on three so I
figured<00:03:16.300> it'd<00:03:16.390> be<00:03:16.630> too<00:03:16.750> much<00:03:16.780> water<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.410> have

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
figured it'd be too much water to have

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.110 
figured it'd be too much water to have
three<00:03:17.860> years<00:03:18.040> into<00:03:18.190> one<00:03:18.280> pipe<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:18.850> I<00:03:18.880> had<00:03:19.060> to

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
three years into one pipe so I had to

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.450 
three years into one pipe so I had to
run<00:03:19.390> another<00:03:19.570> gutter<00:03:19.810> down<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.320> woods<00:03:20.530> but

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
run another gutter down to the woods but

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.860 
run another gutter down to the woods but
uh<00:03:21.490> this<00:03:21.850> right<00:03:21.970> here<00:03:22.120> is<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.510> hill<00:03:22.690> so

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
uh this right here is all on the hill so

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.390 
uh this right here is all on the hill so
I<00:03:22.930> actually<00:03:23.050> have<00:03:23.290> takes<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.590> good<00:03:24.010> bit<00:03:24.130> of<00:03:24.160> dirt

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
I actually have takes a good bit of dirt

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.700 
I actually have takes a good bit of dirt
and<00:03:24.640> kind<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:24.910> mound<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.240> up<00:03:25.300> against<00:03:25.660> there<00:03:25.810> up

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
and kind of mound it up against there up

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.260 
and kind of mound it up against there up
against<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.160> ledge<00:03:27.670> wall<00:03:27.880> there<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.180> way

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
against that ledge wall there that way

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.290 
against that ledge wall there that way
the<00:03:28.330> water<00:03:28.600> and<00:03:29.550> can<00:03:30.550> just<00:03:30.760> run<00:03:30.940> down<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.270> the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
the water and can just run down to the

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.820 
the water and can just run down to the
woods<00:03:31.570> it'd<00:03:31.780> be<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:31.930> kind<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.440> like<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.620> nice
