this<00:02:17.000> is<00:02:17.269> the<00:02:19.060> cluster<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:21.549> gears<00:02:22.549> are<00:02:22.849> first

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
this is the cluster the gears are first

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.929 
this is the cluster the gears are first
up<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.349> off<00:02:24.530> five<00:02:24.950> other<00:02:25.310> gears<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:25.909> done<00:02:27.939> I'm
