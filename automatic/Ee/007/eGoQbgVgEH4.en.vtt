how I in case a glass bead using this
wonderful<00:00:12.950> large<00:00:14.540> diameter<00:00:15.740> CIN<00:00:16.740> creation<00:00:17.520> is

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
wonderful large diameter CIN creation is

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.109 
wonderful large diameter CIN creation is
messy<00:00:18.090> clear<00:00:19.010> I'm<00:00:20.010> gonna<00:00:20.220> start<00:00:20.580> by<00:00:20.699> making<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
messy clear I'm gonna start by making a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.080 
messy clear I'm gonna start by making a
base<00:00:21.330> beads<00:00:21.689> while<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:21.990> talk<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.590> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
base beads while I talk about it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.740 
base beads while I talk about it
the<00:00:25.189> problem<00:00:26.689> with<00:00:27.689> 104<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.010> clear<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.880> that

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
the problem with 104 and clear is that

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.380 
the problem with 104 and clear is that
the<00:00:30.929> morretti<00:00:31.320> clear<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.160> extremely<00:00:33.030> dirty

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the morretti clear is extremely dirty

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.630 
the morretti clear is extremely dirty
and<00:00:35.030> scummy<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:37.290> hardly<00:00:37.800> worth<00:00:38.040> using

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
and scummy and it's hardly worth using

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.410 
and scummy and it's hardly worth using
the<00:00:39.890> alternatives<00:00:40.890> are<00:00:41.219> hard<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.760> come<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
the alternatives are hard to come by and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.950 
the alternatives are hard to come by and
expensive<00:00:43.280> when<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.640> exception<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
expensive when the exception of the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.580 
expensive when the exception of the
creation<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.800> messy<00:00:47.550> clear<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.719> is<00:00:48.750> really

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
creation is messy clear which is really

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.080 
creation is messy clear which is really
very<00:00:49.950> clear<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.910> excellent<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.370> clean<00:00:53.370> glass

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
very clear and excellent and clean glass

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
very clear and excellent and clean glass
so<00:00:54.989> I'm<00:00:55.590> just<00:00:55.860> gonna<00:00:55.949> make<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> small<00:00:56.520> base<00:00:56.820> bead

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
so I'm just gonna make a small base bead

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.479 
so I'm just gonna make a small base bead
but<00:00:57.989> here's<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> thing<00:00:58.440> our<00:00:58.829> friends<00:00:59.190> at<00:00:59.309> wale

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
but here's the thing our friends at wale

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.540 
but here's the thing our friends at wale
are<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.510> carrying<00:01:01.170> creation<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.890> messy<00:01:02.129> clear

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
are now carrying creation is messy clear

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.160 
are now carrying creation is messy clear
in<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.329> large<00:01:03.780> diameter<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> reason<00:01:07.020> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
in a large diameter and the reason that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
in a large diameter and the reason that
you<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.920> large<00:01:08.159> diameter<00:01:10.340> glass<00:01:11.340> for

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you want a large diameter glass for

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.170 
you want a large diameter glass for
encasement<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:16.310> will<00:01:17.310> cover<00:01:17.790> your

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
encasement is that it will cover your

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
encasement is that it will cover your
base<00:01:18.630> bead<00:01:19.430> without<00:01:20.810> your<00:01:21.810> colors<00:01:22.320> seeping

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
base bead without your colors seeping

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.969 
base bead without your colors seeping
through<00:01:22.920> around<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> edges<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> it'll<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
through around the edges and it'll do it

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.080 
through around the edges and it'll do it
in<00:01:26.189> one<00:01:26.549> full<00:01:27.330> swoop<00:01:27.860> and<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.700> it

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
in one full swoop and here it is and it

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.920 
in one full swoop and here it is and it
comes<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.540> an<00:01:30.930> 8<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.369> 10<00:01:32.790> millimeter<00:01:33.479> rod

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
comes about an 8 to 10 millimeter rod

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.700 
comes about an 8 to 10 millimeter rod
and<00:01:36.760> what<00:01:37.760> I<00:01:37.790> do<00:01:37.940> after<00:01:38.450> I<00:01:38.690> make<00:01:38.930> my<00:01:39.110> bass<00:01:39.350> beat

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
and what I do after I make my bass beat

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.430 
and what I do after I make my bass beat
is<00:01:39.920> I<00:01:40.550> keep<00:01:40.850> it<00:01:41.030> warm<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:41.750> outer<00:01:41.930> flames

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
is I keep it warm in the outer flames

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.790 
is I keep it warm in the outer flames
see<00:01:42.800> that<00:01:43.010> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.090> take<00:01:44.810> my<00:01:44.840> creation<00:01:45.710> is

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
see that and then I take my creation is

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.340 
see that and then I take my creation is
messy<00:01:46.220> clear<00:01:46.550> and<00:01:48.400> heat<00:01:49.400> up<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.700> gather<00:01:50.350> and

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
messy clear and heat up a gather and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.350 
messy clear and heat up a gather and
we're<00:01:52.250> gonna<00:01:52.370> use<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.790> fast<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.330> furious

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
we're gonna use the fast and furious

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.790 
we're gonna use the fast and furious
method<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:55.460> when<00:01:56.180> I<00:01:56.210> get<00:01:56.570> a<00:01:56.600> gather<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.229> good<00:01:57.530> I

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
method and when I get a gather a good I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.550 
method and when I get a gather a good I
don't<00:01:58.160> know<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:59.270> size<00:01:59.510> of<00:01:59.660> a<00:02:00.040> large<00:02:01.090> P<00:02:02.560> over

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
don't know the size of a large P over

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.469 
don't know the size of a large P over
here<00:02:03.590> I'm<00:02:04.400> gonna<00:02:05.180> then<00:02:05.540> shift<00:02:06.440> the<00:02:06.590> rod<00:02:06.920> down

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
here I'm gonna then shift the rod down

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.860 
here I'm gonna then shift the rod down
onto<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:09.320> base<00:02:09.530> bead<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.250> use<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.300> rod<00:02:11.570> to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
onto the base bead and use the rod to

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.960 
onto the base bead and use the rod to
push<00:02:12.200> the<00:02:12.530> glass<00:02:12.830> down<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:14.350> around<00:02:15.790> once<00:02:16.790> you

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
push the glass down and around once you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.690 
push the glass down and around once you
get<00:02:17.209> that<00:02:17.390> first<00:02:17.810> coating<00:02:18.230> on<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:19.190> can<00:02:19.370> put<00:02:19.580> as

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
get that first coating on you can put as

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.850 
get that first coating on you can put as
many<00:02:19.910> layers<00:02:20.270> on<00:02:20.630> top<00:02:20.660> as<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> want<00:02:21.530> to

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
many layers on top as you want to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.810 
many layers on top as you want to
enlarger<00:02:22.520> B<00:02:23.680> encasement<00:02:24.680> intensifies<00:02:25.610> your

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
enlarger B encasement intensifies your

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.120 
enlarger B encasement intensifies your
colors<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:28.060> magnifies<00:02:29.060> your<00:02:29.450> design<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.350> it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
colors it magnifies your design and it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.010 
colors it magnifies your design and it
also<00:02:31.310> gives<00:02:31.730> your<00:02:31.910> bead<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.180> great<00:02:32.690> deal<00:02:32.989> of

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
also gives your bead a great deal of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.500 
also gives your bead a great deal of
death<00:02:35.530> okay<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.760> don't<00:02:37.820> have<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.360> go

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
death okay and so I don't have to go

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.539 
death okay and so I don't have to go
around<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.050> edges<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.680> this<00:02:39.800> is<00:02:39.950> important

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
around the edges and this is important

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.199 
around the edges and this is important
in<00:02:41.060> case<00:02:41.120> you're<00:02:41.570> using<00:02:41.600> evil<00:02:42.380> purple<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.209> you

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
in case you're using evil purple and you

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.949 
in case you're using evil purple and you
have<00:02:44.450> glass<00:02:44.840> that's<00:02:45.110> gonna<00:02:45.320> do<00:02:45.560> vitrify

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
have glass that's gonna do vitrify

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.479 
have glass that's gonna do vitrify
around<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.140> edges<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:48.590> we've<00:02:48.769> got<00:02:48.950> a<00:02:48.980> clean

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
around the edges so we've got a clean
