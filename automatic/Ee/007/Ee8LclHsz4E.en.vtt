one is and I was concerned that the
wooden<00:00:59.399> cover<00:00:59.760> plates<00:01:00.149> would<00:01:00.620> darken<00:01:01.620> or

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
wooden cover plates would darken or

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
wooden cover plates would darken or
dampen<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.600> tone<00:01:03.809> too<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.350> but<00:01:04.650> that's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
dampen the tone too much but that's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.830 
dampen the tone too much but that's
actually<00:01:05.400> not<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> case<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:06.270> play<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.659> for

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
