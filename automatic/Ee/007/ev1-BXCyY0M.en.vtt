really upset about sorting into

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.440 
really upset about sorting into
hufflepuff<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.460> I<00:00:11.490> thought<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.150> make<00:00:12.389> a

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
hufflepuff so I thought I would make a

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.990 
hufflepuff so I thought I would make a
video<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:13.080> defense<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:13.620> half<00:00:13.799> bath<00:00:14.099> now<00:00:14.549> before

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
video in defense of half bath now before

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.490 
video in defense of half bath now before
I<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.420> will<00:00:15.450> admit<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.139> used<00:00:16.379> to

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
I do this I will admit that I used to

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
I do this I will admit that I used to
consider<00:00:16.859> myself<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.340> ravenclaw<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.210> was

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
consider myself a ravenclaw this was

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
consider myself a ravenclaw this was
more<00:00:18.510> out<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.690> convenience<00:00:18.930> however<00:00:19.560> because

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
more out of convenience however because

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.560 
more out of convenience however because
I<00:00:20.130> owned<00:00:20.279> lots<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.670> blue<00:00:20.789> clothing<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.330> Luna

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
I owned lots of blue clothing and Luna

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.300 
I owned lots of blue clothing and Luna
was<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> my<00:00:22.050> favorite<00:00:22.410> characters<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.279> I

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
was one of my favorite characters so I

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.429 
was one of my favorite characters so I
figured<00:00:23.430> why<00:00:24.359> not<00:00:24.390> dress<00:00:24.660> up<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:24.960> Luna<00:00:25.140> even

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
figured why not dress up as Luna even

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.830 
figured why not dress up as Luna even
though<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.010> not<00:00:26.550> blonde<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.330> whatever<00:00:27.480> I

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
though this not blonde but whatever I

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.169 
though this not blonde but whatever I
did<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> anyway<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:28.859> cool<00:00:29.189> however

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
did it anyway that was cool however

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.110 
did it anyway that was cool however
about<00:00:30.900> two<00:00:31.199> years<00:00:31.349> ago<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.250> started

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
about two years ago or so I started

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.819 
about two years ago or so I started
having<00:00:33.510> my<00:00:33.690> doubts<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:34.230> whether<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.590> was<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
having my doubts about whether I was a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.010 
having my doubts about whether I was a
ravenclaw<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.969> fairly<00:00:36.390> intelligent<00:00:36.690> I'll

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
ravenclaw I'm fairly intelligent I'll

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
ravenclaw I'm fairly intelligent I'll
admit<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.219> began<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.149> think<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.360> maybe

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
admit it but I began to think that maybe

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
admit it but I began to think that maybe
I<00:00:39.750> didn't<00:00:40.110> belong<00:00:40.320> in<00:00:40.530> ravenclaw<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.760> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
I didn't belong in ravenclaw I like to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.030 
I didn't belong in ravenclaw I like to
learn<00:00:42.059> but<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:43.379> much<00:00:43.440> out<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.770> just

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
learn but it's not so much out of just

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.770 
learn but it's not so much out of just
the<00:00:44.129> pure<00:00:44.399> intellectual<00:00:45.149> part<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.600> it's

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the pure intellectual part of it it's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.360 
the pure intellectual part of it it's
that<00:00:45.899> I'm<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> hard<00:00:46.289> worker<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:46.980> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
that I'm a hard worker and I know that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.650 
that I'm a hard worker and I know that
learning<00:00:47.730> will<00:00:47.850> get<00:00:47.969> me<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> where<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.390> want<00:00:48.629> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
learning will get me to where I want to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
learning will get me to where I want to
be<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.960> life<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:49.829> started<00:00:50.370> putting<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
be in life so I started putting the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.760 
be in life so I started putting the
pieces<00:00:50.789> together<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.750> figured<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
pieces together and I figured out that I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.350 
pieces together and I figured out that I
would<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.250> rather<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.670> in<00:00:53.789> bothell<00:00:54.180> path

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
would really rather be in bothell path

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.270 
would really rather be in bothell path
why<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.320> want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> half<00:00:56.070> full

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
why would you want to be in half full

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.180 
why would you want to be in half full
path<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.850> mean<00:00:57.750> seriously<00:00:58.190> hufflepuffs<00:00:59.190> are

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
path I mean seriously hufflepuffs are

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
path I mean seriously hufflepuffs are
totally<00:00:59.820> lame<00:01:00.059> let<00:01:00.690> me<00:01:00.780> list<00:01:00.989> some<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
totally lame let me list some of the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
totally lame let me list some of the
reasons<00:01:01.590> why<00:01:01.739> half<00:01:01.890> above<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> best<00:01:02.699> first

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
reasons why half above is the best first

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.660 
reasons why half above is the best first
of<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.840> by<00:01:04.320> far<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> best<00:01:05.309> common
