00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.750
 she is the specialist of the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.250
 revaluation of morals bhl is made 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.140
 to four pins they share 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.570
 all this stuff and yes because that's 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.610
 daniel ruel hello I always come to 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.100
 niort today you will teach us to 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.289
 create ourselves the facts as well as 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.660
 the appearance in tic will be furniture yes with 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.699
 always chalk painting and that's 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.710
 with the fact that the sech quickly 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.600
 that she will crackle and with the sites 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.370
 bright and dark we will give the rental 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.230
 and that 's what we want to create today 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.750
 exactly what it looks like on a 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.120
 little board I made a floor 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.540
 of mdf with two layers of paint 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.579
 I played with the thick gmi brush of 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.739
 painting with the dryer crackled effect 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.329
 and I did work I worked 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.950
 the two cyr together and that's what I 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.540
 will show you and we'll start with 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.280
 work on this board must 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.500
 first apply the paint yes he 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.469
 must choose a light enough color yes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.920
 in the color ranges of anise 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.070
 long 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.530
 the cracked fai gives himself reacts better 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.170
 with the painting that is perhaps clear 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.920
 because of the pigments I noticed with 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.259
 tests that black and blue colors 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.380
 the red reacted - where the shows 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.849
 so we go with the painting yes and I 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.909
 think that it is necessary to apply a good 

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:23.529
 layer so we're embarrassed taxes it's a 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.990
 big brush that really takes 

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:28.569
 much like quantity the little tension 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.439
 too much breakaway on the beautiful table 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.189
 so we apply here like that 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.139
 generously is a way 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.119
 to apply we go yes but in fact 

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:38.560
 that's the effect that wanted to give that 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.779
 depends you can crack 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.789
 like that eh uncross excuse like that 

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:45.009
 and the important thing is to do it 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:47.109
 small parts in small parts 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.459
 ok because the time that painting 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:50.439
 dry sometimes it's too late to 

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:52.090
 give them crack and technique 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.369
 of his charges made with a single choice 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.649
 whose daughter an anecdote related to 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.940
 I knew that anne island that had 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.190
 invented the painting of v 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.470
 delivered a piece of furniture in 45 minutes that was 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.210
 not over and at the last layer to 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.400
 the audio I 'm going to do with the dryer that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.890
 will dry quickly and it gives him a 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.690
 cracked effect at the world indoor 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.000
 but it's so beautiful it's like that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.760
 it became the crackle effect well 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 so really of devourer 9 the good ones 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.640
 ideas we talk about minimal dryers and we 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.850
 exactly how are you 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.190
 and after a while the painting goes 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 dry quickly and that's where we go 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.320
 see appear all the effect of the 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.380
 treatment 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.390
 yes we start to see it but we will 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.830
 see of course on the other boards where he 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.750
 how long has it been for 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.600
 let it dry around but we'll see it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.250
 while it's going to crack that paint 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.810
 will change color too with the 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.700
 drying time has redone and this is where 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.160
 we will see here the crackled effect 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.830
 hardly see right now because the 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.190
 painting she is very bad and that's where 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.530
 where here we see the added Acea if 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.250
 circular of the earth makes a layer 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 protection 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.410
 yes exactly because when we are going to put 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.510
 the wax melts it changes the pigment 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.730
 or the color of the painting and it's this 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.880
 we do not want and we really want that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.350
 our color here which is the one colors 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.780
 one wants to keep it 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.489
 if we put the dark wax it will become 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.010
 brown then we will lose our color 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:24.980
 so here have terminated 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.730
 the api tomorrow but that's what gives the 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.010
 antique look 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.440
 ok this is really all coups 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:36.590
 yes and here we will apply here agree 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.170
 like that we apply generously we 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.630
 make sure to rub in circles like this and 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.800
 it's going to make sure that dark wax 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.570
 will go back to the Lankan nurseries and 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.400
 once again we know 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.450
 choice not because it's only 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.600
 for painting 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.630
 ok there circus is a wax based 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.880
 beeswax and it just needs 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.090
 to be wiped like that but we see 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.459
 young people yes 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.980
 look at it's start your game the one 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:11.760
 here and there the trick is to reapply 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.000
 here also another layer of clear wax 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.829
 you can really have fun with the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.019
 possibilities because when we re 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.120
 apply the sirc the looks we find 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.940
 the color of lembach and it's only 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.240
 in the cracks we will find the 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:30.560
 dark wax then according to one wants a 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.180
 furniture lighter we have in addition you 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.510
 exactly because it's too strand 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.889
 remove the brown with another layer 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.970
 circuit is what there are 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.800
 techniques of things not to do 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.360
 not necessarily attention but I 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.850
 do not think no because she is working 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.860
 so much the paint-based 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.470
 create the very opaque that na li was 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.650
 quickly and then are what is 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.450
 easy to go back a bit and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.220
 since we do not need to 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.760
 sand and we do not need a master 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.860
 printer 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.870
 that makes it possible that one could 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.460
 apply another coat of paint to 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.800
 the cream even over the wax and 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.690
 salaberry and faber simply the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.479
 smile end ending tania is 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.130
 dany sloan painting in iceland that you 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.720
 will meet at half mast a government 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 she came to a tower in Montreal 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.620
 came to meet so stockists and 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.300
 I had the chance to meet her on 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.280
 I love working with this painting 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.080
 there they were invented bike 23 years 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.610
 because when she was younger 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.349
 she had three children she wanted 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.389
 do things that go fast that 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.099
 listen very little because with a 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.599
 pint we can do two furniture we fly 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.289
 to dilute that ol this work 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.210
 so well 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.710
 so it was an honor for me 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.330
 to meet the very little known at 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.979
 quebec 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.550
 yes it's to iceland just 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.919
 england 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.660
 she is a little better known in France and 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.610
 she feels good here more in america the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:51.330
 north we start to know it and we 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.990
 discover it thanks to you podiums and in 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.830
 two weeks 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.210
 what are we going to do in two 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.669
 weeks I will teach you how to do 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.240
 an image transfer on furniture then 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.870
 you see pass 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.870
 Yes thanks
