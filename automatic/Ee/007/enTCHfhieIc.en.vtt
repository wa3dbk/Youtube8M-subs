00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:30.440 
so so this four side will be equal
distance<00:01:25.610> so<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:26.820> we<00:01:27.750> have<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:29.450> papers

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
distance so now we have this papers

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
those exact same size

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.220 
those exact same size
but<00:01:34.960> just<00:01:35.230> we<00:01:35.710> want<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.160> have<00:01:36.340> one<00:01:36.760> side

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
but just we want to have one side

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.890 
but just we want to have one side
smaller<00:01:38.230> than<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.980> other<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:40.270> in<00:01:40.660> our

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
smaller than the other because in our

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.700 
smaller than the other because in our
side<00:01:41.490> box<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:45.280> be<00:01:45.460> slightly<00:01:46.090> smaller

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
side box is should be slightly smaller

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.740 
side box is should be slightly smaller
leave<00:01:47.710> it's<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:48.070> slightly<00:01:48.520> smaller<00:01:48.970> that's

what we want so again fold it and then

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
what we want so again fold it and then
turn<00:01:55.090> this<00:01:55.650> maybe<00:01:57.390> half<00:01:58.390> centimeter<00:01:59.550> also<00:02:01.590> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
turn this maybe half centimeter also so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.380 
turn this maybe half centimeter also so
like<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:04.000> and<00:02:04.690> trim<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.530> part<00:02:05.890> off<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:07.180> you
