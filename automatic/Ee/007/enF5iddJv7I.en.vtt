00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:04.859
 As Werner Klemm in the mid-80s the Hotel GlÃ¼ckauf at Auntie was so 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.440
 A lot of Berne took it that you have not heard of today's street noise 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.410
 At most, windows had to be passed because of the smell of the now and then 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.169
 Keep two-stroke engine closed 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.570
 but today the road from the hotel has become a race track accidents 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.349
 not infrequently and for the guests it is cross-dangerous across the street too 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:23.029
 come 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.419
 probably so the hotelier needs someone to die 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.169
 so that the authorities trade 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.569
 during her education at Dipl-ing 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.940
 It can take up to fifteen minutes 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.940
 in the parking lot of the hotel bought to leave 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.720
 The house is right on the main road 101 with transfer to 4 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.890
 very close to the cars over here often with more than allowed 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.890
 100 km / h 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.000
 the older one becomes the keeper that does not have to be it's easier than ever 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.690
 the director appointed 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.350
 Werner Kleeman has been fighting for a speed limit for many years 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 his house all attempts are futile 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.560
 There were costs from the authorities for who wants a speed limit 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.910
 makes one request on Sicily 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.390
 you have to think twice 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.340
 I'm not going to let it go and it's about the public 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.480
 security 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.070
 The sports hotel is popular so close 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.850
 Fitness club swimming pool everything available 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.840
 only the approach is cross-dangerous only recently it has here again 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.740
 crashed 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.420
 While turning, Susanne Herklotz was rammed off the road with her car 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.420
 a car that just wanted to overtake 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.380
 between goods and Plau 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 have taken both prices seen on my occasion, the demanded 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.420
 become 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.810
 that here obviously like to raced is also known to the city administration 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.259
 therefore, the authority had these signs set up a tempo-limit though 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.720
 are not enforceable because officially the site is not an accident priority 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.670
 is a section of road thereby 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.530
 When they arrived, they quickly introduced friends 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.360
 and every place the author has a speed limit before Fender 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.540
 So the book should feel like a skier somewhere because he knows 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.129
 open form can and where not 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.929
 In any case, Werner Klemm gives 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 the hope not on the mayor has promised him 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.929
 have checked whether a reduction in the maximum speed 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:25.510
 is feasible
