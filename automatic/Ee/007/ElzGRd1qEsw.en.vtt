cheap and it looks like something I

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.400 
cheap and it looks like something I
might<00:00:46.980> be<00:00:47.399> interested<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.329> why<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.230> just

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
might be interested in so why not just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380 
might be interested in so why not just
give<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.680> a<00:00:49.770> try<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> says<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.670> most<00:00:50.879> popular

I'm a big fan of a lot of things from
the<00:00:56.730> 90s<00:00:57.120> because<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.809> when<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> grew<00:00:58.440> up<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
the 90s because that's when I grew up so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.130 
the 90s because that's when I grew up so
I<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.430> lot<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> those<00:00:59.940> old<00:01:00.239> cartoons<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
I like a lot of those old cartoons and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
I like a lot of those old cartoons and
everything<00:01:01.500> like<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.160> looking<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.180> some

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
everything like that and looking at some

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
everything like that and looking at some
of<00:01:03.420> these<00:01:03.660> images<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> back<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.799> seems

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
of these images on the back it seems

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.330 
of these images on the back it seems
like<00:01:05.540> just<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.720> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.110> cartoon<00:01:07.590> animated

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
like just that kind of cartoon animated

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.359 
like just that kind of cartoon animated
style<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.270> um<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.890> means<00:01:11.189> it's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
style so um not that that means it's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.160 
style so um not that that means it's
going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:12.030> really<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:12.869> anything

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
going to be like really good or anything

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to be like really good or anything
but<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:13.950> thinking<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.390> um

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
but I'm thinking you know it's just um

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.140 
but I'm thinking you know it's just um
it<00:01:16.650> looks<00:01:16.890> like<00:01:17.070> something<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.520> might<00:01:18.000> be

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
it looks like something that might be

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
it looks like something that might be
worth<00:01:18.330> checking<00:01:18.689> out<00:01:18.900> especially<00:01:19.170> when<00:01:19.500> it's

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
worth checking out especially when it's

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.850 
worth checking out especially when it's
such<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> cheap<00:01:20.250> price<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:21.320> here<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.439> has<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
such a cheap price so here it has the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.620 
such a cheap price so here it has the
description<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> everything<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.210> has<00:01:24.330> some

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
description and everything it has some

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.149 
description and everything it has some
of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.070> voice<00:01:26.070> actors<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.610> everything<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
of the voice actors and everything so

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
of the voice actors and everything so
that's<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:29.430> cool

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
that's pretty cool

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.140 
that's pretty cool
taking<00:01:31.380> a<00:01:31.470> look<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> bottom<00:01:32.220> run<00:01:32.759> time<00:01:33.000> is

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
taking a look at the bottom run time is

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
taking a look at the bottom run time is
10<00:01:33.420> hours<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> 41<00:01:34.470> minutes<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.189> was

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
10 hours and 41 minutes and that was

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
10 hours and 41 minutes and that was
another<00:01:35.610> reason<00:01:35.880> why<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.180> bought<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.720> because

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
another reason why I bought this because

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.710 
another reason why I bought this because
there's<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.500> lot<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.799> content<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
there's a lot of content in here not

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.179 
there's a lot of content in here not
sure<00:01:39.750> how<00:01:40.079> many<00:01:40.140> discs<00:01:40.740> are<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.070> be

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
sure how many discs are going to be

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
sure how many discs are going to be
inside<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:41.790> probably<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.990> least<00:01:43.229> three<00:01:43.619> I'm

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
inside but probably at least three I'm

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.149 
inside but probably at least three I'm
thinking<00:01:44.490> maybe<00:01:44.729> four<00:01:45.149> but<00:01:45.560> yeah<00:01:46.560> Mill<00:01:46.829> Creek

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
thinking maybe four but yeah Mill Creek

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
I'm not really expecting a flipper case

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.850 
I'm not really expecting a flipper case
or<00:02:07.350> anything<00:02:07.590> fancy<00:02:08.039> um<00:02:08.989> very<00:02:09.989> basic<00:02:10.530> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
or anything fancy um very basic so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.750 
or anything fancy um very basic so
that's<00:02:11.430> what<00:02:11.610> I'm<00:02:11.730> expecting<00:02:12.060> inside

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.760 

all<00:02:17.760> right<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.360> got<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.810> security<00:02:19.200> label

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
all right so I got the security label

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.650 
all right so I got the security label
off<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.460> can<00:02:20.610> see<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.910> left<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.240> little<00:02:21.540> bit

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
off and you can see it left a little bit

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.090 
off and you can see it left a little bit
of<00:02:21.780> residue<00:02:22.140> so<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> might<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.950> use<00:02:22.980> some

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
of residue so I might have to use some

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.710 
of residue so I might have to use some
goog<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:25.500> no<00:02:25.650> big<00:02:25.890> deal<00:02:26.270> so<00:02:27.270> let's

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
goog on on that but no big deal so let's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.020 
goog on on that but no big deal so let's
open<00:02:27.960> this<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.650> take<00:02:28.740> a<00:02:28.920> look<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.490> as<00:02:29.880> you

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
open this up and take a look and as you

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.510 
open this up and take a look and as you
can<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:30.290> very<00:02:31.290> bare-bones<00:02:31.620> inside<00:02:32.310> there's

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
can see very bare-bones inside there's

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.550 
can see very bare-bones inside there's
no<00:02:32.670> inserts<00:02:33.180> or<00:02:33.360> anything<00:02:33.570> we<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
no inserts or anything we just have the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.460 
no inserts or anything we just have the
disks<00:02:35.270> looks<00:02:36.270> like<00:02:36.480> pretty<00:02:36.840> nice<00:02:37.020> artwork

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
disks looks like pretty nice artwork

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.050 
disks looks like pretty nice artwork
though<00:02:37.800> so<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.280> pretty<00:02:38.550> cool

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
though so that's pretty cool

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.170 
though so that's pretty cool
not<00:02:39.660> very<00:02:40.080> basic<00:02:40.590> or<00:02:40.740> anything<00:02:40.950> but<00:02:41.850> we<00:02:42.030> do

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
not very basic or anything but we do

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.200 
not very basic or anything but we do
have<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.510> stack<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:42.990> disk<00:02:43.200> thing<00:02:43.470> so<00:02:43.890> um

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
have the stack to disk thing so um

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.510 
have the stack to disk thing so um
here's<00:02:45.210> disc<00:02:45.450> one<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.070> it<00:02:47.070> shows<00:02:47.280> all<00:02:47.490> the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
here's disc one and it shows all the

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.310 
here's disc one and it shows all the
episodes<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.420> looks<00:02:48.630> like<00:02:48.810> there's<00:02:49.020> ten

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
episodes so it looks like there's ten

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.750 
episodes so it looks like there's ten
episodes<00:02:49.860> per<00:02:50.190> disc

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
episodes per disc

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.700 
episodes per disc
there's<00:02:51.360> disc<00:02:51.720> one<00:02:52.020> I'll<00:02:52.200> show<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.680> of

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
there's disc one I'll show you all of

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.100 
there's disc one I'll show you all of
the<00:02:52.950> discs<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.640> don't<00:02:54.330> even<00:02:54.420> know<00:02:54.630> how<00:02:54.780> many<00:02:54.840> are

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
the discs I don't even know how many are

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.320 
the discs I don't even know how many are
in<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.650> but<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.920> seems<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:56.790> it<00:02:56.940> might<00:02:57.060> be

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
in here but it seems like it might be

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.730 
in here but it seems like it might be
four<00:02:58.110> discs

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
four discs

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.790 
four discs
so<00:02:59.400> here's<00:02:59.790> disc<00:03:00.090> two<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.690> then<00:03:00.810> it's<00:03:00.960> looks

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
so here's disc two and then it's looks

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.620 
so here's disc two and then it's looks
like<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.280> changes<00:03:02.670> from<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.940> first<00:03:02.970> season<00:03:03.600> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
like it changes from the first season to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.210 
like it changes from the first season to
the<00:03:03.870> second<00:03:04.260> season<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.770> here

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
the second season on here

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.000 
the second season on here
that's<00:03:05.940> pretty<00:03:06.240> cool<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:09.020> next<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.710> third

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that's pretty cool and next is the third

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.030 
that's pretty cool and next is the third
disc<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.540> guess<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.020> same<00:03:13.260> artwork<00:03:13.650> pretty

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
disc so I guess the same artwork pretty

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.190 
disc so I guess the same artwork pretty
much<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.760> discs<00:03:15.150> but<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.690> shows<00:03:15.930> all

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
much on all the discs but it shows all

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.080 
much on all the discs but it shows all
the<00:03:16.440> episodes<00:03:16.850> very<00:03:17.850> nice<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:18.390> there<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:18.959> are

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the episodes very nice so there they are

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.900 
the episodes very nice so there they are
and<00:03:21.530> nope<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.709> was<00:03:22.860> wrong<00:03:22.920> I<00:03:23.310> guess<00:03:23.459> it's<00:03:23.640> just

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
and nope I was wrong I guess it's just

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.820 
and nope I was wrong I guess it's just
three<00:03:24.180> discs<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:24.750> there<00:03:24.959> are<00:03:25.080> only<00:03:25.260> 30

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830
