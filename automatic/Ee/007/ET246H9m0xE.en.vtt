 new modular air suspension merely new 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.270
 Light air hacks connected in one 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.010
 optimally tuned system the bpw 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.280
 compact is the new scale for nine 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.350
 tons of axles in onroad use 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.410
 basis is the new modular concept with 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.530
 50 percent less components and 100% 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.200
 maintenance-free integration of the two-piece 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.270
 bus handlebar is diagonally bolted to the 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.300
 ensures optimal flow of power and 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.040
 for a long life 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.720
 further plus the components are not 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 welded and therefore easy 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.769
 interchangeable 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.839
 the new steel rubber bush carries through 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.790
 optimal axial and vertical 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.690
 track guidance to high driving comfort and 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.730
 low tire wear in the new 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.440
 two sides ax lift settles in 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.270
 few and simple steps 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.770
 fasten that reduces the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.470
 installation costs by 50 percent the new 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.930
 eco he air is strong up to 60 percent 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.300
 lighter than steel tags thanks to high tech 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.360
 material they are corrosion free and 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:32.360
 particularly durable so many benefits 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.910
 for vehicle manufacturers and forwarders 50 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.330
 percent fewer components for robust 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.460
 design and long life 30 percent 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.590
 less module variants for more 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.590
 flexibility in trailer production 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.810
 50 percent reduced installation time by

 new ax lift 60 lighter gfk air 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.980
 strong for more capacity and 100% 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.080
 maintenance-free integration for reduced 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.910
 operating cost 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.580
 makes an optimal under the dash 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:17.480
 coordinated overall system for more
