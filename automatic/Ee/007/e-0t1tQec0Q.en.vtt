NES now the first thing about this game
look<00:00:09.090> at<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> cartridge<00:00:09.840> it<00:00:09.990> says<00:00:10.230> highly

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
look at the cartridge it says highly

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.419 
look at the cartridge it says highly
addictive<00:00:11.370> when<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.030> say<00:00:12.210> highly<00:00:12.599> addicting
