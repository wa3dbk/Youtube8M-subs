00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
a verizon iphone production in december

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.819 
a verizon iphone production in december
but<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.390> doesn't<00:00:57.960> really<00:00:58.079> mean<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
but that doesn't really mean that it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.700 
but that doesn't really mean that it
could<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.359> rise<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.410> this<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
could be going to rise it and this is

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.820 
could be going to rise it and this is
why<00:01:01.829> Verizon<00:01:02.489> uses<00:01:03.149> cdma<00:01:03.510> technology<00:01:03.989> but

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
why Verizon uses cdma technology but

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.780 
why Verizon uses cdma technology but
also<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.519> sprint<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.330> sprint<00:01:06.990> has<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> 4G<00:01:08.100> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
also the sprint and sprint has a 4G so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.789 
also the sprint and sprint has a 4G so
if<00:01:09.409> the<00:01:10.409> iphone<00:01:10.590> comes<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:11.960> ACM<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> carrier<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
if the iphone comes to ACM a carrier it

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
doesn't have to be rising it could be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.719 
doesn't have to be rising it could be
sprint<00:01:15.900> could<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> called<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> iphone<00:01:17.070> 4g

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729
