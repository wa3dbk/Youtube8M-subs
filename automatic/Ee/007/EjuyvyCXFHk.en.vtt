00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.790 
with my fitness I am currently weighing
at<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:23.900> 130<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.310> 133<00:00:26.310> pounds<00:00:27.530> previously<00:00:28.530> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
at about 130 to 133 pounds previously I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.190 
at about 130 to 133 pounds previously I
had<00:00:29.100> lost<00:00:29.400> all<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.850> my<00:00:30.210> baby<00:00:30.570> weight<00:00:30.870> when<00:00:31.170> I

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
had lost all of my baby weight when I

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.869 
had lost all of my baby weight when I
made<00:00:31.440> that<00:00:31.650> video<00:00:31.740> about<00:00:32.129> how<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.340> lost<00:00:32.579> all<00:00:32.790> my

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
made that video about how I lost all my

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.869 
made that video about how I lost all my
baby<00:00:32.910> weight<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.570> down<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.399> 130<00:00:35.399> pounds

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
baby weight I was down to one 130 pounds

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.840 
baby weight I was down to one 130 pounds
but<00:00:36.739> slowly<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.920> started<00:00:38.339> gaining<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.820> back

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but slowly I started gaining it back

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.290 
but slowly I started gaining it back
because<00:00:39.390> my<00:00:39.629> son<00:00:40.289> was<00:00:40.469> still<00:00:40.739> pretty<00:00:40.980> young

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
because my son was still pretty young

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.869 
because my son was still pretty young
and<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.170> wasn't<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.039> able<00:00:44.339> to<00:00:44.489> be<00:00:44.699> as

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
and so I wasn't really able to be as

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.389 
and so I wasn't really able to be as
consistent<00:00:45.329> as<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.260> been<00:00:46.469> lately<00:00:46.739> and

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
consistent as I have been lately and

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
consistent as I have been lately and
that's<00:00:48.089> one<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.510> things<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.839> want<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's one of the things that I want to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.869 
that's one of the things that I want to
say<00:00:49.319> to<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.710> lot<00:00:49.920> of<00:00:49.980> my<00:00:50.159> viewers<00:00:50.399> if<00:00:50.670> you're<00:00:50.850> a

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
something like school it's really

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.889 
something like school it's really
difficult<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.850> dedicate<00:00:56.850> time<00:00:57.179> to<00:00:57.479> yourself

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
difficult to dedicate time to yourself

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.259 
difficult to dedicate time to yourself

when I'm curling at the gym I don't do a
lot<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.930> cardio<00:04:55.440> because<00:04:55.800> cardio<00:04:56.580> will<00:04:57.510> really

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
lot of cardio because cardio will really

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.950 
lot of cardio because cardio will really
shrink<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.740> so<00:04:59.190> if<00:04:59.430> you're<00:04:59.639> like<00:04:59.820> heavy<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
shrink you so if you're like heavy and

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.290 
shrink you so if you're like heavy and
you're<00:05:01.110> kind<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.410> not<00:05:02.039> toned<00:05:02.400> and<00:05:02.610> wobbly<00:05:03.060> and

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
you're kind of not toned and wobbly and

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.510 
you're kind of not toned and wobbly and
you<00:05:03.780> just<00:05:03.990> run<00:05:04.289> run<00:05:04.440> run<00:05:04.650> run<00:05:04.830> run<00:05:05.039> you're<00:05:05.310> just

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
you just run run run run run you're just

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.890 
you just run run run run run you're just
going<00:05:05.669> to<00:05:05.729> shrink<00:05:06.150> and<00:05:06.389> you're<00:05:06.510> still<00:05:06.750> going

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
going to shrink and you're still going

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.520 
going to shrink and you're still going
to<00:05:06.930> be<00:05:06.990> wobbly<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.340> I<00:05:08.370> use<00:05:09.000> weights<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:10.199> really

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
to be wobbly so I use weights to really

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.740 
to be wobbly so I use weights to really
tone<00:05:10.919> and<00:05:11.280> tighten<00:05:11.550> my<00:05:11.820> body<00:05:12.060> and<00:05:12.360> that's<00:05:12.510> not

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
tone and tighten my body and that's not

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.379 
tone and tighten my body and that's not
to<00:05:13.050> say<00:05:13.260> that<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.830> have<00:05:14.070> like<00:05:14.280> you<00:05:14.430> know<00:05:14.550> muscle
