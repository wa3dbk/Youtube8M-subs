00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
classroom that's a self-reflection part

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.740 
classroom that's a self-reflection part
that<00:00:47.900> is<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:48.729> important<00:00:49.729> in<00:00:49.820> our<00:00:49.909> program<00:00:50.330> we

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
that is so important in our program we

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.649 
that is so important in our program we
work<00:00:51.110> hard<00:00:51.140> to<00:00:51.739> build<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.339> community<00:00:52.519> but<00:00:53.510> any

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
work hard to build the community but any

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:55.509 
work hard to build the community but any
teacher<00:00:54.049> knows<00:00:54.409> that<00:00:54.799> unless<00:00:55.190> you<00:00:55.339> have<00:00:55.489> a

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
teacher knows that unless you have a

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.600 
teacher knows that unless you have a
community<00:00:56.059> in<00:00:56.210> place<00:00:56.830> learning<00:00:57.830> is<00:00:57.979> going<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
community in place learning is going to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.250 
community in place learning is going to
suffer<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.210> so<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.720> start<00:01:00.019> with<00:01:00.049> that

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
suffer and so we start with that

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.579 
suffer and so we start with that
dimension<00:01:01.269> we're<00:01:02.269> taking<00:01:02.720> to<00:01:02.900> the<00:01:02.930> university

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
dimension we're taking to the university

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.090 
dimension we're taking to the university
level<00:01:03.619> what<00:01:04.189> all<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.430> us<00:01:04.820> in<00:01:05.119> pre<00:01:05.720> k-12<00:01:06.200> doing

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
level what all of us in pre k-12 doing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.240 
level what all of us in pre k-12 doing
our<00:01:07.220> classrooms<00:01:07.780> or<00:01:08.780> aspire<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.950> do<00:01:10.070> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
our classrooms or aspire to do and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.300 
our classrooms or aspire to do and
that's<00:01:10.400> to<00:01:10.580> build<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.970> community<00:01:11.180> to

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
that's to build the community to

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.650 
that's to build the community to
establish<00:01:13.310> relationships<00:01:14.030> get<00:01:14.360> people

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
establish relationships get people

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.440 
establish relationships get people
working<00:01:14.930> together<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:16.010> then<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.090> take<00:01:17.270> it

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
working together and then to take it

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.210 
working together and then to take it
from<00:01:17.570> there<00:01:17.780> so<00:01:18.050> is<00:01:18.320> there<00:01:18.560> some<00:01:18.770> of<00:01:18.890> what<00:01:19.070> you

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
from there so is there some of what you

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.300 
from there so is there some of what you
would<00:01:19.340> say<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:19.610> touchy<00:01:19.850> feely<00:01:20.300> absolutely<00:01:21.050> yes

would say is touchy feely absolutely yes
and<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.400> would<00:01:22.550> say<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:22.790> essential<00:01:23.420> if<00:01:23.600> you're

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
and I would say it's essential if you're

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.330 
and I would say it's essential if you're
if<00:01:24.140> you're<00:01:24.320> going<00:01:24.530> to<00:01:24.620> have<00:01:24.740> people<00:01:24.770> at<00:01:25.160> any

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
absolutely but that's the starting basis

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.620 
absolutely but that's the starting basis
that's<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.460> rumble<00:01:58.820> on<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.090> floor<00:01:59.390> and

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
that's like the rumble on the floor and

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.410 
that's like the rumble on the floor and
everything<00:02:00.260> else<00:02:00.409> happens<00:02:01.100> all<00:02:01.760> the<00:02:02.030> dancing

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
everything else happens all the dancing

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.360 
everything else happens all the dancing
on<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:02.630> rug<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.960> know<00:02:03.049> happens<00:02:03.500> above<00:02:04.190> and

on the rug you know happens above and

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.820 
on the rug you know happens above and

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
beyond that as a facilitator I'd say I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.619 
beyond that as a facilitator I'd say I
want<00:02:07.100> to<00:02:07.159> know<00:02:07.250> who<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.610> are<00:02:07.790> tell<00:02:08.420> me<00:02:08.539> about
