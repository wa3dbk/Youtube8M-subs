elkhart<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.470> half<00:00:39.650> and<00:00:39.920> create<00:00:40.190> a<00:00:40.220> notch<00:00:40.460> like

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:40.880 
elkhart in half and create a notch like

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.290 
elkhart in half and create a notch like
so<00:00:44.590> now<00:00:45.590> the<00:00:45.650> other<00:00:45.890> two<00:00:46.040> sticks<00:00:46.310> you<00:00:47.000> square

right there I get it so I guys keep this
thing<00:02:19.480> works<00:02:19.659> with<00:02:19.810> me<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.159> so<00:02:25.000> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
thing works with me like that so the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.940 
thing works with me like that so the
weight<00:02:25.269> is<00:02:25.299> pulling<00:02:25.569> up<00:02:25.719> on<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.989> this<00:02:26.680> stick

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
weight is pulling up on that this stick

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.839 
weight is pulling up on that this stick
is<00:02:27.129> stopping<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:28.659> from<00:02:28.719> going<00:02:29.049> off<00:02:29.549> now<00:02:30.549> let's

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
is stopping it from going off now let's

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.839 
is stopping it from going off now let's
move<00:02:30.939> on<00:02:31.090> until<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.329> set<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.629> platform<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:32.849> want

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
move on until I set the platform up want

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.179 
move on until I set the platform up want
to<00:02:33.969> find<00:02:34.209> about<00:02:34.480> six<00:02:35.379> straight<00:02:35.709> sticks<00:02:35.980> like

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
to find about six straight sticks like

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.319 
to find about six straight sticks like
this<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.260> just<00:02:38.409> take<00:02:38.620> them<00:02:38.889> and<00:02:39.329> gently

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
this and you just take them and gently

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.569 
this and you just take them and gently
send<00:02:40.599> them<00:02:40.719> on<00:02:40.840> the<00:02:41.260> trap<00:02:41.500> cuz<00:02:42.250> this<00:02:42.340> chap<00:02:42.549> is

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
send them on the trap cuz this chap is

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.610 
send them on the trap cuz this chap is
very<00:02:42.879> sensitive<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.389> you<00:02:44.169> don't<00:02:44.290> want<00:02:44.409> to<00:02:44.470> pass

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
very sensitive so you don't want to pass

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:53.280 
very sensitive so you don't want to pass

down on it too hard and once you get all

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.750 
down on it too hard and once you get all
the<00:02:53.650> with<00:02:54.639> the<00:02:54.730> platform<00:02:54.939> on<00:02:55.239> there<00:02:56.519> this

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
the with the platform on there this

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.709 
the with the platform on there this
look<00:02:57.909> like<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:59.669> with<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.909> noose<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.239> there

spring<00:03:11.769> snares<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.900> places<00:03:13.900> where<00:03:14.049> there's

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
spring snares is places where there's

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.050 
spring snares is places where there's
been<00:03:14.379> animal<00:03:14.799> scat<00:03:15.010> or<00:03:15.389> animal<00:03:16.389> tracks<00:03:18.060> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
been animal scat or animal tracks so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.930 
been animal scat or animal tracks so
let's<00:03:19.599> say<00:03:19.810> mr.<00:03:20.500> bunny<00:03:20.709> is<00:03:20.979> walking<00:03:21.970> along<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
let's say mr. bunny is walking along and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.339 
let's say mr. bunny is walking along and
once<00:03:24.940> he<00:03:25.030> steps<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.419> this<00:03:25.540> platform<00:03:25.780> at<00:03:26.169> here

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
once he steps on this platform at here

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.449 
once he steps on this platform at here
he<00:03:27.280> will<00:03:27.430> set<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.959> stick<00:03:29.260> push<00:03:30.099> the<00:03:30.250> stick

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
he will set this stick push the stick

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.939 
he will set this stick push the stick
down<00:03:30.639> release<00:03:31.419> his<00:03:31.569> death<00:03:31.750> stares<00:03:32.199> pulses<00:03:32.709> the

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:32.949 
down release his death stares pulses the

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.009 
down release his death stares pulses the
way<00:03:33.069> it<00:03:33.129> pulls<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.549> up<00:03:33.760> which<00:03:34.629> is<00:03:34.750> basically

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
way it pulls this up which is basically

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.469 
way it pulls this up which is basically
on<00:03:35.169> a<00:03:35.290> bit<00:03:35.729> basically<00:03:36.729> how<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:36.939> mechanism

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:37.479 
on a bit basically how the mechanism

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.390 
on a bit basically how the mechanism
works<00:03:37.659> of<00:03:37.870> this<00:03:37.989> trap<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:39.010> let's<00:03:39.129> see<00:03:39.280> how<00:03:39.370> it

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
works of this trap so let's see how it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.830 
works of this trap so let's see how it
works<00:03:39.639> you<00:03:40.419> like<00:03:40.599> this<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:42.389> mr.<00:03:43.389> Bunyan<00:03:43.659> comes

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
works you like this and mr. Bunyan comes

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.499 
works you like this and mr. Bunyan comes
in<00:03:43.959> here<00:03:44.139> and<00:03:44.290> it's<00:03:45.250> hot<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.750> there's<00:03:46.750> dinner

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
in here and it's hot and there's dinner

00:03:48.509 --> 00:04:01.290 
in here and it's hot and there's dinner
yeah<00:03:49.949> yeah<00:03:51.030> all<00:03:52.030> right<00:03:52.680> Josh<00:03:53.680> ah<00:03:58.290> yeah
