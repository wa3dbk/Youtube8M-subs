of a deck that really has that explosive
power<00:06:21.900> much<00:06:22.900> like<00:06:22.930> her<00:06:23.410> addicts<00:06:23.800> or<00:06:23.950> wind<00:06:24.370> ups

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
power much like her addicts or wind ups

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.280 
power much like her addicts or wind ups
where<00:06:24.850> people<00:06:25.630> have<00:06:25.720> convinced<00:06:26.230> themselves
