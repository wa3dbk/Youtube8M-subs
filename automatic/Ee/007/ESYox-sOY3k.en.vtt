I'm going around the world giving talks

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:18.900 
I'm going around the world giving talks
about<00:00:17.800> Darwin<00:00:18.070> and<00:00:18.369> usually<00:00:18.670> what<00:00:18.790> I'm

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
about Darwin and usually what I'm

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.570 
about Darwin and usually what I'm
talking<00:00:19.270> about<00:00:19.360> is<00:00:19.930> Darwin's<00:00:20.770> strange<00:00:21.310> and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
talking about is Darwin's strange and

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.839 
talking about is Darwin's strange and
version<00:00:21.970> of<00:00:22.090> reasoning<00:00:22.570> now<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:24.220> title<00:00:24.610> that

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
version of reasoning now that title that

critic and this is a passage that I just
love<00:00:30.489> and<00:00:30.759> would<00:00:31.419> like<00:00:31.570> to<00:00:31.599> read<00:00:32.469> for<00:00:32.739> you<00:00:32.770> in

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
absolute ignorance is the artificer so

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.380 
absolute ignorance is the artificer so

exactly exactly and it is a strange

painting that didn't have a painter yes
no<00:01:33.579> do<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.030> know<00:01:34.119> of<00:01:34.210> any<00:01:34.329> car<00:01:34.719> that<00:01:34.750> didn't

no do you know of any car that didn't

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
have a maker yes no if you answered yes

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.080 
have a maker yes no if you answered yes
for<00:01:39.280> any<00:01:39.430> of<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.700> love<00:01:39.939> give<00:01:40.450> details<00:01:41.729> aha

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
for any of you love give details aha

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.490 
for any of you love give details aha
I<00:01:43.289> mean<00:01:44.289> it<00:01:44.469> really<00:01:44.770> is<00:01:44.979> a<00:01:45.579> strange<00:01:46.500> inversion

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
I mean it really is a strange inversion

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.649 
I mean it really is a strange inversion
of<00:01:47.619> reasoning<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.969> would<00:01:49.149> have<00:01:49.270> thought<00:01:49.450> it

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
of reasoning you would have thought it

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.440 
of reasoning you would have thought it
stands<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.409> reason<00:01:50.439> that<00:01:51.270> intelligent<00:01:52.270> design

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
stands to reason that intelligent design

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.849 
stands to reason that intelligent design
requires<00:01:53.350> an<00:01:53.619> intelligent<00:01:54.219> designer<00:01:55.859> but

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
requires an intelligent designer but

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.490 
requires an intelligent designer but
Darwin<00:01:57.070> shows<00:01:57.460> that<00:01:57.700> it's<00:01:57.880> just<00:01:58.149> false<00:01:58.500> today

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
Darwin shows that it's just false today

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.380 
Darwin shows that it's just false today
though<00:01:59.770> I'm<00:02:00.130> going<00:02:00.369> to<00:02:00.429> talk<00:02:00.640> about<00:02:00.670> Darwin's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
though I'm going to talk about Darwin's

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.200 
though I'm going to talk about Darwin's
other<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:02.170> strange<00:02:02.619> inversion<00:02:03.340> which<00:02:03.939> is

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
other a strange inversion which is

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.080 
other a strange inversion which is
equally<00:02:05.020> puzzling<00:02:05.229> at<00:02:05.619> first<00:02:05.890> but<00:02:06.700> in<00:02:06.880> some

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
equally puzzling at first but in some

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.169 
equally puzzling at first but in some
ways<00:02:07.299> just<00:02:07.570> as<00:02:07.749> important<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.340> stands<00:02:09.820> to

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
ways just as important it stands to

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.010 
ways just as important it stands to
reason<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.750> we<00:02:11.230> love<00:02:12.010> chocolate<00:02:12.550> cake

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
reason that we love chocolate cake

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.610 
reason that we love chocolate cake
because<00:02:14.020> it<00:02:14.620> is<00:02:14.740> sweet<00:02:15.930> guys<00:02:16.930> go<00:02:17.290> for<00:02:17.500> girls

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
because it is sweet guys go for girls

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.860 
because it is sweet guys go for girls
like<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.420> because<00:02:19.420> they<00:02:19.959> are<00:02:19.989> sexy<00:02:21.629> we<00:02:22.629> adore

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
like this because they are sexy we adore

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.559 
like this because they are sexy we adore
babies<00:02:23.440> because<00:02:24.040> there's

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
babies because there's

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.369 
babies because there's
cute<00:02:25.079> and<00:02:26.090> of<00:02:27.090> course<00:02:27.359> we<00:02:27.599> are<00:02:27.780> amused<00:02:28.109> by

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
cute and of course we are amused by

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:36.410 
cute and of course we are amused by
jokes<00:02:29.299> because<00:02:30.299> they<00:02:30.659> are<00:02:30.780> funny<00:02:35.060> this<00:02:36.060> is<00:02:36.120> all

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
jokes because they are funny this is all

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.069 
jokes because they are funny this is all
backwards<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:38.489> is

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
backwards it is

sweet our sweet tooth is basically an

sweet our sweet tooth is basically an
evolved<00:02:48.599> sugar<00:02:48.959> detector<00:02:49.730> because<00:02:50.730> sugar<00:02:51.060> is

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
evolved sugar detector because sugar is

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.390 
evolved sugar detector because sugar is
high-energy<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:51.989> it's<00:02:52.349> just<00:02:52.620> been<00:02:52.829> wired<00:02:53.129> up

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
high-energy and it's just been wired up

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.580 
high-energy and it's just been wired up
to<00:02:53.669> the<00:02:53.790> prefer<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.629> put<00:02:54.749> it<00:02:54.900> very<00:02:55.079> crudely

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590

to the prefer to put it very crudely
and<00:02:55.969> that's<00:02:56.969> why<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:58.049> like<00:02:58.290> sugar<00:02:59.159> honey<00:02:59.849> is

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
and that's why we like sugar honey is

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.619 
and that's why we like sugar honey is
sweet<00:03:00.269> because<00:03:00.629> we<00:03:00.810> like<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.049> not<00:03:02.299> we<00:03:03.299> like<00:03:03.480> it

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
sweet because we like it not we like it

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.670 
sweet because we like it not we like it
because<00:03:04.280> honey<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.370> sweet<00:03:06.319> there's<00:03:07.319> nothing

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
because honey is sweet there's nothing

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.420 
because honey is sweet there's nothing
intrinsically<00:03:08.549> sweet<00:03:09.590> about<00:03:10.590> honey<00:03:10.919> if<00:03:11.189> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
intrinsically sweet about honey if you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.270 
intrinsically sweet about honey if you
looked<00:03:11.669> at<00:03:11.760> glucose<00:03:12.650> molecules<00:03:13.650> till<00:03:14.159> you

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
looked at glucose molecules till you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.580 
looked at glucose molecules till you
were<00:03:14.400> blind<00:03:14.760> you<00:03:15.060> wouldn't<00:03:15.389> see<00:03:15.569> why<00:03:16.199> they

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
were blind you wouldn't see why they

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.909 
were blind you wouldn't see why they
tasted<00:03:17.069> sweet<00:03:17.719> you<00:03:18.719> have<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:18.989> look<00:03:19.169> in<00:03:19.680> our

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
tasted sweet you have to look in our

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:23.679 
tasted sweet you have to look in our
brains<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.790> understand<00:03:21.269> why<00:03:21.510> they're<00:03:21.780> sweet

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
brains to understand why they're sweet

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.179 
brains to understand why they're sweet
so<00:03:24.689> if<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.139> think<00:03:25.500> first<00:03:25.829> there<00:03:26.069> was

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
so if you think first there was

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.250 
so if you think first there was
sweetness<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.909> then<00:03:27.239> we<00:03:27.419> evolved<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:28.019> like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
sweetness and then we evolved to like

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.990 
sweetness and then we evolved to like
sweetness<00:03:28.620> you've<00:03:28.949> got<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:29.250> backwards<00:03:29.489> that's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
sweetness you've got it backwards that's

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.330 
sweetness you've got it backwards that's
just<00:03:30.299> wrong<00:03:30.799> it's<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.949> other<00:03:32.099> way<00:03:32.310> around

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
just wrong it's the other way around

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.050 
just wrong it's the other way around
sweetness<00:03:33.209> was<00:03:33.389> born<00:03:33.870> with<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.650> wiring<00:03:35.060> which

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
sweetness was born with the wiring which

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.819 
sweetness was born with the wiring which
evolved<00:03:36.689> and<00:03:37.319> there's<00:03:37.530> nothing

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
evolved and there's nothing

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.710 
evolved and there's nothing
intrinsically<00:03:38.370> sexy<00:03:38.939> about<00:03:39.030> these<00:03:39.449> young

ladies<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:41.250> it's<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.519> good<00:03:41.699> thing<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.449> there

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
ladies and it's a good thing that there

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.800 
ladies and it's a good thing that there
isn't<00:03:43.709> because<00:03:44.519> if<00:03:44.879> there<00:03:45.090> were<00:03:45.269> then<00:03:45.599> mother

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810

one way of doing it but there's a

it's<00:05:11.330> a<00:05:11.449> super<00:05:12.110> normal<00:05:12.530> stimulus<00:05:13.360> to<00:05:14.360> tweak

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
it's a super normal stimulus to tweak

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.100 
it's a super normal stimulus to tweak
our<00:05:15.650> design<00:05:16.340> wiring<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.270> there<00:05:17.690> are<00:05:17.750> lots<00:05:17.960> of

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
our design wiring and there are lots of

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.170 
our design wiring and there are lots of
supernormal<00:05:18.620> stimuli<00:05:19.310> chocolate<00:05:19.729> cake<00:05:19.940> is

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:20.180 
supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.600 
supernormal stimuli chocolate cake is
one<00:05:20.419> there's<00:05:21.050> lots<00:05:21.260> of<00:05:21.409> supernormal<00:05:21.919> stimuli

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
one there's lots of supernormal stimuli

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.520 
one there's lots of supernormal stimuli
for<00:05:22.789> sexiness<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.659> there's<00:05:24.259> even

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
for sexiness and there's even

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.760 
for sexiness and there's even
supernormal<00:05:24.979> stimuli<00:05:25.669> for<00:05:26.360> cuteness<00:05:27.169> here's

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
supernormal stimuli for cuteness here's

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.950 
supernormal stimuli for cuteness here's
a<00:05:27.860> pretty<00:05:28.099> good<00:05:28.220> example<00:05:28.430> it's<00:05:29.330> important

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
a pretty good example it's important

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.779 
a pretty good example it's important
that<00:05:30.080> we<00:05:30.380> love<00:05:30.590> babies<00:05:31.070> and<00:05:31.340> that<00:05:31.490> we<00:05:31.580> not<00:05:31.729> be

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
that we love babies and that we not be

that we love babies and that we not be
put<00:05:32.180> off<00:05:32.210> by<00:05:32.389> a<00:05:32.659> messy<00:05:33.409> diapers<00:05:34.180> so<00:05:35.180> babies

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
put off by a messy diapers so babies

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.170 
put off by a messy diapers so babies
have<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.169> have<00:05:36.560> to<00:05:36.710> attract<00:05:37.190> our<00:05:37.430> affection<00:05:38.030> in

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
have to have to attract our affection in

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.810 
have to have to attract our affection in
our<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.630> our<00:05:38.870> nurturing<00:05:39.199> and<00:05:39.650> they<00:05:40.070> do<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.490> by

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
our and our nurturing and they do and by

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.899 
our and our nurturing and they do and by
the<00:05:40.880> way<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.180> recent<00:05:41.659> study<00:05:41.840> shows<00:05:42.259> that

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
the way a recent study shows that

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.730 
the way a recent study shows that
mothers<00:05:43.909> prefer<00:05:44.599> the<00:05:44.810> smell<00:05:45.110> of<00:05:45.169> the<00:05:45.530> dirty

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
mothers prefer the smell of the dirty

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.700 
mothers prefer the smell of the dirty
diapers<00:05:46.220> of<00:05:46.370> their<00:05:46.550> own<00:05:46.729> baby

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
diapers of their own baby

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.189 
diapers of their own baby
so<00:05:48.710> nature<00:05:49.099> works<00:05:49.460> on<00:05:49.669> many<00:05:49.970> levels<00:05:50.330> here<00:05:50.780> but

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
so nature works on many levels here but

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:53.290 
so nature works on many levels here but
now<00:05:51.349> if<00:05:51.590> babies<00:05:52.190> didn't<00:05:52.550> look<00:05:52.699> the<00:05:52.909> way<00:05:52.940> they

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
now if babies didn't look the way they

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.080 
now if babies didn't look the way they
do<00:05:53.360> if<00:05:53.900> babies<00:05:54.620> looked<00:05:54.919> like<00:05:55.099> this<00:05:55.430> that's

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
do if babies looked like this that's

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.499 
do if babies looked like this that's
what<00:05:56.479> we<00:05:56.630> would<00:05:56.750> find<00:05:56.810> adorable<00:05:58.210> that's<00:05:59.210> what

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
what we would find adorable that's what

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.240 
what we would find adorable that's what
we<00:05:59.630> would<00:05:59.780> find<00:05:59.840> we<00:06:00.229> would<00:06:00.440> think<00:06:00.710> oh<00:06:01.009> my

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
we would find we would think oh my

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.250 
we would find we would think oh my
goodness<00:06:01.639> do<00:06:02.120> I<00:06:02.150> ever<00:06:02.360> want<00:06:02.690> to<00:06:02.750> hug<00:06:02.930> that

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
goodness do I ever want to hug that

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.710 
goodness do I ever want to hug that
this<00:06:05.260> is<00:06:05.440> the<00:06:05.590> strange<00:06:05.920> inversion<00:06:06.580> well<00:06:07.570> now

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:07.720 
this is the strange inversion well now

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.520 
this is the strange inversion well now
finally<00:06:08.170> what<00:06:08.650> about<00:06:08.770> funny<00:06:10.110> my<00:06:11.110> answer<00:06:11.410> is

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
finally what about funny my answer is

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.790 
finally what about funny my answer is
it's<00:06:11.710> the<00:06:11.860> same<00:06:12.040> story<00:06:12.600> the<00:06:13.600> same<00:06:13.630> story<00:06:14.380> this

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 
it's the same story the same story this

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.980 
it's the same story the same story this
is<00:06:14.860> the<00:06:15.160> hard<00:06:15.430> one<00:06:15.670> the<00:06:16.360> one<00:06:16.540> that<00:06:16.570> isn't

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
is the hard one the one that isn't

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.570 
is the hard one the one that isn't
obvious<00:06:17.110> that's<00:06:17.590> why<00:06:17.740> I<00:06:17.800> leave<00:06:18.070> it<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.430> end

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
obvious that's why I leave it to the end

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.130 
obvious that's why I leave it to the end
and<00:06:18.880> I<00:06:18.940> won't<00:06:19.120> be<00:06:19.270> able<00:06:19.390> to<00:06:19.480> say<00:06:19.660> too<00:06:19.720> much

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:20.140 
and I won't be able to say too much

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.040 
and I won't be able to say too much
about<00:06:20.440> it<00:06:20.650> but<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.430> have<00:06:21.640> to<00:06:21.790> think

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
about it but you have to think

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.390 
about it but you have to think
evolutionarily<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.290> have<00:06:23.470> to<00:06:23.590> think<00:06:23.800> what

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
evolutionarily you have to think what

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.060 
evolutionarily you have to think what
hard<00:06:24.790> job<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.810> has<00:06:26.020> to<00:06:26.050> be<00:06:26.380> done<00:06:26.590> it's<00:06:26.800> dirty

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.070 
hard job that has to be done it's dirty

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.880 
hard job that has to be done it's dirty
work<00:06:27.280> somebody's<00:06:27.760> got<00:06:27.940> to<00:06:27.970> do<00:06:28.180> it<00:06:28.560> it's<00:06:29.560> so

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
work somebody's got to do it it's so

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.610 
work somebody's got to do it it's so
important<00:06:30.550> to<00:06:30.790> give<00:06:31.570> us<00:06:31.720> such<00:06:31.990> a<00:06:32.020> powerful

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
important to give us such a powerful

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:36.200 
important to give us such a powerful
inbuilt<00:06:33.370> reward<00:06:33.940> for<00:06:34.480> it<00:06:34.630> when<00:06:35.080> we<00:06:35.260> succeed

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
inbuilt reward for it when we succeed

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.570 
inbuilt reward for it when we succeed
now<00:06:37.210> I<00:06:37.510> think<00:06:38.020> we<00:06:38.350> found<00:06:38.590> the<00:06:38.770> answer<00:06:39.100> I<00:06:39.160> and<00:06:39.520> a

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
now I think we found the answer I and a

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.810 
now I think we found the answer I and a
few<00:06:39.820> of<00:06:40.240> my<00:06:40.510> colleagues<00:06:41.310> it's<00:06:42.310> a<00:06:42.460> neural

few of my colleagues it's a neural

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.020 
few of my colleagues it's a neural
system<00:06:43.330> that's<00:06:43.540> wired<00:06:43.960> up<00:06:44.290> to<00:06:44.610> reward<00:06:45.610> the

this<00:06:55.480> is<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:55.840> joy<00:06:56.140> of<00:06:56.170> debugging<00:06:57.810> now<00:06:58.810> I'm<00:06:58.960> not

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
this is the joy of debugging now I'm not

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.020 
this is the joy of debugging now I'm not
gonna<00:06:59.260> have<00:06:59.470> time<00:06:59.740> to<00:07:00.010> spell<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.310> all<00:07:00.580> out<00:07:00.610> but

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
gonna have time to spell it all out but

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.600 
gonna have time to spell it all out but
I'll<00:07:01.150> just<00:07:01.530> say<00:07:02.530> there<00:07:02.740> are<00:07:02.800> only<00:07:02.830> some<00:07:03.220> kinds

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
I'll just say there are only some kinds

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.700 
I'll just say there are only some kinds
of<00:07:03.700> debugging<00:07:04.240> get<00:07:04.450> the<00:07:04.570> reward<00:07:05.020> and<00:07:05.260> what

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
of debugging get the reward and what

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.350 
of debugging get the reward and what
we're<00:07:05.860> doing<00:07:05.890> is<00:07:06.460> we're<00:07:06.970> using<00:07:08.070> humor<00:07:09.070> as<00:07:09.360> a

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 
we're doing is we're using humor as a

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.490 
we're doing is we're using humor as a
sort<00:07:10.810> of<00:07:10.870> neuro<00:07:11.200> scientific<00:07:11.890> probe<00:07:12.460> by

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
sort of neuro scientific probe by

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.020 
sort of neuro scientific probe by
