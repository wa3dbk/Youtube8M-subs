00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:09.020
 pulling out 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.020
 rear arm mount 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.380
 there on two bolts fastened 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:47.930
 and the bottom of the bill for one goes must 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.930
 leave here is this fold 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:00.550
 just in this place is the back 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.550
 lever mount 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.140
 i'm stretched to size now making a shield 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:50.910
 draw shield 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.450
 otrihtuyu pull the rack forward it 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.130
 behind 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.580
 the door won't close then I'll 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.580
 present front 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.230
 pulling the middle rack 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:48.010
 and the front rack at the same time doing 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.010
 gaps on the left side 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.230
 made gaps on the doors 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.000
 hole through holes 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.540
 to which others will be welded 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.130
 the details 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:11.890
 I made it on the bottom and here on 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.750
 spars above and below so 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.630
 weakening 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.630
 details will not be now 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:31.420
 winches and tie will be present 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:36.720
 body front diagonally not 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:42.190
 the diagonal and the longitudinal length will 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:47.050
 top and bottom tighten with cups until 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:51.430
 I took the right size for this 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:54.030
 I will work and size but the main 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:04.150
 the criterion is of course 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:08.160
 symmetry and diagonal set by 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:15.010
 bottom shot sizes and already grabbed 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:20.500
 now do the longitudinal size of the top 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:24.700
 parts of the mudguard need to be delayed a little 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:29.970
 by 5 millimeters and now I will 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.970
 weld this part 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.900
 so this part of the amplifier is exposed 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:56.040
 I'll weld the weld over here 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.040
 on top of 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.040
 part 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.820
 then this 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:11.360
 amplifier 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:11.360
 on the side and this one on the other side 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.930
 and all will not be able to collect our 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:35.770
 car cooked now I will put the hood 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:42.340
 headlamp wings and collect them in a bunch 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.340
 here are the right wing 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.750
 left wing 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.970
 hood even worse broken weight 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:19.469
 Now, open up and will try on 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.129
 that's what happened 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.389
 but 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:15.110
 not only cilia on headlights husband 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:17.960
 the original deficit and China here any 

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:23.289
 does not stand sideways well and it will be necessary 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:23.289
 touch up space cheek bumper as well 

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:35.380
 and so everything is fine, the sizes are diagonal 

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.380
 everything else is normal 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:39.460
 cars go for painting
