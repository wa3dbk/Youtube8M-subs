third fret first finger pointer on the
second<00:00:49.200> fret<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.120> second<00:00:51.120> string<00:00:52.070> this<00:00:53.070> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
second fret on the second string this is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.580 
second fret on the second string this is
a<00:00:53.250> standard<00:00:53.579> tuning<00:00:53.879> by<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.590> you're

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
a standard tuning by the way and you're

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.229 
a standard tuning by the way and you're
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.920> plucking<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.460> bass<00:00:56.699> string<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
going to be plucking a bass string and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.860 
going to be plucking a bass string and
the<00:00:58.170> third<00:00:58.469> top<00:00:58.680> string<00:00:59.480> which<00:01:00.480> i<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.629> is<00:01:00.809> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
the third top string which i think is a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.640 
the third top string which i think is a
deep<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.579> got<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.080> behavior<00:01:04.080> deep<00:01:04.260> so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
deep so you got your behavior deep so

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.450 
deep so you got your behavior deep so
you're<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.070> be<00:01:05.129> plucking<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you're just going to be plucking that

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.670 
you're just going to be plucking that
back<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.880> forth<00:01:06.260> to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
back and forth to

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.279 
back and forth to
that<00:01:09.680> goes<00:01:09.829> four<00:01:10.039> times<00:01:10.250> one<00:01:10.579> two<00:01:11.060> three<00:01:11.630> four

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
that goes four times one two three four

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.560 
that goes four times one two three four
and<00:01:12.799> then<00:01:13.700> you're<00:01:13.880> just<00:01:13.909> gonna<00:01:14.090> switch<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.509> up

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
and then you're just gonna switch it up

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.260 
and then you're just gonna switch it up
by<00:01:14.810> keeping<00:01:15.439> your<00:01:15.579> ear<00:01:16.579> pointer<00:01:16.939> finger<00:01:17.149> on

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
by keeping your ear pointer finger on

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.440 
by keeping your ear pointer finger on
top<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.439> ring<00:01:18.590> finger<00:01:18.770> goes<00:01:19.670> on<00:01:20.030> that

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
top and your ring finger goes on that

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.240 
top and your ring finger goes on that
other<00:01:20.960> string<00:01:21.409> right<00:01:21.560> there<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:21.920> that's<00:01:22.039> where

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
other string right there so that's where

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.950 
other string right there so that's where
it's<00:01:22.369> at<00:01:22.460> right<00:01:22.520> there<00:01:22.700> so<00:01:23.359> you've<00:01:23.539> parked<00:01:23.810> out

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it's at right there so you've parked out

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:33.419 
it's at right there so you've parked out
for<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.380> so<00:01:24.619> it<00:01:24.679> goes<00:01:24.860> 1<00:01:25.640> 2<00:01:25.670> 3<00:01:26.600> 4<00:01:26.890> 1<00:01:27.890> 2<00:01:27.920> 3<00:01:28.399> 4

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.039 

switch<00:01:34.429> back<00:01:34.670> before<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.000> twice<00:01:35.240> that's<00:01:35.929> your

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
switch back before it twice that's your

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.929 
switch back before it twice that's your
intro<00:01:36.319> then<00:01:36.979> you<00:01:37.069> do<00:01:37.189> that<00:01:37.340> same<00:01:37.549> thing<00:01:37.579> again

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.150 
those you know strength to strength
three<00:02:07.700> times<00:02:07.939> so<00:02:08.209> it<00:02:08.299> goes<00:02:08.450> one<00:02:08.780> two<00:02:09.160> three

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
three times so it goes one two three

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.440 
three times so it goes one two three
four<00:02:10.729> and<00:02:10.759> then<00:02:11.480> you<00:02:11.690> open<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.230> a<00:02:12.260> string<00:02:12.680> plus

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
four and then you open the a string plus

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.750 
four and then you open the a string plus
then<00:02:14.450> down<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.019> g<00:02:15.440> string

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
then down to this g string

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.449 
then down to this g string
you<00:02:17.599> put<00:02:17.810> those<00:02:17.930> twice<00:02:18.230> 1<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:20.349> 10<00:02:21.349> and<00:02:22.189> then<00:02:22.340> he

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
you put those twice 1 to 10 and then he

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.559 
you put those twice 1 to 10 and then he
switched<00:02:22.640> us<00:02:22.849> back<00:02:23.000> up<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.420> 2nd<00:02:24.379> fret<00:02:25.569> 12

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
switched us back up to the 2nd fret 12

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.319 
switched us back up to the 2nd fret 12
as<00:02:27.349> you're<00:02:27.590> plucking<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.980> a<00:02:28.010> chord<00:02:28.459> a<00:02:28.730> string

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
as you're plucking the a chord a string

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.640 
as you're plucking the a chord a string
and<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.599> and<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.110> Beast<00:02:30.349> straight<00:02:30.500> at<00:02:30.590> the

and that and the Beast straight at the
same<00:02:30.829> time<00:02:31.659> just<00:02:32.659> like<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.040> you

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
same time just like that and then you

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.649 
same time just like that and then you
switch<00:02:34.310> back<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.519> that<00:02:34.790> that<00:02:35.090> first<00:02:35.299> part<00:02:35.510> that

00:02:35.649 --> 00:02:35.659 
switch back to that that first part that

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.920 
switch back to that that first part that
we<00:02:35.720> have<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.959> beginning<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:38.420> do<00:02:38.540> that<00:02:38.690> four

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
that twice 12 and then you switch to

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.459 
that twice 12 and then you switch to
this<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.939> like<00:02:58.090> to<00:02:58.180> use<00:02:58.269> my<00:02:58.299> pinky<00:02:58.689> one<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.409> the

this I like to use my pinky one of the
fifth<00:02:59.680> fret<00:02:59.829> might<00:03:00.250> be<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:01.599> songs<00:03:01.840> kind<00:03:02.049> of

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
course 12 is kind of just like a

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.300 
course 12 is kind of just like a
transition<00:03:05.319> back<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.769> same<00:03:05.950> person<00:03:06.280> you

transition back to the same person you
do<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.609> same<00:03:06.790> thing<00:03:07.060> again<00:03:07.920> twice<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.250> in

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
do the same thing again twice so in

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.490 
do the same thing again twice so in
diverse<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.659> do<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.959> same<00:03:11.109> thing<00:03:11.290> twice

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
diverse you do the same thing twice

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:22.400 
diverse you do the same thing twice
that's<00:03:12.069> what<00:03:12.340> it<00:03:12.370> sounds<00:03:12.700> like<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.359> it<00:03:13.420> goes

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.979 

switch<00:03:23.410> over<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.740> lapper

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.089 

so<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.050> server<00:03:32.349> so<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.620> do<00:03:32.770> that<00:03:32.950> to

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
so I server so you do that to

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.190 
so I server so you do that to
temperature<00:03:33.489> this<00:03:34.150> this<00:03:34.390> is<00:03:34.450> your<00:03:34.720> chorus<00:03:35.050> now

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
string right there that's we're going to

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.960 
string right there that's we're going to
plug<00:03:48.250> in<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.489> three<00:03:48.760> times<00:03:48.940> one<00:03:49.420> two<00:03:50.050> three

plug in that three times one two three
and<00:03:51.970> then<00:03:52.120> you<00:03:52.150> put<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.540> open<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.410> a<00:03:53.620> string

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
and then you put this open this a string

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.130 
and then you put this open this a string
then<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.459> pop<00:03:54.760> that<00:03:54.790> first<00:03:55.599> finger<00:03:55.870> down

then you pop that first finger down
there<00:03:56.580> like<00:03:57.580> that<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:57.970> you<00:03:58.030> keep<00:03:58.239> lugging

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
there like that and you keep lugging

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.410 
there like that and you keep lugging
that<00:03:58.629> thing<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.879> plucked<00:04:01.090> out<00:04:01.209> three

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
that thing so you plucked out three

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.650 
that thing so you plucked out three
times<00:04:01.569> one<00:04:01.959> two<00:04:02.470> three<00:04:03.269> then<00:04:04.269> you<00:04:04.360> pick<00:04:04.540> your

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
times one two three then you pick your

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.630 
times one two three then you pick your
paint<00:04:04.900> pinkie<00:04:05.380> put<00:04:05.920> that<00:04:06.099> on<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.250> fourth<00:04:06.489> fret

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
paint pinkie put that on the fourth fret

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.970 
paint pinkie put that on the fourth fret
on<00:04:06.760> that<00:04:07.000> same<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.420> string<00:04:07.840> kind<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.530> interlude

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
on that same a string kind of interlude

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.910 
on that same a string kind of interlude
back<00:04:09.190> into<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.989> back<00:04:10.989> into<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.380> other<00:04:11.530> other

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 
back into the back into the other other

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.160 
back into the back into the other other
strengths<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:12.940> what<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.540> sounds<00:04:13.750> like<00:04:13.810> is<00:04:14.019> this

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
strengths so what it sounds like is this

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.569 
strengths so what it sounds like is this
you<00:04:14.319> could<00:04:14.470> do<00:04:14.560> this<00:04:14.680> four<00:04:15.010> times<00:04:15.040> in<00:04:15.489> the

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
you could do this four times in the

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.610 
you could do this four times in the
course<00:04:15.730> okay<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.359> close

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.140 

you

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.770 

as<00:04:28.540> four<00:04:28.840> times

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.090 

this<00:04:35.780> is<00:04:35.900> how<00:04:35.990> you<00:04:36.050> interlude<00:04:36.470> back<00:04:36.710> into<00:04:36.980> the

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
this is how you interlude back into the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.950 
this is how you interlude back into the
second<00:04:37.430> verse<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:37.850> after<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.480> do<00:04:38.570> that<00:04:38.630> four

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
second verse so after you do that four

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.470 
second verse so after you do that four
times<00:04:38.990> you're<00:04:39.380> going<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.530> go<00:04:39.650> one<00:04:40.040> two<00:04:40.639> three

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
times you're going to go one two three

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.990 
times you're going to go one two three
then<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.440> open<00:04:42.770> string<00:04:42.980> again<00:04:43.070> then<00:04:43.910> you

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
then that open string again then you

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.370 
then that open string again then you
just<00:04:44.150> go<00:04:44.270> right<00:04:44.419> back<00:04:44.570> into<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.840> again<00:04:44.990> on<00:04:45.230> the

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
just go right back into it again on the

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.050 
just go right back into it again on the
s<00:04:45.710> in<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:45.980> second<00:04:46.310> bridge<00:04:46.430> which<00:04:46.639> is<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.880> same

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
s in the second bridge which is the same

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.730 
s in the second bridge which is the same
thing<00:04:47.360> as<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.840> first<00:04:48.050> verse<00:04:48.260> so<00:04:48.500> we're<00:04:48.650> going

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
thing as the first verse so we're going

00:04:48.740 --> 00:05:06.620 
thing as the first verse so we're going
to<00:04:48.830> just<00:04:49.040> play<00:04:49.220> that<00:04:49.370> right<00:04:49.580> through

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:20.980 

you

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.940 

so<00:05:21.990> that's<00:05:22.140> your<00:05:22.230> first<00:05:22.380> and<00:05:22.710> then<00:05:22.800> you<00:05:22.830> go

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 
so that's your first and then you go

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.280 
so that's your first and then you go
into<00:05:23.460> another<00:05:23.610> corset<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:24.810> it's<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.110> same

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
into another corset so it's the same

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.950 
into another corset so it's the same
thing<00:05:25.320> as<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.620> last<00:05:25.800> chorus<00:05:26.160> so<00:05:26.310> it's<00:05:26.490> just

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.540 

that's<00:05:30.960> one<00:05:31.200> time

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.200 

production

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.210
