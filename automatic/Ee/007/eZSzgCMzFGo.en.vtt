00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:08.250
 they have made us believe that money is 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:11.700
 bad that money does not seem to be 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.870
 thing of god money itself is nothing 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.500
 bad is neither good nor bad is a means 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.320
 to get certain things to the best 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.010
 in your life maybe the scarcest of 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.439
 money and maybe your family suffers 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.410
 maybe your loved ones suffer it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.120
 we all know that without money we can not 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.820
 make global changes we want or not is 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 money is like a kind of means 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.670
 in which the world moves something that serves 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.980
 to change things for 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.430
 get the things and the money itself 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.690
 As I said, it's not bad if you do not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.260
 you arrive at the end of the month 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:59.879
 your family suffers your family has a bad time 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.789
 If you have no money people can not 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.339
 to be helped by you, maybe if you see 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.310
 someone poorer than you 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.859
 and you want to buy him food or you want him 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.500
 help if you have no economy if you do not 

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:16.049
 you have money you will not be able to help 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.909
 If you like projects for 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.810
 help the people of the third world to the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.079
 poor people without money do not currently 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.209
 can do anything thinking that it's going to 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.810
 change the world or think that we can 

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:34.229
 eliminate money is something that for now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.890
 it is not possible and it is not viable but there 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.590
 many who speak in the mouth of God as 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.399
 if God spoke to you and said that the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.189
 money or power or abundance is 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.280
 something bad that takes us through evil 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.969
 path does not depend on the use we make 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.619
 of money the universe god even 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:01.920
 Jesus Christ have never said that you are 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.079
 poor you have a bad time that you do not reach 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.250
 end of the month those are some that the 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:12.360
 what they want is to make you 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:17.280
 see or get into a bag where you can not see 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.560
 nothing more and that prevents you from being critical with 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.750
 the society that we live with even the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.220
 beliefs that we have 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.660
 the world has been created to be 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.590
 abundant the universe is abundance 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.920
 anything we look at the 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.920
 nature is creation everything is created all 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.190
 It transforms everything moves and money 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.700
 it's also energy, do not you think that the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.520
 money is a bad thing if you think that the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.190
 people with money is bad is that 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.650
 possibly you are looking at it from a 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.170
 negative point of view because also 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.060
 there are poor people who are bad there are also 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.450
 people who do not have money and it is bad 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.989
 there are also sinners who do not have 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.170
 money and instead there are people with money 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.320
 that does a lot of good that makes it helps 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.810
 many people who create projects for 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.020
 make a better world have sold us that 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.620
 that money is bad and the universe is 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.269
 abundance 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.760
 Many of you have contacted 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.400
 with me possibly maybe you 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.140
 You are watching this video, not that 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.040
 They want to make a pact with the devil 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.980
 so they have power so they have 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.250
 abundance so that they have money but 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.250
 in truth everything in the universe forms 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.769
 part of the same god the same energy and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.650
 therefore all that same energy will 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:49.450
 can give abundance without going through evil 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.000
 way I invite you to search the related 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.440
 the scriptures you seek is shown 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.620
 inside 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.930
 that part that says that money is 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.750
 bad the power 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:06.040
 is bad and when I say power I do not say the 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.380
 power to impose on others you 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.740
 for example if you have a small kitten 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:14.890
 or you have any animal so small you 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.810
 you really have a power over you if 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.260
 Would you like to kill him? 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.320
 mistreat because you are superior to him 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.740
 but you do not because that would channel the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.060
 love towards him that is power is also not 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.060
 bad 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.910
 many make us see that we must be 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.090
 humble that we should not pursue the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.880
 money and all those things no god no 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.980
 he wants that I invite you to change your 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.410
 way of thinking you look 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.220
 truly that with money you can 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:51.850
 do things and that you can change your life 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.650
 you can change goal goals and 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.600
 that you can do a lot of good in this 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.320
 I'm not telling you 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.540
 capitalist but yes that you believe in you that 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.350
 throw away projects that you do 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:09.729
 changes in your life because god if you know 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.280
 listen to good scriptures if you know 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:15.100
 read between lines what he told us 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:18.970
 Jesus Christ you will see that really what 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.650
 wants you to be a complete being that 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:24.160
 have plenty of life 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.620
 spiritual as of your social life as 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.050
 your economic life 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.780
 and without more that he told us about dropbox 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.360
 and I hope you start changing your 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.940
 way of looking at the economy in your own way 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.330
 see the money and the way to see the 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:43.160
 abundance the universe is abundance and 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.919
 I invite you to live in that abundance 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.350
 and if not, I'll show you the way to 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.389
 that you have plenty and it's not a matter of 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.660
 malignant if it is a matter of energy 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.889
 divine is also a thing of god see you 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.889
 in upcoming videos
