00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that goes into the history of the actual

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.899 
that goes into the history of the actual
building<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:13.260> they're<00:01:13.439> modeling<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.280> lot<00:01:14.790> of

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
building that they're modeling a lot of

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.410 
building that they're modeling a lot of
details<00:01:15.299> about<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.909> all<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.210> history

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
details about it and all that history

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.510 
details about it and all that history
and<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.900> usually<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.290> multiple<00:01:19.770> languages<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
and it's usually in multiple languages a

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.179 
and it's usually in multiple languages a
lot<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.180> pictures<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.409> can<00:01:22.560> get<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> good

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
lot of pictures so you can get a good

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.999 
lot of pictures so you can get a good
history<00:01:23.640> lesson<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.320> think<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
history lesson so that I think this is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.899 
history lesson so that I think this is
even<00:01:26.280> though<00:01:27.000> it's<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> little<00:01:27.210> pricey<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
even though it's a little pricey for the

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.310 
even though it's a little pricey for the
amount<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.970> pieces<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.450> get<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.170> it's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
amount of pieces you get I think it's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.700 
amount of pieces you get I think it's
worth<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.640> education<00:01:33.299> value<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
worth it for the education value that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.730 
worth it for the education value that
your<00:01:35.220> children<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.970> learn<00:01:36.210> about<00:01:36.840> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
your children can learn about the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.200 
your children can learn about the
different<00:01:38.159> models<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.670> they're<00:01:38.970> building

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
different models that they're building

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.840 
different models that they're building
of<00:01:40.079> course<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:40.619> adults<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.490> want<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
of course as adults you know we want the

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.370 
of course as adults you know we want the
big<00:01:42.090> epic<00:01:42.869> looking<00:01:43.770> giant<00:01:44.369> sets<00:01:44.659> but<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:46.020> think

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
big epic looking giant sets but I think

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.620 
big epic looking giant sets but I think
these<00:01:46.530> Lego<00:01:46.829> architecture<00:01:47.340> sets<00:01:48.180> serve<00:01:48.420> their

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
these Lego architecture sets serve their

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.630 
these Lego architecture sets serve their
purpose<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.259> they're<00:01:49.380> really<00:01:49.500> well<00:01:49.740> done<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
purpose and they're really well done and

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.310 
purpose and they're really well done and
it's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> good<00:01:51.090> series<00:01:51.390> that<00:01:51.600> Lego<00:01:51.780> has<00:01:52.079> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
it's a good series that Lego has and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's a good series that Lego has and
they<00:01:52.380> give<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.680> good<00:01:52.829> box<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:54.720> storm<00:01:55.020> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
they give you a good box to to storm in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.620 
they give you a good box to to storm in
and<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:57.990> designer<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.619> featured

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
and you know the designer is featured

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
and you know the designer is featured
and<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:00.899> they're<00:02:01.049> very<00:02:01.259> good<00:02:01.409> for<00:02:01.649> storage

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and so they're very good for storage

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.940 
and so they're very good for storage
do<00:02:04.180> get<00:02:04.360> a<00:02:04.390> few<00:02:04.570> extra<00:02:04.600> parts<00:02:05.200> with<00:02:05.350> this<00:02:05.530> and

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
do get a few extra parts with this and

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.380 
do get a few extra parts with this and
then<00:02:06.040> they<00:02:06.160> usually<00:02:06.340> give<00:02:06.670> you<00:02:06.700> dimensions

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
then they usually give you dimensions

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.720 
then they usually give you dimensions
and<00:02:07.720> things<00:02:08.020> like<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:08.380> on<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.830> that's

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730

the<00:02:09.850> way<00:02:09.940> it's<00:02:10.090> being<00:02:10.270> with<00:02:10.510> all<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.900> our

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
the way it's being with all of our

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.520 
the way it's being with all of our
particular<00:02:12.160> sets<00:02:12.580> I've<00:02:12.790> looked<00:02:13.030> at<00:02:13.290> so<00:02:14.290> here's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
particular sets I've looked at so here's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.340 
particular sets I've looked at so here's
the<00:02:14.680> model<00:02:15.040> and<00:02:15.700> also<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.540> architecture

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
the model and also with the architecture

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:19.410 
the model and also with the architecture
sets<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.740> get<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> printed<00:02:18.310> piece<00:02:18.520> it<00:02:19.210> says

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
sets you get the printed piece it says

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.750 
sets you get the printed piece it says
big<00:02:19.600> man<00:02:19.870> not<00:02:20.320> no<00:02:20.500> stickers<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.160> any<00:02:21.520> of<00:02:21.640> these

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
big man not no stickers and any of these

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.460 
big man not no stickers and any of these
or<00:02:22.270> most<00:02:22.480> of<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.660> ones<00:02:22.840> I've<00:02:23.020> looked<00:02:23.200> at<00:02:23.350> the

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
or most of the ones I've looked at the

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.220 
or most of the ones I've looked at the
hem<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.860> stickers<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.720> these<00:02:25.720> are<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> real

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
hem and stickers and these are a real

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.920 
hem and stickers and these are a real
high<00:02:26.410> quality<00:02:26.790> set<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.510> of<00:02:28.600> course<00:02:28.780> it's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
high quality set and of course it's

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.580 
high quality set and of course it's
mostly<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.380> lot<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:30.420> common<00:02:31.420> pieces<00:02:31.660> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
mostly a lot of common pieces you

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.220 
mostly a lot of common pieces you
probably<00:02:33.040> could<00:02:33.400> build<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.850> if<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:35.020> just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
probably could build this if you just

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.360 
probably could build this if you just
acquired<00:02:35.590> all<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.510> grilles<00:02:37.510> and<00:02:37.960> one<00:02:38.920> by<00:02:39.070> ones

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
acquired all the grilles and one by ones

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.900 
acquired all the grilles and one by ones
and<00:02:39.760> round<00:02:40.410> bricks<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.890> things<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.760> could

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
and round bricks and things you could

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.170 
and round bricks and things you could
probably<00:02:43.090> build<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.400> very<00:02:45.610> good<00:02:45.790> model

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
probably build it it's a very good model

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.430 
probably build it it's a very good model
of<00:02:46.300> course<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:46.960> don't<00:02:47.110> get<00:02:47.200> all<00:02:47.350> the

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
of course you don't get all the

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.190 
of course you don't get all the
Westminster<00:02:48.130> we're<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.870> focusing<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.020> the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
Westminster we're just focusing on the

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.850 
Westminster we're just focusing on the
tower<00:02:50.470> part<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.280> and<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.780> see<00:02:52.990> my<00:02:53.440> daughter

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
tower part of it and the see my daughter

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.470 
tower part of it and the see my daughter
built<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.250> see<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:54.700> times<00:02:54.970> are<00:02:55.240> all<00:02:55.330> the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
built this see of the times are all the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.020 
built this see of the times are all the
same<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.650> could<00:02:56.830> make<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> times<00:02:57.400> different

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
same you could make the times different

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.210 
same you could make the times different
you<00:02:58.150> didn't<00:02:58.450> orient<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.990> print<00:02:59.920> this<00:03:00.010> as<00:03:00.190> a

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
you didn't orient the print this as a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.890 
you didn't orient the print this as a
printed<00:03:00.580> piece<00:03:00.760> here<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.150> get<00:03:01.270> four<00:03:01.510> clocks

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
printed piece here you get four clocks

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.310 
printed piece here you get four clocks
so<00:03:02.590> very<00:03:02.800> good<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.340> good<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.870> does<00:03:05.050> look

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
so very good very good so it does look

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.460 
so very good very good so it does look
very<00:03:05.350> similar<00:03:06.100> to<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.490> real<00:03:07.020> Westminster<00:03:08.020> Big

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470
