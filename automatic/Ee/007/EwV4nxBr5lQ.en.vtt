00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.429
 the staff is all good 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.219
 in today's video I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.769
 make the braid cascade and she is a little 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.289
 complicated but I advise you to 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.930
 to do is try to make you watching a 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.580
 video along with me there already aimed at hurts 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.789
 a little arm then gives an elongated 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.779
 dinho before you start and but is not 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.260
 impossible 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.150
 Let's sit down I braided and snapped. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.329
 the hair because I think it stands out well 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.489
 more layers but nothing prevents you from 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.700
 use it with book also sure we 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.700
 over there 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.440
 Good people, this braid you have two. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.360
 options or with the side of your 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.329
 fringe you prefer 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.879
 or it is divided in half to can not 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.850
 also went down there to get whatever I will 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.770
 start with it in the middle 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 looks will catch and the beginning of his 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.270
 fringe and divide into three as if it were 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:10.650
 begin to bring the traditional 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:16.490
 split and I entered and you will start 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:19.080
 downstairs and above normal 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.430
 now if I were going to continue I would pass 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 This one up but I 'm going to drop it. 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:30.990
 and I'm going to get a piece of 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.630
 even hair and go to next the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.960
 people were going to go over you're going 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.170
 food a little hard here 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.030
 brings recessed month only on one side 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.600
 so I tried to put a bit of 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.600
 hair 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:55.810
 it now reads that we pass here 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:59.220
 will let go and get this hair and pass 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:05.920
 on top and another wants to go over 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:09.780
 will feed with a little hair and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.780
 Look this, I'm going to release it. 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.790
 I came back now and you can apply this stop. 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:19.799
 So I'll let go and get a hair out. 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.799
 from it that is already loose 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.599
 now here at the end 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.219
 as I do not have more hair to 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.980
 continue here because I've lost in 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:58.799
 fringe will continue to braid to make 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.659
 to finish with it had not done 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.209
 the braid and it will get me up 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:05.099
 then I advise you to continue through 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.549
 a little bit of the braid here 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:15.510
 underneath because then it weighs him then 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:24.180
 do not stand up for china said 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:27.240
 connie both you and this braid also 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.039
 you have smooth joseph option or give a box 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.460
 on the edge and I'll do a little bit to 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:31.460
 you will see 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.770
 We just finished curling our hair. 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.960
 to show you the other option 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.639
 also it gives to use if you do not 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.200
 want to leave their braids another 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:15.169
 here you can use it with a comic strip 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.330
 and you lose a clamp down here only 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.160
 For hiding it will camouflage itself 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.040
 here in the middle of the layers 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.390
 I wanted to let go of myself or 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.820
 so this is what I hope you liked 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.919
