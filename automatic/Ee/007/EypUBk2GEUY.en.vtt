00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.939 

so<00:00:00.539> the<00:00:00.659> next<00:00:00.840> thing<00:00:01.020> that<00:00:01.230> we<00:00:01.500> have<00:00:01.770> to

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so the next thing that we have to

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.869 
so the next thing that we have to
consider<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.639> error<00:00:03.600> handling<00:00:04.370> now<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.430> way

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
consider is error handling now the way

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.849 
consider is error handling now the way
that<00:00:06.089> we're<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.450> do<00:00:06.660> this<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.140> by<00:00:07.620> using

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
that we're going to do this is by using

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.499 
that we're going to do this is by using
whoops<00:00:08.490> it's<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.750> page<00:00:09.990> P<00:00:10.290> package<00:00:10.800> which<00:00:11.099> makes

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
whoops it's a page P package which makes

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.269 
whoops it's a page P package which makes
air<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.840> much<00:00:13.080> easier<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:14.330> read<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.360> debug<00:00:16.279> you

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
air is much easier to read and debug you

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.859 
air is much easier to read and debug you
may<00:00:17.460> recognize<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.330> screen<00:00:18.720> from<00:00:19.140> laravel<00:00:20.869> so

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
may recognize the screen from laravel so

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.320 
may recognize the screen from laravel so
that's<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.550> what<00:00:23.699> we're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.210> in

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that's that so what we're going to do in

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.599 
that's that so what we're going to do in
this<00:00:24.570> video<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:25.109> actually<00:00:25.529> install<00:00:26.310> whoops

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this video is actually install whoops

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.480 
this video is actually install whoops
and<00:00:26.939> get<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.990> up<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.199> running<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> do<00:00:29.460> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
and get it up and running so to do this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.659 
and get it up and running so to do this
we're<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> go<00:00:30.269> into<00:00:30.539> our<00:00:30.750> VM<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.669> we're

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
we're going to go into our VM and we're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're going to go into our VM and we're
going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.020> CD<00:00:34.020> into<00:00:34.680> our<00:00:35.040> directory<00:00:37.850> so<00:00:38.850> we're

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
going to CD into our directory so we're

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.220 
going to CD into our directory so we're
going<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> search<00:00:39.600> composer<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.829> whoops<00:00:41.760> and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
going to search composer for whoops and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
going to search composer for whoops and
any<00:00:43.230> second<00:00:43.860> now<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:44.040> list<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:44.730> repositories

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
any second now a list of repositories

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.279 
any second now a list of repositories
will<00:00:45.539> pop<00:00:45.750> up<00:00:46.550> effects<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.899> going<00:00:49.140> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
will pop up effects so we are going to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.889 
will pop up effects so we are going to
take<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.680> first<00:00:49.980> one<00:00:50.219> here<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:51.870> just

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
take this first one here so we're just

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.740 
take this first one here so we're just
going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> require<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.320> there<00:00:55.320> we<00:00:55.410> go

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to require that in and there we go

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to require that in and there we go
so<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.930> have<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> actually<00:00:58.559> code<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.660> so

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so now we have to actually code this so

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.439 
so now we have to actually code this so
inside<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.350> application<00:01:02.160> class<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> our<00:01:03.090> run

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
inside our application class and our run

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.240 
inside our application class and our run
method<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.860> create<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.220> new

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
method we're going to create a new

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
method we're going to create a new
method<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> call

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
method down here and we're going to call

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.870 
method down here and we're going to call
this<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.520> whoops<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.700> method<00:01:11.700> name

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
this in it whoops and the method name

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.730 
this in it whoops and the method name
pretty<00:01:12.540> much<00:01:12.750> gives<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> away<00:01:13.229> all<00:01:13.560> we're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
pretty much gives it away all we're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
pretty much gives it away all we're
going<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.100> inside<00:01:14.369> here<00:01:14.670> is<00:01:14.700> initialize

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
going to do inside here is initialize

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.130 
going to do inside here is initialize
whoops<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> we're<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> call<00:01:17.670> this

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
whoops and we're going to call this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.550 
whoops and we're going to call this
inside<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.530> run<00:01:19.740> method<00:01:21.229> so<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.530> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
inside the run method so to do this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.770 
inside the run method so to do this
we're<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.790> use<00:01:24.290> oops<00:01:25.290> run<00:01:26.250> and

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
we're going to have to use oops run and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.609 
we're going to have to use oops run and
we'll<00:01:27.780> Elias<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:29.900> we're<00:01:30.900> also<00:01:31.049> going<00:01:31.380> to

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
we'll Elias that and we're also going to

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
we'll Elias that and we're also going to
use<00:01:32.130> whoops<00:01:32.960> handler<00:01:34.040> pretty<00:01:35.040> page<00:01:35.520> handler

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
use whoops handler pretty page handler

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
use whoops handler pretty page handler
as<00:01:36.439> whoops<00:01:37.439> pretty<00:01:37.829> page<00:01:38.490> handler<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:40.400> let's

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
as whoops pretty page handler and let's

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.469 
as whoops pretty page handler and let's
get<00:01:41.700> rid<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.909> s<00:01:42.530> okay<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.590> now<00:01:44.360> what<00:01:45.360> we're

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
get rid of that s okay so now what we're

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.050 
get rid of that s okay so now what we're
going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.810> do<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.430> instantiate<00:01:47.430> whoops<00:01:47.759> are

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
going to do is instantiate whoops are

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.980 
going to do is instantiate whoops are
the<00:01:48.899> whoops<00:01:49.110> run<00:01:49.470> class<00:01:50.299> so<00:01:51.299> what's<00:01:51.540> equals

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the whoops run class so what's equals

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.020 
the whoops run class so what's equals
new<00:01:52.520> whoops<00:01:53.520> run<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:55.250> then<00:01:56.250> we're<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
new whoops run and then we're going to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.319 
new whoops run and then we're going to
say<00:01:57.509> whoops<00:01:58.670> push<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.090> LA<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:02.070> fact<00:02:02.759> first<00:02:03.119> we

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
say whoops push and LA in fact first we

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.810 
say whoops push and LA in fact first we
have<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.509> create<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> handler<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> say

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
have to create the handler so say

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.779 
have to create the handler so say
handler<00:02:06.240> equals<00:02:06.570> new<00:02:06.780> whoops<00:02:07.710> pretty<00:02:08.190> page

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
handler equals new whoops pretty page

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.050 
handler equals new whoops pretty page
handler<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:10.129> then<00:02:11.129> we're<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.640> push<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
handler and then we're going to push the

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.630 
handler and then we're going to push the
handler

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
handler

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.850 
handler
and<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:15.480> we're<00:02:15.630> just<00:02:15.660> going<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.080> register

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and then we're just going to register

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.410 
and then we're just going to register
that<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.340> then<00:02:17.910> we'll<00:02:18.150> just<00:02:18.360> return<00:02:18.620> this<00:02:20.420> so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
that and then we'll just return this so

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.210 
that and then we'll just return this so
let's<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.750> check<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.530> make<00:02:22.800> sure<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.130> we

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
let's just check to make sure that we

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.030 
let's just check to make sure that we
don't<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.580> any<00:02:23.820> errors<00:02:24.240> which<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.480> don't

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
don't get any errors which we don't

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.000 
don't get any errors which we don't
perfect<00:02:26.210> so<00:02:27.210> what<00:02:27.450> happens<00:02:27.840> if<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.290> now<00:02:28.500> throw

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
perfect so what happens if we now throw

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.980 
perfect so what happens if we now throw
