00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.620
 about 500,000 children from 25 of the primary schools participate as well

 centralize the inner city of maastricht the problems come to mind 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.030
 these kids certainly don't make them change for socializing too 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.990
 resist the blame then bite 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.259
 and I think that's pretty funny 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.119
 after that you are always your own city and mom or places in two sets 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.080
 And then that is a chance that after being with the whole class but at the national 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.290
 School breakfast is actually meant to get the children to breakfast because 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.449
 It is of course nationwide that many children go to school without breakfast 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:35.920
 come 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.170
 for our turn it is the target group here 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.250
 it is not so important to just join in with the kids when 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.520
 you have breakfast together he knows for himself when there can bite on debt today 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.800
 This year because it is important that Kim's age 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.020
 a little on my voice you don't have that much energy on that day 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:56.950
 who the Belgian 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.020
 range of charity 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.020
 yes there you have many couples 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 it is ignored to be healthy at the riots after being true 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.549
 jakarta anp when it is very important to you that these are of course none 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.549
 children in the fort is that this is really a waste of time going to a school counselor 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.230
 could be 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.460
 because a bit of a boost was ever created this year 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.030
 whistleblower that then apparently there is a difference between maybe the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.020
 larger cities not well yes I think that has an appointment with pediatricians 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.780
 have disadvantaged environments 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.240
 take it I am naturally you have a lot of people a lot of time to pay 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 I can tell myself 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.940
 at least the fourth time I think that's a lot of stimulation 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 underlying thought of what is after this one so favorably 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.750
