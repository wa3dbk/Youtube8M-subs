00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
one right one up from that we have

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.939 
one right one up from that we have
static<00:04:18.729> barrier<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.750> creates<00:04:20.380> a<00:04:20.530> shield

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
static barrier this creates a shield

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.770 
static barrier this creates a shield
that<00:04:21.099> absorbs<00:04:21.159> a<00:04:21.729> high<00:04:21.909> amount<00:04:22.150> of<00:04:22.330> damage<00:04:22.659> and

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
that absorbs a high amount of damage and

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240 
that absorbs a high amount of damage and
it's<00:04:22.930> got<00:04:23.110> this<00:04:23.229> kind<00:04:23.469> of<00:04:23.560> cool<00:04:23.770> electric

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
it's got this kind of cool electric

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.209 
it's got this kind of cool electric
tendril<00:04:24.880> effect<00:04:25.180> that<00:04:25.840> keeps<00:04:26.469> the<00:04:26.710> shield<00:04:27.010> in

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:27.219 
tendril effect that keeps the shield in

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:29.250 
tendril effect that keeps the shield in
place<00:04:27.250> so<00:04:28.029> that's<00:04:28.419> good<00:04:28.690> probably<00:04:28.960> want<00:04:29.229> to

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
place so that's good probably want to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.500 
place so that's good probably want to
keep<00:04:29.320> that<00:04:29.529> up<00:04:29.650> as<00:04:29.800> much<00:04:30.010> as<00:04:30.250> possible

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
keep that up as much as possible

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.600 
keep that up as much as possible
and<00:04:31.600> another<00:04:32.080> thing<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.440> note<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:32.890> got<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.310> six

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
and another thing to note it's got a six

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.580 
and another thing to note it's got a six
second<00:04:34.060> cooldown<00:04:34.360> so<00:04:34.810> that's<00:04:34.990> pretty<00:04:35.320> damn

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
second cooldown so that's pretty damn

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.020 
second cooldown so that's pretty damn
overpower<00:04:36.100> I'm<00:04:36.490> sure<00:04:36.700> they're<00:04:36.880> going<00:04:36.970> to

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030

change<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.570> this<00:04:38.470> is<00:04:38.620> beta<00:04:38.860> but<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.280> wonder

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
change that this is beta but I wonder

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.490 
change that this is beta but I wonder
who<00:04:40.120> thought<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:41.080> would<00:04:41.170> be<00:04:41.200> a<00:04:41.290> good<00:04:41.440> idea

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
who thought that would be a good idea

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.320 
who thought that would be a good idea
because<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.430> absorbs<00:04:42.670> a<00:04:42.880> lot<00:04:42.910> of<00:04:43.030> damage<00:04:43.180> with

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
because it absorbs a lot of damage with

because it absorbs a lot of damage with
their<00:04:43.450> mind<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:44.020> down<00:04:44.170> from<00:04:44.260> that<00:04:44.440> you

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
you're out of combat you just kind of

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.190 
you're out of combat you just kind of
stroll<00:05:28.030> around<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.390> bit<00:05:28.510> drawn<00:05:28.750> energy<00:05:29.080> the

little bit of damage and also stuns them
for<00:05:53.110> four<00:05:53.320> seconds<00:05:53.920> so<00:05:53.950> this<00:05:54.220> is<00:05:54.400> a<00:05:54.580> good

twenty-five percent and this stacks up

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.660 
twenty-five percent and this stacks up
to<00:07:01.960> four<00:07:02.470> times<00:07:02.680> a<00:07:02.980> net<00:07:03.100> effect<00:07:03.280> last<00:07:03.460> ten

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:03.670 
to four times a net effect last ten

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:06.000 
to four times a net effect last ten
seconds<00:07:04.030> so<00:07:04.330> the<00:07:04.840> more<00:07:05.020> you<00:07:05.260> get<00:07:05.530> mana<00:07:05.770> back

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:06.010 
seconds so the more you get mana back

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:07.920 
seconds so the more you get mana back
you<00:07:06.190> won't<00:07:06.340> be<00:07:06.550> able<00:07:06.640> to<00:07:06.970> regenerate<00:07:07.450> your<00:07:07.690> own

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
you won't be able to regenerate your own

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.690 
you won't be able to regenerate your own
force<00:07:08.170> and<00:07:08.410> the<00:07:08.470> force<00:07:08.500> regeneration<00:07:09.490> in<00:07:09.610> this

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:09.700 
force and the force regeneration in this

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.100 
force and the force regeneration in this
game<00:07:09.910> for<00:07:10.030> what<00:07:10.210> I've<00:07:10.330> seen<00:07:10.540> is<00:07:10.720> actually

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:11.110 
game for what I've seen is actually

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.770 
game for what I've seen is actually
pretty<00:07:11.500> high<00:07:11.890> so<00:07:12.370> you're<00:07:13.120> gonna<00:07:13.240> have<00:07:13.510> to<00:07:13.660> be

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
pretty high so you're gonna have to be

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.840 
pretty high so you're gonna have to be
careful<00:07:14.530> when<00:07:14.680> you<00:07:14.830> use<00:07:14.860> this<00:07:15.340> to<00:07:15.550> make<00:07:15.670> sure

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:15.850 
careful when you use this to make sure

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.170 
careful when you use this to make sure
you<00:07:16.030> have<00:07:16.740> force<00:07:17.740> all<00:07:17.980> the<00:07:18.100> time<00:07:18.310> and<00:07:18.520> also

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
you have force all the time and also

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.360 
you have force all the time and also
just<00:07:19.630> to<00:07:19.750> make<00:07:19.930> sure<00:07:19.960> you're<00:07:20.770> not<00:07:21.010> completely

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:21.370 
just to make sure you're not completely

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.350 
just to make sure you're not completely
relying<00:07:21.850> on<00:07:21.970> that<00:07:22.180> because<00:07:22.480> sift<00:07:23.290> sorcerers

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 
relying on that because sift sorcerers

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.620 
relying on that because sift sorcerers
won't<00:07:25.360> have<00:07:25.510> many<00:07:25.660> self<00:07:26.350> hills<00:07:27.420> anyway<00:07:28.420> let's

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:28.630 
won't have many self hills anyway let's

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.540 
won't have many self hills anyway let's
move<00:07:28.690> on<00:07:28.990> to<00:07:29.110> overload<00:07:29.740> the<00:07:29.770> last<00:07:30.130> ability

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
move on to overload the last ability

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.960 
move on to overload the last ability
found<00:07:30.880> at<00:07:31.030> the<00:07:31.180> bottom<00:07:31.390> this<00:07:32.260> is<00:07:32.500> an<00:07:33.010> area<00:07:33.670> you

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:33.970 
found at the bottom this is an area you

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.820 
found at the bottom this is an area you
use<00:07:34.180> it<00:07:34.330> it<00:07:34.450> deals<00:07:34.660> a<00:07:35.080> certain<00:07:35.620> amount<00:07:35.710> of

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830 
use it it deals a certain amount of

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.230 
use it it deals a certain amount of
damage<00:07:36.100> where<00:07:36.310> you<00:07:36.400> are<00:07:36.550> and<00:07:36.640> it<00:07:36.760> knocks<00:07:37.030> all

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:37.240 
damage where you are and it knocks all

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.970 
damage where you are and it knocks all
enemies<00:07:37.660> back<00:07:37.870> so<00:07:38.080> this<00:07:38.200> is<00:07:38.320> useful<00:07:38.500> for

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 
enemies back so this is useful for

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.090 
enemies back so this is useful for
escaping<00:07:39.910> merely<00:07:40.630> goers<00:07:40.990> or<00:07:41.260> large<00:07:41.800> groups

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
escaping merely goers or large groups

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.430 
escaping merely goers or large groups
anyway<00:07:42.910> I<00:07:42.940> hope<00:07:43.210> you've<00:07:43.420> enjoyed<00:07:43.510> the<00:07:44.110> video
