00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello everyone the sequel didn't need the world 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.170
 movie captain america first avenger 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:12.050
 she is unlikely we will go to the sequel to the film 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.050
 captain america first avenger oh yeah and 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.330
 let's start with the movie captain america 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.210
 the first avenger I would attribute to the worst 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.090
 a movie about superheroes of all time and this 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.949
 not even my personal opinion at all 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.230
 don't really like titular american 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.599
 superheroes what superman audyssey what 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.600
 captain america y marvel and the thing is 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.820
 that they are just boring too cardboard 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.950
 too patterned too crowded 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 famous american patriotism cheers 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 we love the wolverine Deadpool and the joker 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 the guys in red and blue are somehow not very 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.899
 favor the first movie about captain america 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.969
 was just awful judge for yourself the plot 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 mediocre picture disgusting 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.680
 villains Well quite simply a caricature 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 The main duck and does a rubber crank 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.590
 masks opponents are trying to delay 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.510
 hero fiery rhombuses imagine 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.189
 as fascists in free time from drill 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.650
 learned to build geometric 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 figures with the help of Walter flame throwers 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.299
 I burned 15 villages again on the map 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.000
 It turned out smiley and of course love 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.880
 line which would be nice if chalk 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 any word meaning if it were not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.540
 There were such films as 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.350
 phantom racer 2 electro or 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.600
 daredevil 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.759
 I would say that Captain America is 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.280
 worst super heroic movie ever 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.150
 but he is still not much better than all 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.810
 listed 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.119
 and not the fact that it is generally better however 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.090
 intervened avengers forcing look 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.250
 Kepa at least quite good action heroes to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 the same after the release of the new trailer 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.049
 the film in the soul warmed timid hope 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.960
 that he may be very 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.790
 not bad film that will be released in Russia with 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.549
 name first avenger another war 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.040
 instead captain america winter soldier 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.079
 by the way is not the arbitrariness of our localizers 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.659
 still at the time of the first movie 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.570
 captain america the first avenger for 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.570
 Russia Ukraine and South Korea he received 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.640
 the name is just the first avenger also 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.770
 obviously happened with the second movie 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.600
 and what 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.180
 It is clear that the distributors fear that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.000
 the first version of the name will be unpleasant 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.630
 for the ear of the communists well, or who they are with there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.330
 think 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.940
 although it would seem where does South Korea 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.910
 I understood if they spoke at least a northern 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.730
 and so the main opponent is captain in 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.100
 This film will make a winter soldier and you 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.900
 already understand why he is winter but 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.600
 of course because he is a Russian agent 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.320
 but obviously because we have winter 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.120
 all year round but dumb and so winter 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.940
 a soldier in classic cap history 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.280
 is his friend bucky which is long 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.710
 time spoke to his companions and after 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.220
 alleged death lost memory 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.950
 Russians saved the left hand 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.350
 special services recruited but also yes 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.260
 bionic arm but that he became at all 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.630
 cool with time the truth is faced 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.880
 by the captain america himself returned the tanks 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.890
 imagine the memory re-educated and even 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.580
 subsequently took the place of steve rogers 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.080
 taking on the role of captain america with 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.020
 character tank we already had 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.970
 meet in the first movie and obviously 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.430
 that his story will undergo noticeable 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.480
 changes and in his fate a big role 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:26.180
 will play hydra over this slogan by the way 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.400
 laughed even american critics what 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.890
 curious in the comics winter soldier 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.360
 worked for a long time side by side with black 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.910
 widow role which in 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.170
 marvel cinematic universe 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.090
 performs scarlett johansson 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.530
 but judging by the trailer in this universe 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.080
 heroes are not familiar 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.970
 also intriguing question if this movie 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.670
 will be devoted to internal disassembly 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.130
 accounts as promised by the creators and Russian 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.230
 special services will not appear here then 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.980
 what the hell is for the winter soldier red 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.980
 star on the shoulder 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.019
 the next new superhero who 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.299
 the falcon will light up in the clip 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.090
 a hawk eye marvel that is not an action 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.909
 so a textbook ornithology film its role 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.489
 Anthony Maki Falcon will become a friend 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.829
 and partner steve rogers he too 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.049
 retired soldier and went through a lot 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:17.900
 I give a tooth that he will be called either 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.359
 the hero of Afghanistan or the heroes of Iraq is not 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.180
 every movie Johnny cancer hero 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:26.389
 personally killed 340 people shock 4 village 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.479
 beat to death 13 prisoners of war hero 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:32.389
 iraq he is a simple american boy 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:35.570
 who defended his country to another 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.490
 Falcon's country is the second black 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.940
 a hero in the history of the marvel universe 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.520
 Nobody created it but Stanley himself 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.949
 spiderman father hulka fantastic 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.599
 Four people X 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.240
 among falcon abilities by the way 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.940
 there was a telepathic connection with 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.860
 birds and it definitely makes him 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.930
 snow white is certainly not the most 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.449
 impressive ability but we 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.460
 most likely in the film will not see but 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.800
 famous falcon costume stocked 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.229
 winged and jet turbine it seems 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.729
 will be one of the notable new buns 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.860
 the movie 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.289
 like bucky falcon character completely 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.720
 unfamiliar to our viewer and the reaction to 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:16.970
 these characters will be entirely dependent 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.370
 from talent to screenwriters and acting 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.960
 mastery of sebastian sten and anthony 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.729
 poppies 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.190
 also in the film the baron should shine 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.320
 von Strucker not to be confused with a Stryker 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.659
 also mercury and scarlet witch 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.120
 which will become prominent characters in 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.800
 continuation of the avengers about whom we 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.020
 be sure to talk next 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.099
 release which will be devoted to the film 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.979
 avengers 2 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:42.050
 the age of altron and for me personally remains 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.849
 mystery why all of a sudden 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.889
 hysteria shove more 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.139
 the number of characters in each new 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.780
 the film is like the studios are afraid that their 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.630
 money will earn someone else columbia 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.789
 pictures in one movie about spiderman 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.860
 shoved as many as three new villains and even 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:06:00.080
 restarts the fantastic four 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.659
 which then wants to connect with 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.060
 20th century spiderman universe fox 

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.810
 plans another whole series of new films 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.180
 about people 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.040
 x and this despite the fact that in the new film they and 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.680
 so already combined the team from 

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:13.130
 original trilogy and x-men first 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.590
 the class 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.500
 but in the new superman besides batman 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.440
 there will be a miracle woman too 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.960
 enough materials still releases for 200 but 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.480
 question with a friend why such haste 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.820
 yes it's obvious for disi comics because 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.860
 that umar you already have the avengers and the league 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.389
 justice should be more likely to run but 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.730
 why is everyone else up to the studio with the chain 

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:37.190
 broke down but let's go back to 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.200
 film captain america if the first 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.060
 part of the story I did not immediately lay 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.510
 no hope and expect nothing from her 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.669
 the good the trailer 2 allows the tube 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.479
 hope that can come out very much 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.639
 nothing 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:52.070
 besides, those who have already been to 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.960
 pre-premiere film show 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.690

 wait and see well and it was kinofobiya and

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.220
 disappoint everyone bye
