titled be part of the pack and this is a

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.150 
titled be part of the pack and this is a
way<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.569> us<00:00:06.720> to<00:00:06.899> try<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.529> share<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.830> little<00:00:08.040> bit

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
way for us to try to share a little bit

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.009 
way for us to try to share a little bit
about<00:00:08.400> our<00:00:08.550> pack<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:08.790> I'm<00:00:09.120> going<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.300> explain

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
about our pack and I'm going to explain

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.839 
about our pack and I'm going to explain
them<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.710> may<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.010> involved<00:00:11.400> and

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
them how you may be involved and

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.990 
them how you may be involved and
certainly<00:00:12.809> this<00:00:13.040> YouTube<00:00:14.040> seems<00:00:14.549> like<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
certainly this YouTube seems like it's a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.609 
certainly this YouTube seems like it's a
little<00:00:15.179> outdated<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.690> footage<00:00:16.049> but<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.379> fact

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
little outdated with footage but in fact

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.060 
little outdated with footage but in fact
it<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:17.789> last<00:00:18.330> week<00:00:18.600> in<00:00:19.140> April<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.859> have

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
it is just last week in April we have

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.269 
it is just last week in April we have
temperatures<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.789> vary<00:00:21.449> from<00:00:21.920> 70<00:00:22.920> degrees

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
temperatures that vary from 70 degrees

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.370 
temperatures that vary from 70 degrees
down<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.000> 30<00:00:24.210> degrees<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.019> happened<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
down to 30 degrees and this happened to

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
down to 30 degrees and this happened to
be<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.560> cold<00:00:25.920> front<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.310> had<00:00:26.430> moved<00:00:26.580> through

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
be a cold front that had moved through

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.880 
be a cold front that had moved through
and<00:00:27.060> dumped<00:00:27.779> about<00:00:27.960> an<00:00:28.080> inch<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.470> two<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> snow

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and dumped about an inch or two of snow

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
and dumped about an inch or two of snow
early<00:00:29.369> last<00:00:29.580> week<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.869> wolf<00:00:31.019> certainly

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
early last week and the wolf certainly

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.200 
early last week and the wolf certainly
liked<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.070> animals<00:00:32.520> are<00:00:32.669> definitely

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
liked it these animals are definitely

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.270 
liked it these animals are definitely
designed<00:00:33.630> for<00:00:33.809> being<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.410> northern<00:00:35.100> climates

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
designed for being in northern climates

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
designed for being in northern climates
in<00:00:35.850> cooler<00:00:36.300> weather<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.230> hot<00:00:37.440> weather<00:00:37.649> was

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
in cooler weather the hot weather was

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.740 
in cooler weather the hot weather was
getting<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.340> be<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> bit<00:00:38.730> much<00:00:38.969> they<00:00:39.300> didn't

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
getting to be a bit much they didn't

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.869 
getting to be a bit much they didn't
obviously<00:00:40.500> haven't<00:00:41.070> started<00:00:41.340> shedding<00:00:41.579> their

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
obviously haven't started shedding their

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
obviously haven't started shedding their
winter<00:00:42.090> coats<00:00:42.300> yet<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.899> they've<00:00:43.020> got<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> full

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
winter coats yet so they've got a full

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
winter coats yet so they've got a full
winter<00:00:44.100> coat<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.670> when<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> temperatures<00:00:45.300> get

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
winter coat so when the temperatures get

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.990 
winter coat so when the temperatures get
up<00:00:45.570> into<00:00:45.780> B<00:00:45.899> 70s<00:00:46.500> it's<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.550> problematic

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
up into B 70s it's a little problematic

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
up into B 70s it's a little problematic
for<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> Wolves<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.469> they<00:00:49.680> were

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
for the Wolves and so they were

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.010 
for the Wolves and so they were
definitely<00:00:50.219> relieved<00:00:50.850> when<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> cooler

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
definitely relieved when the cooler

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.619 
definitely relieved when the cooler
weather<00:00:52.260> hit<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:53.070> we'll<00:00:53.460> typically<00:00:54.000> see<00:00:54.390> them

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
weather hit and we'll typically see them

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
weather hit and we'll typically see them
to<00:00:55.440> stimulate<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.699> dominance

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to stimulate a little bit more dominance

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.540 
to stimulate a little bit more dominance
and<00:00:57.989> certainly<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.680> tend<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:58.949> investigate

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
and certainly they tend to investigate

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.930 
and certainly they tend to investigate
the<00:00:59.699> smells<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.300> come<00:01:00.870> with<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.440> snow<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.280> as

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
the smells that come with a snow and as

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
the smells that come with a snow and as
you<00:01:03.120> can<00:01:03.239> hear<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> dripping<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you can hear the dripping in the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
you can hear the dripping in the
background<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.880> definitely<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
background this is definitely a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.719 
background this is definitely a
short-lived<00:01:07.439> season<00:01:08.130> as<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.340> matter<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> fact

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
short-lived season as a matter of fact

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.850 
short-lived season as a matter of fact
today<00:01:08.939> as<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.330> finally<00:01:10.170> get<00:01:10.260> time<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.680> produce

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
today as I finally get time to produce

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.100 
today as I finally get time to produce
this<00:01:11.130> video<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:12.119> snows<00:01:12.360> already<00:01:12.659> gone<00:01:12.840> so

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
this video the snows already gone so

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
this video the snows already gone so
it's<00:01:13.409> one<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> those<00:01:13.740> things<00:01:14.010> where<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.790> may<00:01:14.970> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's one of those things where it may be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.300 
it's one of those things where it may be
here<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.600> day<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:15.930> two<00:01:15.960> before<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.100> Sun

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
here for a day or two before the Sun

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760 
here for a day or two before the Sun
melts<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.420> snow<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.320> time<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> year

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
melts the snow and this time of the year

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.410 
melts the snow and this time of the year
but<00:01:20.670> as<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.909> said<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.500> stimulus<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.799> snow

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
but as I said that stimulus of the snow

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
but as I said that stimulus of the snow
is<00:01:24.420> enough<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> make<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.500> little<00:01:25.979> bit<00:01:26.130> more

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is enough to make a little bit more

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.130 
is enough to make a little bit more
dominance<00:01:26.850> than<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.299> been<00:01:27.479> seeing<00:01:27.750> so

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
dominance than we have been seeing so

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.499 
dominance than we have been seeing so
Lunas<00:01:28.530> gonna<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> couple<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> write-ups<00:01:30.299> but

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
Lunas gonna do a couple of write-ups but

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
Lunas gonna do a couple of write-ups but
what's<00:01:30.659> interesting<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.380> Aidan<00:01:32.100> just<00:01:32.130> comes

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
what's interesting is Aidan just comes

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
what's interesting is Aidan just comes
over<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.090> one<00:01:33.299> growl<00:01:33.570> puts<00:01:34.409> an<00:01:34.530> end<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> some

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
over with one growl puts an end to some

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.999 
over with one growl puts an end to some
of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.689> dominance<00:01:36.689> behavior<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
of the dominance behavior and so that is

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.330 
of the dominance behavior and so that is
typically<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.939> sign<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.650> control<00:01:41.100> pack

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
typically the sign of a in control pack

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.039 
typically the sign of a in control pack
leader<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.420> matter<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.659> fact<00:01:42.840> we're

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
leader and as a matter of fact we're

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.940 
leader and as a matter of fact we're
celebrating<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> webinar<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.430> week<00:01:44.899> April

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:23.950 
while I'm recording this YouTube I am

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.650 
while I'm recording this YouTube I am
watching<00:06:24.190> with<00:06:24.490> surveillance<00:06:25.000> cameras<00:06:25.450> and

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
watching with surveillance cameras and

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.780 
watching with surveillance cameras and
there<00:06:25.900> is<00:06:26.020> an<00:06:26.140> eagle<00:06:26.530> that<00:06:26.680> has<00:06:26.860> landed<00:06:27.130> in<00:06:27.550> our

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
enclosure and so we do see that the

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.050 
enclosure and so we do see that the
photographers<00:06:33.850> have<00:06:34.000> a<00:06:34.030> lot<00:06:34.270> to<00:06:34.540> film

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
photographers have a lot to film

00:06:36.060 --> 00:07:14.189
