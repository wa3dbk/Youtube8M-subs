00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.090 
effect let's take a look and see how
long<00:01:56.600> is<00:01:56.869> left<00:01:57.080> on<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.229> clock<00:01:57.530> before<00:01:57.890> it

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
long is left on the clock before it

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.429 
long is left on the clock before it
gives<00:01:58.220> me<00:01:58.400> this<00:01:58.520> challenge<00:01:59.079> so<00:02:00.079> this<00:02:00.229> first

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
gives me this challenge so this first

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.010 
gives me this challenge so this first
one<00:02:00.560> using<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.040> vector<00:02:01.189> here<00:02:01.490> looks<00:02:01.729> like<00:02:02.020> 0.6

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
one using the vector here looks like 0.6

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.980 
one using the vector here looks like 0.6
seconds<00:02:03.829> which<00:02:04.790> is<00:02:04.820> just<00:02:05.270> of<00:02:05.420> course<00:02:05.659> under

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
seconds which is just of course under

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.289 
seconds which is just of course under
the<00:02:06.020> one-second<00:02:06.710> mark<00:02:06.890> this<00:02:07.640> next<00:02:07.970> one<00:02:08.119> on

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:08.299 
the one-second mark this next one on

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:10.449 
the one-second mark this next one on
Prison<00:02:08.780> Break<00:02:08.810> I'm<00:02:09.200> using<00:02:09.380> the<00:02:09.619> Remington<00:02:10.280> and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
I luckily spot this guy at the last

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.330 
I luckily spot this guy at the last
second<00:02:13.430> and<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.760> stops<00:02:14.150> at<00:02:14.420> about<00:02:15.019> 0.7<00:02:16.010> seconds

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
second and it stops at about 0.7 seconds

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.460 
second and it stops at about 0.7 seconds
and<00:02:16.489> then<00:02:16.610> my<00:02:16.730> controller<00:02:17.090> messes<00:02:17.450> up<00:02:17.630> that<00:02:17.810> is

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
and then my controller messes up that is

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.580 
and then my controller messes up that is
so<00:02:18.799> annoying<00:02:19.450> this<00:02:20.450> last<00:02:20.780> one<00:02:21.049> is<00:02:21.200> again<00:02:21.470> on

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
about who looks like 1.5 seconds left

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
about who looks like 1.5 seconds left
and<00:02:27.650> then<00:02:27.739> this<00:02:27.829> guy<00:02:28.010> appears<00:02:28.340> now<00:02:28.519> watch<00:02:28.760> this

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and then this guy appears now watch this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.050 
and then this guy appears now watch this
the<00:02:29.989> timer<00:02:30.260> actually<00:02:30.470> counts<00:02:31.010> down<00:02:31.160> past<00:02:31.640> zero

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the timer actually counts down past zero

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.390 
the timer actually counts down past zero
yeah<00:02:32.930> he<00:02:33.170> wasn't<00:02:33.320> even<00:02:33.560> dead<00:02:33.739> when<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.950> hit<00:02:34.100> zero

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
yeah he wasn't even dead when I hit zero

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.090 
yeah he wasn't even dead when I hit zero
and<00:02:34.730> it<00:02:35.269> gives<00:02:35.450> me<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.840> snooze<00:02:36.410> you<00:02:36.560> lose<00:02:36.739> pet

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100
