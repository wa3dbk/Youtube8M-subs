-Ciao! MAMA MIAA!

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.030
-Move over. I got a degree in advanced joystick theory and I ain't afraid to use it.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.100
-Yeah, I heard you practicing last night.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.440
-Uh, Olivia! Oh Munn! You do it for me everytime!

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.080
There! Done with this hand crocheted towel of Olivia Munn!

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.200
Time to jack off.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.110
-Let me show you how this shit's done, son!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.720
-THE FUCK?! Who took them lights?!

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.060
-I mean we haven't payed the electricity bill
in 7 months.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.580
-We pay for electricity?
-You don't! I do!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.000
-Wait! All of our food's gonna go bad!
-All of our food IS bad!

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.820
-Can't let. Precious food. Go to waste!
-Dude you know that's all expired.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.020
-I DON'T CARE!
-Oh god, not the milk.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.960
-I'll keep you safe in my belly cow juice!
I think I'm gonna vom...

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.440
-Hey listen. I-I got a big problem.
I totally just lied to Pink.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.800
-EEEGS!

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.880
-Her birthday's next week and I told her I got her the greatest gift of all time, but I didn't get her anything!

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.040
-Give her this mayonnaise jar. Aaaaaahh...

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.040
-No. Come on, you know what girls like right?
What should I get her?

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.160
-Hey you should go see The Racc-

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.600
-See who?
-The Raccoo-

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.860
-What are you trying to say?!
-I can only say so many words before I-

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.980
-The Raccoon!
-Ooooh...

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.100
-He's got the coolest stuff.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.660
-Eesh. I don't know if I should get my girlfriend a gift in the pawn shop.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.120
-You should get her this cool hat!

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.260
-Yeah, try it on.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.440
-So, you want a gift for your girrfriend, ehhh?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.900
-Whoa. How'd you know?
-You talk-a very roud.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.220
-Fits perfect!
-DID YOU TOUCH THAT FUCKING BEAR TRAP?!

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.680
-No. Idiot.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.740
-Um so... me and my girlfriend have been dating a long time and I wanna get her something super romantic.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.760
-I've got-a the perfect gift for you.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.020
But first, a story.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.720
-No! Old people stories!

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.020
-A rong time ago, in ancient Japan,
my country was at war.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.320
My small virrage was all that was reft.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.920
Knowing I may die in battle,
I gave my wife our symbol of undying rove.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.860
A Rotus Frower.

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:16.700
Armed with the weapon of my ancestors,
The Great Sword of Destiny,

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.640
I reft to confront my fate.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.660
But the mighty beast Ocho Muerte emerged from the sea and-a took my wife!

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.100
I was too rate!

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.260
In my rage, I fought the Takagami Demon Army

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.430
And srew ten hundred thousand hundred warriors!
Honorabry.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.630
All that remained was-a Rord Takagami himself.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.750
Though wounded, he shattered the brade
and scattered it through the wind.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.820
As he ray dying, he said to me.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.300
-Fuck you!
-He was a douchebag.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.080
-You may have won the battle Raccoon,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.600
but the ghosts of my warriors will haunt The Great Sword of Destiny,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.440
FOREVER!

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.340
-And with-a that he died, but his curse remains,

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.180
guarding the sword against any who may seek to use it's great-a power again.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.840
But the power of the brade was-a too strong
even-a for me.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.540
And in the fury of battre, I found I destroyed not only the Takagami Demon Army,

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.220
but all of Japan!

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.300
Dishonered, my kinsmen banished me from my home!

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.800
Never again, to return.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.520
-Oh! Sorry. I was-a bored my own story.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.500
-Wait, so where's the sword?
-There is onry one reft arive who knows.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.200
-Who?
-Hold up. Why the hell would I get Pink a sword?

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.060
This is retarded!
-NO!

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.500
Bring me the sword and in return, I shall give you the greatest gift a girl--

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.160
NO! A woman--

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.840
NO! A goddess could ever hope to recieve.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.860
-Is it, ma dick?
-Yes.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.380
-Ho, Really?
-No.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.500
Hahaha you're very gurrible.

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.409
-Well, who even knows where it still is?

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.449
-You must-a find the man who considers me
his greatest enemy.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.600
-My son, Son-san!

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.180
-Nope, you're weird.
I'm just gonna go buy her some flowers.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.920
-Shit, I'll find that sword, this sounds awesome!

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.520
-What? Really?
-Yeah, man!

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.200
It's a ten-thousand year-old sword, hidden in Japan, guarded by demon ninjas?!

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.220
That's the most awesome thing I've ever heard of!

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.580
-Dude, you're gonna get yourself killed going after that thing.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.300
-Maybe... but at least I'm not a goddamn pussy!
-I'm not a pussy!

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.900
-You ARE a pussy, with a capitar vagina!

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:56.080
I told you about the brade because I thought
you would have the courage to do something...

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.680
extraordinary!

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:02.040
-Yeah right, all he does all day is sit in his room playing with his joystick.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.900
He'd TOTALLY get killed.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:09.320
-Have fun stayin' home man! I'll send you a postcard!

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:16.080
-This was a mistake. Onry a true hero could
find The Great Sword of Destiny.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.100
But I can see now. it is not you.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.680
-You're wrong!
-Ohh?

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.220
-Yeah! I'm gonna find the shit out of that sword!

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.979
-It's going to be very dangerous.

00:07:32.059 --> 00:07:36.699
-Good! Pussies hate danger! And I'm NOT a pussy!

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.520
Give me that!
-Aw-ha yeah!

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.840
Time to get our quest on! Whoo!
