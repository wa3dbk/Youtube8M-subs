00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
character and I'm thinking about going

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.809 
character and I'm thinking about going
back<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:04.019> starting<00:03:04.829> another<00:03:04.950> character<00:03:05.370> just

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
back and starting another character just

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.159

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
even if I reach level 70 I thought it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.580

treyarch<00:05:01.010> to<00:05:01.160> get<00:05:01.310> back<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.840> reins<00:05:03.080> I

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
treyarch to get back in the reins I

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.770 
treyarch to get back in the reins I
guess<00:05:03.590> back<00:05:04.340> under<00:05:04.610> control<00:05:04.730> of<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.360> series

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
guess back under control of this series

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.320 
guess back under control of this series
because<00:05:06.020> i<00:05:06.320> think<00:05:06.380> my<00:05:06.620> noir<00:05:06.830> 43<00:05:07.190> just<00:05:07.460> it<00:05:08.240> was

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
because i think my noir 43 just it was

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.030 
because i think my noir 43 just it was
just<00:05:08.360> like<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.600> throwaway<00:05:08.960> game<00:05:09.290> if<00:05:09.470> you<00:05:09.770> ask<00:05:09.890> me

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
just like a throwaway game if you ask me

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.710 
just like a throwaway game if you ask me
they<00:05:10.130> have<00:05:10.220> some<00:05:10.370> good<00:05:10.520> stuff<00:05:10.820> like<00:05:11.540> the

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
they have some good stuff like the

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.930 
they have some good stuff like the
killstreak<00:05:12.620> stacking<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.310> point<00:05:13.580> streaks

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
killstreak stacking the point streaks

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.570 
killstreak stacking the point streaks
and<00:05:14.180> getting<00:05:14.990> points<00:05:15.530> for<00:05:15.740> objective<00:05:16.370> play

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
and getting points for objective play

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.930 
and getting points for objective play
but<00:05:16.940> you<00:05:17.630> know<00:05:17.750> I<00:05:17.780> think<00:05:18.050> it's<00:05:18.140> really<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.940> made

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
but you know I think it's really I made

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.580 
but you know I think it's really I made
another<00:05:20.090> commentary<00:05:20.540> about<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:21.110> forest<00:05:21.410> I

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
another commentary about this forest I

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.870 
another commentary about this forest I
touched<00:05:21.920> on<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:22.220> but<00:05:22.340> it's<00:05:22.460> like<00:05:22.550> a<00:05:22.580> step

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
touched on this but it's like a step

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.180 
touched on this but it's like a step
sideways<00:05:23.150> because<00:05:24.050> you<00:05:24.380> didn't<00:05:24.620> go<00:05:24.740> forward

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
sideways because you didn't go forward

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.560 
sideways because you didn't go forward
but<00:05:25.340> you<00:05:25.460> didn't<00:05:25.640> go<00:05:25.700> backwards<00:05:26.120> you<00:05:26.390> just

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
but you didn't go backwards you just

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.590 
but you didn't go backwards you just
step<00:05:27.140> sideways<00:05:27.350> the<00:05:27.830> modern<00:05:28.040> warfare<00:05:28.160> 3<00:05:28.600> so

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
step sideways the modern warfare 3 so

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.020 
step sideways the modern warfare 3 so
