 a fee is an amount to be paid 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.169
 regularly in this case this is the 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.410
 amount due to be able to listen to the radio 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.930
 or watch TV 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.689
 what would change if this 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.790
 amendment of the law is accepted a 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.980
 general fee for television and 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.809
 the radio would be established it

 provided for example for people 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.980
 living in an ems or in a home for 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.079
 students or for companies 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.200
 with an annual turnover of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:55.000
 up to a certain amount 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.890
 the people who is going on radio and 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.540
 of television would not pay this 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.250
 fee for the next five 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.259
 years what are the arguments of the 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.729
 supporters 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.710
 everyone has the opportunity to 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.600
 watch and listen to the radio and the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.969
 television everywhere thanks to phones 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.689
 laptops to tablets or even 

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:16.060
 computers 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.880
 therefore a fee is required 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.719
 on radio and television 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.729
 which fits better with the current reality 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:25.719
 with the general fee on the radio 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.670
 and television 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:33.189
 most households should pay 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.950
 less a year what are the arguments 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.569
 opponents and households that 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.700
 do not listen to the radio and watch 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:45.459
 not the television should also pay 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.319
 this general royalty with the 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.549
 general royalty on radio and 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.139
 television 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.849
 most households should very 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:54.240
 probably pay more in the years 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.240
 to come up 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.630
