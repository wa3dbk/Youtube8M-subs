00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
see in an upcoming video let's talk

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.600 
see in an upcoming video let's talk
about<00:01:30.540> what<00:01:30.750> else<00:01:30.900> we<00:01:30.930> got<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.560> phone<00:01:31.799> so

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
about what else we got on the phone so

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.569 
about what else we got on the phone so
the<00:01:32.880> front<00:01:33.210> here<00:01:33.540> you've<00:01:33.900> got<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.799> believe<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the front here you've got a I believe a

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.330 
the front here you've got a I believe a
VGA<00:01:36.090> resolution<00:01:36.180> camera<00:01:37.020> with<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.619> single<00:01:37.979> LED

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
VGA resolution camera with a single LED

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.010 
VGA resolution camera with a single LED
flash<00:01:38.610> however<00:01:38.970> there's<00:01:39.150> an<00:01:39.240> open<00:01:39.540> spot<00:01:39.659> next

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
flash however there's an open spot next

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
flash however there's an open spot next
to<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.229> led<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:40.950> may<00:01:41.130> actually<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.520> dual

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
to that led so it may actually have dual

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.690 
to that led so it may actually have dual
LED<00:01:42.150> flashes<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> front<00:01:43.200> by<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> time<00:01:44.430> it

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
LED flashes in the front by the time it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.499 
LED flashes in the front by the time it

well you get sort of that ergonomic
raised<00:02:56.620> something<00:02:57.069> we<00:02:57.190> saw<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.700> tilt<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
raised something we saw on the tilt a

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.199 
raised something we saw on the tilt a
while<00:02:59.260> ago<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.310> keyboard<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.819> actually

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
while ago and the keyboard is actually

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.120 
while ago and the keyboard is actually
very<00:03:01.239> easy<00:03:01.630> to<00:03:02.049> use<00:03:02.080> the<00:03:02.380> keys<00:03:02.620> are<00:03:02.769> raised<00:03:03.010> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
very easy to use the keys are raised a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.920 
very easy to use the keys are raised a
lot<00:03:03.310> of<00:03:03.340> tactile<00:03:03.730> feedback<00:03:03.910> clearly<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:04.780> is

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
lot of tactile feedback clearly this is

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.710 
lot of tactile feedback clearly this is
not<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:05.580> North<00:03:06.580> American<00:03:07.060> keyboard<00:03:07.480> there's

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
not a North American keyboard there's

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.960 
not a North American keyboard there's
some<00:03:08.400> letters<00:03:09.400> on<00:03:09.549> there<00:03:09.670> which<00:03:09.760> I've<00:03:09.940> never

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
some letters on there which I've never

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.270 
some letters on there which I've never
seen<00:03:10.180> before<00:03:10.360> presumably<00:03:11.260> therefore<00:03:11.739> finish

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
seen before presumably therefore finish

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.460 
seen before presumably therefore finish
so<00:03:13.060> also<00:03:13.239> we<00:03:13.420> look<00:03:13.540> at<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> phone<00:03:13.900> here<00:03:14.140> I've

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
so also we look at the phone here I've

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.729 
so also we look at the phone here I've
got<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.739> very<00:03:15.100> large<00:03:15.519> space<00:03:16.209> bar<00:03:16.450> the<00:03:17.319> period<00:03:17.650> is

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
got a very large space bar the period is

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.110 
got a very large space bar the period is
right<00:03:17.859> next<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.370> but<00:03:18.609> that<00:03:18.730> doesn't

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
right next to it but that doesn't

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.330 
right next to it but that doesn't
actually<00:03:19.180> work<00:03:19.540> you've<00:03:19.870> got<00:03:20.109> your<00:03:20.769> four-way

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
actually work you've got your four-way

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.699 
actually work you've got your four-way
navigation<00:03:21.910> keys<00:03:22.090> here<00:03:22.299> I've<00:03:22.780> got<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> nicer<00:03:23.620> of

let's<00:03:37.269> got<00:03:37.420> service<00:03:37.720> raised<00:03:38.049> hinge<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
let's got service raised hinge that

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.740 
let's got service raised hinge that
comes<00:03:39.040> out<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.459> phone<00:03:39.640> goes<00:03:39.820> down<00:03:40.060> slides

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
comes out so the phone goes down slides

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.380 
comes out so the phone goes down slides
back<00:03:40.930> into<00:03:41.140> place<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.739> snaps<00:03:42.040> up<00:03:42.280> when<00:03:43.090> you

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
back into place and it snaps up when you

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.720 
back into place and it snaps up when you
push<00:03:43.660> on<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.109> is<00:03:44.230> indeed<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.160> have<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.430> sort

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
push on it so it is indeed I have a sort

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.210 
push on it so it is indeed I have a sort
of<00:03:45.760> a<00:03:45.850> spring-loaded<00:03:46.239> feel<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.100> do<00:03:48.100> that

from<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.400> size<00:03:48.640> you<00:03:48.820> can<00:03:48.910> see<00:03:49.060> what<00:03:49.120> that

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
from the size you can see what that

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.340 
from the size you can see what that
looks<00:03:49.269> like<00:03:53.730> so<00:03:54.730> moving<00:03:55.239> right<00:03:55.269> along<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:56.230> so

there's<00:04:23.470> not<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.680> much<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.220> difference

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
there's not that much of a difference

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.330 
there's not that much of a difference
and<00:04:24.789> from<00:04:24.880> a<00:04:24.970> thickness<00:04:25.180> standpoint

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
and from a thickness standpoint

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.530 
and from a thickness standpoint
there's<00:04:26.580> not<00:04:26.760> much<00:04:27.030> there<00:04:27.300> as<00:04:27.480> well<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:30.240> next
