00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.130 

in<00:00:02.400> our<00:00:02.730> last<00:00:02.940> video<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.420> learned<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:03.870> we<00:00:03.929> had

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
in our last video we learned how we had

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.840 
in our last video we learned how we had
to<00:00:04.170> find<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.590> way<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.770> get<00:00:04.950> these<00:00:05.040> blow-by<00:00:05.520> fumes

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
to find a way to get these blow-by fumes

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.820 
to find a way to get these blow-by fumes
out<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.210> our<00:00:06.569> engine<00:00:06.960> without<00:00:07.259> pushing<00:00:07.740> them

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
out of our engine without pushing them

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.980 
out of our engine without pushing them
into<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.100> atmosphere<00:00:08.420> the<00:00:09.420> solution<00:00:09.900> is

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
into the atmosphere the solution is

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.220 
into the atmosphere the solution is
simple<00:00:10.380> it's<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.769> PCV<00:00:11.309> system<00:00:12.000> these<00:00:12.719> systems

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
simple it's a PCV system these systems

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.589 
simple it's a PCV system these systems
are<00:00:13.410> very<00:00:13.559> simple<00:00:14.190> what<00:00:14.580> we<00:00:14.610> do<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.269> take

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
are very simple what we do is we take

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.590 
are very simple what we do is we take
vacuum<00:00:16.380> from<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> intake<00:00:17.340> manifold<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.060> use

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
vacuum from the intake manifold and use

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.470 
vacuum from the intake manifold and use
it<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> suck<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.740> draw<00:00:20.220> these<00:00:20.699> ceilings<00:00:21.240> out<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
it to suck or draw these ceilings out of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
it to suck or draw these ceilings out of
the<00:00:21.539> crankcase<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.590> fumes<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.160> enter<00:00:23.490> into

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
the crankcase the fumes then enter into

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.009 
the crankcase the fumes then enter into
the<00:00:23.850> manifold<00:00:24.300> they<00:00:24.480> mix<00:00:24.720> with<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:24.990> air

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the manifold they mix with the air

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.509 
the manifold they mix with the air
stream<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.890> they<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.100> off<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.279> they

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
stream there and they go off and they

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.810 
stream there and they go off and they
get<00:00:26.730> burnt<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.740> usually<00:00:28.890> done<00:00:29.220> simply<00:00:29.699> by

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
get burnt this is usually done simply by

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.400 
get burnt this is usually done simply by
connecting<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.330> hose<00:00:30.570> from<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> intake

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
connecting a hose from the intake

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.770 
connecting a hose from the intake
manifold<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.400> valve<00:00:32.580> cover<00:00:32.879> and<00:00:33.059> there<00:00:33.660> we

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
manifold to the valve cover and there we

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
manifold to the valve cover and there we
are<00:00:33.809> we're<00:00:34.050> drawing<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.410> fumes<00:00:34.680> away<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.760> in

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
are we're drawing the fumes away now in

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.639 
are we're drawing the fumes away now in
most<00:00:36.149> cases<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.690> automotive<00:00:37.079> engineers<00:00:37.500> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
most cases the automotive engineers have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.260 
most cases the automotive engineers have
added<00:00:37.890> three<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.280> more<00:00:38.430> things<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.910> system

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
added three or more things to the system

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.139 
added three or more things to the system
make<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> even<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:39.960> efficient<00:00:40.610> okay<00:00:41.640> think

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
make it even more efficient okay think

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.970 
make it even more efficient okay think
about<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.629> moment<00:00:42.690> simply<00:00:43.620> sucking

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
about it for a moment simply sucking

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.910 
about it for a moment simply sucking
these<00:00:44.100> things<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.700> works<00:00:45.239> but<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.320> we<00:00:46.500> made<00:00:46.649> so

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
these things out works but if we made so

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.350 
these things out works but if we made so
much<00:00:47.039> more<00:00:47.219> efficient<00:00:47.670> if<00:00:47.789> we<00:00:47.879> could<00:00:48.030> find<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
much more efficient if we could find a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
much more efficient if we could find a
way<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.510> let<00:00:48.690> fresh<00:00:49.170> air<00:00:49.200> in<00:00:50.059> okay

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
way to let fresh air in okay

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.450 
way to let fresh air in okay
thus<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:51.960> having<00:00:52.230> fresh<00:00:52.530> air<00:00:52.800> entering<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
thus by having fresh air entering and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
thus by having fresh air entering and
going<00:00:53.489> down<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.030> don't<00:00:54.270> have<00:00:54.539> these<00:00:54.780> blow-by

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
going down we don't have these blow-by

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
going down we don't have these blow-by
fumes<00:00:55.649> accumulating<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.850> they're

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
fumes accumulating in here and they're

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.400 
fumes accumulating in here and they're
not<00:00:57.420> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.660> able<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.809> contaminate<00:00:58.379> our

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
not going to be able to contaminate our

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.910 
not going to be able to contaminate our
oil<00:00:58.800> okay<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.239> most<00:01:00.449> PCV<00:01:01.199> systems<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.800> an

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
oil okay so most PCV systems have an

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.979 
oil okay so most PCV systems have an
additional<00:01:02.370> line<00:01:02.609> usually<00:01:02.879> filtered<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
additional line usually filtered that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
additional line usually filtered that
allows<00:01:04.259> fresh<00:01:04.649> hair<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.039> go<00:01:05.160> in<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.489> fresh<00:01:05.790> air

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
allows fresh hair to go in so fresh air

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.789 
allows fresh hair to go in so fresh air
enters<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> mixes<00:01:07.140> picks<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
enters that mixes picks up the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.530 
enters that mixes picks up the
contaminated<00:01:08.490> air<00:01:08.549> fuel<00:01:08.909> mix<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> there<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
contaminated air fuel mix of there and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.620 
contaminated air fuel mix of there and
goes<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.320> gets<00:01:10.409> burned<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> second

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
goes and gets burned off the second

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870 
goes and gets burned off the second
thing<00:01:12.750> that's<00:01:12.869> needed<00:01:13.229> is<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.950> PCV<00:01:14.460> valve<00:01:14.670> has

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
thing that's needed is the PCV valve has

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
thing that's needed is the PCV valve has
to<00:01:15.090> match<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.630> has<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:15.869> have<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> restriction<00:01:16.560> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to match it has to have a restriction it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.429 
to match it has to have a restriction it
to<00:01:17.159> max<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.580> size<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> engine<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:19.229> don't

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to max the size of the engine we don't

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
to max the size of the engine we don't
want<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.710> pull<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.310> much<00:01:20.549> air<00:01:20.939> food<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.689> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
want to pull so much air food here and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.240 
want to pull so much air food here and
into<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> intake<00:01:22.320> manifold<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.040> motor

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
into the intake manifold that the motor

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.910 
into the intake manifold that the motor
begins<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.790> run<00:01:23.970> lean<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.960> PCV<00:01:25.530> valves<00:01:25.799> are

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
begins to run lean so PCV valves are

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.679 
begins to run lean so PCV valves are
matched<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> motor<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> they<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
matched to the motor so that they have a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.570 
matched to the motor so that they have a
restriction<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.409> allows<00:01:28.619> only<00:01:28.950> enough<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
restriction that allows only enough to

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.800 
restriction that allows only enough to
do<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> job<00:01:29.850> without<00:01:30.210> anymore

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
do the job without anymore

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.069 
do the job without anymore
and<00:01:31.100> lastly<00:01:32.100> these<00:01:32.850> tombs<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.540> accumulate

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and lastly these tombs that accumulate

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.260 
and lastly these tombs that accumulate
inside<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.650> motor<00:01:34.860> these<00:01:35.100> blow-by<00:01:35.579> fumes<00:01:36.000> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
inside the motor these blow-by fumes are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.920 
inside the motor these blow-by fumes are
flammable<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:37.860> fact<00:01:38.040> they<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.280> explode

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
flammable and in fact they can explode

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.120 
flammable and in fact they can explode
imagine<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.079> had<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> backfire<00:01:40.829> in<00:01:41.040> your

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
imagine if you had a backfire in your

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
imagine if you had a backfire in your
intake<00:01:41.340> manifold<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.270> ran<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.630> through

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
intake manifold and it ran it through

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
intake manifold and it ran it through
the<00:01:42.810> manifold<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.409> through<00:01:43.650> this<00:01:43.799> line<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
the manifold and through this line and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.770 
the manifold and through this line and
entered<00:01:44.579> into<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:44.939> where<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.180> seams<00:01:45.509> are

it has been known to blow valve covers
or<00:01:48.210> oil<00:01:48.360> pans<00:01:48.659> right<00:01:48.869> off<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.229> motor<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:50.220> need

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
or oil pans right off the motor we need

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
or oil pans right off the motor we need
something<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> put<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> stop<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.470> all<00:01:52.470> PCV

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
something to put a stop to that all PCV

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
something to put a stop to that all PCV
valves<00:01:53.610> have<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> check<00:01:54.240> valve<00:01:54.270> built<00:01:54.810> inside

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
valves have a check valve built inside

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.649 
valves have a check valve built inside
of<00:01:55.350> them<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.100> process<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> simple<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.180> an

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of them and the process is simple if an

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.690 
of them and the process is simple if an
explosion<00:01:57.930> does<00:01:58.320> place<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> backfire<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.610> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
explosion does place a backfire in the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.429 
explosion does place a backfire in the
intake<00:01:59.909> manifold<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.630> tries<00:02:00.869> to<00:02:00.899> run<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
intake manifold and it tries to run to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.800 
intake manifold and it tries to run to
here<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> can't<00:02:02.250> because<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> PCV<00:02:03.479> valve

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
here it can't because the PCV valve

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.469 
here it can't because the PCV valve
serves<00:02:04.140> as<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> check<00:02:04.469> valve<00:02:05.180> that's<00:02:06.180> how<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
serves as a check valve that's how the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.160 
serves as a check valve that's how the
system<00:02:06.689> works

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
system works

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
system works
it's<00:02:07.530> very<00:02:07.770> system<00:02:08.190> very<00:02:08.459> simple<00:02:08.729> very

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
it's very system very simple very

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550 
it's very system very simple very
effective<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> does<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> job<00:02:09.989> very<00:02:10.379> very

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
effective and it does the job very very

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.650 
effective and it does the job very very
well<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.670> next<00:02:11.910> video<00:02:12.150> we'll<00:02:12.330> show<00:02:12.510> how

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
well in the next video we'll show how

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.390 
well in the next video we'll show how
some<00:02:12.930> people<00:02:13.110> have<00:02:13.470> managed<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.099> shoot

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
some people have managed to shoot

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.500 
some people have managed to shoot
themselves<00:02:14.580> in<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:14.970> foot

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
themselves in the foot

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.490 
themselves in the foot
not<00:02:16.080> understanding<00:02:16.709> how<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.860> system<00:02:16.980> works
