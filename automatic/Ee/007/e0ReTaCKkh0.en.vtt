today then we'll we'll have a look at it
from<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.630> mini<00:00:21.810> perspective<00:00:24.050> so<00:00:25.050> last<00:00:25.920> night<00:00:26.070> i

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
from a mini perspective so last night i

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.109 
from a mini perspective so last night i
just<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.900> coat<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.470> gloss<00:00:29.310> polyurethane<00:00:30.090> on

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
just put a coat of gloss polyurethane on

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.069 
just put a coat of gloss polyurethane on
it<00:00:30.529> about<00:00:31.529> semi-gloss<00:00:31.949> actually<00:00:32.840> then<00:00:33.840> i<00:00:33.930> put

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it about semi-gloss actually then i put

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.600 
it about semi-gloss actually then i put
a<00:00:34.140> coat<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.620> flat<00:00:35.480> enamel<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:38.219> reason

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
a coat of flat enamel on it the reason

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
a coat of flat enamel on it the reason
you<00:00:38.730> use<00:00:38.790> gloss<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.390> semigloss<00:00:39.510> first<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you use gloss or semigloss first is

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.010 
you use gloss or semigloss first is
because<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.340> much<00:00:41.579> harder<00:00:42.020> coat

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
because it's actually a much harder coat

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.400 
because it's actually a much harder coat
than<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.440> flat<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:44.730> more<00:00:44.910> gloss<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
than the flat the more gloss it has in

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.880 
than the flat the more gloss it has in
it<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.590> harder<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.270> so<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.750> put<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.170> gloss

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it the harder it is so you put the gloss

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.729 
it the harder it is so you put the gloss
on<00:00:50.160> first<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:50.820> durability<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> put

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
on first for durability and then you put

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.790 
on first for durability and then you put
a<00:00:52.770> flat<00:00:53.010> code<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.789> rid<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.059> shine

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
a flat code one to get rid of the shine

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.080 
a flat code one to get rid of the shine
so<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:55.829> did<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.489> dried<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so I did that and it dried in this

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.569 
so I did that and it dried in this
morning<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.820> put<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.870> static<00:01:01.260> grass<00:01:01.579> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
morning I put on some static grass you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.740 
morning I put on some static grass you
can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.910> there<00:01:03.979> this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:08.540> static<00:01:09.540> grass

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
can see there this is some static grass

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
can see there this is some static grass
by<00:01:09.990> scenic<00:01:10.350> express<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.760> called

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
by scenic express I think it's called

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.030 
by scenic express I think it's called
meadow<00:01:12.330> or<00:01:12.659> something<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.439> got<00:01:13.500> some<00:01:13.799> reds

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.030 
there to kind of offset the greens on
have<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.090> complementary<00:01:21.720> colors<00:01:22.110> to

have some complementary colors to
balance<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.490> peace<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.960> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> tie

reason<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.500> want<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.680> do<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:40.920> stuff<00:01:41.189> is<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
reason you want to do this stuff is to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.870 
reason you want to do this stuff is to
kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.790> give<00:01:41.970> your<00:01:43.280> your<00:01:44.280> piece<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> little

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
kind of give your your piece a little

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.630 
kind of give your your piece a little
bit<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.090> elevation<00:01:45.530> without<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.100> top

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bit of elevation without that the top

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.300 
bit of elevation without that the top
just<00:01:47.939> kind<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> looked<00:01:48.360> flat<00:01:48.750> across<00:01:49.110> there<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
just kind of looked flat across there so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.590 
just kind of looked flat across there so
you<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.820> kind<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> break<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
you do this to kind of break up the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.010 
you do this to kind of break up the
flatness<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:54.119> helps<00:01:54.689> to<00:01:54.840> break

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
flatness of it and and it helps to break

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.160 
flatness of it and and it helps to break
disguise<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.040> eye<00:01:56.070> lines<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.960> where<00:01:57.960> things

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
disguise the eye lines of where things

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.959 
disguise the eye lines of where things
are<00:01:58.380> flat<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.680> when<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.100> cut<00:01:59.369> a<00:01:59.399> flat<00:01:59.729> piece

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
are flat and when you cut a flat piece

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.469 
are flat and when you cut a flat piece
of<00:02:00.409> foam<00:02:01.549> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> helps<00:02:02.820> disguise<00:02:03.180> that

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
of foam kind of helps disguise that

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.570 
of foam kind of helps disguise that
stuff<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:05.369> put<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> couple<00:02:06.450> little<00:02:06.689> clumps<00:02:07.170> of

stuff I put a couple little clumps of
field<00:02:09.270> grass<00:02:09.570> in<00:02:09.840> there<00:02:10.370> I've<00:02:11.370> got<00:02:11.550> a<00:02:11.580> video<00:02:12.980> in

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
field grass in there I've got a video in

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.110 
field grass in there I've got a video in
my<00:02:14.280> quick<00:02:14.610> tips<00:02:14.960> on<00:02:15.960> field<00:02:16.320> grass<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.910> shows

but I kind of braided the bottom there
and<00:03:21.030> then<00:03:21.150> worked<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.540> off<00:03:21.660> into<00:03:22.620> three<00:03:22.860> pieces

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
and then worked it off into three pieces

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.800 
and then worked it off into three pieces
of<00:03:23.280> wire<00:03:26.750> so<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.959> here's<00:03:28.140> kind<00:03:28.350> of<00:03:28.440> how<00:03:28.590> the

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
of wire so and here's kind of how the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.000 
of wire so and here's kind of how the
vines<00:03:30.810> came<00:03:31.230> out<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.720> see<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.769> wire

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
vines came out you can see that wire

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.560 
vines came out you can see that wire
actually<00:03:35.519> helped<00:03:35.730> give<00:03:35.880> them<00:03:36.000> a<00:03:36.060> lot<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.330> depth

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
actually helped give them a lot of depth

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.720 
actually helped give them a lot of depth
and<00:03:36.750> that's<00:03:36.989> two<00:03:37.470> coats<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.950> brown<00:03:38.190> paint<00:03:38.489> on

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and that's two coats of brown paint on

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.479 
and that's two coats of brown paint on
that<00:03:38.850> copper<00:03:39.239> wire<00:03:39.800> so<00:03:40.800> that<00:03:40.830> really<00:03:41.100> helped

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
that copper wire so that really helped

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.140 
that copper wire so that really helped
bring<00:03:42.480> those<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.900> life<00:03:43.080> I<00:03:43.320> think<00:03:43.380> I<00:03:43.739> mean<00:03:43.860> there

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
bring those to life I think I mean there

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.030 
bring those to life I think I mean there
I'm<00:03:45.150> quite<00:03:45.870> surprised<00:03:46.290> at<00:03:46.530> how<00:03:46.620> realistic
