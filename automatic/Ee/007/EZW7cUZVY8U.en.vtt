 Today we want to thank you there. 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.330
 what is making a difference do not look at 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:19.900

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.150
 You want to know why I explain. 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.630

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:28.150
 liters and liters of water washing sidewalk 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.390
 You taught people from the hinterland will wait for the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.160
 of rain that is very little in 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.190
 small external 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.130

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 can you believe that you are thirsty? 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.180

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.310
 while it is increasingly difficult 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.230
 find people who care about 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.890
 truth with the others 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.500

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.820
 teaches children from all over the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.820
 Brazil to eat better 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.650
 while there are people who do not even look 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.420
 some communities 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.549

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.100
 She's not a lot of people today. 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.830
 people may have the chance to work 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:24.020
 with autonomous resellers and arrived 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:26.869
 of Brazil's 720,000 households in the most 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.549
 rectangles listens only in how many people 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.530
 are forced to come to the big city 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 in search of opportunity 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.500

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.119

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.150
 It's so much, we could stay. 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.159

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.580

 Brazil, but the most important thing is that 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.709
 while a spectacle tone because we 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.630
