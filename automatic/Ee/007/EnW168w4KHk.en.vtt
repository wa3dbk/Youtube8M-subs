00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:20.070
 1975 July 15 in neutral space 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.070
 docked two ships union and abalon 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.000
 at an altitude of 200 kilometers above the ground 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:35.760
 met two political systems two 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.290
 different world and here it is the first space 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.430
 train is a bunch of two completely different 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.890
 Soyuz and Apollo Program epic 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.470
 experimental flight apollo alliance 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.440
 was destined to become the prototype of the ISS 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.610
 international space station and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 symbol of cooperation in space 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.739
 the participants of the docking met 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.200
 more than forty years ago when it boiled 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 work on the first international 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.590
 space project systems engineer 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.990
 docking Viktor Pavlov 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.840
 Head of Flight Management Victor 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.240
 blogs and cosmonaut Alexander Ivan Chunkov 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 then hundreds of people began to work on 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.040
 most important project to take place 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.780
 historic meeting sheet to 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.189
 we went in for the cold war 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.729
 cooperation in space 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.200
 I will note that such courage has gathered 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.370
 Only their only industry 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.630
 space 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:34.940
 In 1972, the United States and the USSR agreed on 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.310
 creating joint rescue systems 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.130
 crews in space on two continents 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.410
 began the development of docking stations and 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.450
 radio communication systems adaptation 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.390
 of course there was a colossal land 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.820
 preparing a colossal job on 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.030
 interface voltage and that's it 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.680
 It worked to dock successfully 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.140
 space ships seriously 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.630
 They were refining the fact that the internal 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.970
 atmosphere ships differ so 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 american technique and people worked in 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.710
 pure oxygen environment Soviet 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.560
 air-gas mixtures 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.210
 that is, the usual air is now american 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.770
 flies with the air just like him 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.650
 docking units do not fit together 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.650
 in the docking system redesigned 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.050
 did appas androgyne peripheral 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.420
 docking unit incompatible system 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.910
 pin cone systems who should be pin 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.100
 to whom the cone was a problem and it is difficult 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.640
 agree to everybody want to be active 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.450
 even strong want to be pins 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.090
 July 15, 1975 started with Baikonur 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.110
 Union 19 ship with Alexey Leonov and 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.110
 Valery Kubasov 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.590
 a few hours later from the spaceport in 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.840
 florida took off apollo 18 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.220
 with thomas stafor there vincent fronts and 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.020
 donald with neutan on soviet 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.970
 ships refused camera color 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.550
 images it was chips 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.710
 Moscow for the first time broadcast the launch on 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.500
 the whole world and flight live 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:18.010
 decided to repair the equipment already in 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.590
 space did not work out with the Americans 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.300
 Pripyat docking airlock became 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.010
 clear historical meeting on the verge of collapse 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.480
 hatch opening prevents cable from 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.290
 meant that to dock 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.780
 dock 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 with another docking system this is already 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.730
 gateway fails transition 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:43.959
 docked in orbit twice the first time 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.780
 July 17 was active 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.440
 knot of the American ship is the first 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.769
 docking 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:58.599
 and went down in history open the hatch and see 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:04:02.170
 Tom's smiling face in front of him 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:06.819
 Stafford three years we went to this I took 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:15.400
 his arm and I dragged him to me 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:18.850
 the ship after this flight the crews became 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.500
 best friends and in 2004 thomas 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.229
 stafford installed two russian 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.540
 boys from the orphanage every time 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:28.210
 meeting all the participants in addition 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:30.040
 historical events are celebrated at 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.950
 docking the Apollo alliance there would be no 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.389
 program world world shuttle german with not really 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.669
 trust relationship between 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:38.940
 Russian cosmonauts and American 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.940
 astronauts
