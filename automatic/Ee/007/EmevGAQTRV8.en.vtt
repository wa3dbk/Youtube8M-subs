mm-hmm<00:00:17.340> this<00:00:18.000> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.570> energy<00:00:19.320> energy<00:00:20.100> ring

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
mm-hmm this is the energy energy ring

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.550 
mm-hmm this is the energy energy ring
and<00:00:21.630> then<00:00:22.490> that<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:24.199> a<00:00:25.199> fusion<00:00:25.859> waste<00:00:26.220> using

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
and then that is a fusion waste using

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.400 
and then that is a fusion waste using
this<00:00:28.560> beam<00:00:29.550> crack<00:00:30.000> one<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.900> them<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> this

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
this beam crack one of them is this

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.270 
this beam crack one of them is this
performance<00:00:32.070> cap<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:33.770> performance<00:00:34.770> tip<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
performance cap and performance tip and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.430 
performance cap and performance tip and
springs<00:00:36.290> spin<00:00:37.290> okay<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:39.059> we<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.020> going<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
springs spin okay now we are going to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.709 
springs spin okay now we are going to
show<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> how<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.010> put<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> together<00:00:41.719> first

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you put the fusion wheel mana energy

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.639 
you put the fusion wheel mana energy
ring<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> push<00:00:51.149> them<00:00:51.360> together<00:00:51.539> then<00:00:52.500> you
