the<00:02:19.069> matrix<00:02:19.219> a<00:02:19.489> long<00:02:19.670> time<00:02:19.849> ago<00:02:19.999> after<00:02:20.180> seeing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the matrix a long time ago after seeing

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.640 
the matrix a long time ago after seeing
that<00:02:20.540> movie<00:02:20.810> that<00:02:21.200> we're<00:02:21.349> probably<00:02:21.499> all

that movie that we're probably all
living<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.189> matrix<00:02:22.489> but<00:02:22.639> now<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.849> matrix

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
living in the matrix but now the matrix

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.119 
living in the matrix but now the matrix
start<00:02:23.389> to<00:02:23.480> become<00:02:23.599> very<00:02:23.719> unpleasant<00:02:24.409> so<00:02:24.980> now

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129
