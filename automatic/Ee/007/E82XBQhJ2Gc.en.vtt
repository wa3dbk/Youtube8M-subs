00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:07.640
 on the first position grabs the largest 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.640
 car factory in europe 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.320
 We work hundreds of robots next to it 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:16.410
 a crowd of almost 51 1600 people 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.509
 that is 42 percent of all inhabitants of 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.029
 wolfsburg rosbergs wolfsburg once had 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:28.460
 1000 inhabitants since the factory opened 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.460
 122 thousand people lived there 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.320
 then they cut themselves for a 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.860
 drive through one of the most impressive 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 production sites of the earth 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 this plant in eastern Lower Saxony 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.059
 is the main work of the largest 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.059
 European car builder 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.980
 on almost 7 square kilometers is area 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.329
 here a whole city emerged 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.329
 and that is state of the art 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 The company is so proud that they 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.810
 your production process in public 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.299
 But it does not work in Wolfsburg 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.450
 but in the glass factory in 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.450
 Dresden 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.450
 Here you can have a fascinating 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.049
 work process very close 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.049
 follow 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.650
 today is again the daily target 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.100
 be achieved 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.759
 First, the parts must be 12,000 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.759
 for every vehicle 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.579
 the transport to the city center would have 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.020
 easily become a logistical nightmare 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.040
 can 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.259
 Therefore the factory became the 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.540
 Tramway network connected by dresden 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.540
 and will now be supplied by freight room 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.970
 the cargo tram runs seven times a day 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.890
 through the city to the logistics center 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.650
 It carries 80 percent of the parts and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.030
 exception of the body 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.030
 they are too wide for the cargo tram 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.039
 in the factory , the delivered 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.879
 along a 1.1 kilometer long 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.860
 production route are distributed 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:18.200
 The solution perfectly synchronized 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.200
 robots that work almost noiselessly 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.410
 57 computer-controlled sled 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.080
 of 100,000 magnets in the ground by the 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.599
 The factory governs the magnets serve as 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.910
 a street map that way 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.270
 sledges everywhere even in the 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.270
 lifts 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.300
 here we have inside the living of the author 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.959
 the engine the chassis celebrate these parts 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.959
 same wedding 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.290
 In Wolfsburg you work less 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 public here it is all about the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.620
 Production figures are part of the job 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.220
 is also taken over by robots 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.760
 The rest are done by the 51 1600 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.760
 Employee 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.160
 but the carrosserie workshop is like that 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.160
 as big as 13 soccer fields 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.930
 Overall, almost every hour left 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.000
 160 cars the big assembly building in 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.140
 all put together and then 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.140
 is strictly tested 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.120
 about a part of this dare the same 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.379
 The place to bring the man was the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.340
 Autostadt built 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.299
 2 48 meter high towers in the 400 each 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.299
 new cars fit 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.290
 the cars arrive via a band in 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.820
 then become a tunnel in the towers 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.890
 at a speed of 2 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.440
 meters per second hydraulically in the 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.440
 height and raised to your shelf space 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:00.490
 autonomous 3800 leaves the factory to be 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.490
 space in the shelf is already filled again 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.860
 the daily target has been reached 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.280
 Production goes around the clock here 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.280
 continue 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.690
 in the fight for the title of the world 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.269
 Number one among the mega factories 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.200
 is the largest European car factory 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.200
 not bad at all 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.680
 but what about the Germans? 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.180
 Giant with the output time the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.190
 to let production lines run faster 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.190
 and to heat the blast furnaces even more 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.770
 now it's about the annual production 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.690
 in fifth place houston we have one 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.150
 problem 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.670
 until just lay the kennedy space center 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.710
 still in second place but his output 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.630
 amounts to no more than 6000 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.760
 tons per year that corresponds to the 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:01.710
 weight of the shuttles and their tanks the 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.710
 2010 were mounted here 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.680
 Well at least you can with this 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.150
 fly to the stars 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.180
 www.das produces more for it 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.780
 information as the other factory 1 1 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:20.380
 petabyte 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:24.810
 that's one eleven with 14 of attendance 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.720
 the greenberg kit ranks on the four 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.490
 to the largest factory of the multinational 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.950
 The Group includes food laboratories and 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.900
 A sales center's production 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.919
 amounts to more than a billion 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.919
 cans a year 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:46.610
 need for their 415,000 tons a year 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:52.470
 she only drove away 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:56.300
 incredible volkswagen in wolfsburg there 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.300
 gas and lands in third place 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.539
 Employees and robots manage here 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.740
 an output of 14 million tons 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:04.740
 ascending trend 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.860
 They have 750,000 cars in one year 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.280
 built 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.280
 Great 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.709
 ranked two South Korean 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:18.709
 stahlwerk 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:27.180
 It produces around 18 million tons 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.180
 steel a year 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:31.349
 that's more than any other steel works 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.659
 create the world 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:37.009
 every week you could do it five times 

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:37.009
 Build the golden gate bridge 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.659
 but now the tonnage is still 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:46.669
 Pumped much higher, it follows 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:49.059
 actually a work that many times 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:49.059
 creates 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.990
 on number one in the production figures 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:57.600
 lands reliance in northwest india 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.919
 60 million each year 

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:04.020
 tons of refined oil that have the 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:05.550
 world's largest catalytic crackers 

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.930
 they can be different 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.120
 produce by-products 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.500
 that's why it's the refinery 

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:12.500
 makes the most money 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:16.720
 then we pack up and do one 

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:19.170
 Small round trip with the kings of the oil 

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.170
 world 

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.199
 there
