00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
back at braveman studio sometimes I'll

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.190 
back at braveman studio sometimes I'll
use<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.440> paint<00:00:07.980> medium<00:00:08.460> that's<00:00:08.730> not<00:00:09.200> that

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
use a paint medium that's not that

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.290 
use a paint medium that's not that
instead<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:10.590> speeding<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.519> drying<00:00:11.849> time<00:00:12.120> like

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
instead of speeding the drying time like

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.390 
instead of speeding the drying time like
resin<00:00:12.690> gel<00:00:12.870> that'll<00:00:13.139> retard<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> drying<00:00:14.070> time

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
resin gel that'll retard the drying time

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.630 
resin gel that'll retard the drying time
and<00:00:14.610> I'll<00:00:15.210> make<00:00:15.389> my<00:00:15.570> own<00:00:16.070> emulsion<00:00:17.070> to<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.369> that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
and I'll make my own emulsion to do that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.130 
and I'll make my own emulsion to do that
I<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.210> need<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.920> bucket<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.670> spatula<00:00:21.600> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I just need a bucket and a spatula and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.019 
I just need a bucket and a spatula and
I'll<00:00:22.650> use<00:00:22.859> three<00:00:23.160> materials<00:00:23.699> I'll<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.000> a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
I'll use three materials I'll use a

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.450 
I'll use three materials I'll use a
stand<00:00:25.019> which<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> have<00:00:26.160> different

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
stand which is I have different

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.519 
stand which is I have different
qualities<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.090> stand<00:00:27.480> oil<00:00:27.720> this<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.260> not<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
qualities of stand oil this is not the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.200 
qualities of stand oil this is not the
right<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:30.560> this<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:32.000> standard<00:00:33.000> oil's

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
right one this is a standard oil's

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
right one this is a standard oil's
linseed<00:00:33.630> oil<00:00:33.719> that's<00:00:33.989> been<00:00:34.110> left<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.649> stand<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
linseed oil that's been left to stand so

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.190 
linseed oil that's been left to stand so
it's<00:00:35.430> very<00:00:36.000> thick<00:00:36.680> and<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> it's<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
it's very thick and it's it's that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.549 
it's very thick and it's it's that
thickness<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.899> linseed<00:00:43.290> oil<00:00:43.320> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
thickness that we use the linseed oil is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
thickness that we use the linseed oil is
much<00:00:43.770> more<00:00:44.040> fluid<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.329> tend<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.820> since

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
much more fluid and I tend to use since

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.819 
much more fluid and I tend to use since
I'm<00:00:47.969> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> add<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.420> dryer<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.230> i<00:00:49.530> tend

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I'm going to add a dryer to this i tend

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.330 
I'm going to add a dryer to this i tend
to<00:00:49.920> use<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> walnut<00:00:51.000> oil<00:00:51.120> which<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:52.160> which<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.309> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
to use a walnut oil which is which is a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.470 
to use a walnut oil which is which is a
little<00:00:53.489> more<00:00:53.610> fluid<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.300> see<00:00:54.420> how

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
little more fluid so you can see how

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.479 
little more fluid so you can see how
much<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.809> fluid<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> same

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
much more fluid and this is the same

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.630 
much more fluid and this is the same
fluidity<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.480> regular<00:00:58.020> linseed<00:00:58.829> oil<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
fluidity of regular linseed oil it's

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.220 
fluidity of regular linseed oil it's
just<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.030> used<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.390> don't<00:01:00.570> have<00:01:00.690> any<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.079> so

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
just I used I don't have any here so

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.920 
just I used I don't have any here so
it's<00:01:01.350> all<00:01:01.469> use<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> walnut<00:01:02.250> oil<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
it's all use the walnut oil but this the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
it's all use the walnut oil but this the
you<00:01:04.260> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.589> how<00:01:04.650> much<00:01:04.769> more<00:01:05.040> liquid<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you can see how much more liquid the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.969 
you can see how much more liquid the
walnut<00:01:06.570> oil<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.960> or<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> linseed<00:01:07.650> oil<00:01:07.680> is

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
walnut oil is or the linseed oil is

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.490 
walnut oil is or the linseed oil is
versus<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.580> stand<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.479> I'll<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.260> mix

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
versus the stand all and I'll you mix

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
versus the stand all and I'll you mix
the<00:01:10.650> two<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.920> them<00:01:11.040> together<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.640> then<00:01:12.180> I'll

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the two of them together and then I'll

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.539 
the two of them together and then I'll
throw<00:01:12.540> in<00:01:12.689> some<00:01:12.720> gamsol<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.799> get<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.520> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
throw in some gamsol to get that back to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.399 
throw in some gamsol to get that back to
a<00:01:16.159> more<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:18.150> there's<00:01:18.330> a<00:01:18.390> dryer<00:01:18.750> out<00:01:18.780> drying

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
a more so there's a dryer out drying

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.200 
a more so there's a dryer out drying
element<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.340> then<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.180> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
element to it and then I also have a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
element to it and then I also have a
copal<00:01:21.720> painting<00:01:22.200> medium<00:01:22.500> which<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.680> mixed

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
copal painting medium which is mixed

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.789 
copal painting medium which is mixed
with<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.689> use<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> touch<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> because

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
with I just use a touch of this because

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.350 
with I just use a touch of this because
it's<00:01:25.950> got<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lavender<00:01:26.700> instead<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
it's got a lavender instead of a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.690 
it's got a lavender instead of a
turpentine<00:01:27.750> got<00:01:28.710> something<00:01:28.979> called<00:01:29.100> spike

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
turpentine got something called spike

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.899 
turpentine got something called spike
oil<00:01:29.970> oil<00:01:30.750> it's<00:01:31.049> spiked<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:31.799> end<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
oil oil it's spiked and it's end of

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.859 
oil oil it's spiked and it's end of
copal<00:01:33.479> varnish<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.430> there<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.909> well<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.600> don't

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
copal varnish and there can well I don't

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.630 
copal varnish and there can well I don't
mind<00:01:37.020> using<00:01:37.259> them<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.590> studio<00:01:37.950> when<00:01:38.520> I've

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
mind using them in the studio when I've

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.749 
mind using them in the studio when I've
got<00:01:38.790> students<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.750> gets<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.759> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
got students here it gets a little the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.700 
got students here it gets a little the
lavender<00:01:42.240> smell<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.560> don't

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
lavender smell can be kind of I don't

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.719 
lavender smell can be kind of I don't
know<00:01:43.770> if<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> smell<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.369> where<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.610> are

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
know if you can smell it where you are

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.819 
know if you can smell it where you are
but<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.360> lavender<00:01:45.720> smell<00:01:45.930> gets<00:01:46.049> very<00:01:46.350> potent

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
but the lavender smell gets very potent

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
but the lavender smell gets very potent
and<00:01:47.280> I'll<00:01:47.399> mix<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.759> two<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.970> those<00:01:48.090> together

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and I'll mix the two of those together

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.999 
and I'll mix the two of those together
all<00:01:48.780> three<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.170> those<00:01:49.259> together<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.770> that'll

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
all three of those together and that'll

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.460 
all three of those together and that'll
give<00:01:50.189> me<00:01:50.220> an<00:01:50.520> emulsion<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.960> can<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.320> it's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
give me an emulsion and you can see it's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.730 
give me an emulsion and you can see it's
very<00:01:52.740> fluid<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.970> amount<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.570> I'll<00:01:55.290> pour

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
very fluid and the amount of I'll pour

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.139 
very fluid and the amount of I'll pour
it<00:01:55.829> out<00:01:55.890> over<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> amount<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.909> stand<00:01:59.909> oil

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
it out over here the amount of stand oil

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.200 
it out over here the amount of stand oil
I<00:02:00.270> use<00:02:00.509> controls<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.560> fluidity<00:02:02.090> again<00:02:03.090> this

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
I use controls that fluidity again this

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.789 
I use controls that fluidity again this
is<00:02:03.390> another<00:02:03.689> standard<00:02:04.079> oil<00:02:04.320> product<00:02:04.680> I've

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
is another standard oil product I've

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.830 
is another standard oil product I've
gotten<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> lot<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:05.969> viscous<00:02:06.540> than

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
gotten this is a lot more viscous than

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.020 
gotten this is a lot more viscous than
the<00:02:07.020> other<00:02:07.259> ones<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> can<00:02:07.770> see<00:02:07.920> how<00:02:08.160> how<00:02:08.759> heavy

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the other ones you can see how how heavy

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.420 
the other ones you can see how how heavy
this<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.750> stand<00:02:10.440> oil<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.860> linseed<00:02:11.310> oil

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
this is and stand oil is linseed oil

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.620 
this is and stand oil is linseed oil
that's<00:02:11.730> been<00:02:11.910> left<00:02:12.150> to

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
that's been left to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.120 
that's been left to
and<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> it's<00:02:14.460> just<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.910> depends<00:02:15.720> on<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.130> this

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
and so it's just it depends on how this

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.240 
and so it's just it depends on how this
is<00:02:17.280> older<00:02:17.700> so<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.120> more<00:02:18.810> viscous<00:02:19.260> it's<00:02:19.530> that

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
is older so it's more viscous it's that

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.150 
is older so it's more viscous it's that
has<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.360> stiffness<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:23.040> what

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
has more stiffness to it and that's what

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.360 
has more stiffness to it and that's what
controls<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:24.300> thick<00:02:24.780> my<00:02:24.810> emulsion<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:25.920> I

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
controls how thick my emulsion is and I

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.160 
controls how thick my emulsion is and I
really<00:02:26.670> like<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.510> stiffens<00:02:28.020> it

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
really like that because it stiffens it

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.020 
really like that because it stiffens it
up<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.500> quickly<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.160> gives<00:02:29.400> me<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.730> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
up so quickly and gives me that the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.030 
up so quickly and gives me that the
thickness<00:02:30.510> now<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> still<00:02:31.020> got<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.920> enough

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
thickness now I still got just enough

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100 
thickness now I still got just enough
dryer<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:32.910> with<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.150> copal<00:02:33.570> varnish

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
dryer in there with the copal varnish

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.480 
dryer in there with the copal varnish
and<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.720> gamsol<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:37.590> will<00:02:37.890> dry<00:02:38.220> but

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and the gamsol so that this will dry but

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.700 
and the gamsol so that this will dry but
this<00:02:38.970> will<00:02:39.120> dry<00:02:39.330> in<00:02:39.390> about<00:02:39.630> three<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.500> five

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
this will dry in about three to five

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.610 
this will dry in about three to five
days<00:02:40.770> whereas<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.360> resin<00:02:43.140> gel<00:02:43.290> will<00:02:43.440> dry

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
days whereas the resin gel will dry

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.120 
days whereas the resin gel will dry
overnight

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
overnight

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.970 
overnight
so<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.420> same<00:02:45.660> liquid<00:02:46.260> nasaan

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so it's this the same liquid nasaan

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.800 
so it's this the same liquid nasaan
building<00:02:47.430> this<00:02:47.520> up<00:02:47.580> to<00:02:47.820> the<00:02:47.940> same<00:02:48.150> body<00:02:48.450> as<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
building this up to the same body as the

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.100 
building this up to the same body as the
resin<00:02:49.170> gel<00:02:49.380> with<00:02:50.250> using<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.640> Stan<00:02:51.060> dial<00:02:51.390> to

resin gel with using that Stan dial to

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.190 
resin gel with using that Stan dial to
give<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.560> body<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:54.030> it'll<00:02:54.240> dry<00:02:54.720> over<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
give it more body but it'll dry over a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.410 
give it more body but it'll dry over a
much<00:02:55.440> longer<00:02:55.800> period<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.610> which<00:02:56.850> gives<00:02:58.340> a

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
much longer period of time which gives a

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
much longer period of time which gives a
richer<00:03:00.420> look<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.170> wetter<00:03:01.680> look<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.310> paint

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
richer look a wetter look to the paint

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.090 
richer look a wetter look to the paint
