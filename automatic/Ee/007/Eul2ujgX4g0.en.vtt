these cords here that's pretty much it
you're<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.270> going<00:05:18.449> to<00:05:18.479> follow<00:05:18.660> that<00:05:18.960> pattern

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
you're just going to follow that pattern

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.499 
you're just going to follow that pattern
the<00:05:19.620> whole<00:05:20.610> way<00:05:20.729> through<00:05:20.759> so<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.150> play<00:05:21.360> that

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
the whole way through so you play that

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.029 
the whole way through so you play that
on<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.720> first<00:05:21.930> chord<00:05:24.530> then<00:05:25.530> your<00:05:25.650> second

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 
on the first chord then your second

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.170 
on the first chord then your second
chord

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.080 

now<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.290> last<00:05:30.500> strum<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.490> this<00:05:31.880> when

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
now on the last strum on this when

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.450 
now on the last strum on this when
you're<00:05:32.180> actually<00:05:32.510> going<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.890> play<00:05:33.890> that<00:05:34.130> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
you're actually going to play that the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.280 
you're actually going to play that the
second<00:05:34.850> chord<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.300> slide<00:05:35.660> it<00:05:35.840> to<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:35.990> third

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:36.290 
second chord and slide it to the third

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:48.310 
second chord and slide it to the third
chord<00:05:38.530> okay<00:05:39.530> so<00:05:46.330> I<00:05:47.330> can't<00:05:47.690> mess<00:05:47.810> that<00:05:47.870> up<00:05:48.020> so<00:05:48.290> I

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
chord okay so I can't mess that up so I

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:57.360 
chord okay so I can't mess that up so I
wasn't<00:05:48.440> thinking<00:05:48.560> here<00:05:49.040> we<00:05:49.130> go

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.939 

as<00:05:57.940> you<00:05:58.300> can<00:05:58.389> see<00:05:58.570> I<00:05:58.600> do<00:05:58.720> the<00:05:58.870> same<00:05:59.110> pattern<00:05:59.500> on

00:05:59.939 --> 00:05:59.949 
as you can see I do the same pattern on

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.550 
as you can see I do the same pattern on
the<00:06:00.910> third<00:06:01.479> chord<00:06:01.840> and<00:06:01.960> then<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.139> go<00:06:02.320> down<00:06:02.350> to

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
the third chord and then I go down to

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.879 
the third chord and then I go down to
the<00:06:02.770> first<00:06:03.040> the<00:06:03.340> fourth<00:06:03.820> chord<00:06:04.150> and<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:05.410> put

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
the first the fourth chord and I put

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:13.379 
the first the fourth chord and I put
that<00:06:05.979> same<00:06:06.160> pattern<00:06:06.430> so<00:06:11.880> okay<00:06:12.880> now<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.300> only

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:13.389 
that same pattern so okay now the only

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.170 
that same pattern so okay now the only
time<00:06:13.780> it<00:06:14.020> made<00:06:14.229> changes<00:06:14.710> that<00:06:15.220> last<00:06:15.580> strum

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
time it made changes that last strum

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:17.700 
time it made changes that last strum
sometimes<00:06:16.690> you<00:06:16.840> might<00:06:17.020> accidentally<00:06:17.500> paw

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710 
sometimes you might accidentally paw

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.439 
sometimes you might accidentally paw
mute<00:06:17.979> it<00:06:18.130> or<00:06:18.310> if<00:06:18.370> you're<00:06:18.520> sliding<00:06:18.850> you<00:06:19.150> may<00:06:19.300> do

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
mute it or if you're sliding you may do

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.030 
mute it or if you're sliding you may do
it<00:06:19.570> a<00:06:19.600> little<00:06:19.720> bit<00:06:19.870> different<00:06:20.320> but<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.860> main

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:21.040 
it a little bit different but the main

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.530 
it a little bit different but the main
thing<00:06:21.280> is<00:06:21.490> that<00:06:21.520> you<00:06:21.910> pretty<00:06:22.090> much<00:06:22.180> make<00:06:22.419> it

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
thing is that you pretty much make it

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:34.620 
thing is that you pretty much make it
sound<00:06:22.750> the<00:06:22.960> same<00:06:23.199> on<00:06:23.979> all<00:06:24.729> of<00:06:24.940> them<00:06:33.240> okay<00:06:34.240> so<00:06:34.600> I

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
sound the same on all of them okay so I

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.540 
sound the same on all of them okay so I
tend<00:06:34.930> to<00:06:34.960> change<00:06:35.289> it<00:06:35.440> when<00:06:35.560> I'm<00:06:35.740> just<00:06:36.250> playing

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
tend to change it when I'm just playing

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.430 
tend to change it when I'm just playing
kind<00:06:36.789> of<00:06:36.850> fast<00:06:37.120> but<00:06:37.449> it's<00:06:37.840> good<00:06:38.080> to<00:06:38.199> show<00:06:38.380> you

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 
kind of fast but it's good to show you

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.430 
kind of fast but it's good to show you
guys<00:06:38.740> a<00:06:39.240> general<00:06:40.240> rhythm<00:06:40.780> you<00:06:40.870> can<00:06:40.900> use<00:06:41.110> on<00:06:41.289> all

guys a general rhythm you can use on all
of<00:06:41.680> them<00:06:41.800> so<00:06:42.100> don't<00:06:42.310> worry<00:06:42.699> about<00:06:42.820> if<00:06:43.120> you<00:06:43.300> want
