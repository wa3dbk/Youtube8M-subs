foundation<00:03:43.780> if<00:03:44.530> you're<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:44.829> to<00:03:44.919> use<00:03:45.040> a

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
foundation if you're going to use a

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:46.860 
foundation if you're going to use a
stippling<00:03:45.340> brush<00:03:45.489> I<00:03:45.760> suggest<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.359> to<00:03:46.419> use<00:03:46.690> it

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
stippling brush I suggest not to use it

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.870 
stippling brush I suggest not to use it
because<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.620> swirling<00:03:48.069> method<00:03:48.459> will<00:03:48.639> just

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
because the swirling method will just

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.789 
because the swirling method will just
really<00:03:49.329> disrupt<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.200> concealer<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
really disrupt the concealer and

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.349 
really disrupt the concealer and
everything<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.220> don't<00:03:51.370> want<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.819> happening

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
everything you don't want that happening

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.990 
everything you don't want that happening
