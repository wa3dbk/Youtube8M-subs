together<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.500> pro<00:00:19.710> version<00:00:19.740> actually<00:00:20.550> comes

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
together the pro version actually comes

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.540 
together the pro version actually comes
with<00:00:21.150> an<00:00:21.300> acrylic<00:00:21.740> shell<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:23.070> you<00:00:23.100> can<00:00:23.310> set

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
dual open-source plan so it's very

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.780 
dual open-source plan so it's very
similar<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.899> all<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.960> other<00:00:37.430> 3d<00:00:38.430> printers

with a nice sheet of Kapton tape and
right<00:01:01.770> now<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.160> laying<00:01:02.430> down<00:01:02.730> I'm<00:01:03.300> using

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
right now it's laying down I'm using

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.969 
right now it's laying down I'm using
both<00:01:03.719> extruders<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:04.680> it's<00:01:04.830> laying

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
both extruders right now it's laying

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.820 
both extruders right now it's laying
down<00:01:05.189> some<00:01:05.430> abs<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.330> then<00:01:07.110> I'm<00:01:07.200> gonna<00:01:07.380> see<00:01:07.619> how

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
down some abs and then I'm gonna see how

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.310 
down some abs and then I'm gonna see how
the<00:01:07.890> hips<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:09.330> gonna<00:01:09.600> stick<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the hips is is gonna stick to the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.550 
the hips is is gonna stick to the
captain<00:01:10.979> tape<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.280> haven't<00:01:11.549> actually<00:01:11.640> tried

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
captain tape I haven't actually tried

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.230 
captain tape I haven't actually tried
high-impact<00:01:13.560> polystyrene<00:01:14.000> prints<00:01:15.000> on

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
high-impact polystyrene prints on

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.749 
high-impact polystyrene prints on
captain<00:01:15.869> tape<00:01:16.049> yet<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> would<00:01:17.490> be<00:01:17.580> an

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
captain tape yet so this would be an

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.679 
captain tape yet so this would be an
interesting<00:01:18.150> experiment<00:01:20.000> the<00:01:21.000> firmware<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
interesting experiment the firmware it

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.450 
interesting experiment the firmware it
has<00:01:21.840> its<00:01:22.020> own<00:01:22.140> unique<00:01:22.530> firmware<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> comes

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
has its own unique firmware it comes

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.539 
has its own unique firmware it comes
with<00:01:23.670> its<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.780> power<00:01:25.049> spec<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.860> based<00:01:26.250> on

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
with its a for power spec it's based on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.539 
with its a for power spec it's based on
the<00:01:27.479> MakerBot<00:01:27.930> firmware<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:29.250> it's<00:01:29.369> really

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
the MakerBot firmware but it's really

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.120 
the MakerBot firmware but it's really
robust<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> lot<00:01:30.390> of<00:01:30.420> utility<00:01:31.290> features

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
robust there a lot of utility features

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.700 
robust there a lot of utility features
built<00:01:33.030> into<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.570> are<00:01:33.689> different<00:01:33.990> from

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
built into it that are different from

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.179 
built into it that are different from
the<00:01:34.979> MakerBot<00:01:36.020> 7.5<00:01:37.020> or<00:01:37.320> any<00:01:37.470> other<00:01:37.619> version<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the MakerBot 7.5 or any other version of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.120 
the MakerBot 7.5 or any other version of
firmware<00:01:38.990> and<00:01:40.610> so<00:01:41.610> therefore<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.720> eats

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
firmware and so therefore it eats

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130 
firmware and so therefore it eats
instead<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> dot<00:01:44.460> g-code<00:01:45.000> files

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
instead of dot g-code files

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.300 
instead of dot g-code files
TxDOT<00:01:46.740> x3g<00:01:47.610> files<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.409> comes

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
TxDOT x3g files so it comes

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
TxDOT x3g files so it comes
there's<00:01:50.700> no<00:01:50.910> printed<00:01:51.420> documentation<00:01:52.050> or

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
there's no printed documentation or

there's no printed documentation or
anything<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.980> box<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.460> comes<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:54.030> SD

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
anything in the box it comes with an SD

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
anything in the box it comes with an SD

right there above the L LCD screen it's

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.580 
right there above the L LCD screen it's
got<00:02:31.140> some<00:02:31.410> neat<00:02:31.890> little<00:02:33.110> bells<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.290> whistles

on<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.770> like<00:02:35.310> I<00:02:35.430> said<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.700> comes<00:02:35.820> with<00:02:36.030> an

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
on it like I said it comes with an

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.860 
on it like I said it comes with an
acrylic<00:02:36.680> enclosure<00:02:38.570> forms<00:02:39.570> kind<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
acrylic enclosure forms kind of a

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.140 
acrylic enclosure forms kind of a
pyramid<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.410> top<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:41.160> don't<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.000> can

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
pyramid at the top I don't think you can

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.690 
pyramid at the top I don't think you can
see<00:02:42.330> them<00:02:42.420> right<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.810> maybe<00:02:43.140> from<00:02:43.700> inside

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
see them right here maybe from inside

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.490 
see them right here maybe from inside
the<00:02:44.850> handle<00:02:45.209> yeah<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:46.050> see<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.380> are

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
the handle yeah you can see there are

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.030 
the handle yeah you can see there are
some<00:02:46.650> color<00:02:46.920> changing<00:02:47.400> LEDs<00:02:47.850> that<00:02:48.270> are

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
some color changing LEDs that are

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.130 
some color changing LEDs that are
ultraviolet<00:02:50.040> LEDs<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.270> change<00:02:51.540> color<00:02:51.840> based

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
ultraviolet LEDs they change color based

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.040 
ultraviolet LEDs they change color based
on<00:02:52.490> like<00:02:53.490> if<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.730> heating<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.300> bed<00:02:54.660> it'll

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
on like if it's heating the bed it'll

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.370 
on like if it's heating the bed it'll
give<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.830> magenta<00:02:56.670> shade<00:02:57.330> of<00:02:57.720> UV

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
give you like a magenta shade of UV

give you like a magenta shade of UV
light<00:02:59.060> and<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.209> was<00:03:00.780> kind<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.050> surprised<00:03:01.440> when<00:03:01.590> I

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
light and I was kind of surprised when I

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.470 
light and I was kind of surprised when I
saw<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> filament<00:03:02.640> coming<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:03.000> as<00:03:03.209> I<00:03:03.360> was

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
saw the filament coming out as I was

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.630 
saw the filament coming out as I was
loading<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.930> was<00:03:04.080> glowing<00:03:04.400> because<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.519> must

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
loading it was glowing because they must

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.000 
loading it was glowing because they must
have<00:03:05.790> tested<00:03:06.150> it<00:03:06.269> with<00:03:06.390> some<00:03:07.010> fluorescent

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
have tested it with some fluorescent

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.600 
have tested it with some fluorescent
filament<00:03:08.930> which<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.019> really<00:03:10.260> cool<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:11.310> was<00:03:11.580> a

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
filament which is really cool this was a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.479 
filament which is really cool this was a
thousand<00:03:12.510> bucks<00:03:12.660> today

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
original version like I said this is the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.350 
original version like I said this is the
pro<00:03:19.110> version<00:03:19.670> for<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> while<00:03:20.850> there<00:03:21.090> that<00:03:21.269> we

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
everything else appears to be the same

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.140 
everything else appears to be the same

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
stop switches in there but it's about

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.160 
stop switches in there but it's about
the<00:04:09.760> same<00:04:09.940> that's<00:04:10.450> pretty<00:04:10.690> much<00:04:10.780> all<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:10.990> them

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
the extruders so when you get it

the extruders so when you get it
the<00:04:15.970> extruders<00:04:16.480> are<00:04:16.600> in<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.750> box<00:04:16.989> resting<00:04:17.620> on

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
the build plate and you just use a

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.750 
the build plate and you just use a
couple<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.109> allen<00:04:20.859> head<00:04:20.980> screws<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.549> mount
