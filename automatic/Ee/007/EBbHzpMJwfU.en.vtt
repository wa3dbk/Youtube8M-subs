00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.370

 after all the crazy hustle and bustle are 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.110
 we finally on the side of me here 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.949
 linked in the video description below 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.600

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 et ass 2 mp point comes after that you see 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.250
 almost this page where I on ets 2 mp 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.080
 open beta click I have the one all 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.650
 bit prepared because yes if a lot 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.960
 is her business is a little bad 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.119
 good on this site if i did that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.130
 I have to click here on normal 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.159
 download this area quite time 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.170
 long if as I said a lot of business 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.650
 if you did that, you see 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.140
 this area or this window and 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.479
 click on Steam for all the yes with that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.070
 synonymous steam synonymous believe it 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 I do not want to go too far 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.250
 The window lean somehow compelling 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.259
 assuming I think the work 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.000
 yes, if you can do that now with the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.700
 synced with such a maybe 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.619
 steam workshop we wait like it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.689
 go on like that I did that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.970
 I come to this team quite normally 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.340
 page if you do those already on the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.500
 have installed computers yes and you yours 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.079
 user name password can enter it 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.320
 be quite if you are browsing these 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.030
 and did not sync with that 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.649
 I say so now that we still 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.570
 a five- to six-digit code 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.549
 will be sent via your email 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.509
 so again look at it 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.960
 press and then it will be activated and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.680
 thereby 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.810
 You see, you have the game 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.420
 you come to this side where you have one 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.770
 download is sometimes available 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.450
 are also a bit more for 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.100
 disposal is here for example 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.020
 now only france because the 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.380
 others probably too overloaded 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 and if I did that 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:37.120
 I get this normal one 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.930
 zip file unpacked and here you will find 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.770
 also the installation ship area 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.250
 So only 800 800 50 kb in size so not 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.020
 so doll 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.790
 and when i have that installed i 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.070
 have for example on the hard disk 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.710
 installed steam is installed and 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.580
 the game is up, that's why I would 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:00.550
 I guess everyone did that 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 you get something like that yes play euro 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:08.020
 truck simulator 2 and then you press 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.840
 here on it and then it works 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.150
 also already going on so we are now 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.060
 again and you see, of course, here 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.400
 above which version it is that is too 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.950
 imperative the current version 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.160
 because otherwise you would not be with 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.290
 connected to the server and you have to 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.210
 It's always a bit around everyone 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.340
 day or if you do not party 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.680
 Just played this procedure 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 i have just shown now 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.340
 going through again it could well 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.450
 be that a new update or only 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.910
 new version 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.680
 and if I did that then 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.370
 I keep on pushing on normally 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.500
 the whole laments the you plan the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.940
 are of course not in the game there is 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.800
 yes, not like everyone has something 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.870
 another thing in it 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.360
 and yes, I'm always here here 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 is my truck and i would also like everyone 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.600
 recommend that he almost a first 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.420
 free ride just made mine 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.980
 current trucks have how to do so 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.140
 problems led that the game 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.480
 is canceled so then we go completely 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.910
 normal into the game 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.490
 my starting point was berlin and you see 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.290
 already there are all the trucks now 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.940
 may well be that few minutes 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.730
 nothing is so ten minutes 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.690
 quarter of an hour that you are not in the yes 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.170
 game are you see above 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.360
 I'm a little bit 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.240
 there must be a bit dark up there 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.620
 on the right I am online on the server 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.820
 1 Currently the servers are at 3000 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.400
 been stopped high 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.870
 and if any problems are then 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.970
 the bottom left is displayed with red 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.980
 Writing the cap more out of where you or day 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.920
 7 me now that it will always be 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.870
 any problems are there so now 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.700
 I have some players here now 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:57.450
 gradually the game now 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.570
 It's not that easy 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:03.720
 the game report also often fail yes 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.520
 So yes, from or is mart 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.050
 right there I had to be outside long 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.430
 was high with the elevator I had 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
 I'm not afraid now 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.870
 digress and that's how easy it is 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.430
 and if you still have any questions 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.960
 who then writes it down in the video 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.490
 description and now comes the 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.290
 first truck years 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:22.620
 I think I'm going to this now 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.470
 make time break or fish like that 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.350
 because otherwise it will be again 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.400
 pretty loud you already see it with the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.930
 I really want to say words 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.770
 I say goodbye I could you 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.660

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.250
