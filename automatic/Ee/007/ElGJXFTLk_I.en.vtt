for being any all three any three of
them<00:01:38.970> Saamy<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.630> any<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.829> levels<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.430> the

them Saamy at any of the levels on the
insomniac<00:01:42.150> challenge<00:01:42.750> time<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:44.040> basically

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
insomniac challenge time so basically

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.380 
insomniac challenge time so basically
you<00:01:44.880> got<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.210> go<00:01:45.329> under<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> certain<00:01:46.880> time<00:01:47.880> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you got to go under a certain time and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.969 
you got to go under a certain time and
you<00:01:48.860> beat<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:49.890> challenge<00:01:50.310> time<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.979> it's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you beat that challenge time and it's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.560 
you beat that challenge time and it's
basically<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> speedrun<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.450> go

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
basically like a speedrun you want to go

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
basically like a speedrun you want to go
like<00:01:55.079> this<00:01:55.229> one<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.530> already<00:01:55.799> beat<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.100> game

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
like this one you already beat the game

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.109 
like this one you already beat the game
it's<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.390> harder<00:01:57.990> than<00:01:58.649> doing<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.850> just

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
it's it's harder than doing it just

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.020 
it's it's harder than doing it just
think<00:02:00.329> on<00:02:00.509> 20<00:02:01.409> minutes<00:02:01.740> or<00:02:01.860> something<00:02:02.009> some<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
think on 20 minutes or something some of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.749 
think on 20 minutes or something some of
them<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.570> seven<00:02:04.110> minutes<00:02:04.380> long<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:04.759> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
them are like seven minutes long so you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.249 
them are like seven minutes long so you
can<00:02:05.850> do<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.149> any<00:02:06.360> three<00:02:06.630> out<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.079> five

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
can do it on any three out of the five

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.710 
can do it on any three out of the five
levels<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> trophy<00:02:08.789> guide<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.450> a

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
levels I have a trophy guide up a

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.800 
levels I have a trophy guide up a
speedrun<00:02:10.679> trophy<00:02:11.039> god<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.400> that<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:12.629> did

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
so you don't even have to worry about

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.400 
so you don't even have to worry about
not<00:02:16.080> finding<00:02:16.350> your<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:17.220> level<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.940> need

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
not finding your the level that you need

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.860 
not finding your the level that you need
