wasting time and I hate that feeling so
I<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:28.019> maybe<00:03:28.439> if<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.799> set<00:03:29.159> a<00:03:29.340> goal<00:03:29.549> for

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
I think maybe if you set a goal for

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.059 
I think maybe if you set a goal for
yourself<00:03:29.849> if<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.449> set<00:03:30.689> a<00:03:30.720> serious<00:03:31.349> goal<00:03:31.859> for

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
yourself if you set a serious goal for

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.800 
yourself if you set a serious goal for
yourself<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.579> you<00:03:32.639> chase<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.030> dream<00:03:33.569> no

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
yourself and you chase that dream no

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.869 
yourself and you chase that dream no
matter<00:03:34.019> what<00:03:34.349> and<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.620> never<00:03:34.829> quit<00:03:35.099> on<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
matter what and you never quit on it and

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.189 
matter what and you never quit on it and
I<00:03:35.970> think<00:03:36.030> you'll<00:03:36.329> have<00:03:36.419> yourself<00:03:36.810> more

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:37.199 
I think you'll have yourself more
