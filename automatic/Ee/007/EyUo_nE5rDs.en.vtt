00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:21.278
 Good friends, this afternoon I want to invite you to change your world 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.278
 Through what? Through a skill that we often forget sometimes. 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.838
 Ie reading. 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.998
 I want to ask you a simple question. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.038
 How many books have you completed in the past 1 year? 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.958
 Come on, admit it! 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.358
 Maybe the answer is different yes, there are those who answer 1 book there. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.078
 Dinisi maybe someone answered 2, or above there are those who diligently read 10 books. 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.078
 Or maybe there's nothing at all. 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.438
 A study in the United States shows that 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.238
 1 in 4 adults did not read 1 book in the past year. 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.918
 Can you imagine how an adult no longer increases his knowledge 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.638
 no longer adding new abilities. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.558
 This is research in the United States, a country that is actually very advanced. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.518
 How about us Indonesia? You can guess yourself. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.798
 Then a question arises. "Why are people lazy to read?" 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.118
 "What is hard to read?", Why do we get sleepy when we read five pages. 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.838
 and then fall asleep like this. Is it because the book isn't interesting? 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.158
 or are we not motivated? Or there are other problems that we feel. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:56.998
 One reason why people are lazy to read is. Because the majority of us are still reading slowly. 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.558
 When you read slowly, a book will be so hard to finish. 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.478
 You need days, months, maybe even years 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.998
 Because it's not surprising if I check here. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.838
 How many of you, try checking the book in your home, 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:26.918
 how many have you completed in full and how many have not been completed. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.998
 Well, if someone reads slowly. How much is the average reading speed of people. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.678
 Or have you ever tried to measure your reading speed. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.718
 The average reading speed is 200 words per minute. 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.358
 With this speed, you will read 2 minutes for 1 page. 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.758
 and approximately 3½ hours for a 100-page book. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.438
 That is with the note that the book is read completely, without any pause at all. 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.238
 Well the speed, it turns out is not much different from a graduate of elementary school. 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.198
 Imagine that you are now entering the information age, 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.118
 but has a reading speed that is only equivalent to a primary school graduate. 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.518
 Is this surprising? 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.318
 The answer is no. Why? 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.078
 Because we never learn to read after we graduate from elementary school (elementary school). 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.998
 Now how can you read quickly? 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.878
 I want to give you a few simple tips. 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.158
 The first is, DO NOT COMPETE. 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.358
 When you read while saying what you read 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.238
 When you read while voicing sentence by sentence 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.118
 then your speed will falter, the maximum equivalent to the speed of speech. 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.558
 Even though reading doesn't need a mouth, reading it only requires your eyes and head. 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.798
 The second is, DO NOT READ THE WORD PER WORD 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.078
 Because looking for this is very slow, don't see one word move again, move again. 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.518
 And this is what is usually done when reading. 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.358
 So our eyes move from one word, then move to another word, 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.238
 to other words and so on. 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.398
 Imagine if 1 line has 10 words, and you need 1/2 second for 1 word 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.598
 then you need 5 seconds, and 1 page takes 2½ minutes. 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.518
 Now I want to prove that you are all TEDx Jakarta, 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.598
 that you are able to read faster, much faster than you can imagine. 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.638
 Now try to concentrate, look at this blackboard, pay close attention. 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:55.078
 And now you start reading. 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.678
 [audience laughs] 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.718
 Okay, how? Is there enlightenment? 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.118
 What just felt? 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.998
 So you just practiced reading like a fast reader. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.438
 And I'm sure many people can read the text. 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.478
 And this is the text that you just read. 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.598
 [audience applauds] 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.478
 Pretty much right? 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:01.798
 Well, imagine when you were able to read text that runs quickly. 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:08.238
 You just read 2x faster than the average person. Congratulations. 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.678
 [audience applauds] 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.878
 It's like we have 2 processors working together, 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.998
 help us to understand a reading material. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.478
 And of course you will be far superior to people who use only 1 processor. 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.398
 Thus, whatever your profession, must be related to reading. 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.558
 If you are a student, then you will learn to read intelligently. 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.958
 To capture the essence of the problem from a reading. 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.038
 You will complete college material much faster than most of your colleagues. 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.758
 Not only that. Reading fast will help you to have a high understanding. 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.958
 Maybe people feel strange, how can they read fast but understanding better. 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.478
 The reason is simple. Because our brain will catch something in its context. 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.318
 In its meaning. By entering many words at once. 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:08.518
 Then you help your brain to capture the essence of the reading you read is much better. 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.398
 If you are a professional, speed reading will help you to 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.638
 complete various tasks. You can make a decision, 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.638
 and will be a reliable professional. 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.438
 and if you are a learner in life, 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.158
 then speed reading will help you love reading. 

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:30.998
 Will help you to learn many new abilities. 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.638
 And finally it will bring you to be a superior person. 

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.758
 Thus you become a human who will build our Indonesia 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.678
 in the future. 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.198
 Thus, if one day someone comes to ask you a question. 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:51.518
 "How many books did you read in a year?" 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.758
 So now you can say proudly. 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:08:01.518
 "I read 52 books a year, because I am a fast reader." 

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.798
 thank you
