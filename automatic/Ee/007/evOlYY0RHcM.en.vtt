00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
started forming Peaks now at this point

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.260 
started forming Peaks now at this point
of<00:01:48.800> time<00:01:48.860> you<00:01:49.040> have<00:01:49.280> to<00:01:49.400> be<00:01:49.520> very<00:01:49.760> careful

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.890 

now<00:01:58.490> as<00:01:58.729> you<00:01:58.820> can<00:01:58.970> see<00:01:59.030> this<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.690> perfect

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
now as you can see this is the perfect

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.590 
now as you can see this is the perfect
consistency<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.580> has<00:02:01.759> whipped<00:02:02.030> nicely

consistency and it has whipped nicely

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.560 
consistency and it has whipped nicely
and<00:02:02.840> its<00:02:03.140> formal<00:02:03.590> peak<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.430> this<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.270> the<00:02:05.390> only

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
and its formal peak so this is the only

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
and its formal peak so this is the only
consistency<00:02:06.259> which<00:02:06.410> we<00:02:06.560> need<00:02:06.740> for<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> cake<00:02:07.250> or

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490
