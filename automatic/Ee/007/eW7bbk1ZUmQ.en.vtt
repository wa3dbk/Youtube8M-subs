00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
something and yeah I killed it for other

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.200 
something and yeah I killed it for other
guys<00:00:57.030> with<00:00:57.420> some<00:00:57.899> pretty<00:00:58.590> decent<00:00:58.859> frags<00:00:59.399> but

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
guys with some pretty decent frags but

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.590 
guys with some pretty decent frags but
it<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.870> crazy<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.340> yeah<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.180> one

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
it was just crazy and yeah there was one

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
it was just crazy and yeah there was one
yeah<00:01:04.170> probably<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.710> nicest<00:01:04.860> around<00:01:05.250> I've

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
yeah probably the nicest around I've

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
yeah probably the nicest around I've
ever<00:01:05.580> done<00:01:05.760> at<00:01:06.000> least<00:01:06.180> caught<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:06.990> camera<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
ever done at least caught on camera and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.700 
ever done at least caught on camera and
probably<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> most<00:01:09.750> important<00:01:10.260> frag<00:01:10.439> I've

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
probably the most important frag I've

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.609 
probably the most important frag I've
ever<00:01:11.159> done<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> CPL<00:01:12.600> final<00:01:13.200> i<00:01:13.320> think<00:01:13.530> it

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
ever done was in a CPL final i think it

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
ever done was in a CPL final i think it
was<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.040> thousand<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.400> three<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.030> four

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
was two thousand and three or four

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.710 
was two thousand and three or four
something<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.250> it<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.430> tied<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.360> i

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
something like that it was tied up i

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.289 
something like that it was tied up i
think<00:01:19.159> if<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.460> would<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.670> won<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.939> round

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
think if they would have won that round

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.510 
think if they would have won that round
they<00:01:21.479> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.720> go<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.020> draw<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.159> won

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
they want to go in to draw and if we won

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.859 
they want to go in to draw and if we won
that<00:01:23.670> round<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.600> won<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.750> game

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
that round we would have won the game

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.850 
that round we would have won the game
and<00:01:25.320> i<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.070> 11<00:01:26.310> left<00:01:26.790> vs<00:01:27.390> element<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.829> a

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and i was 11 left vs element was a

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.710 
and i was 11 left vs element was a
player<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> played<00:01:29.369> with<00:01:29.790> before<00:01:30.060> after<00:01:30.570> I

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
player I played with before after I

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.499 
player I played with before after I

before everybody else when playing back

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.030

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
don't think it's getting recognized

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.330 
don't think it's getting recognized
enough<00:02:45.570> for<00:02:45.870> it<00:02:45.960> nowadays<00:02:46.500> theatre<00:02:46.860> but<00:02:47.040> he

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
enough for it nowadays theatre but he

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.270 
enough for it nowadays theatre but he
was<00:02:47.700> such<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.000> good<00:02:48.120> player<00:02:48.530> well<00:02:49.530> rating

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
was such a good player well rating

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.160 
was such a good player well rating
myself<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.060> cs<00:02:51.390> player<00:02:51.600> is<00:02:51.720> pretty<00:02:51.930> hard

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
myself as the cs player is pretty hard

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.010 
myself as the cs player is pretty hard
obviously<00:02:53.100> right<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:53.520> i'm<00:02:53.760> not<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> top<00:02:54.810> player

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
obviously right now i'm not a top player

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.290 
obviously right now i'm not a top player
since<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:55.950> don't<00:02:56.100> play<00:02:56.220> too<00:02:56.280> much<00:02:56.550> anymore<00:02:56.850> but

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
since I don't play too much anymore but

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.830 
since I don't play too much anymore but
I<00:02:57.750> think<00:02:58.620> there<00:02:59.010> was<00:02:59.040> time<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.360> we're<00:03:00.570> when<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
I think there was time so we're when I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.180 
I think there was time so we're when I
was<00:03:01.020> the<00:03:01.140> best<00:03:01.320> player<00:03:01.560> in<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.740> world<00:03:01.800> for

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
was the best player in the world for

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.280 
was the best player in the world for
sure<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.180> going<00:03:03.420> up<00:03:03.540> and<00:03:03.720> down<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.930> mean

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
sure but it was going up and down I mean

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.560 
sure but it was going up and down I mean
someday<00:03:04.950> some<00:03:05.400> months<00:03:05.760> party<00:03:06.150> was<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> best

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
someday some months party was the best

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.510 
someday some months party was the best
player<00:03:06.750> another<00:03:07.350> one<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.560> was<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.460> the

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
player another one I was it and the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.910 
player another one I was it and the
third<00:03:08.700> one<00:03:08.910> spoon<00:03:09.300> was<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.440> just<00:03:10.470> kept

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
third one spoon was it and it just kept

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.640 
third one spoon was it and it just kept
on<00:03:11.070> going<00:03:11.130> in<00:03:11.550> cycles<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.930> think

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
on going in cycles like that so I think

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.980 
on going in cycles like that so I think
it's<00:03:13.770> pretty<00:03:14.160> hard<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.490> say<00:03:14.700> i<00:03:14.940> would<00:03:15.720> rate

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
it's pretty hard to say i would rate

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.530 
it's pretty hard to say i would rate
rate<00:03:16.410> myself<00:03:16.590> but<00:03:16.980> i<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.940> that<00:03:18.000> pretty<00:03:18.480> much

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
rate myself but i think that pretty much

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140 
rate myself but i think that pretty much
a<00:03:19.050> top<00:03:19.230> five<00:03:19.470> player<00:03:19.740> during<00:03:20.340> all<00:03:20.580> time<00:03:20.880> for

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
a top five player during all time for

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.680 
a top five player during all time for
sure<00:03:21.590> well<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.010> strongest<00:03:23.370> side<00:03:23.580> i<00:03:23.610> had<00:03:23.940> when

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
sure well the strongest side i had when

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.540
