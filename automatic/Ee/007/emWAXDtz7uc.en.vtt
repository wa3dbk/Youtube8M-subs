00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.020
 hello and welcome to geneva 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.900
 and with another world premiere that 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:16.380
 Here's the new toyota aygo he 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.770
 shares the platform with the peugeot 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.919
 108 and the third in the covenant of the citroen 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.730
 c1 you see it too on the same 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.730
 built platform 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.380
 The front at Mango has become complete 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.300
 changed here in the front this sixx that is 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.610
 the new language of forms looks like this 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.230
 Bit of a bad pokemon though 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.230
 is actually quite good for him 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.950
 This design concept will also be at the back 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.930
 resumed 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.330
 the ixs in front under the hood in one 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.330
 three-cylinder with 68 hp 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.350
 In the interior, it is relatively simple 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.880
 the playfull call the toyota is supposed to do so 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 a little bit to the Japanese 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.549
 youth culture definitely remember 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.420
 There's a decent one here 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.590
 entertainment system piano lacquer bit 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.149
 fingerprint sensitive here that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 red wine outside that reminds a bit 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.530
 the vw up otherwise the materials that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:25.250
 feels very well made good 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.250
 impression toyota aygo with panoramic roof 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 Of course, the front here is essential 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 European and not so playful 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.009
 as with the competitor from Japan 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.320
 but here is clearly show 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.450
 it's on it you can see so synonymous 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.320
 that it's the French interpretation 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.320
 this small car 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.179
 and that also the peugeot 108 the 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.369
 same base has you see here 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:02.700
 luggage compartment as well as the glass pane 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.130
 here 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.140
 and if you look in the back of it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.890
 compartment then it looks exactly like 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.989
 at toyota aygo here in the interior too 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.510
 There are hardly any differences to see here 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.940
 Of course we are sitting in the peugeot 108 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.250
 in a fully equipped model with 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.890
 leather seats integrated headrests 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.290
 but overall, the ambience is accurate 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.299
 the same as in the toyota aygo I am 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.849
 curious how the priced itself 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:31.410
 be different 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.610
 so also here in front it becomes visible that it 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.920
 but it is about the same car 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.480
 Of course also influenced by the company logo in 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 this case of citroÃ«n 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.650
 out 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.750
 if this little sign would be little 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.659
 I would not know which car I am in 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.640
 currently toyota aygo peugeot 108 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.340
 or as in this case citroen c1 because 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.650
 in fact the ambience here is exact 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.400
 the same multimedia systems with the 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.330
 piano lacquer also prone to fingers here 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.349
 five-speed same 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.599
 dashboard 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.280
 So I'm curious which of these 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.379
 three small cars actually at the end of the 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.030
 nose front has the two French or 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:21.569
 just the Japanese 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.569
 you do not know
