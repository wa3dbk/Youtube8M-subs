00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 it's all fast for a video 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.859
 on lcp content and which version 3.1 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.719
 ie the most recent then shot 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.900
 for the previous video how to kill the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.750
 cp 106 there are other short and I you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.949
 talked about s &amp; p 62nd 70.92 I do not know 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.449
 exactly which is which given 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.800
 that they do not have to display the 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:24.330
 presenting what we will do I will 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.550
 ask which is the realistic 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 creator of super content and which 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 of what and his landscapes and on his 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.309
 game background will allow you the answer 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.329
 by the notation have already listened 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.590
 the atmosphere of the room put you the sound 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.989
 that's really to bring 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.699
 shops with a residential area in 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.559
 the room here is the room its center 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.829
 is very weak so you have to 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.839
 present to access or power 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 also a kind of cage with 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.739
 inside a computer 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.690
 the cp 62 or 512 is a simple 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 computer but endowed with a kind of a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 sorcerer according to the presentation sheet 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.100
 that I read and who is possessed by a 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.149
 kind of wizard if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.530
 so here I tried several things 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:09.929
 particular to communicate with 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.479
 him a radio ambitions I'm going to do 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:14.539
 fucking the video condition of finding to 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.399
 different channels 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:20.580
 So here there if I'm a little disappointed 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.320
 the room let's say that on those targeted in 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.149
 anyway it was the last room where 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.009
 I had gone through three rooms 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.619
 different with the white cp I had this 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.550
 he wants twice the CP 106 so game 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.679
 but it was really a very last 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.360
 simple of the map is obviously very 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.340
 happy to find it because it takes 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.310
 late January but I was disappointed I was 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.620
 disappointed 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.880
 already by the lack of posters 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:44.280
 the camera was a bit suspenseful 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.230
 okay but that's not really 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 of possible interest with radiology ps 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.800
 which I have not tried maybe that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.410
 with the gps that it does not happen 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.520
 very much no danger 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.530
 here I was expecting I was expecting 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.200
 something a little more intriguing 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.390
 for a last room in so had to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.760
 was expecting something a little more 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 a trio here is a very short video 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.550
 I show you how are you going next? 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.959
 video it will be on the room of the s &amp; p 106 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.220
 which is also novelty with a small 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.150
 bonus of twice that in the end I got 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 a praying mantis 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.300
 I explain you recently the next 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.300
 video with soul to all
