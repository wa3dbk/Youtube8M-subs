some individuals do select creatine
supplements<00:00:45.090> there's<00:00:46.080> probably<00:00:46.320> been<00:00:46.440> over<00:00:46.500> a

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
supplements there's probably been over a

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.200 
supplements there's probably been over a
thousand<00:00:47.130> studies<00:00:47.310> on<00:00:47.670> creatine

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210

supplementation with or without exercise

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.570 
supplementation with or without exercise
and<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:52.680> seeing<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.220> that<00:00:53.250> creatine

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
and what we're seeing is that creatine

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.670 
and what we're seeing is that creatine
as<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> beneficial<00:00:54.540> effect<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:55.050> increasing

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
as a beneficial effect that increasing

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.560 
as a beneficial effect that increasing
potential<00:00:56.040> energy<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:57.150> if<00:00:57.240> you<00:00:57.330> give<00:00:57.450> an

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
potential energy so if you give an

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.240 
potential energy so if you give an
individual<00:00:58.050> more<00:00:58.200> potential<00:00:58.710> energy<00:00:58.800> when

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
individual more potential energy when

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.250 
individual more potential energy when
they're<00:00:59.370> exercising<00:00:59.490> they<00:01:00.180> may<00:01:00.330> be<00:01:00.390> exercised

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
they're exercising they may be exercised

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.410 
they're exercising they may be exercised
longer<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.040> higher<00:01:02.220> intensity<00:01:02.330> and<00:01:03.330> we

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
longer and at a higher intensity and we

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
longer and at a higher intensity and we
saw<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.720> quite<00:01:04.019> apparent<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.619> younger

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
saw that quite apparent in younger

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.219 
saw that quite apparent in younger
individuals<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.450> thought<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.689> with<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
individuals so the thought is with the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.230 
individuals so the thought is with the
ageing<00:01:07.560> body<00:01:07.799> usually<00:01:08.549> after<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> age<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
ageing body usually after the age of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.789 
ageing body usually after the age of
around<00:01:09.329> 50s<00:01:10.020> where<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.320> start<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.619> see<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
around 50s where we start to see a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.310 
around 50s where we start to see a
decrease<00:01:11.310> in<00:01:11.340> muscle<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.119> bone<00:01:12.299> health<00:01:12.600> we

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
decrease in muscle and bone health we

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.990 
decrease in muscle and bone health we
thought<00:01:13.560> if<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.950> give<00:01:14.100> creatine<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.880> these

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
thought if we can give creatine to these

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.520 
thought if we can give creatine to these
individuals<00:01:15.539> while<00:01:15.750> their<00:01:15.899> weight<00:01:16.079> training

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
individuals while their weight training

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.080 
individuals while their weight training
they<00:01:16.920> may<00:01:17.130> get<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> greater<00:01:17.700> increase<00:01:18.060> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
they may get a greater increase in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
they may get a greater increase in
strength<00:01:18.539> muscle<00:01:19.049> mass<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.590> bone<00:01:19.799> health<00:01:19.829> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
strength muscle mass and bone health and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.950 
strength muscle mass and bone health and
hopefully<00:01:20.880> that'll<00:01:21.060> lead<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.329> an<00:01:21.420> increase<00:01:21.780> in

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
hopefully that'll lead to an increase in

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.169 
hopefully that'll lead to an increase in
functionality<00:01:22.579> so<00:01:23.579> we've<00:01:23.700> done<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> build

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179 
functionality so we've done a build

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.209 
functionality so we've done a build
probably<00:01:24.509> 10<00:01:24.689> or<00:01:24.810> 15<00:01:25.079> studies<00:01:25.530> now<00:01:25.710> looking

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
probably 10 or 15 studies now looking

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.950 
probably 10 or 15 studies now looking
specifically<00:01:26.640> at<00:01:26.729> creatine<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.390> aging<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
specifically at creatine and aging and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.870 
specifically at creatine and aging and
what<00:01:28.560> we're<00:01:28.710> finding<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.670> definitely

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
what we're finding is that it definitely

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
what we're finding is that it definitely
does<00:01:30.210> increase<00:01:30.659> muscular<00:01:30.929> strength<00:01:31.380> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
does increase muscular strength so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.120 
does increase muscular strength so
ability<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.969> contract<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.630> muscle<00:01:34.020> group<00:01:34.409> at<00:01:35.069> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
ability to contract a muscle group at a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
ability to contract a muscle group at a
powerful<00:01:35.579> range<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:36.869> definitely<00:01:37.200> see<00:01:37.319> an

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
powerful range we definitely see an

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.840 
powerful range we definitely see an
increase<00:01:37.679> in<00:01:37.710> muscle<00:01:37.950> mass<00:01:38.130> so<00:01:38.670> for

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
increase in muscle mass so for

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
increase in muscle mass so for
functionality<00:01:39.659> later<00:01:39.869> on<00:01:40.109> in<00:01:40.229> life<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.679> does

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
functionality later on in life it does

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.679 
functionality later on in life it does
seem<00:01:41.039> to<00:01:41.159> help<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.969> the<00:01:42.060> new<00:01:42.179> emerging

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
seem to help but the new emerging

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.599 
seem to help but the new emerging
therapy<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.469> strategies<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.219> is<00:01:44.310> actually

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:44.609 
therapy or strategies that is actually

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:46.879 
therapy or strategies that is actually
increasing<00:01:45.119> bone<00:01:45.329> health<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.960> seems<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889 
increasing bone health it seems like the

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:48.679 
increasing bone health it seems like the
cells<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.340> our<00:01:47.399> bone<00:01:47.579> use<00:01:47.939> creatine<00:01:48.359> as

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
cells in our bone use creatine as

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
cells in our bone use creatine as
potential<00:01:49.079> energy<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.679> we<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> it

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
potential energy and we think that it

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609

can<00:01:50.999> actually<00:01:51.270> make<00:01:51.359> our<00:01:51.509> bones<00:01:51.719> more<00:01:52.319> rigid

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
can actually make our bones more rigid

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.559 
can actually make our bones more rigid
so<00:01:52.819> specifically<00:01:53.819> for<00:01:54.030> individuals<00:01:54.149> with

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
creatine is about a teaspoon and you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.150 
creatine is about a teaspoon and you
combine<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.710> or<00:02:16.950> can

a little bit before and a little bit
after<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:21.590> what<00:02:22.590> we're<00:02:22.710> actually<00:02:22.920> seeing<00:02:23.190> in

after and what we're actually seeing in
previous<00:02:23.670> studies<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.300> has<00:02:24.420> shown

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
previous studies is that it has shown

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.560 
previous studies is that it has shown

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
have a trend or potential cute

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.690 
have a trend or potential cute
beneficial<00:02:28.320> effects<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.310> want<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.550> look

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
beneficial effects and we want to look

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.490 
beneficial effects and we want to look
at<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> long<00:02:30.000> longer<00:02:30.480> term<00:02:30.630> effects<00:02:31.290> over

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
at the long longer term effects over

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800 
at the long longer term effects over
time<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.640> theory<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.660> give

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
time so the theory is that if you give

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.620 
time so the theory is that if you give
creatine<00:02:34.380> which<00:02:34.620> is<00:02:34.890> aiding<00:02:35.880> in<00:02:36.030> energy
