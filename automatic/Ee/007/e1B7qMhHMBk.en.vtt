other<00:00:49.289> videos<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:50.160> showed<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.910> how<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.059> prepare

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
other videos I showed you how to prepare

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.840 
other videos I showed you how to prepare
this<00:00:51.770> organically<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.250> can<00:00:53.430> use<00:00:53.610> synthetic

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
this organically you can use synthetic

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.590 
this organically you can use synthetic
fertilizer<00:00:55.129> again<00:00:56.129> look<00:00:56.969> let<00:00:57.270> me<00:00:57.360> see<00:00:57.480> if<00:00:57.539> I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
fertilizer again look let me see if I

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.410 
fertilizer again look let me see if I
can<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.960> tablespoon<00:00:58.620> put<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.460> tablespoon<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
can get a tablespoon put a tablespoon in

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.789 
can get a tablespoon put a tablespoon in
there<00:01:00.739> now<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.609> do<00:01:02.760> either<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.799> do

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
there now the reason I do either I do

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.740 
there now the reason I do either I do
prefer<00:01:05.189> organic<00:01:05.400> but<00:01:06.299> when<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.450> do<00:01:06.540> these

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
prefer organic but when I do these

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
prefer organic but when I do these
videos<00:01:07.110> sometimes<00:01:07.430> organic<00:01:08.430> fertilizers

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
videos sometimes organic fertilizers

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.340 
videos sometimes organic fertilizers
aren't<00:01:09.210> available<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.689> different<00:01:10.020> countries

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
aren't available in different countries

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so you don't need to stress whether it's

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.530 
so you don't need to stress whether it's
organic<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:12.990> synthetic<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.680> whatever<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.729> do

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the 1 tablespoon of fertilizer and I

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.440 
the 1 tablespoon of fertilizer and I
always<00:01:22.590> recommend<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.909> using<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
always recommend really using a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.179 
always recommend really using a
tablespoon<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> measure<00:01:25.320> this<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:25.860> usually

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
tablespoon to measure this is usually

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.399 
tablespoon to measure this is usually
less<00:01:26.610> fertilizer<00:01:27.180> than<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
less fertilizer than you need it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.200 
less fertilizer than you need it's

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
better to have less than more and the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.870 
better to have less than more and the
plants<00:01:30.540> will<00:01:30.659> find<00:01:30.869> what<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> needs<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:32.549> mixing

when you fill it fill it about halfway

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.500 
when you fill it fill it about halfway
four<00:02:43.620> inches<00:02:43.829> on<00:02:43.950> top<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:44.790> when<00:02:45.389> the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
four inches on top of there and when the

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.910 
four inches on top of there and when the
greenery<00:02:45.930> grows<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:47.569> six<00:02:48.569> inches<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.829> about

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
greenery grows up six inches to about

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920 
greenery grows up six inches to about
here<00:02:50.310> you're<00:02:50.760> going<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.970> fill<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.299> up<00:02:51.389> half

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
here you're going to fill it up half

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.330 
here you're going to fill it up half
you're<00:02:52.319> going<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.560> fill<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.889> container<00:02:53.010> again

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
you're going to fill the container again

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.610 
you're going to fill the container again
and<00:02:53.730> cover<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.329> half<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.810> two-thirds<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
and cover it half to two-thirds of the

and cover it half to two-thirds of the
greenery<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> then<00:02:56.609> when<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.880> grows<00:02:57.090> again<00:02:57.480> to

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
greenery and then when it grows again to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.300 
greenery and then when it grows again to
about<00:02:57.840> twelve<00:02:58.200> inches<00:02:58.319> you're<00:02:58.980> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.160> fill

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
about twelve inches you're going to fill

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.620 
about twelve inches you're going to fill
up<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.579> rest<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.850> the<00:02:59.970> way<00:03:00.060> up<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.359> here<00:03:00.540> and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
up the rest of the way up to here and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.840 
up the rest of the way up to here and
the<00:03:00.750> reason<00:03:01.049> you<00:03:01.139> do<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.319> is<00:03:01.650> potatoes<00:03:02.519> don't

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
the reason you do that is potatoes don't

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.430 
the reason you do that is potatoes don't
grow<00:03:03.060> down<00:03:03.299> where<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.630> roots<00:03:03.810> are<00:03:04.019> they

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
grow down where the roots are they

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.949 
grow down where the roots are they
actually<00:03:04.769> come<00:03:05.010> out<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.160> the<00:03:05.400> stalk<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.389> as<00:03:06.720> the

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
actually come out of the stalk so as the

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.390 
actually come out of the stalk so as the
greenery<00:03:07.290> grows<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.799> add<00:03:07.920> more<00:03:08.100> soil

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
greenery grows you add more soil

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.250 
greenery grows you add more soil
potatoes<00:03:09.060> will<00:03:09.180> grow<00:03:09.329> into<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.569> and<00:03:10.139> when

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
potatoes will grow into that and when

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.809 
potatoes will grow into that and when
you<00:03:10.350> get<00:03:10.500> to<00:03:10.680> full<00:03:10.889> size<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.489> could<00:03:11.579> have<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
you get to full size you could have the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.550 
you get to full size you could have the
soil<00:03:12.030> all<00:03:12.209> the<00:03:12.239> way<00:03:12.389> up<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.569> here<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:12.989> this

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
soil all the way up to here and this

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.780 
soil all the way up to here and this
whole<00:03:13.769> container<00:03:14.130> will<00:03:14.459> fill<00:03:14.639> up<00:03:14.760> with
