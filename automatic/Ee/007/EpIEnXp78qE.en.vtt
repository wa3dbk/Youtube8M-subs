00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
with the mini well this is really is not

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.270 
with the mini well this is really is not
the<00:00:06.629> pneumatics<00:00:07.109> but<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> man<00:00:07.589> x2<00:00:08.630> spyderco

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
the pneumatics but the man x2 spyderco

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.919 
the pneumatics but the man x2 spyderco
cts<00:00:11.280> xhp<00:00:12.889> sprint<00:00:13.889> run<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.089> full<00:00:15.299> flat<00:00:15.570> but

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
cts xhp sprint run this is full flat but

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.980 
cts xhp sprint run this is full flat but
the<00:00:16.109> little<00:00:17.100> wider<00:00:17.400> blade<00:00:17.730> might<00:00:18.119> behave<00:00:18.930> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
the little wider blade might behave a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.240 
the little wider blade might behave a
little<00:00:19.109> differently<00:00:19.320> in<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.830> thick<00:00:20.039> rubber

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
little differently in that thick rubber

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.900 
little differently in that thick rubber
and<00:00:20.939> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.390> still<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.600> factory<00:00:22.109> edge<00:00:22.230> I

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
and this is still the factory edge I

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.519 
and this is still the factory edge I
might<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.150> one<00:00:24.330> twice<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.810> see<00:00:24.990> what<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
might do this one twice to see what the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.740 
might do this one twice to see what the
rough<00:00:25.710> edge<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.699> still<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.090> sharp<00:00:27.449> but<00:00:27.630> it's

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
rough edge is still very sharp but it's

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.589 
rough edge is still very sharp but it's
toothy<00:00:28.109> see<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.490> versus<00:00:30.420> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
toothy see what that is versus the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.639 
toothy see what that is versus the
polish<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> just<00:00:36.809> can<00:00:36.960> use<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.140> little<00:00:37.350> tire

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
polish so just can use this little tire
