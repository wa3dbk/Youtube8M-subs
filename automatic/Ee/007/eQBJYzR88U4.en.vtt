00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.040
 turn off the record and so here we have a department 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.340

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.750

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:28.590
 now it costs 32 gigabytes so on 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:33.000
 still here on the one hand is the inclusion 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.759
 wi-fi to connect with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.520
 smartphone so here we have nothing and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:44.460
 here we have a mount for 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.850

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:21.610
 open and close it for carrying with 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:29.890
 means for fixing the camera itself 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:34.620
 mechanism and move on because this 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:39.280
