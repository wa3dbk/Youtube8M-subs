fatty<00:01:22.140> acid<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.189> were<00:01:23.400> chronically<00:01:24.090> starved

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
fatty acid that were chronically starved

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.030 
fatty acid that were chronically starved
for<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.259> because<00:01:25.530> we're<00:01:25.710> chronically

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
for and because we're chronically

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
starved for it it causes inflammation

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.230

and<00:01:28.439> those<00:01:28.920> inflammatory<00:01:29.430> hormones

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and those inflammatory hormones

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.539 
and those inflammatory hormones
basically<00:01:31.049> force<00:01:31.439> your<00:01:31.650> body<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.979> gain<00:01:32.310> weight

when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.360> enough<00:01:33.570> omega-3<00:01:33.689> s<00:01:34.229> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
when you get enough omega-3 s the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.620 
when you get enough omega-3 s the
inflammation<00:01:35.220> goes<00:01:35.250> away<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:36.119> inflammatory

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
inflammation goes away the inflammatory

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.510 
inflammation goes away the inflammatory
of<00:01:36.869> hormones<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.439> away<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> you're<00:01:38.340> not

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
of hormones go away and you're not

gaining<00:01:39.150> weight<00:01:39.450> anymore<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.170> become<00:01:40.409> very

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
gaining weight anymore you become very

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.780 
gaining weight anymore you become very
efficient<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.860> losing<00:01:41.100> right<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.610> need

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
efficient at losing right so you need

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
efficient at losing right so you need
those<00:01:42.090> three<00:01:42.479> ingredients<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.960> need<00:01:42.990> protein

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
those three ingredients you need protein
