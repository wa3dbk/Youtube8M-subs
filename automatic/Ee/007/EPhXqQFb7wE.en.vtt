platform<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.450> has<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.719> same<00:00:13.110> kind<00:00:13.380> of

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
platform it has the same kind of

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.980 
platform it has the same kind of
topology<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:15.299> just<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.570> second<00:00:15.839> if<00:00:15.960> you

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
topology here in just a second if you

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.359 
topology here in just a second if you
come<00:00:16.230> actually<00:00:16.560> i<00:00:16.619> think<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.920> nice<00:00:17.070> picture

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
come actually i think the nice picture

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.000 
come actually i think the nice picture
is<00:00:17.460> from<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.730> side<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.560> will<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.920> the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
is from this side you will see that the

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.279

because it's for anyone ok so this is an
AMD<00:00:40.379> platform<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> see<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> screen

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
AMD platform you see the screen

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.810 
AMD platform you see the screen
connected<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:43.670> integrated<00:00:44.670> graphics

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
point the CN nvidia GPU planting i think

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.889 
point the CN nvidia GPU planting i think
it's<00:00:47.879> an<00:00:47.969> 8<00:00:48.180> 40<00:00:48.629> f<00:00:49.730> for<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.940> 484<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:54.660> does

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's an 8 40 f for a 484 and and it does

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.189 
it's an 8 40 f for a 484 and and it does
everything<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.440> virtue<00:00:55.860> does<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.460> here<00:00:57.199> you

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
everything that virtue does but here you

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.420 
everything that virtue does but here you
do<00:00:58.350> not<00:00:58.379> have<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> quick<00:00:59.219> singh

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
do not have like the quick singh

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760 
do not have like the quick singh
features<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> all<00:01:00.840> but<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.559> have

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
features and and all but you have

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.820 
features and and all but you have
virtual<00:01:02.309> precinct<00:01:03.110> features<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.559> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
virtual precinct features right so

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.830 
virtual precinct features right so
somehow<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.309> sync<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.090> still<00:01:06.270> strong

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
somehow the sync thing is still strong

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.310 
somehow the sync thing is still strong
here<00:01:07.080> oh<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.510> all<00:01:09.810> over<00:01:10.080> here

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
here oh and you see are all over here

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.080 
here oh and you see are all over here
and<00:01:10.619> won't<00:01:10.890> want<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> show<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and won't want to show you is that the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
and won't want to show you is that the
first<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:12.750> saying<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> same<00:01:13.380> type

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
first of all was saying it's same type

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.990 
first of all was saying it's same type
of<00:01:13.920> behavior<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.610> you've<00:01:14.939> seen<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:16.880> on<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of behavior that you've seen them on the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.090 
of behavior that you've seen them on the
notebook<00:01:18.180> but<00:01:18.960> here<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> course<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.619> discrete

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
notebook but here of course the discrete

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.920 
notebook but here of course the discrete
graphics<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.580> push<00:01:20.790> push<00:01:21.210> much<00:01:21.450> more<00:01:21.630> frames

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
graphics can push push much more frames

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740 
graphics can push push much more frames
so<00:01:22.560> i'm<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> show<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.390> standard<00:01:24.390> vsync

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
so i'm going to show you standard vsync

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
so i'm going to show you standard vsync
operative<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.320> releasing<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.369> let

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
operative is releasing and then we let

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.640 
operative is releasing and then we let
you<00:01:26.640> playing<00:01:26.909> ok<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:27.990> you'll<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
you playing ok and you'll see the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.100 
you playing ok and you'll see the
difference<00:01:28.680> ill<00:01:29.159> while<00:01:29.900> go<00:01:30.900> for<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
difference ill while go for it so here

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
difference ill while go for it so here
his<00:01:34.830> own<00:01:35.270> but<00:01:36.270> no<00:01:36.690> visual<00:01:37.170> recent<00:01:37.590> so<00:01:37.740> far<00:01:46.970> your

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
his own but no visual recent so far your

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:09.020 
his own but no visual recent so far your
pictures<00:02:04.850> so<00:02:06.020> till<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.200> kept<00:02:07.500> 60fps<00:02:08.399> now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
pictures so till they kept 60fps now

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.770 
pictures so till they kept 60fps now
think<00:02:09.540> about<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.810> power<00:02:10.229> kept<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.100> 60fps<00:02:11.780> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
think about this power kept to 60fps it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.979 
think about this power kept to 60fps it
can<00:02:13.080> push<00:02:13.320> two<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.310> three<00:02:14.520> hundred<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
can push two or three hundred and you

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:20.720 
can push two or three hundred and you
will<00:02:16.140> see<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:18.860> okay<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:19.920> what<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.250> don't<00:02:20.610> know

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
will see it okay so what I don't know

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.300 
will see it okay so what I don't know
don't<00:02:21.480> keep<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.840> running<00:02:22.320> I<00:02:22.500> will<00:02:22.770> just<00:02:22.950> switch

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
don't keep it running I will just switch

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
don't keep it running I will just switch
the<00:02:23.340> mutually<00:02:24.030> single<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:27.090> isn't<00:02:27.450> releasing

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
the mutually single this isn't releasing

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.570 
the mutually single this isn't releasing
of<00:02:28.200> terminal<00:02:29.959> actually<00:02:30.959> but<00:02:31.860> visual<00:02:32.220> quality

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
of terminal actually but visual quality

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:47.360 
of terminal actually but visual quality
matters

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.820 

same

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.700 

what

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
what

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.559 
what
night

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:14.590 

now<00:02:57.140> we<00:02:57.200> all<00:02:57.439> noticed<00:02:58.280> already<00:02:58.519> virtually

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600
