sets that will see the next exercise
alright<00:02:13.939> so<00:02:14.180> next<00:02:14.330> up<00:02:14.569> after<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.019> bent

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
alright so next up after you have bent

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.320 
alright so next up after you have bent
over<00:02:15.439> one<00:02:15.769> arm<00:02:15.890> dumbbell<00:02:16.069> rows<00:02:16.580> we're<00:02:17.239> going

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
over one arm dumbbell rows we're going

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.809 
over one arm dumbbell rows we're going
to<00:02:17.420> be<00:02:17.480> doing<00:02:17.950> cable<00:02:18.950> face<00:02:19.159> polls<00:02:19.519> now<00:02:19.700> what

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
to be doing cable face polls now what

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.490 
to be doing cable face polls now what
this<00:02:19.939> is<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.629> a<00:02:20.659> really<00:02:20.900> efficient<00:02:21.379> way<00:02:21.470> to

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
this is it's a really efficient way to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.650 
this is it's a really efficient way to
target<00:02:22.340> your<00:02:22.579> rear<00:02:22.849> delts<00:02:22.879> the<00:02:23.779> inner<00:02:24.079> part

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
target your rear delts the inner part

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.500 
target your rear delts the inner part
right<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.670> can<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.090> don't<00:02:27.300> get

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
right and so we can really don't get

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170 
right and so we can really don't get
pause<00:02:28.230> hold<00:02:28.710> it<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.490> resistance<00:02:29.670> there's<00:02:30.090> a

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
pause hold it the resistance there's a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.330 
pause hold it the resistance there's a
fish<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.690> whole<00:02:30.870> way<00:02:31.050> on<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.250> going

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
fish in the whole way on it's not going

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.070 
fish in the whole way on it's not going
to<00:02:32.430> put<00:02:32.520> a<00:02:32.550> message<00:02:32.910> surge<00:02:33.150> stress<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.720> any<00:02:34.020> of

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
to put a message surge stress on any of

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500 
to put a message surge stress on any of
your<00:02:34.200> shoulder<00:02:34.560> rotator<00:02:35.220> cuff<00:02:35.430> right<00:02:35.700> so

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
your shoulder rotator cuff right so

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.250 
your shoulder rotator cuff right so
we're<00:02:36.600> going<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> hit<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.930> way<00:02:37.110> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
we're going to hit the way that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.720 
we're going to hit the way that
something<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.680> start<00:02:37.950> light<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.580> would

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
something in start light off this would

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.950 
something in start light off this would
be<00:02:38.790> super<00:02:39.240> citing<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.570> we're<00:02:39.750> only<00:02:39.840> doing

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
be super citing this we're only doing

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.830 
be super citing this we're only doing
three<00:02:40.260> sets<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:40.860> so<00:02:41.550> i<00:02:41.580> start<00:02:42.090> in<00:02:42.180> lighter

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
three sets of this so i start in lighter

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.390 
three sets of this so i start in lighter

not moving anything but your arms let's
do<00:04:11.070> with<00:04:11.220> that<00:04:11.310> you<00:04:11.610> can<00:04:11.730> really<00:04:11.880> flare<00:04:12.180> them

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
do with that you can really flare them

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.630 
do with that you can really flare them
off<00:04:12.510> with<00:04:12.720> elastics<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.920> tension<00:04:14.340> is<00:04:14.400> always

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
off with elastics the tension is always

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.310 
off with elastics the tension is always
going<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.850> be<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.970> snapback<00:04:15.480> where's<00:04:16.080> weeds

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
going to be a snapback where's weeds

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.039 
going to be a snapback where's weeds
there's<00:04:17.070> kind<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.340> momentum<00:04:17.610> so<00:04:17.970> again<00:04:18.150> fire

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
there's kind of momentum so again fire

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.350 
there's kind of momentum so again fire
those<00:04:19.260> off<00:04:19.580> you<00:04:20.580> probably<00:04:20.790> don't<00:04:20.970> do<00:04:21.120> more

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:21.360 
those off you probably don't do more

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.820 
those off you probably don't do more
than<00:04:21.450> 12<00:04:21.750> reps<00:04:21.959> to<00:04:22.110> just<00:04:22.290> do<00:04:22.380> as<00:04:22.470> many<00:04:22.620> as<00:04:22.770> you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
than 12 reps to just do as many as you

can to failure get that steady burn on

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.230 
can to failure get that steady burn on
take<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.100> couple<00:04:26.280> min<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> break<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.970> you<00:04:27.060> get
