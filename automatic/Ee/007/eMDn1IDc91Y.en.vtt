00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
moves differences between all their

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.820 
moves differences between all their
variations<00:00:12.000> as<00:00:12.240> well<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:12.840> their<00:00:13.290> basic<00:00:13.679> game

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
variations as well as their basic game

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.980 
variations as well as their basic game
plan<00:00:14.070> so<00:00:14.250> scorpion<00:00:14.790> he<00:00:15.450> has<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.599> couple<00:00:15.839> of

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
plan so scorpion he has a couple of

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.160 
plan so scorpion he has a couple of
different<00:00:16.109> game<00:00:16.440> plans<00:00:16.710> depending<00:00:17.279> on<00:00:17.490> his

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
different game plans depending on his

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.060 
different game plans depending on his
variation<00:00:19.170> but<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.680> main<00:00:19.830> thing<00:00:20.010> about

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
variation but the main thing about

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.890 
variation but the main thing about
scorpion<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:21.000> he's<00:00:21.240> relatively

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
scorpion is that he's relatively

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.140 
scorpion is that he's relatively
defensive<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.710> neutral<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.699> he<00:00:23.910> has<00:00:24.119> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
defensive in the neutral but he has a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.150 
defensive in the neutral but he has a
really<00:00:24.689> fast<00:00:24.900> teleport<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.800> very<00:00:25.949> hard

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
really fast teleport so it's very hard

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.920 
really fast teleport so it's very hard
to<00:00:26.189> zone<00:00:26.460> him<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:26.880> it's<00:00:27.570> very<00:00:27.779> uncomfortable

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
to zone him and it's very uncomfortable

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.259 
to zone him and it's very uncomfortable
fighting<00:00:28.800> him<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> neutral<00:00:29.670> in<00:00:29.820> general

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
fighting him in the neutral in general

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.410 
fighting him in the neutral in general
as<00:00:30.449> well<00:00:30.510> as<00:00:31.140> him<00:00:31.470> having<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.210> pretty<00:00:33.210> good

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
as well as him having a pretty good

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.360 
as well as him having a pretty good
vortex<00:00:34.050> once<00:00:34.410> he<00:00:34.559> hits<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:35.070> he<00:00:35.250> has

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
vortex once he hits you right he has

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
vortex once he hits you right he has
overhead<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.000> low<00:00:36.120> options<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.870> very

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
overhead and low options that are very

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
overhead and low options that are very
tricky<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.469> block<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.950> he's<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> general

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
tricky to block and he's just a general

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920 
tricky to block and he's just a general
all-around

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
all-around

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.690 
all-around
character<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> guess<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.100> would<00:00:41.219> describe<00:00:41.309> him

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
character I guess I would describe him

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.180 
character I guess I would describe him
as<00:00:41.790> but<00:00:42.420> he's<00:00:43.079> definitely<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.559> character<00:00:44.010> very

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
as but he's definitely a character very

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.470 
as but he's definitely a character very
good<00:00:44.370> at<00:00:44.430> controlling<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.969> neutral<00:00:45.329> very

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
good at controlling the neutral very

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
good at controlling the neutral very
frustrating<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> fight<00:00:46.350> against<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.219> he's<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
frustrating to fight against and he's a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.560 
frustrating to fight against and he's a
really<00:00:47.610> fun<00:00:47.789> character<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> play

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
really fun character to play

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.750 
really fun character to play
as<00:00:49.350> far<00:00:49.590> as<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> strings<00:00:50.070> go<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> first

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
as far as the strings go the first

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
as far as the strings go the first
things<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.239> mention<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.930> his<00:00:52.140> back<00:00:52.350> 3

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
things I would mention are his back 3

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.369 
things I would mention are his back 3
which<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.190> his<00:00:53.640> low<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.149> his<00:00:54.360> 4/4<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
which is his low and his 4/4 which is

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.439 
which is his low and his 4/4 which is
his<00:00:55.649> overhead<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.210> moves

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
his overhead so those two moves

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
his overhead so those two moves
obviously<00:00:58.079> very<00:00:58.289> important<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:58.920> they

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
obviously very important because they

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
obviously very important because they
lead<00:00:59.460> into<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.359> 50<00:01:00.600> 50s<00:01:00.899> with<00:01:01.079> his<00:01:01.170> low

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
lead into you know 50 50s with his low

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.560 
lead into you know 50 50s with his low
and<00:01:01.500> overhead<00:01:01.829> very<00:01:02.100> nice<00:01:02.280> his<00:01:02.969> back<00:01:03.300> too

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and overhead very nice his back too

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
and overhead very nice his back too
which<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.379> safe<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.830> block<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.339> his<00:01:05.460> forward

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
which is safe on block and his forward

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.130 
which is safe on block and his forward
too<00:01:05.970> which<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.270> pretty<00:01:06.479> hard<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> punish<00:01:06.869> and

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
too which is pretty hard to punish and

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.590 
too which is pretty hard to punish and
also<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.380> very<00:01:07.710> fast<00:01:08.010> overhead<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> those<00:01:09.510> are

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
also a very fast overhead is those are

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.700 
also a very fast overhead is those are
really<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.990> great<00:01:10.140> normal<00:01:10.409> as<00:01:10.470> well<00:01:10.619> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
really really great normal as well but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.590 
really really great normal as well but
back<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.920> has<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.490> much<00:01:11.670> range<00:01:12.000> really<00:01:12.390> really

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

great<00:01:12.810> normal<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.830> 1<00:01:14.010> 2<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> pretty

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
great normal to 1 2 is also a pretty

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.600 
great normal to 1 2 is also a pretty
good<00:01:15.470> hour<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.650> 1<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.310> really<00:01:17.430> good

is his talib where you can also do it in
the<00:02:01.979> air<00:02:02.130> yeah<00:02:02.729> as<00:02:03.360> we<00:02:03.570> mentioned<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.020> can

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the air yeah as we mentioned but you can

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
the air yeah as we mentioned but you can
also<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> teleport<00:02:05.729> fake<00:02:05.969> if<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.299> didn't

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
also do a teleport fake if you didn't

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.789 
also do a teleport fake if you didn't
see<00:02:06.630> look<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:06.899> my<00:02:06.960> stamina<00:02:07.259> there<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.649> hold

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
see look at my stamina there if I hold

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.770 
see look at my stamina there if I hold
down<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.759> fake<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.030> teleport<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.690> you

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
down you can fake the teleport and you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.750 
down you can fake the teleport and you
can<00:02:09.899> hit<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:10.050> button<00:02:10.200> pretty<00:02:10.500> quick<00:02:10.739> I'll<00:02:11.520> just

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
can hit a button pretty quick I'll just

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.970 
can hit a button pretty quick I'll just
try<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> jump<00:02:12.270> after<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.780> guys<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
try to jump after and you guys can see

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.220 
try to jump after and you guys can see
how<00:02:14.129> quickly<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.030> recover<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.900> really

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
how quickly and recover it's it's really

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.449 
how quickly and recover it's it's really
fast<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:16.680> it's<00:02:16.800> pretty<00:02:16.890> hard<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.190> see<00:02:17.310> that

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
fast right it's pretty hard to see that

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.170 
fast right it's pretty hard to see that
so<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.120> can<00:02:18.390> cancel<00:02:18.690> the<00:02:19.310> the<00:02:20.310> teleport<00:02:20.819> with

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
so you can cancel the the teleport with

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.899 
so you can cancel the the teleport with
that<00:02:21.930> as<00:02:22.200> well<00:02:22.500> as<00:02:22.650> holding<00:02:22.980> forward<00:02:23.610> right

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
that as well as holding forward right

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.699 
that as well as holding forward right
after<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.420> it<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.750> you<00:02:24.870> will<00:02:25.019> not<00:02:25.200> go<00:02:25.680> off

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
after you do it and you will not go off

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.170 
after you do it and you will not go off
the<00:02:26.040> screen<00:02:26.250> like<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:26.610> can<00:02:26.730> cancel<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.120> two

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the screen like so you can cancel in two

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.320 
the screen like so you can cancel in two
different<00:02:27.360> ways<00:02:27.569> but<00:02:28.349> basically<00:02:29.299> you<00:02:30.299> can

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
different ways but basically you can

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.699 
different ways but basically you can
fake<00:02:30.690> your<00:02:30.840> opponent<00:02:31.170> out<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.440> they're<00:02:31.530> like

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
fake your opponent out and they're like

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.050 
fake your opponent out and they're like
alright<00:02:31.950> well<00:02:32.160> I'm<00:02:32.250> waiting<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.549> block<00:02:32.790> and

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
alright well I'm waiting to block and

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.030 
alright well I'm waiting to block and
then<00:02:33.209> you<00:02:33.390> just<00:02:33.599> don't<00:02:33.840> you<00:02:34.470> know<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
then you just don't you know to the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
then you just don't you know to the
teleport<00:02:35.459> so<00:02:35.580> then<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.790> can<00:02:35.910> hit<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.030> button<00:02:36.180> or

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
teleport so then you can hit a button or

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.170 
teleport so then you can hit a button or
thrower<00:02:37.730> advantage<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.060> do

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
thrower advantage and what you do

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.449 
thrower advantage and what you do
whatever<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.930> teleport<00:02:40.769> there<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.430> a

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
whatever you want so teleport there is a

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.970 
whatever you want so teleport there is a
spear<00:02:41.849> which<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.120> backboard<00:02:42.540> one<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.860> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
spear which is backboard one you get you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680 
spear which is backboard one you get you
know<00:02:44.099> your<00:02:44.250> combo<00:02:44.670> after<00:02:44.970> you<00:02:45.390> get<00:02:45.540> your

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
know your combo after you get your

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.479 
know your combo after you get your
standing<00:02:46.110> reset<00:02:46.410> after<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.280> game

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
standing reset after and then this game

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.750 
standing reset after and then this game
exp<00:02:48.120> R<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.410> actually<00:02:49.410> safe<00:02:49.769> well<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:50.519> minus

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
exp R is actually safe well it's minus

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.699 
exp R is actually safe well it's minus
five<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.329> technically<00:02:51.900> certain<00:02:52.349> characters

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
five so technically certain characters

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.619 
five so technically certain characters
can<00:02:52.859> punish<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.280> with<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.579> reversal<00:02:54.239> special

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
can punish it with like reversal special

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.819 
can punish it with like reversal special
moves<00:02:54.780> but<00:02:54.959> it's<00:02:55.049> very<00:02:55.140> difficult<00:02:55.379> to<00:02:55.590> punish

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
moves but it's very difficult to punish

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.830 
moves but it's very difficult to punish
which<00:02:55.950> means<00:02:56.160> he<00:02:56.879> can<00:02:57.030> go<00:02:57.150> for<00:02:57.390> his<00:02:57.569> vortex

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
which means he can go for his vortex

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.319 
which means he can go for his vortex
relatively<00:02:58.799> safely<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.489> he<00:02:59.640> has<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.819> bar<00:03:00.090> which

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
relatively safely if he has a bar which

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.210 
relatively safely if he has a bar which
is<00:03:00.450> very<00:03:00.629> nice<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:01.379> other<00:03:01.500> universal<00:03:01.890> move<00:03:02.010> is

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
is very nice the other universal move is

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.619 
is very nice the other universal move is
his<00:03:02.400> takedown<00:03:02.670> which<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.030> back<00:03:03.180> for<00:03:03.359> four

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
armor does four percent more damage so

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.789 
armor does four percent more damage so
those<00:03:08.040> are<00:03:08.190> scorpions<00:03:08.670> Universal<00:03:09.180> moves<00:03:09.359> in

special moves but their variations are
very<00:04:11.549> wide<00:04:11.879> that's<00:04:12.239> that's<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.660> thing<00:04:12.810> about

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
very wide that's that's the thing about

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.720 
very wide that's that's the thing about
these<00:04:13.109> characters<00:04:13.500> so<00:04:13.530> their<00:04:14.069> variations<00:04:14.609> are

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
these characters so their variations are

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.860 
these characters so their variations are
really<00:04:14.910> what<00:04:15.030> changed<00:04:15.299> them<00:04:15.419> a<00:04:15.449> lot<00:04:15.599> so<00:04:15.750> now

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
really what changed them a lot so now

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.830 
calm off of this like if you're up close
you<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.490> get<00:04:32.580> huge<00:04:32.910> damage<00:04:33.270> combos<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
you can get huge damage combos this

you can get huge damage combos this
variation<00:04:34.260> does<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.410> lot<00:04:34.560> of<00:04:34.620> damage<00:04:34.770> and<00:04:35.160> it's

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
variation does a lot of damage and it's

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.340 
variation does a lot of damage and it's
very<00:04:35.490> good<00:04:35.580> at<00:04:35.700> zoning<00:04:36.000> but<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.810> doesn't<00:04:37.200> have

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
very good at zoning but it doesn't have

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.470 
very good at zoning but it doesn't have
any<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.650> the<00:04:37.770> strong<00:04:38.040> normals<00:04:38.520> or<00:04:38.820> Hellfire

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
any of the strong normals or Hellfire

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.660 
any of the strong normals or Hellfire
that<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.810> other<00:04:39.960> variation<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:40.650> he<00:04:41.520> also

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
that the other variation is so he also

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.190 
that the other variation is so he also
has<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.150> charge<00:04:42.390> which<00:04:42.600> is<00:04:42.690> down<00:04:42.810> back<00:04:42.990> one

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
has the charge which is down back one

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.290 
has the charge which is down back one
comes<00:04:43.440> from<00:04:43.590> behind<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.640> low<00:04:44.790> grab<00:04:45.060> with<00:04:45.240> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
comes from behind the low grab with the

comes from behind the low grab with the
EX<00:04:45.480> version<00:04:45.570> looks<00:04:45.960> like<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.260> just<00:04:46.530> last<00:04:46.770> a

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
EX version looks like that just last a

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.790 
EX version looks like that just last a
little<00:04:46.980> bit<00:04:47.070> longer<00:04:47.360> then<00:04:48.360> this<00:04:48.810> this<00:04:49.470> DX

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
little bit longer then this this DX

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.870 
little bit longer then this this DX
version<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.250> does<00:04:50.400> a<00:04:50.430> little<00:04:50.550> bit<00:04:50.700> more

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
version of that does a little bit more

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.930 
version of that does a little bit more
does<00:04:51.390> 5%<00:04:52.260> more<00:04:52.380> and<00:04:52.620> then<00:04:52.980> there's<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.490> down

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
does 5% more and then there's the down

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.550 
does 5% more and then there's the down
back<00:04:54.150> tube<00:04:54.330> which<00:04:54.450> is<00:04:54.570> an<00:04:54.630> overhead<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.350> he<00:04:55.440> has

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
back tube which is an overhead so he has

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.960 
back tube which is an overhead so he has
this<00:04:55.770> one<00:04:55.980> which<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.190> an<00:04:56.340> overhead<00:04:56.670> he<00:04:56.850> has

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
this one which is an overhead he has

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.730 
this one which is an overhead he has
this<00:04:57.150> one<00:04:57.390> which<00:04:57.540> is<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.720> low<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.410> he<00:04:58.590> has<00:04:58.710> a

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
this one which is a low and he has a

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.920 
this one which is a low and he has a
mate<00:04:58.950> version<00:04:59.370> they<00:05:00.060> overhead<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.570> ex1

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
mate version they overhead the ex1

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.270 
mate version they overhead the ex1
knocks<00:05:01.170> down<00:05:01.380> does<00:05:01.770> a<00:05:01.800> little<00:05:01.920> bit<00:05:02.100> extra

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
knocks down does a little bit extra

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.100 
knocks down does a little bit extra
damage<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:02.820> that's<00:05:02.940> pretty<00:05:03.240> annoying<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.960> deal

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
damage so that's pretty annoying to deal

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.550 
damage so that's pretty annoying to deal
with<00:05:04.200> right<00:05:04.430> this<00:05:05.430> kind<00:05:05.580> of<00:05:05.700> stuff<00:05:06.380> yeah<00:05:07.380> so

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
with right this kind of stuff yeah so

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.220 
with right this kind of stuff yeah so
that<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.340> very<00:05:08.940> very<00:05:09.240> strong<00:05:09.630> zoning

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
that is a very very strong zoning

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:13.220 
that is a very very strong zoning
variation<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.540> scorpion<00:05:12.540> right<00:05:12.690> really<00:05:13.080> good

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
variation of scorpion right really good

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.990 
variation of scorpion right really good
for<00:05:13.530> locking<00:05:13.890> you<00:05:14.160> down<00:05:14.370> on<00:05:14.550> your<00:05:14.700> approach

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
for locking you down on your approach

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.900 
for locking you down on your approach
very<00:05:15.840> annoying<00:05:16.260> to<00:05:16.380> deal<00:05:16.560> with<00:05:16.800> and<00:05:17.250> he<00:05:17.670> still

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
very annoying to deal with and he still

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.040 
very annoying to deal with and he still
has<00:05:18.030> those<00:05:18.150> other<00:05:18.360> moves<00:05:18.540> right<00:05:18.660> he<00:05:18.780> still<00:05:18.960> has

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
has those other moves right he still has

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.360 
has those other moves right he still has
the<00:05:19.230> spear<00:05:19.560> and<00:05:19.710> his<00:05:19.800> takedown<00:05:20.130> in<00:05:20.250> his

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
the spear and his takedown in his

teleport along with all those those

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.360 
teleport along with all those those
other<00:05:22.169> moves<00:05:22.410> so<00:05:22.680> that's<00:05:22.890> just<00:05:23.010> something<00:05:23.220> you

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
other moves so that's just something you

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.430 
other moves so that's just something you
have<00:05:23.490> to<00:05:23.520> keep<00:05:23.730> in<00:05:23.880> mind<00:05:24.200> when<00:05:25.200> playing

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
have to keep in mind when playing

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.390 
have to keep in mind when playing
against<00:05:25.830> him<00:05:25.950> let's<00:05:26.910> take<00:05:27.090> a<00:05:27.240> look<00:05:27.570> at<00:05:27.780> his

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
against him let's take a look at his

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.070 
against him let's take a look at his
ninjutsu<00:05:29.400> variation<00:05:30.060> now<00:05:30.150> this<00:05:30.330> one<00:05:30.540> is<00:05:30.750> the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
ninjutsu variation now this one is the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.110 
ninjutsu variation now this one is the
one<00:05:31.410> that<00:05:31.770> is<00:05:32.130> pretty<00:05:32.430> interesting<00:05:32.669> because

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
one that is pretty interesting because

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.060 
one that is pretty interesting because
he<00:05:33.450> doesn't<00:05:33.660> actually<00:05:34.110> gain<00:05:34.320> if<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.680> look<00:05:34.890> at

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070 
he doesn't actually gain if you look at

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.830 
he doesn't actually gain if you look at
his<00:05:35.190> special<00:05:35.550> move<00:05:35.669> he<00:05:36.419> doesn't<00:05:36.720> actually

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
his special move he doesn't actually

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.790 
his special move he doesn't actually
gain<00:05:37.200> any<00:05:37.530> additional<00:05:38.340> new<00:05:38.610> special<00:05:39.419> moves

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
gain any additional new special moves

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.200 
gain any additional new special moves
everything<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:40.980> this<00:05:41.100> character<00:05:41.580> has<00:05:41.820> is

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
everything that this character has is

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.230 
everything that this character has is
normals<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:43.410> his<00:05:43.620> back<00:05:43.800> to<00:05:44.040> from<00:05:44.700> before<00:05:45.030> has

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
normals so his back to from before has

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.740 
normals so his back to from before has
changed<00:05:45.810> into<00:05:46.350> this<00:05:46.910> like<00:05:47.910> this<00:05:48.150> move<00:05:48.450> is

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
changed into this like this move is

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.740 
changed into this like this move is
massive<00:05:49.740> range<00:05:50.040> very<00:05:50.700> very<00:05:51.000> huge<00:05:51.300> hitbox

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:51.750 
massive range very very huge hitbox

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:54.500 
massive range very very huge hitbox
really<00:05:52.169> good<00:05:52.290> for<00:05:52.470> hands<00:05:52.680> hiring<00:05:53.070> and<00:05:53.300> yeah<00:05:54.300> it

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:54.510 
really good for hands hiring and yeah it

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.030 
really good for hands hiring and yeah it
is<00:05:54.630> it<00:05:54.840> is<00:05:54.960> unsafe<00:05:55.229> home<00:05:55.380> walk<00:05:55.620> that's<00:05:55.860> one

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
is it is unsafe home walk that's one

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.200 
is it is unsafe home walk that's one
thing<00:05:56.250> you<00:05:56.370> can<00:05:56.520> space<00:05:56.729> it<00:05:56.940> pretty<00:05:57.120> well

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
thing you can space it pretty well

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.210 
thing you can space it pretty well
though<00:05:57.419> he<00:05:57.870> also<00:05:58.020> has<00:05:58.290> this<00:05:58.470> forward<00:05:58.890> to<00:05:59.040> this

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
though he also has this forward to this

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.340 
though he also has this forward to this
double<00:05:59.580> hit<00:05:59.729> like<00:05:59.880> that<00:06:00.120> which<00:06:00.690> is<00:06:00.720> also<00:06:01.320> a

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:01.350 
double hit like that which is also a

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:03.500 
double hit like that which is also a
very<00:06:01.650> strong<00:06:01.770> move<00:06:02.310> pretty<00:06:02.940> good<00:06:03.030> in<00:06:03.210> pussies

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
very strong move pretty good in pussies

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.290 
very strong move pretty good in pussies
like<00:06:03.540> that<00:06:03.870> great<00:06:04.680> range<00:06:04.950> it's<00:06:05.820> like<00:06:05.910> minus<00:06:06.150> 10

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
like that great range it's like minus 10

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.510 
like that great range it's like minus 10
or<00:06:06.330> 11<00:06:06.630> on<00:06:06.720> walk<00:06:06.900> as<00:06:07.050> well<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:08.040> other<00:06:08.070> moves<00:06:08.400> he

right there he has his back three two
forward<00:06:30.930> to<00:06:31.110> which<00:06:31.650> looks<00:06:31.860> like<00:06:31.890> this<00:06:32.630> so<00:06:33.630> that

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:33.660 
forward to which looks like this so that

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.880 
forward to which looks like this so that
has<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.870> little<00:06:34.050> overhead<00:06:34.320> at<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.530> end<00:06:34.650> of<00:06:34.770> it

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.890 
has a little overhead at the end of it

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.909 
has a little overhead at the end of it
and<00:06:35.010> his<00:06:35.550> a<00:06:35.580> forward<00:06:36.240> for<00:06:36.630> has<00:06:37.110> a<00:06:37.140> string<00:06:37.800> off

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
and his a forward for has a string off

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.140 
and his a forward for has a string off
of<00:06:38.070> it<00:06:38.190> with<00:06:38.370> a<00:06:38.400> 4-4-2

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
of it with a 4-4-2

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.730 
of it with a 4-4-2
it's<00:06:39.630> like<00:06:39.750> that<00:06:39.960> so

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
it's like that so

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.469 
it's like that so
scorpion<00:06:42.550> gains<00:06:42.729> all<00:06:42.910> these<00:06:43.060> additional

scorpion gains all these additional

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:46.260 
scorpion gains all these additional
normals<00:06:43.990> and<00:06:44.310> ways<00:06:45.310> to<00:06:45.340> control<00:06:45.820> space<00:06:46.000> with

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
normals and ways to control space with

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.850 
normals and ways to control space with
his<00:06:46.419> buttons<00:06:46.840> that<00:06:47.050> he<00:06:47.169> previously<00:06:47.470> didn't

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
his buttons that he previously didn't

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.710 
his buttons that he previously didn't
have<00:06:48.039> before<00:06:48.400> right<00:06:48.610> like<00:06:48.789> he<00:06:48.910> he<00:06:49.330> didn't<00:06:49.570> have

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
have before right like he he didn't have

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.420 
have before right like he he didn't have
the<00:06:50.050> greatest<00:06:50.380> foot<00:06:50.710> season<00:06:51.070> and<00:06:51.190> that<00:06:51.340> was

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
the greatest foot season and that was

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.499 
the greatest foot season and that was
one<00:06:51.520> of<00:06:51.610> the<00:06:51.699> things<00:06:51.880> I<00:06:51.970> touched<00:06:52.180> on<00:06:52.330> in<00:06:52.479> the

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:52.509 
one of the things I touched on in the

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:53.879 
one of the things I touched on in the
start<00:06:52.720> of<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.840> video<00:06:52.900> right<00:06:53.229> he<00:06:53.620> didn't<00:06:53.770> have

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:53.889 
start of the video right he didn't have

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.499 
start of the video right he didn't have
anything<00:06:54.220> from<00:06:54.460> this<00:06:54.699> range<00:06:54.970> like<00:06:55.210> ain<00:06:55.389> t

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:55.509 
anything from this range like ain t

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:56.640 
anything from this range like ain t
didn't<00:06:55.690> have<00:06:55.810> anything<00:06:56.080> that<00:06:56.229> reached<00:06:56.500> of

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 
didn't have anything that reached of

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.469 
didn't have anything that reached of
this<00:06:56.740> range<00:06:56.979> closest<00:06:57.729> thing<00:06:57.850> was<00:06:57.970> is<00:06:58.090> down<00:06:58.240> for

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
this range closest thing was is down for

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.939 
this range closest thing was is down for
which<00:06:58.690> reaches<00:06:59.020> a<00:06:59.050> little<00:06:59.289> closer<00:06:59.500> but<00:06:59.830> it

00:06:59.939 --> 00:06:59.949 
which reaches a little closer but it

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:00.930 
which reaches a little closer but it
doesn't<00:07:00.190> leave<00:07:00.280> anything<00:07:00.610> right<00:07:00.880> now

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:00.940 
doesn't leave anything right now

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.020 
doesn't leave anything right now
suddenly<00:07:01.539> that<00:07:02.530> is<00:07:02.800> a<00:07:02.830> threat<00:07:03.190> that<00:07:03.490> that<00:07:03.550> is<00:07:04.000> a

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
suddenly that is a threat that that is a

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.749 
suddenly that is a threat that that is a
legitimate<00:07:04.539> threat<00:07:04.870> from<00:07:05.289> a<00:07:05.500> very<00:07:05.919> far<00:07:06.310> range

00:07:06.749 --> 00:07:06.759 
legitimate threat from a very far range

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:08.700 
legitimate threat from a very far range
as<00:07:07.090> well<00:07:07.570> as<00:07:07.690> that<00:07:07.840> right<00:07:08.080> that<00:07:08.289> that<00:07:08.530> is<00:07:08.590> very

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710 
as well as that right that that is very

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.689 
as well as that right that that is very
far<00:07:09.070> as<00:07:09.190> well<00:07:09.840> so<00:07:10.840> ninjutsu<00:07:11.620> is<00:07:12.100> all<00:07:12.370> about

00:07:12.689 --> 00:07:12.699 
far as well so ninjutsu is all about

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.210 
far as well so ninjutsu is all about
footsies<00:07:13.449> and<00:07:13.930> staying<00:07:14.380> in<00:07:14.590> there<00:07:14.770> and<00:07:15.009> close

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
footsies and staying in there and close

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.460 
footsies and staying in there and close
up<00:07:15.460> game<00:07:15.669> and<00:07:15.940> the<00:07:16.360> other<00:07:16.479> two<00:07:16.630> variations<00:07:17.169> are

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
up game and the other two variations are

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:19.860 
up game and the other two variations are
two<00:07:18.009> different<00:07:18.370> takes<00:07:18.520> on<00:07:18.759> zoning<00:07:19.389> characters

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:19.870 
two different takes on zoning characters

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.560 
two different takes on zoning characters
so<00:07:20.080> again<00:07:20.770> scorpion<00:07:21.310> like<00:07:21.520> sub-zero<00:07:22.060> not

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:22.570 
so again scorpion like sub-zero not

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.629 
so again scorpion like sub-zero not
super<00:07:23.020> complicated<00:07:23.410> but<00:07:23.860> their<00:07:24.070> variations

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
super complicated but their variations

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:26.790 
super complicated but their variations
are<00:07:24.940> pretty<00:07:25.270> wide<00:07:25.599> so<00:07:25.990> they're<00:07:26.139> very<00:07:26.169> matchup

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 
are pretty wide so they're very matchup

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.740 
are pretty wide so they're very matchup
specific<00:07:27.430> and<00:07:27.970> I<00:07:28.330> think<00:07:28.509> that's<00:07:28.630> really

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:28.750 
specific and I think that's really

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:29.939 
specific and I think that's really
interesting<00:07:28.870> way<00:07:29.259> to<00:07:29.289> do<00:07:29.470> the<00:07:29.560> character<00:07:29.830> now

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
interesting way to do the character now

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.290 
interesting way to do the character now
every<00:07:30.340> character<00:07:30.669> is<00:07:30.729> like<00:07:30.910> that<00:07:31.090> some

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
every character is like that some

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.700 
every character is like that some
characters<00:07:31.509> are<00:07:31.930> pretty<00:07:32.110> much<00:07:32.259> the<00:07:32.410> same<00:07:32.560> in

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:32.710 
characters are pretty much the same in

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:34.890 
characters are pretty much the same in
every<00:07:32.889> variation<00:07:33.190> except<00:07:34.180> for<00:07:34.330> like<00:07:34.389> one<00:07:34.660> move

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:34.900 
every variation except for like one move

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.020 
every variation except for like one move
so<00:07:35.470> like<00:07:35.740> you<00:07:35.979> know<00:07:36.070> that<00:07:36.250> changes<00:07:36.550> things<00:07:36.820> and

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
so like you know that changes things and

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.700 
so like you know that changes things and
some<00:07:37.150> characters<00:07:37.509> are<00:07:37.630> completely<00:07:38.289> different

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:38.710 
some characters are completely different

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.589 
some characters are completely different
in<00:07:38.800> every<00:07:39.009> variation<00:07:39.580> so<00:07:39.789> yeah<00:07:40.389> pretty

00:07:40.589 --> 00:07:40.599 
in every variation so yeah pretty

00:07:40.599 --> 00:07:41.640 
in every variation so yeah pretty
interesting<00:07:40.930> stuff<00:07:41.139> if<00:07:41.289> you<00:07:41.380> guys<00:07:41.410> are

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
interesting stuff if you guys are

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.200 
interesting stuff if you guys are
