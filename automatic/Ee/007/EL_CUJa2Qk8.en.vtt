the hope the paper creat will drain
through<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> glass<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.660> will

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
through the glass and the water will

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.990 
through the glass and the water will
leave<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.739> then<00:00:58.890> even<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.520> rains<00:00:59.730> and

leave and then even if it rains and
there's<00:01:00.180> puddles<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.690> won't<00:01:00.870> wake<00:01:01.050> up<00:01:01.079> into

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
there's puddles it won't wake up into

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.290 
there's puddles it won't wake up into
the<00:01:01.530> glass<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:02.910> instead<00:01:03.239> of
