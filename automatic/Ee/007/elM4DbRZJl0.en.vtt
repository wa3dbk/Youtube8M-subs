00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 there you are welcome to another top indicates 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.839
 in this your asking I want to talk about 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:09.300
 a phrase that almost everyone knows 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.889
 that phrase is giving you receive 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.179
 I think you come to realize this in our 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.849
 day by day with tests in some 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.789
 situations it has not been quoted where 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.439
 conflicts or perhaps challenges and this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.460
 week that started to look at these issues 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.140
 of days that have passed from a situation 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.630
 complicated in terms of disease in the 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.560
 family with my wife my wife 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.450
 was hospitalized and so again the 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 gold on facebook to talk about it 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.510
 To tell you that a lot of people called 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.940
 many people have made themselves available 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.370
 but there was a person who was like this 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.030
 Fundamental is a rent smoke rentals 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.570
 one of the courses I have is online and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.300
 This is a very important doctor outside. 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.879
 of sao paulo and not here in sao paulo and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
 so the follow-up that had the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 concern that he and his wife 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.449
 reached the point of view in sÃ£o paulo 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.460
 visit inside the house and avoid 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.159
 my wife accompany even 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 make available for many things 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.130
 I stopped to think it was a good situation 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.409
 Is this person doing everything 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.689
 this for me will not have other 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 people do it for me on other occasions 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.290
 not only that documenting these 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.549
 exists on other occasions that people 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.960
 need 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.409
 sometimes of a force of one 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.170
 thinking about it should only be 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.840
 having the answer should be my course was 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.340
 very good maybe I have offered 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:42.299
 many things and he's feeling there is there 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.060
 perhaps in that of which they give him some 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:48.329
 response risk that gives me a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.610
 contribution of this, in the end, 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.590
 little committed to it and I think 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.810
 what are people talk so much about 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.180
 reciprocity with capital targets and without 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.520
 doubt is this proximity to the penalty seen 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.540
 so the very strong mental trigger 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.460
 now I think we have to know 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 use this environmental talking cat 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.640
 This is why you use this from a 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.649
 forged form right 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.250
 I started working out what I do so that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.460
 people do things for me 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.950
 took 80% of my friends to respond 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.950
 I usually respond from people who enter 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.320
 there are registered want some one want 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.110
 take a doubt some information 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.280
 I answer the comments that are in the 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.310
 Facebook 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.470
 in my blog I usually pay close attention 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.540
 The people my students are are 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.430
 between the two closed groups 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.890
 so if a person very present in the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.450
 people and most of the time my 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.150
 well most of the time without charging anything 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.190
 so because I like to share 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.050
 information with people I like 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.540
 offer new information I like 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.170
 then automatically teach 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.380
 reciprocity and here is the top tip of today 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.090
 work your reciprocity will analyze 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.920
 what form it is contributing to the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.970
 The people you're contributing the most are 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.670
 more receiving 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.340
 if you are not self-employed 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.720
 you with a businessman or you with 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.350
 the professional is inside a large 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.239
 company 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.739
 what contribution have they made? 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.330
 contributions 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.420
 you're offering something for the 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.330
 people beyond normal nor what you already 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.360
 comes offering does not think about dispensing 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.890
 What is your contribution level? 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.780
 while of reciprocity 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.299
 You take time with this without thinking. 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.720
 on reciprocity with a death album 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.000
 strategic structured metal is not something 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.600
 that is natural and if this is not 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.790
 approved for you work support - 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.370
 put this as a challenge for you and 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.110
 something that would come there is a trigger
