00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:03.689
 penetron is high effective 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.000
 concrete protection technology is very 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.379
 simple technology but strict adherence 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:10.010
 all stages of application 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.230
 materials is very important we will tell 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.309
 how to use 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.660
 materials system penetron start with 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.390
 most famous and most 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.160
 used yes all names to the whole system 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.160
 materials start with material penetron 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.230

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.550
 penetron 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.220
 it's a dry mix 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.500
 it consists of special cement 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.330
 filler and fillers 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.730

 patented active chemical 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.650
 additives 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.460
 penetron used for waterproofing 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 surface and monolithic and prefabricated 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.070
 concrete structures first and second 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.320
 groups crack resistance with 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.750
 cracking of three tenths 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.910
 millimeter 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.950
 mourning 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.660

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.990
 petroleum products and other outsiders 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.040
 substances 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.260
 absolutely smooth polished 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.480
 Surface water under 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.060
 high pressure or other possible 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.970
 mechanically for example 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.880
 brushed metal 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.330
 tell me how to carry penetron 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.120
 better moisturize the surface 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.120
 impregnate concrete to maximum depth 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.190
 mourning 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.610
 cooking work and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.520
 apply with rubber gloves 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.010
 prepare a liquid water solution 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.700
 penetron one kilogram of dry mix 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.760
 400 grams of 3 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.090
 add water to the dry mix not 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.890
 vice versa 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.210
 mix thoroughly 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.110
 re-adding water and not allowed 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.740
 prepare this amount of solution 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.550
 which can be spent on 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.890
 for 30 minutes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.290
 while working the solution is regular 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.190
 stir 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.230
 mourning 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.859
 apply penetron and brush out 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:13.639
 synthetic fiber and using 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:15.660
 equipment for on going on 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.570
 penetron should be applied in two layers 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.999
 consumption depends on the surface relief 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:22.999
 average consumption of dry mix for one 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.199
 square meter when applied in two layers 

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:27.519
 from eight hundred grams to one kilogram 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:28.959
 two hundred grams 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.239
 apply the second layer on fresh but already 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.010
 grappling first layer usually through 1 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.879
 2 hours 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.119
 but no later than six hours 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:38.689
 before applying the second layer 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.709
 the surface is thoroughly cloudy 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.409
 if the break between applying the first and 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.089
 the second layer is over 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:47.039
 six hours should be processed 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.769
 surface before applying the second 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.759
 brushed metal 

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:54.789
 but she 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.649
 a colorful and finishing compositions 

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:02.409
 recommended to be applied after 20 ones 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.579
 day after processing the structure 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:05.489
 penetron 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.469
 before applying these materials 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.109
 surface and treated 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:10.749
 the penetron will follow to clear 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:12.090
 mechanically for 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.939
 grip enhancement
