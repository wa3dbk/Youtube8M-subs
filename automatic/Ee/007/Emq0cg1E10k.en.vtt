my cruise method for making triangles

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.210 
my cruise method for making triangles
I've<00:01:17.270> covered<00:01:17.600> a<00:01:17.900> baking<00:01:18.320> sheet<00:01:18.590> with<00:01:18.620> saran

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
I've covered a baking sheet with saran

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.090 
I've covered a baking sheet with saran
wrap<00:01:19.780> because<00:01:20.780> it's<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.320> way<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.530> keep<00:01:21.680> your

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
wrap because it's that way to keep your

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.180 
wrap because it's that way to keep your
work<00:01:22.430> based<00:01:22.790> particle<00:01:23.510> in<00:01:23.630> depth<00:01:23.870> free<00:01:24.290> and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
work based particle in depth free and

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.530 
work based particle in depth free and
I've<00:01:25.670> rolled<00:01:26.030> my<00:01:26.360> polymer<00:01:26.810> clay<00:01:27.070> into<00:01:28.070> a<00:01:28.100> ball

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
I've rolled my polymer clay into a ball

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.410 
I've rolled my polymer clay into a ball
I'm<00:01:29.540> using<00:01:29.990> this<00:01:30.310> plastic<00:01:31.310> ruler<00:01:31.670> to<00:01:32.090> apply

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
I'm using this plastic ruler to apply

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.330 
I'm using this plastic ruler to apply
some<00:01:32.690> pressure<00:01:32.930> on<00:01:33.260> it<00:01:33.410> maybe<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:34.040> could<00:01:34.160> use

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
some pressure on it maybe you could use

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:47.820 
some pressure on it maybe you could use
the<00:01:34.460> CD<00:01:34.730> Joe<00:01:34.940> get<00:01:35.120> these<00:01:35.810> back<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.740> guys

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:02:15.190 

your<00:01:48.830> triangles<00:02:13.120> so<00:02:14.120> silly<00:02:14.480> but<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:15.170> really

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
your triangles so silly but it really

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.700 
your triangles so silly but it really
makes<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.340> differential<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:18.080> doesn't<00:02:18.440> fly

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
makes the differential it doesn't fly

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.310 
makes the differential it doesn't fly
nor<00:02:19.010> squish<00:02:19.340> your<00:02:19.520> clay<00:02:19.870> then<00:02:20.870> I'm<00:02:21.110> just

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
nor squish your clay then I'm just

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.820 
nor squish your clay then I'm just
finishing<00:02:21.650> this<00:02:22.190> triangle<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:24.850> using<00:02:25.850> needle

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
finishing this triangle and using needle

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.270 
finishing this triangle and using needle
to<00:02:28.060> make<00:02:29.060> my<00:02:29.300> hole<00:02:29.740> coming<00:02:30.740> up<00:02:30.920> through<00:02:31.190> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
to make my hole coming up through the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.320 
to make my hole coming up through the
tip<00:02:31.550> there<00:02:39.130> if<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.430> choose<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.820> glazier

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
tip there if you choose to glazier

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.530 
tip there if you choose to glazier
triangles<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.320> came<00:02:42.680> up<00:02:42.830> with<00:02:42.860> a<00:02:43.340> homemade<00:02:44.270> way

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
triangles I came up with a homemade way

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.620 
triangles I came up with a homemade way
to<00:02:44.600> do<00:02:44.810> that<00:02:45.020> yes<00:02:45.950> the<00:02:46.430> toilet<00:02:46.790> paper<00:02:46.940> roll<00:02:47.090> I

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
to do that yes the toilet paper roll I

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.479 
to do that yes the toilet paper roll I
just<00:02:48.170> nicked<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.770> and<00:02:49.660> retina<00:02:50.660> triangles<00:02:51.489> on

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
just nicked it and retina triangles on

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.760 
just nicked it and retina triangles on
the<00:02:52.970> iron.i<00:02:53.540> pin<00:02:54.350> and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the iron.i pin and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the iron.i pin and
then<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:57.120> can<00:02:57.390> play<00:02:57.990> them<00:02:58.230> as<00:02:58.830> many<00:02:59.190> times<00:02:59.280> as

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
then you can play them as many times as

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:00.290 
then you can play them as many times as
you<00:02:59.940> want

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
you want

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.120 
you want
I<00:03:00.360> like<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.780> coffee<00:03:01.110> glaze<00:03:01.530> there's<00:03:01.950> many

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
I like this coffee glaze there's many

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.760 
I like this coffee glaze there's many
coats<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:03.090> let<00:03:04.050> them<00:03:04.200> dry<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:06.770> these

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
coats and let them dry like this these

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.390

are all ready please direct you and I

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.340 
are all ready please direct you and I
have<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:11.760> most<00:03:11.910> strung<00:03:12.300> up<00:03:12.480> I'm<00:03:13.110> going<00:03:13.290> to

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
have the most strung up I'm going to

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.630 
have the most strung up I'm going to
show<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.500> how<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:13.770> add<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.130> chain<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.550> your

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
show you how to add the chain to your

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.050 
show you how to add the chain to your
eye<00:03:14.670> pin<00:03:15.030> I've<00:03:15.960> cut<00:03:16.290> three<00:03:17.040> tiny<00:03:17.490> pieces<00:03:17.940> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
eye pin I've cut three tiny pieces of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.300 
eye pin I've cut three tiny pieces of
chain<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.750> didn't<00:03:19.440> worry<00:03:19.650> too<00:03:20.130> much<00:03:20.160> about

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
chain I didn't worry too much about

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.310 
chain I didn't worry too much about
getting<00:03:20.790> them<00:03:20.910> all<00:03:21.030> exactly<00:03:21.210> even<00:03:21.900> cuz<00:03:22.140> it's

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
getting them all exactly even cuz it's

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.730 
getting them all exactly even cuz it's
easier<00:03:22.770> to<00:03:22.950> tell<00:03:23.690> once<00:03:24.690> they're<00:03:24.930> hanging<00:03:25.410> and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
easier to tell once they're hanging and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.040 
easier to tell once they're hanging and
I<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.460> opened<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.420> bottom<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.020> eye

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
I just opened up the bottom of the eye

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.590 
I just opened up the bottom of the eye
pin<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.770> my<00:03:28.950> needle<00:03:29.220> nose<00:03:29.370> pliers<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.540> then

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
pin is my needle nose pliers and then

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:37.760 
pin is my needle nose pliers and then
I'm<00:03:31.020> gonna<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:35.340> then<00:03:35.550> I'm<00:03:36.030> singing<00:03:36.900> go

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
I'm gonna and then I'm singing go

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.750 
I'm gonna and then I'm singing go
through<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.730> trim<00:03:39.120> up<00:03:40.190> so<00:03:41.190> they're<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.730> same

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
through and trim up so they're the same
