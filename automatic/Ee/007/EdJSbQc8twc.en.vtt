00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:52.650
 It is the same explanation as before, but there is a microbe called Euglena 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.650
 It is the official name of the black city of the hot dusk though 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.220
 It seems that there is one person of the sun 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:08.890

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.340

 That's right though 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.650

 This is the time 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 This is a child who would like to eat an old burdock in a bowl of green seaweed rice 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 That green curry or green 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.690
