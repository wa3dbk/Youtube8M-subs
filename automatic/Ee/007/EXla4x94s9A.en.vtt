00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 if you had the eye of a bee 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.100
 You would not be seeing this flower of the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.020
 Way you 're seeing now. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.389
 and this is the way some insects 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.260
 see the flowers I'm going to show 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.260
 gold experience 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.789
 of course I will need several 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.100
 flowers for this experiment then the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.480
 first thing is going to be out on the street and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:36.690
 find some flowers out there 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:39.239
 bora there now have all these 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.879
 flowers the next step is quite simple go 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
 need only a little cotton and 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.379
 ammonia you find in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 any pharmacy only takes care that the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 smell of this business is very strong and he 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.559
 may irritate the eyes 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.170
 so I 'll look at cotton as the only 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.809
 placed between the pots and play 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 flowers inside and now just let the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.640
 steam ammonia that the ammonia react 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.840
 Where did the pot come from? 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 little to see what happened 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.160
 a red flower that has seen what 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.350
 happened now will open sports and 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:28.630
 take a look at the picture before in favor 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.630
 contact with ammonia and then 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.700
 You saw that the flowers changed color. 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.690
 that some parts get darker 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.060
 whereas the other 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.310
 those parts which reacted with ammonia and 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.610
 become darker indicate that here 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.820
 there is something called grandfather 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.250
 noide for those who serve this one of a 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.679
 flavonoid flavonoids serve to 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.739
 several things but some of them like 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.560
 anthocyanins are used to color the 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.860
 flowers and that showy color of flowers 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.170
 helps to catch the attention of insects 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.959
 so for example that insects know 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.180
 where is the nectar of the flower those 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.970
 stupid that bees use to make 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.620
 in her but because the flowers well call 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.750
 the attention of insects because they 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.670
 giving the gift nectar to the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.690
 insects 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.620
 I'll take a look at the book by 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.900
 many flowers need biology 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.620
 insects to reproduce 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.670
 rather the plants reproduce with the help 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.340
 of insects 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.420
 they spread pollen to other flowers and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:55.310
 this allows the fertilization of the flowers 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.340
 The legal thing is that because of these 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.769
 flavonoids bees nor the colors of the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:04.580
 a little different way because the eye 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.650
 of them can see things of our union 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.050
 so if I get some flowers and 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.630
 put on the black light I'll see some 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:29.750
 pigments that I can not see 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:32.180
 a look liked on that is why 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.280
 you were a bee probably going to 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 die of the urge to take a break 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.170
 this flower here more experiments of 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.240
 chemical physics and biology 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.790
 you find out if you have noticed 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.600
 the effect of amorim every flower is very 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.280
 different 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.110
 so if you're going to do it at home 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.540
 especially if you are going to make a 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.700
 science fair it is very important that 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.220
 You picked some flowers. 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.250
 tests and then you see where 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.620
 it worked better because on yellow flower 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.630
 for example the effect was very small and 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.370
 on the red flower these two flowers are 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.980
 very close and knows that they are a 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.110
 very close relative of the red flower 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.300
 effect was completely different 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.970
 so it's worth it if you give a day search 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.549
 in the flowers of the neighborhood to see which 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.130
 the effect on each flower and ammonia is 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.880
 very cheap here in the pharmacy with 53 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.980
 real 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
 so it's a very easy experience to do 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.850
 at home has another way of changing color 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.370
 of the flower that is very fun using 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.380
 dye I've done a lot of time in the 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.300
 world I'm going to leave the link to this video 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.480
 how to change the color of a flower use 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.880
 of this organ and if you like gardens and 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.620
 things that I leave behind. 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.760
 link of how to make a garden 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.760
 inside a lamp
