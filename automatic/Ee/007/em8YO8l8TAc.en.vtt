 it already knows itself 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:41.949
 that more and more 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:45.769
 the airplanes and they will have greater fair not mine of flight 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.109
 in all concepts 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.279
 for certain routes to them, everything must be

 a line of communication

 that is known with time it will be like that we hope

 that elapses in less time 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.639
 also from what is known until now 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:24.669
 is that the a330 bush was still flying at an altitude of 11 thousand meters 11 kilometers

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.689
 d seven days and the 48 kilometers 

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.709
 and what the first warning
