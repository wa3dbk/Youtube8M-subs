00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
well it's pretty simple basically I've

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.590

if<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.930> put<00:00:24.960> almost<00:00:25.949> ninety<00:00:26.760> percent<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.180> the

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
if you put almost ninety percent of the

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.019 
if you put almost ninety percent of the
legends<00:00:27.779> against<00:00:28.740> today's<00:00:29.369> current<00:00:29.880> NBA

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
legends against today's current NBA

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.030 
legends against today's current NBA
teams<00:00:31.309> process<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.759> minute<00:00:34.040> so

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
teams process that for a minute so

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.520 
teams process that for a minute so
that's<00:00:35.190> exactly<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.880> did<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.360> got<00:00:37.320> together

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.030 
that's exactly what I did I got together
and<00:00:38.010> created<00:00:38.629> almost<00:00:39.629> every<00:00:40.230> single<00:00:40.440> legend

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and created almost every single legend

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.280 
and created almost every single legend
you<00:00:41.309> can<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.910> players<00:00:42.360> from<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.600> 60s

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.080 
you can think of players from the 60s
50s<00:00:43.670> 70s<00:00:44.670> 80s<00:00:45.210> 90s<00:00:46.280> even<00:00:47.280> pass<00:00:47.489> legends<00:00:47.969> like

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
50s 70s 80s 90s even pass legends like

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.650 
50s 70s 80s 90s even pass legends like
prime<00:00:48.300> example<00:00:48.780> Allen<00:00:49.050> Iverson<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.539> we<00:00:51.539> are

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660
