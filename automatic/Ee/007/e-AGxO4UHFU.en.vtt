00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.360
 plan on 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.960
 on the main device site 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.960
 this portal 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 car red power 1204 installation 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.470
 was put on the car volkswagen jetta 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.630
 13 years 2013, the installation was carried out 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.540
 installer alexander installation center 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.480
 spb tuning contact phone 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:39.670
 plus 7 906 2535 377 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.920
 alexander tell me what the nuances even 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.670
 us car was the easiest 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:50.559
 picking here is such a tape recorder and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:53.920
 I think it's called RNS 110 or 210 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.489
 don't exactly remember not so important on her 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 there was the usual 1 line display 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.719
 That is the advantage of this recorder 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.570
 that after installation it is automatic 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.730
 picked up climate control ie 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.950
 very comfortable that is, on a regular climate 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.260
 it was not annoying that nothing was then 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.030
 is there only for the sake of but nothing else 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.040
 not even displayed on the shield was not 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.560
 nothing here in this case 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.920
 there is a climate even occurs in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 movies this family warmed nothing 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.260
 bundling simple buttons on the steering wheel I 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.650
 also not but that is a big 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.890
 advantage means further with us 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.930
 wires are all brought out through this 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.600
 Now there's a hole there about dachas 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.640
 stub breaks in and out 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.330
 two tails in this case two tails 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 touch 3g and beat it us chamfer plays 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:47.680
 the sound of the car was just say 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.870
 so two speakers you just before 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.140
 default factory that is squeaking glasses and 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.660
 in the door we set up with a broach 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.390
 wiring the rear speakers alpine through 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.960
 spacers made a full 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.920
 normal sound 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.450
 cops take this food is for glasses doors 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.430
 let's say manned for this 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.170
 more or less normal equipment 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.209
 to the sound 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.250
 microphone for speakerphone is like 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.410
 you put up here and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.480
 to dim the rearview mirror so 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.290
 what we have here is still the main but magnitolka 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.650
 of course 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 works without a key, that is, as soon as 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.770
 we will remove the key it will turn off by the sound 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.590
 the sound is immediately interesting that we have here 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.350
 the basses are all overpriced as you can see the bass or 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.790
 the court 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:45.130
 well, the camera does not transmit it 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:48.140
 of course worth license Navitel 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.890
 already fully activated already 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:55.690
 checked it on the street now just 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.690
 let's show how it looks 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.220
 now his clients are parsed 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.880
 the opportunity to purchase Navitel 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.770
 give all russia and ukraine map 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.930
 we now have three files delivered 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.170
 only with license or sitigid 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.880
 either navitel broken software nothing to 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.900
 Unfortunately, no, well, it looks like a sitigid 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.470
 Standard Navitel is pretty launch 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.660
 Main menu 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.340
 there is no time yet 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.920
 although she in my own already got 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.800
 they will call this number even nothing 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:39.100
 I didnâ€™t have to build a radio 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:43.620
 here only comes from single wire then 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.390
 There is only FNB for them angles 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.710
 reception so-so mediocre itself not a crab 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.710
 from the wagon develops and better 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.769
 there are no buttons on the steering wheel here unfortunately 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.230
 since the machines are simple let's say everything 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.520
 the main 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.980
 but 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:11.260
 it works the same disk drive client 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.260
 in some mp3 now check 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.310
 123 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.690
 but always displays the name that is 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.910
 it's just sit and 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.870
 that is, standard or sitting on 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:40.510
 which mp3 files are recorded so well 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.510
 still this letter. we have this joystick and 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.689
 then I found it to click on 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.939
 restore 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.819
 so evgeny by you is what else 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:55.399
 add to the main feature here 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:58.129
 It was in the publication that enough 

00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:03.649
 simple with radio with 1 lowercase 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:06.019
 display and pockets climate information 

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:07.549
 It was displayed here on this. 

00:05:06.019 --> 00:05:10.039
 now it was not found, but simply 

00:05:07.549 --> 00:05:13.089
 displayed now displays all 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:15.439
 duplicated and on 

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:18.110
 just for yes she is right here 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:21.139
 showed and left and right now here 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.209
 it's all completely duplicated well 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:26.149
 Of course if you put there to seize 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:28.579
 This is auto mode in auto mode put 

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:29.959
 that is, keep in mind that when you will 

00:05:28.579 --> 00:05:32.269
 go to the radio ki 

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:34.489
 with magnitolka excluded i 'm gonna be there 

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:36.259
 sake or something else that trade navigation if 

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:38.269
 there will be some changes in climate then 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:40.369
 there he himself wants to auto-mode 

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:42.259
 put up there either hot you 

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:44.149
 buried him some kind of flap open 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:47.589
 open all this is absolute automatic 

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:50.239
 will be displayed on the radio 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:53.119
 so you know what's going on and what 

00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:54.949
 changed to the staff of this course 

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:57.039
 no mapping exactly in moments 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.110
 auto mode 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:01.909
 Well, probably we will finish everything with you 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.999
 there was a company of melts thanks to 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:03.999
 dating
