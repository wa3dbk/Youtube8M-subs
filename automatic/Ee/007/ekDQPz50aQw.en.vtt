00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.540
 Hello and welcome to this 2 today I want to explain to you 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.089
 that is a jailbreak 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.129
 and what brings up probably all other questions about Tibet 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:13.039
 could powerfully fight Liu Xiang 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.550
 In the first round in general question what is a prayer at all 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.859
 Angelina Whalley 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:23.269
 is a rear spoiler Albert splitting off or iPad 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.289
 Every foliage is not supposed to do things 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.029
 IBM dominated normally could not do as you can 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 Lehmann is yours, that's certain events or something else 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.700
 looks 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.820
 you can send and receive a bluetooth w-lan 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.620
 we can make huge folders and Poland can do a lot more 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.820
 This is incredible what you can do with a jailbreak 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.250
 fits brilliantly 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.380
 and now the question is how does it work? 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.600
 always works differently and that depends 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.600
 what a few more than convincing the system version 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.880
 a lot is installed at the moment is banks 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.470
 but mostly works on the internet 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.520
 same way and secondly a program to GP LP Inc 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.899
 We need to know what a nice and on 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.840
 Crete connect new iPod or iPhone iPad 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.710
 Munich 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.160
 what to do and watches 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.090
 and then it works on the whole in which there are an incredible number 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.420
 Pauli witnesses every single citizen version 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.280
 This site is always located on YouTube search always 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.660
 or most of them 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.610
 2 also can be now 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.660
 her existence was actually there are no thoughts yet 4 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.130
 and what supposedly makes bathing drowned bit in your iPod or iPhone 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.130
 Reichelt 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.420
 Munich dpa activated the phone and did not have in the whole team 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.040
 technical guidelines 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.850
 In any case, at the end of the day, this is more fitting for the new r Cup 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 and most of the time we are 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.470
 At ten years this is, so to speak, Jailbreak App Store and now please 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.569
 Do not misunderstand the Taliban to it as ten years is not 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:04.619
 1 goal off 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 where there is free App Store Hommel 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.349
 until Sunday can increase further 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.799
 Mad one has the opportunity with a jailbreak 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.489
 it is also free to steal even pirate pages also Sheehan lying down 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.660
 you would like to 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.260
 Abu Sayyaf is not 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.660
 this free app store but Angelbeck, so to speak 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.230
 this year 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.700
 you can choose different programs and it is his 2 0 documents the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.360
 then just stuff like files could be potent Boulogne and UC Rusal 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.369
 make it possible there 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.059
 Furthermore, yes, in the tenth year Schwerin Munich continues 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:44.869
 If any developer develops something for Jay concerns Angell 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.430
 and he would like to offer his own sources are in the break post 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.309
 you can enter the annoying one 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.249
 And his exports and downloads mean endless possibilities 

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.859
 So it fits almost infinite possibilities with Cindy years as 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:02.859
 Gabriel Altdorf 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.480
 and now it was like that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.869
 the biggest 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:07.860
 the question 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.630
 "Asked for tea at all Estelle worlds lives suffered or maybe even 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.099
 cheaper 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.569
 this view is her pelvic exercise meanwhile it has always been 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:17.839
 harmless 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:20.780
 but not the Cell World Wolfgang Franz 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.100
 is not completely harmless what is dangerous that is what with 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.309
 some projects can happen 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.579
 because no money way works 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.379
 there was a threat of what to do, how is the building? 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:34.339
 security 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.629
 Questions that are activated 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.250
 And of course not only the programs from Chile can do that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.810
 but we can also Wieland and is champion and everything possible 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.880
 Besides, there are so many non-professional developed past ten 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.799
 years 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.590
 that's pretty much all right now 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.410
 also given the crash test 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.889
 but after leaving you can not be afraid 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.489
 most of them in 99 percent more old and 1 percent 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.149
 You can set fire to the problems of your room 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:09.350
 in the district of Judenburg make contact with old accessories game 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.799
 this means 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.569
 permanent damage we are unable to use this anymore 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.309
 so far very unlikely 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.309
 and now are good days the wind is illegal 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:23.979
 totally not included at all 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.150
 really does not matter 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.409
 because there will be no fear without 1 and not easy 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.180
 face on arrival 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.499
 what she does of course after the jailbreak she does for example as a pirate 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.210
 Seers and clown and waterproof 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.180
 that's obviously another thing OpenGL started is not cheaper 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.389
 so Marcell arouse my guarantees and happy 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:50.440
 that's also a question many people ask and it's true 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.300
 actually Henrik Teske goes 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.020
 has 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.699
 no more guarantee 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.029
 but that is not so bad 

00:04:58.029 --> 00:05:03.299
 You should somehow why iPod is you it is a warranty case hindrances 

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:04.469
 has a problem 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:07.099
 you all have but is it the possibility 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.830
 repeatedly is restore 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.789
 Another important topic is several times the internal test of the world 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.039
 di Michele way Euro 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.689
 trackless 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.430
 "I can not deny anything, and soon 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.979
 to remove at all neumarkt-st would not be enough because in the farthest 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.180
 Corners and Speicherssdorf Federal Courts exist so z can participate 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:34.629
 and when then several times Bayer restored a people before applied to them 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:35.590
 sought 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.650
 your money will get away almost without a trace and that's where I am 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:40.800
 do not do it 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.789
 is restored if you ask of course if the girls 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.240
 downhill through Bärtschi I do not answer because he is on all the time 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.080
 Pröll must also say no that fits then already 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.999
 that's clearly morally of course asking why it works 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.509
 Euro 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.099
 the Wars if you have any further questions about Jan Becker 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:03.780
 easy and beside comments ads 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.730
 "I would have taken a lot of time so long there is nothing too many questions 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.420
 Everything obedient to answer the executive floors of this writing is Obama's speech 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.710
 and of course that's those million charming eyes 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.939
 Shame belong 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:18.859
 See you next time
