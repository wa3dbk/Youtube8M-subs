00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.929
 Offset hook on silicone and what is it 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.260

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.130
 especially peter 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 he goes specifically for the offset hook 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 here on the back is a groove and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.309
 abdomen more written off ice return 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.360
 the hook often wore the forbidden hook 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.950
 he is not so hooked on algae 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.450
 for everything else he may be on 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:56.390
 They begin Identifying done 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:01:00.630
 bottom and top as always crocheted halls 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:07.010
 on top because all upper through lip 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 stronger and paste through the head down 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 literally half a centimeter pasted ate 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:24.990
 and deployed 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.320
 it turns out like this and then we look at 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.320
 the length 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 did must walk 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.580
 we get right actually in front 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:39.350
 tail we take this sting and insert 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.050
 there 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 at home prompted 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.010
 there is obtained like this even in those 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.330
 it turns out the bracket 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:00.250
 the sting is hidden when the fish bite 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:04.540
 we're gonna be all gone 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:11.870
 lay punches and google 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.940
 then back again and correct for 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.650
 offset hook go special and here 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.400

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:26.000
 we put on weight on a rolling pin, I have here 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.900
 the difference as I hope because you can 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.180
 Do not wear correctly and the fish will 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.420
 swim belly color and we do not 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.420
