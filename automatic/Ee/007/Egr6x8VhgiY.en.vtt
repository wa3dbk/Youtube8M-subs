00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
minute like I mentioned in a previous

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.900 
minute like I mentioned in a previous
part<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.309> i<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:39.269> know<00:00:39.360> i<00:00:39.570> wish<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:40.910> had

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
part but i don't know i wish i had

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.939 
part but i don't know i wish i had
longer<00:00:42.300> that's<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:43.050> i<00:00:43.110> have<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> really<00:00:43.769> say

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
longer that's all i have to really say

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:46.189 
longer that's all i have to really say
about<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.760> found<00:00:45.540> sound<00:00:45.809> like<00:00:45.900> Forrest

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
about that but found sound like Forrest

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.840 
about that but found sound like Forrest
Gump<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.589> uh<00:00:47.089> so<00:00:48.089> this<00:00:48.420> is<00:00:48.449> a<00:00:49.610> pretty<00:00:50.610> good

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
Gump but uh so this is a pretty good

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.979 
Gump but uh so this is a pretty good
round<00:00:51.030> like<00:00:51.180> i<00:00:51.239> mentioned<00:00:51.360> i<00:00:51.600> think<00:00:51.780> i<00:00:51.839> have<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
round like i mentioned i think i have a

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.680 
round like i mentioned i think i have a
couple<00:00:52.350> chopper<00:00:52.680> gunners<00:00:53.010> lined<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:54.239> probably

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
couple chopper gunners lined up probably

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.719 
couple chopper gunners lined up probably
wasn't<00:00:55.080> the<00:00:55.110> smartest<00:00:55.170> thing<00:00:55.650> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.890> when<00:00:56.580> i'm

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
wasn't the smartest thing to do when i'm

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.759 
wasn't the smartest thing to do when i'm
thinking<00:00:57.089> about<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:58.350> because<00:00:58.710> i'm

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
thinking about it now but because i'm

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.140 
thinking about it now but because i'm
about<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.010> get<00:00:59.129> another<00:00:59.309> chopper<00:00:59.729> gunner<00:00:59.909> i

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
about to get another chopper gunner i

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.229 
about to get another chopper gunner i
just<00:01:00.839> got<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.070> i<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.940> know<00:01:03.030> i

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
just got one there so i don't know i

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.130 
just got one there so i don't know i
think<00:01:04.170> probably<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.460> could<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.150> gotten<00:01:06.869> more

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
think probably I could have gotten more

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.020 
think probably I could have gotten more
kills<00:01:07.409> if<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.710> had<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> uh<00:01:08.780> uh<00:01:09.780> like<00:01:10.740> uh<00:01:10.770> maybe<00:01:11.640> not

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
kills if I had a uh uh like uh maybe not

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.490 
kills if I had a uh uh like uh maybe not
rolling<00:01:12.540> thunder<00:01:12.689> i<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.140> think<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.320> got

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
rolling thunder i don't think that got

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
rolling thunder i don't think that got
me<00:01:13.619> many<00:01:14.070> kills<00:01:14.340> I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.850> him<00:01:14.970> might

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
me many kills I think about him might

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.780 
me many kills I think about him might
have<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.780> me<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.960> multi<00:01:16.830> kill<00:01:17.010> once<00:01:17.220> not<00:01:17.549> sure<00:01:17.760> I

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
have got me a multi kill once not sure I

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.000 
have got me a multi kill once not sure I
can't<00:01:18.090> remember<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> game<00:01:18.689> was<00:01:19.260> really<00:01:19.830> long

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:20.010 
can't remember this game was really long

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.780 
can't remember this game was really long
time<00:01:20.220> ago<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:22.049> uh<00:01:22.790> i'm

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.109 
time ago that I got this but uh i'm
pretty<00:01:24.210> sure<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:25.229> didn't<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.829> a<00:01:26.119> full

pretty sure that we didn't have a full

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.700 
pretty sure that we didn't have a full
part<00:01:27.299> i<00:01:27.390> think<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.689> might<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.990> but<00:01:28.259> i'm<00:01:28.500> not

the<00:01:43.259> point<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> staying<00:01:43.770> i<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.159> get<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.460> like

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the point of staying i don't get it like

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.849 
the point of staying i don't get it like
I<00:01:45.210> guess<00:01:45.749> it's<00:01:45.929> kind<00:01:46.109> of<00:01:46.170> good<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.380> he<00:01:46.590> stayed

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
I guess it's kind of good that he stayed

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.319 
I guess it's kind of good that he stayed
because<00:01:47.070> i'm<00:01:47.249> pretty<00:01:47.340> sure<00:01:47.520> easier<00:01:47.820> here<00:01:48.179> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
because i'm pretty sure easier here the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.289 
because i'm pretty sure easier here the
whole<00:01:48.479> game<00:01:48.719> not<00:01:49.020> sure<00:01:49.189> but<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.819> he<00:01:50.969> wasn't

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
whole game not sure but if he wasn't

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.779 
whole game not sure but if he wasn't
here<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.569> whole<00:01:51.689> game<00:01:51.960> then<00:01:52.679> that<00:01:53.429> was<00:01:53.549> really

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
here the whole game then that was really

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.309 
here the whole game then that was really

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
was Henry though ties so his name was

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.430

bad<00:05:53.700> nose<00:05:53.910> PSN<00:05:54.750> name<00:05:54.930> was<00:05:55.490> so<00:05:56.490> as<00:05:56.820> I<00:05:57.510> get<00:05:58.020> pretty

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440

right<00:06:00.330> here<00:06:00.540> but<00:06:00.870> I<00:06:01.050> think<00:06:01.410> that<00:06:01.470> out<00:06:01.800> if<00:06:02.700> you

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
right here but I think that out if you

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.850 
right here but I think that out if you
or<00:06:03.660> sensitivities<00:06:04.290> how<00:06:04.410> you<00:06:04.470> should<00:06:04.740> be<00:06:04.800> able

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
or sensitivities how you should be able

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.740 
or sensitivities how you should be able
to<00:06:04.980> move<00:06:05.100> the<00:06:05.160> chopper<00:06:05.550> gunner<00:06:05.700> fast<00:06:05.970> move<00:06:06.570> so

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
to move the chopper gunner fast move so

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.690 
to move the chopper gunner fast move so
slow<00:06:07.080> like<00:06:07.320> I<00:06:07.440> can<00:06:07.590> get<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.950> but<00:06:08.160> it's<00:06:08.490> a<00:06:08.520> game

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
slow like I can get that but it's a game

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.880 
slow like I can get that but it's a game
so<00:06:08.970> it's<00:06:09.510> a<00:06:09.600> condo<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.110> Rolling<00:06:10.380> Thunder<00:06:10.410> and

kills I think on our team and they get

00:07:06.699 --> 00:07:08.700 
kills I think on our team and they get
probably<00:07:07.000> about<00:07:07.060> maybe<00:07:07.509> 300<00:07:08.199> deaths<00:07:08.349> I<00:07:08.560> don't

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:08.710
