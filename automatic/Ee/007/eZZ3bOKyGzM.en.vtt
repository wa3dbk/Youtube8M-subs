00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 bother his writing number 2 for the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.680
 roasted indoors without saying no 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.660
 you did is that you did not learn the grill 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.400
 because you do not have because you could not because 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.400
 I saw these impressive 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.160
 this is a probable strip are to do 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.529
 questions 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.650
 Today there are fashionable iron there are 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.169
 good pottery I do this there are 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.730
 individual as is or in the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.960
 three big in the same way you can 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.000
 make an individual complaint look 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.680
 that cut it out like that, that's clear 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.989
 would be for the individual service a 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.269
 whole provoleta agrees with what 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.210
 that says well here I'm going to do it 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:59.370
 so we cut 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.620
 cubes and look at how long it takes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.070
 you think he's going to cook these four 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.530
 minutes in your oven we will place the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 cheese 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.390
 So that for provoletas and here 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.340
 is where you can basically put 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.280
 different products that you like 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.590
 I was to enjoy some good 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.590
 provoletas we can do well 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.720
 this is this is a solution this is a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.520
 easy solution so that the 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.770
 provoleta you get it right because any 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.240
 we long for going to the grill 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 neighborhood couple 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 they approach wherever we bring a 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.220
 progressive and bring it crispy up 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 but not totally melted down on the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.360
 ball grill sat at home and the one that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.729
 you put it on the grill and they're 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.280
 dealing with the brand there if everything goes to 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.679
 down did not get to worship good there 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.750
 It depends on the cheese a lot of quality 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.420
 of the cheese and something to help is to pass the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.399
 provoleta previously by flour the 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.000
 Lambeau puts it in a bowl with flour 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.280
 provoleta just wet flour you will 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.350
 Stick to the flour and go to the grill 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.750
 then the flour that it makes prevents 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.450
 fall makes a layer on the outside and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.220
 allows that layer to hold on 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.650
 strength of the melted cheese you want 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.900
 that is not then as soon as the 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.569
 you turn around and there in the second round 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.640
 quickly pum pum pum do not turn it around 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.650
 in the jump you take the golden part was 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.860
 the first one is up, you take it out 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.349
 and you take it and the game has to 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.750
 be a fire that you put your hand 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.069
 up and hold up to 8 before 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.870
 Mars 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.609
 there I started to burn the irradiation 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.530
 of the fire this is how a grill is 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.180
 the same me with these in the pardilla 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.609
 waters and I do not even put them in the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.980
 grill look how the provoletas them 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.930
 like 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.930
 and ground oregano for example 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.340
 jerry 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:10.129
 put each one more or less what more 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.629
 He liked me 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:13.629
 another option are slices of 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.350
 good is that there is variety then here 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.580
 for all tastes a little here 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.459
 no no no no 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.240
 go for a little bit of ground chili 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.240
 oregano to this one 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.690
 Well, the secret is good, look at the 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.520
 secret is well I have the fire can be 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.760
 the burner with open fire closed 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.440
 this but three-quarters of its power 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.330
 this is the same for everyone if you have the 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.300
 flames and high three quarters of the flames 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.010
 If it's electric, you have ten points. 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.680
 then put seven and so 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.360
 successively he grabbed the provoleta and the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 placed here 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:04.970
 I want you to see this, let's do 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:09.230
 one thing are the ones that we go to the case of 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.010
 that did not touch it the good thing is we do not touch it 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.500
 and there it goes cooking carefully now with 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.170
 cheese mostly with yes that not the 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.690
 material was iron that starts to 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.640
 warm up and something important is going to be like that 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.620
 they will not miss kidneys will not miss 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.620
 the roast and they will not miss the pumpkins
