00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 and then folks maybe linux well watch 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:11.790
 here with an ipad is and samsung galaxy note 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.940
 of 10 2014 and mission I will speak to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.750
 respect for you here about is 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.300
 performance 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.250
 I can not find one 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 application that measures performance 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.359
 was the same militia application 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.090
 performance of the two is then not 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 I can tell you if one is more. 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.420
 faster than the other 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.960
 I understood then I'll show 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.070
 You the next I'll be running. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.070
 in them or even stay here for example 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.730
 google maps and after a game and let's go 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.850
 see if there is any difference or not 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:55.879
 performance is personal let's google 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:59.640
 maps practically the practically not the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.739
 here the ipad and ran faster just by 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.930
 location of each January product 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.400
 Let's get here in Sao Paulo try 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.400
 find the same place here 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:31.130
 basically the same place for both of us 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:38.370
 let's make a turn here 贸 it seems 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:44.150
 the ipad it is also it is softer 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:50.670
 than in that one no longer goes water and 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:56.340
 in samsung it is seems that the scroll 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:59.520
 is not as good as Apple's. 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.900
 time it went better both here and 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450
 on the other device I made a 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.860
 already here so that it attempts to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.729
 load all at once 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.679
 understood here not here it will carry 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.390
 because it carries the names 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.480
 of those already try to carry everything once 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.150
 and even names together 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.709
 then in this one again 贸 贸 he 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.270
 comes out much more ahead of 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.540
 android 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:31.050
 however much it may be for more than the onenote 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.830
 it has a quadcore processor of 1.9 and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.150
 1.3 still ipad it in addition to the upper back 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.980
 About that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:42.810
 I see that it's much better to google 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.920
 maps here on android is also very 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.840
 good 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.200
 it seems that he has even more details 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 here is more vivid the colors in 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.780
 compared to the ipad but this I do not know what 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.239
 tell me for example is this here 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:04.290
 you have a cool ct scroll him 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:06.209
 loading a third segmentation is crashing 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.280
 on android 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.930
 here we have the same options to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.959
 a search bar that is a little bit 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.790
 the smaller you can see here on the side a 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.130
 compass alone here too it is okay O 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.600
 that such an attack determined the 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.420
 organization, I do not have one 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.900
 location because I already had on the ipad the 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.900
 location 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.080
 and I'm already doing here, you do not have to. 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.620
 on android this move here 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.360
 the next will be a personal sambas game 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.269
 surfers're 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.599
 both devices just for you 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.599
 have an idea 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.739
 opa 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.580
 Look, I can not 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:57.310
 it is only running the one that is only 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.140
 running and if the maps ovi maps here only 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:05.380
 It's running, it's not, it's not, it's not 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.260
 because of the memory loaded that 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.819
 vai vai loading the other 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.030
 Let's carry the samb么 and be happy and 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.549
 both here we'll see who it takes 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.090
 less time to carry the person walks 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.090
 23c 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:38.560
 What is happening is that the ipad 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.750
 it took less time to load the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.860
 dog does not stop this he always has 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.639
 this advertisement at any interval 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.629
 I think Aquino in the year 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.629
 have the advertisements 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:15.029
 It is personal play on probation two here 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:15.029
 it's not a joke 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.850
 here it was already 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:35.990
 but in personal performance they seem 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:40.660
 It seems the same thing but the ipad again 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:44.420
 he carries the first robot surfers 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.200
 personal touch let's end up being just one 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.200
 test same right 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.550
 this was basically a test of 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:09.210
 performance 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:11.970
 the ipad looks like it's loaded more 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.900
 fast about relationship here in the 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.420
 Google Maps 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:19.020
 I also think that there are no more 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:20.850
 another here to do your personal test 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.390
 if you have any suggestions there 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.340
 test of this test application that here 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.460
 also to see please leave it at 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.070
 description of the video there what kopcak what 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.630
 you want the test on both the 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.820
 do another performance test 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:40.560
 to see who 's out front who is 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:43.230
 which works best for now, the ipad is 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.660
 in my opinion he is better both 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.060
 on google maps how much flavor went to 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.550
 upload now to play the samba 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.850
 it makes so much one another of the person does not have 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:57.000
 it's big so it's the big difference 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.610
 It's there, that's how I told you. 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.220
 you if you can suggest 

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:04.800
 which app is the game again ? 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.600
 can run on both for a test 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.700
 of performance you leave in the description 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.090
 the video is good, and with that 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.169
 Did you like the jewelry leave a message? 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:15.169
 Thank you and even more personal
