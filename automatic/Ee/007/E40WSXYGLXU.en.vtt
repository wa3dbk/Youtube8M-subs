 chapter 59 already a new series called 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.800
 discontinued as its name indicates 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.810
 we'll see in this section 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.600
 Discontinued razors that are no longer 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.560
 in the current victorinox catalog for 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.340
 this first episode 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.920
 I have decided to bring you this wonder and 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.559
 as you can see the first thing 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.070
 striking is that its shield is not 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.210
 the typical one that victorinox carries in his 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.630
 good bit of this from the shield and that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.000
 razor 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.860
 let's talk right now so without 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.860
 more we start 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.469
 Well, here we have it and first thing 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.119
 let's talk about it is that shield 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.220
 what are you seeing and is the federal shield 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.780
 Swiss as you can see the contrary 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.690
 that the current knives that is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.509
 embedded this is thermogravure in 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
 the follower steps good to tell you that 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.040
 this shield and this knife belong to 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.530
 the victorinox economic series that 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.720
 I made in the 80s you 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:31.490
 you will know for sure the economic series 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.920
 current is what the grips are in 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:38.030
 nylon effectively come that way from the 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.240
 90s but this guy is from the 80s 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.850
 it came on a follower scale 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.270
 and with the shield as I told you 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.970
 Swiss federal prior to this before 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.030
 the 80's here I put a photo that 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.270
 the economic model of victorinox is 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.090
 I called the stainless steel as I said 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.740
 disappeared in the 70s and gave way to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.159
 the 80s to this model that comes with 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.590
 handles in follower and without stick or 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.230
 tweezers since I had to 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.569
 make it much cheaper and the stick the 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.340
 and the tweezers, well, it made that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.030
 that will not cost the knife and the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.069
 could put at an affordable price 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.870
 Well, it has 11 functions and 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.269

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.480
 I said it does not have any sticks or tweezers 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.260
 to lower costs 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.650
 well remember is a model 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.630
 economic that the current one is called ecoline 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.209
 the difference with them is that the 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.709
 current ecoline bring the grips in 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:25.180
 nylon and these during the 80s were coming 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.030
 in follower and they brought the federal shield 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.910
