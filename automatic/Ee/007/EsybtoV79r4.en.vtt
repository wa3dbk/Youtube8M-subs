00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.200
 transformers 4 movie that at least 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.080
 for me it makes you think seriously if 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.090
 see it or not see it I must be honest to the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.160
 beginning when the trailer came out of the 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.560
 film had no idea what 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.509
 I was seeing first I thought I was going to 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.669
 be something similar to what happened to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.320
 spiderman who started over by 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.540
 reasons that have nothing to do with 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.939
 the video besides I do not have either 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.009
 idea of reason I do not see much the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.469
 official pages of the movies that 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.090
 will come out in the future so any 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.220
 information that comes out of there or a 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.190
 exclusive advance on the page 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.200
 surely I miss it good that I thought 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.150
 at first but as I watched 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.280
 the trailer looked like any 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.290
 Transformers with lots of action and a lot 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.510
 dramatization in fact if there were not 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.700
 seen a video of a channel giving its 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.890
 trailer opinion really never 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.350
 I would have known that it was transformers 4 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.480
 then it was when I investigated a 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.550
 particular topic disappearance 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.380
 shia labeouf in the breakthrough and I realized 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.059
 that this actor who plays the role of 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.759
 protagonist of the first three 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.860
 deliveries of transformers sam witwicky no 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.300
 will be or was not in the movie 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.980
 reasons that I do not understand 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.140
 I only know that if he did not want to do 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.300
 fourth for reasons I do not know and the 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 most of the actors or I think all do not 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.230
 they want to make the fourth installment so 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.300
 that actor Mark Wahlberg replaced him 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.400
 The truth is that his performance in the 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.070
 movie was very good nothing but 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.530
 say about the good that I thought the 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 movie the truth is that I stayed with 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.310
 a bit of bad taste in the mouth when 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.380
 I saw that the only buses that were left 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.020
 with life were optimal pain and mild wing 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.120
 besides that the designs of the characters 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.280
 they changed a lot and in my opinion they seem 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.860
 something similar to power rangers at 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.470
 least in my view the movie 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.450
 in itself it gives you a lot to be desired especially 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.700
 because this movie was not planned 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.430
 from a beginning of fact until I can 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 to say that it is something like a filler is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.630
 supposed the third hands over the side 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.880
 dark of the moon ' was going to be the last 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.400
 Transformers movie so 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.230
 should have been the end of the franchise as 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.360
 I see it would have been fine if 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.429
 they would have left transformers as well 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.140
 is in any way in the third 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.750
 delivery many conclusions were made 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.580
 his end was perfect to end with 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.660
 Transformers and their story with a final 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.150
 very epic 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.730
 my opinion for me would have been good 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.800
 with that ending that's why I say that at 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.200
 look like they just made this movie for 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.180
 fill in but it does not mean that the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.700
 movie itself is bad but neither 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.990
 I am saying that the 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.210
 action and the battles are 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.010
 main characteristics of this type 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.160
 of movies and this is not the exception 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.230
 just like his characters but not 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.420
 I can say the same about the story 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.970
 It's bad but compared to the previous ones 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.790
 deliveries I would say I expected more like that 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.860
 I missed something in it and its end I'm not going 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.290
 to say nothing but the end in all 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.210
 aspects I did not like at all in fact 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.400
 I can consider it the worst end of 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.980
 transformers and something very predictable for 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.920
 me your mood is pretty good has not 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.810
 changed a lot but it's good I've seen it 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.850
 once and I can really tell you that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.220
 I would see her again in my house but not in 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.520
 the cinema is a film that in detail 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.320
 bored a little eye just a little bit good is 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.510
 that only bores when they show only 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.370
 filling that are sometimes very long on 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.800
 all because the movie is long at 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.959
 except I felt it as well as data 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.440
 additional I will tell you something that happened through me 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.480
 mind 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.850
 and the three new transformers of the 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.040
 movie those three reminded me of 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.960
 certain characters of the metal gear solid ' 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.150
 I will not tell you what it is because as they say 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.240
 some an image says more than a thousand 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.240
 words 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.569
 reaching the end of the video les 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.480
 I will answer certain questions is 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:04.280
 advisable to see the movie good if you 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.010
 you're a fan and you saw all the movies 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.900
 previous ones and you liked them of course 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.819
 you have to see this movie since 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.500
 having something to do with history and 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.629
 that I also tell you from now on that 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.489
 there will be a fifth installment at least that 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.430
 I suppose for the end that he had 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.380
 I recommend seeing it on the big screen 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.320
 Besides, as everyone knows, the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.000
 dinosaurs that are really good really 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.590
 but instead of you being one or one of 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.840
 those people who did not like the 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.460
 previous films and besides that not 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.310
 they want to see their main characters 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.380
 well changed style I tell you 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.090
 immediate that you do not see this movie anymore 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.310
 that if you did not like the first three 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.710
 deliveries I do not see the reason to see the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.389
 fourth since to be honest this 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.910
 fourth was nothing compared to the 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.669
 previous what did you think in detail 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.710
 transformers 4 because there are no details 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.720
 I can simply tell you that the 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.520
 movie itself worth it but for 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.800
 the people who saw the deliveries 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.139
 previous in my case 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.470
 the movie was regular neither so good nor 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.120
 so bad, yes 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.580
 Humor is good just like your 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.680
 dramatization but if I had to choose 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.140
 between seeing this or seeing how to train your 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.050
 dragon ' 2 I would sincerely choose to see 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.360
 dragon 2 good for today has been all in 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.010
 this video I know it was very short but it's 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.200
 my first time doing a video of 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.090
 opinion like this I hope you have a 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.090
 good day and for today I say goodbye
