00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
high production engine but it's very

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.870 
high production engine but it's very
sweet<00:00:27.100> typical<00:00:27.840> East<00:00:28.840> European<00:00:29.650> engine<00:00:30.039> here

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
sweet typical East European engine here

in<00:00:31.000> the<00:00:31.090> bag<00:00:31.330> I<00:00:31.600> have<00:00:31.720> to<00:00:31.990> let<00:00:32.739> more<00:00:33.039> replicas

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
in the bag I have to let more replicas

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.680 
in the bag I have to let more replicas
and<00:00:34.030> as<00:00:34.930> you<00:00:35.079> see<00:00:35.379> a<00:00:36.030> lot<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.059> things<00:00:37.390> are

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
and as you see a lot of things are

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.189 
and as you see a lot of things are
actually<00:00:37.960> almost<00:00:38.409> the<00:00:38.710> same<00:00:39.269> also<00:00:40.269> screwed<00:00:40.929> in

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
actually almost the same also screwed in

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.129 
actually almost the same also screwed in
front<00:00:41.530> journal<00:00:42.780> bearing<00:00:44.190> exact<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.309> same<00:00:46.139> the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
front journal bearing exact the same the

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:50.039 
front journal bearing exact the same the
tank<00:00:47.469> of<00:00:47.679> course<00:00:47.979> a<00:00:48.370> lot<00:00:49.269> of<00:00:49.389> stuff<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:49.809> very

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:50.049 
tank of course a lot of stuff is very

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.200 
tank of course a lot of stuff is very
very<00:00:50.260> similar<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:51.760> going<00:00:51.909> to<00:00:51.999> buy<00:00:52.149> this

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
very similar I'm going to buy this

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.379 
very similar I'm going to buy this
engine<00:00:52.719> was<00:00:52.899> actually<00:00:53.319> not<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:53.799> bad<00:00:54.359> only<00:00:55.359> a

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
engine was actually not so bad only a

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.259 
engine was actually not so bad only a
very<00:00:55.839> ugly<00:00:56.049> true<00:00:57.039> was<00:00:57.249> here<00:00:57.459> I<00:00:57.639> change<00:00:57.969> it<00:00:58.089> for

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
very ugly true was here I change it for

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.829 
very ugly true was here I change it for
a<00:00:58.329> normal<00:00:58.780> comprises<00:00:59.589> true<00:01:00.149> also<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.299> oxy<00:01:01.749> are

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
a normal comprises true also the oxy are

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.920 
a normal comprises true also the oxy are
play<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.379> the<00:01:02.469> shaft<00:01:02.709> has<00:01:02.889> almost<00:01:03.369> no<00:01:03.699> none<00:01:04.059> so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
play in the shaft has almost no none so

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.200 
play in the shaft has almost no none so
when<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.170> engine<00:01:05.619> warms<00:01:05.950> up<00:01:06.100> I<00:01:06.490> will<00:01:06.670> expand

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
when the engine warms up I will expand

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.090 
when the engine warms up I will expand
and<00:01:07.479> it<00:01:07.720> breaks<00:01:08.140> the<00:01:08.620> correction<00:01:09.010> from

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
and it breaks the correction from

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.400 
and it breaks the correction from
turning<00:01:09.520> so<00:01:09.670> it<00:01:09.730> was<00:01:09.940> not<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.120> good<00:01:10.300> idea<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:11.380> I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
turning so it was not a good idea so I

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.650 
turning so it was not a good idea so I
just<00:01:11.800> made<00:01:12.040> some<00:01:12.070> state<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.850> should<00:01:13.360> be<00:01:13.450> one

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
just made some state and should be one

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.760 
just made some state and should be one
one<00:01:13.960> tenth<00:01:14.200> of<00:01:14.320> a<00:01:14.380> millimeter<00:01:14.800> it's<00:01:15.370> okay<00:01:15.670> now

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
one tenth of a millimeter it's okay now

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.890 
one tenth of a millimeter it's okay now
compression<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.980> i<00:01:18.880> would<00:01:19.480> say<00:01:19.750> around

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
compression is i would say around

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.920 
compression is i would say around
seventy<00:01:20.740> sixty<00:01:21.040> percent<00:01:21.480> save<00:01:22.480> enough<00:01:22.750> for

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
seventy sixty percent save enough for

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.100 
seventy sixty percent save enough for
running<00:01:23.290> nice<00:01:24.070> top<00:01:24.400> coming<00:01:24.640> out<00:01:24.910> but<00:01:25.660> could<00:01:25.930> be

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
running nice top coming out but could be

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.660 
running nice top coming out but could be
using<00:01:26.920> new<00:01:27.040> piston<00:01:27.490> or<00:01:27.670> a<00:01:27.730> little<00:01:28.450> bit<00:01:28.570> play

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
using new piston or a little bit play

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.740 
using new piston or a little bit play
radio<00:01:30.670> play<00:01:31.090> in<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:31.470> crankshaft<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.540> not<00:01:34.540> one

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
radio play in the crankshaft but not one

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.660 
radio play in the crankshaft but not one
for<00:01:34.930> him<00:01:35.080> you<00:01:35.320> run<00:01:35.590> with<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> second<00:01:36.490> or<00:01:36.640> third

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
for him you run with a second or third

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.780 
for him you run with a second or third
place<00:01:37.060> maybe<00:01:37.420> even<00:01:37.750> with<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:37.990> first<00:01:38.260> one<00:01:38.790> so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
place maybe even with the first one so

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.690 
place maybe even with the first one so
let's<00:01:39.970> go<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.570> check<00:01:40.900> when<00:01:41.590> run<00:01:41.890> oh<00:01:42.130> yeah

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
let's go out and check when run oh yeah

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.050 
let's go out and check when run oh yeah
i<00:01:42.760> also<00:01:43.090> want<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.840> mention<00:01:43.900> that<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:45.280> noise<00:01:45.730> of
