00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
consistency should look something like

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.300 
consistency should look something like
this<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:41.210> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.450> an<00:01:42.690> owl<00:01:43.260> mug<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:43.979> I<00:01:44.040> got

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
for my friend Tiffany so I used a spoon

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.280 
for my friend Tiffany so I used a spoon
to<00:01:48.720> try<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.290> separate<00:01:50.190> the<00:01:50.640> foam<00:01:51.170> but<00:01:52.170> it

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:04.340 
didn't really work out so you don't have
to<00:01:54.180> use<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> spoon<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.810> adding<00:02:04.170> the
