00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.810 
hot on the 15th of May was 1967
so<00:00:15.150> I've<00:00:15.269> broke<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.900> of<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.139> engine<00:00:16.650> stud<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
so I've broke one of the engine stud the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420 
so I've broke one of the engine stud the
stud<00:00:18.210> bolts<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> thermostat<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.400> I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
stud bolts for the thermostat so I

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.279 
stud bolts for the thermostat so I
picked<00:00:20.789> up<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:20.939> parts<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> attempt<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> fix

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
picked up some parts to attempt to fix

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.910 
picked up some parts to attempt to fix
this<00:00:22.560> I've<00:00:23.250> never<00:00:23.580> done<00:00:23.789> this<00:00:23.939> before<00:00:24.150> but

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
this I've never done this before but

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.279 
this I've never done this before but
left-hand<00:00:25.920> drill<00:00:26.369> bits<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.080> hopefully<00:00:28.080> while

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
left-hand drill bits and hopefully while

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.050 
left-hand drill bits and hopefully while
I'm<00:00:28.410> drilling<00:00:28.710> that'll<00:00:29.130> break<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.699> stud

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
I'm drilling that'll break that stud

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.209 
I'm drilling that'll break that stud
free<00:00:30.390> which<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:31.080> pretty<00:00:31.439> sure<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.859> been<00:00:32.099> in

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
free which I'm pretty sure has been in

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.639 
free which I'm pretty sure has been in
there<00:00:32.369> for<00:00:32.730> thirty<00:00:33.510> years<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.170> think<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
there for thirty years I think it's the

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.920 
there for thirty years I think it's the
original<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.640> then<00:00:35.940> I've<00:00:36.090> got<00:00:36.270> some<00:00:36.300> screw

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930

actually video of the second turn into
the<00:02:03.460> tap<00:02:03.670> tapping<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.630> hole<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.930> first<00:02:05.140> time

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
the tap tapping the hole the first time

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.950 
the tap tapping the hole the first time
I<00:02:05.350> did<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.040> half<00:02:06.670> turn<00:02:07.060> back<00:02:07.450> out<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.660> quarter

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
I did the half turn back out a quarter

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.930 
I did the half turn back out a quarter
turn<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.410> advance<00:02:08.710> another<00:02:09.070> half<00:02:09.280> turn<00:02:09.490> back

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
turn in advance another half turn back

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.970 
turn in advance another half turn back
out<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.150> quarter<00:02:10.540> turn<00:02:10.720> and<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.080> went<00:02:11.260> very<00:02:11.530> slow

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
out a quarter turn and I went very slow

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.150 
out a quarter turn and I went very slow
on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.880> second<00:02:13.210> pass<00:02:13.360> I'm<00:02:13.570> just<00:02:13.840> uh<00:02:14.160> clockwise

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
on the second pass I'm just uh clockwise

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.120 
on the second pass I'm just uh clockwise
turning<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.880> just<00:02:16.690> one<00:02:16.870> final<00:02:17.230> time<00:02:17.380> to<00:02:17.440> clean

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
turning in just one final time to clean

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:29.330 
turning in just one final time to clean
up<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.400> threads<00:02:25.860> remove<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.070> extractor<00:02:27.730> and

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
up the threads remove the extractor and

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.930 
up the threads remove the extractor and
next<00:02:30.340> insert<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.820> coil<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:33.430> is<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.730> coil

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
next insert the coil this is the coil

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.910 
next insert the coil this is the coil
that<00:02:34.060> gets<00:02:34.240> me<00:02:34.360> back<00:02:34.540> down<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:35.140> seven<00:02:35.590> eighths

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
that gets me back down to seven eighths

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.610 
that gets me back down to seven eighths
inch<00:02:36.640> thread<00:02:37.300> size<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.260> any<00:02:38.410> video

with<00:02:38.740> a<00:02:38.800> coil<00:02:39.010> going<00:02:39.370> in<00:02:39.520> but<00:02:39.820> there's<00:02:40.270> a

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
with a coil going in but there's a

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.840 
with a coil going in but there's a
special<00:02:40.720> insertion<00:02:41.620> tool<00:02:41.770> for<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:44.850> here's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
special insertion tool for that here's

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.770 
special insertion tool for that here's
the<00:02:46.210> new<00:02:46.390> stud<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:48.070> used<00:02:48.460> two<00:02:48.910> bolts<00:02:49.390> locked

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the new stud and I used two bolts locked

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.260 
the new stud and I used two bolts locked
together<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.810> a<00:02:52.870> wrench<00:02:53.170> on<00:02:53.880> one<00:02:54.880> side<00:02:55.120> of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
together to get a wrench on one side of

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.860 
together to get a wrench on one side of
the<00:02:55.330> stud<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:56.459> tighten<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.550> into<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.910> head<00:02:58.360> a

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.630 

little<00:03:01.870> bit<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.170> thread<00:03:02.350> lock<00:03:02.530> applied<00:03:02.890> to<00:03:03.250> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
little bit of thread lock applied to the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:21.340 
little bit of thread lock applied to the
coil<00:03:03.910> as<00:03:04.330> well<00:03:04.900> as<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.380> stud

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
and a stud on the right I'm not sure why

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.670 
and a stud on the right I'm not sure why
but<00:04:25.100> anyhow<00:04:26.100> ball<00:04:26.520> back<00:04:26.669> together<00:04:26.850> now<00:04:27.210> and<00:04:27.680> no
