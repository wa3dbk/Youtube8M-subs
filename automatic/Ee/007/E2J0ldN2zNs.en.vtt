challenge<00:05:25.330> I<00:05:25.420> don't<00:05:25.600> think<00:05:25.810> any<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.500> the

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
challenge I don't think any of the

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.470 
challenge I don't think any of the
devices<00:05:27.430> that<00:05:27.730> people<00:05:27.940> have<00:05:28.120> been<00:05:28.240> showing

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
devices that people have been showing

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.720 
devices that people have been showing
yet<00:05:28.780> have<00:05:28.990> really<00:05:29.380> solved<00:05:29.800> actually<00:05:30.220> um<00:05:30.490> it's

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
yet have really solved actually um it's

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.980 
yet have really solved actually um it's
something<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:31.150> we<00:05:31.300> feel<00:05:31.510> confident<00:05:31.900> that

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
something that we feel confident that

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.640 
something that we feel confident that
leaves<00:05:32.260> now<00:05:32.500> solved<00:05:33.010> in<00:05:33.130> internal<00:05:34.030> prototypes

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
leaves now solved in internal prototypes

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.740 
leaves now solved in internal prototypes
but<00:05:35.650> even<00:05:36.040> our<00:05:36.130> dk2<00:05:36.550> is<00:05:36.880> not<00:05:37.060> consumer-ready

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
but even our dk2 is not consumer-ready

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.520 
but even our dk2 is not consumer-ready

anything but you have all these internal
prototypes<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:46.240> dev<00:05:46.480> kit<00:05:46.690> 2<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.230> is<00:05:47.650> getting

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
prototypes and dev kit 2 is is getting

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.890 
prototypes and dev kit 2 is is getting
there<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.430> it's<00:05:48.670> looking<00:05:48.850> great<00:05:49.180> like<00:05:49.570> I<00:05:49.690> just

budget<00:06:18.149> behind<00:06:18.599> it<00:06:18.749> and<00:06:18.899> that's<00:06:19.619> incredibly

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:20.129 
budget behind it and that's incredibly

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:21.889 
budget behind it and that's incredibly
exciting<00:06:20.579> and<00:06:20.729> it's<00:06:21.059> just<00:06:21.269> neat<00:06:21.449> to<00:06:21.479> see<00:06:21.599> this

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:21.899 
exciting and it's just neat to see this

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:23.809

finally<00:06:22.439> start<00:06:22.679> to<00:06:22.709> pick<00:06:22.949> up<00:06:23.069> and<00:06:23.249> be<00:06:23.339> real<00:06:23.549> I

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
finally start to pick up and be real I

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:25.249 
finally start to pick up and be real I
think<00:06:24.239> we<00:06:24.329> have<00:06:24.360> a<00:06:24.509> hundred<00:06:24.749> and<00:06:24.989> ninety

00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 
think we have a hundred and ninety

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.679 
think we have a hundred and ninety
experience<00:06:25.739> as<00:06:25.860> an<00:06:25.979> oculus<00:06:26.399> share<00:06:26.639> you<00:06:27.629> know

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
experience as an oculus share you know

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.179 
experience as an oculus share you know
there<00:06:27.989> are<00:06:28.049> a<00:06:28.079> lot<00:06:28.199> of<00:06:28.229> community<00:06:28.649> experiences

00:06:29.179 --> 00:06:29.189 
there are a lot of community experiences

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:30.739 
there are a lot of community experiences
a<00:06:29.249> lot<00:06:29.489> of<00:06:29.579> people<00:06:29.729> just<00:06:29.969> testing<00:06:30.360> out<00:06:30.479> what's

00:06:30.739 --> 00:06:30.749 
a lot of people just testing out what's

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:32.449 
a lot of people just testing out what's
working<00:06:30.929> what's<00:06:31.289> not<00:06:31.379> sharing<00:06:32.339> everything

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:32.459 
working what's not sharing everything

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:35.209 
working what's not sharing everything
openly<00:06:33.119> but<00:06:33.719> I<00:06:33.959> think<00:06:34.169> you<00:06:34.259> will<00:06:34.409> see<00:06:34.469> hundreds

00:06:35.209 --> 00:06:35.219 
openly but I think you will see hundreds

00:06:35.219 --> 00:06:37.279
