00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.870
 more video in this review 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.809
 is it about a tv speaker system 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.000
 brand boston acoustics the so-called tv 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.950
 Model 26 consists of a right 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.350
 Compact sound bar and a wireless 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.949
 subwoofer everything else after the intro 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.949
 have fun 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.210
 in the scope of supply are beside the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.590
 sound construction and the subwoofer two more 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.060
 suitable power supplies 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.360
 continue to lie an optical 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.219
 a 3 5 mm jack cable and audio cable 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.930
 an adapter from jack to cinch for 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.610
 connect with the tv at the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.649
 provided remote control is indeed 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
 practically becomes thanks to learnable soundbar 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.250
 but hardly necessary because you just his 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.149
 normal tv remote control continues 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.680
 can use 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.539
 and last but not least we have here 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.610
 a fat guide and what I like very much 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.110
 practically find a template for a 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.629
 simplified wall mounting 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 the installation is incredibly easy 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.230
 Both components only need to be powered 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.760
 supplied and the soundbar with one 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.629
 single cable with the tv 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 get connected 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.140
 after the turn connect bar 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 and subwoofer then automatically and that 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.229
 system is ready to use 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.330
 depending on the tv you may need 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.640
 still change the output channel with it 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.860
 the sound really synonymous to the tv 26th 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 but then you can 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.500
 be amazed 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.299
 at the beginning I have several times between 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.159
 the tv speakers and the boston 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.140
 sound system switched back and forth and 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.540
 I can only really say madness 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.799
 the difference is really huge to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.479
 but more later 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.570
 the soundbar has the dimensions 8,3 x 80 x 73 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.299
 5 centimeters and fits optimally for 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.770
 32 inch television or larger appliances 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.240
 she is in a simple but very 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.400
 send black kept 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.380
 on the front is located in the middle 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.360
 the boston acoustics logo and one piece 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.100
 Continue right six function keys the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.020
 can be operated via touch 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 different colored leds behind the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 buttons informed and the soundbar over 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.090
 we switch the current status 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.399
 for example, the sound mute captures the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.159
 corresponding button to blink as 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.750
 Speakers come 2 5 inches big hrt 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.490
 drivers to use for one 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.649
 pretty clear and dynamic sound 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.240
 we can make the soundbar either 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.799
 Just put in front of the TV for 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
 a firm stand there are several 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.670
 Rubber feet on the bottom or else 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.540
 also hang on the wall for what also 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.519
 already half 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.019
 Pre-installed on the back 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.709
 are also still the 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.840
 connections 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.219
 besides two analog aux 1 against which 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.719
 one over the trip switch 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.640
 let's have one more 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:28.010
 optical and thus digital input 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:32.459
 the subwoofer has the size 23 eight times 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.900
 26.6 times 27.9 centimeters and needed 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.069
 no cable and with the soundbar 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.780
 to be connected 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.290
 in it is a class d 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.879
 amplifier and 165 mm large bank of the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 is oriented downwards 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.510
 At the back we find next to one 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.730
 switch on and off another regulator 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.349
 to adjust the strength of the bass 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.970
 feet are light from below 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.040
 gummed and run a little late 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.900
 whereby the subwoofer is established and the 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.260
 pass the signals well to the ground 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.359
 can 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.280
 as already briefly mentioned 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.419
 the included remote control 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.159
 actually not needed at all 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:03.989
 soundbar is capable of learning and works 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.480
 after a short programming with almost 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.129
 every tv remote control that is real 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.439
 very convenient as you only continue 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.419
 a single remote control then needed 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.829
 Let's come to the sound it is always 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.989
 very difficult to put into words 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.549
 and that's why I want to share this point 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.579
 a quick comparison between mine 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.120
 tv speakers and the tv 26 initiate 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.120
 hear yourself 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.570
 I am sure that the difference 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.000
 We have become very clear 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.220
 here have 150 watts rms system so 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.440
 neat performance behind it and the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.660
 Sound is just fantastic 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.120
 no matter if you watch tv or watch a movie 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.130
 watch or hear music hears it 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.410
 Everything is just really good 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.850
 for movies there is an extra surround 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.650
 Mode there is a bit of cinema 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.020
 feeling on and for music one 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.190
 special stereo mode i am 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.290
 in the meantime even already 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.970
 passed music over my tv 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.320
 to hear it because the whole thing sounded to me 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.600
 just like it so much 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.590
 the bass is really nice and powerful 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.720
 also to your own 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.220
 adjust needs and otherwise of 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.170
 the heights and the middle 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.600
 everything sounds good it fits 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.640
 I am altogether in total and sonorous 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.350
 really 100% satisfied 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.660
 then we are already at the conclusion 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.570
 boston acoustics has arrived with the 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.370
 tv model 26 a pretty brilliant sound 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.290
 package is put on the market it is 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.840
 compact well processed and comes along 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.550
 a minimum of cabling from the sound 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.350
 is totally awesome and the virtual 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.340
 surround mode brings real kinofeeling 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.830
 home 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.470
 the tv model 26 comes with a 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.790
 recommended retail price of 349 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.950
 Euro indicated 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.180
 the current Amazon price at the time 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.970
 the recording is clearly 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.890
 including around 240 euros 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.750
 that's the price in my eyes 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.700
 definitely ok 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.650
 I could not criticize as far as none 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.420
 find at most integrated bluetooth 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.070
 would have been a nice feature around 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.150
 wireless music from the smartphone or 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.920
 to hear tablet 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:26.050
 otherwise I am completely satisfied 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.490
 and now enjoy the great sound 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.020
 then we are already at the end 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.760
