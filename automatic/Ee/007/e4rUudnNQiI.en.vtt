a full Chain of Custody on it everything
we<00:01:36.130> do<00:01:36.219> want<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.520> make<00:01:36.640> sure<00:01:36.700> we're<00:01:36.909> doing<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
we do want to make sure we're doing it

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.520 
we do want to make sure we're doing it
for<00:01:37.359> the<00:01:37.570> environment<00:01:38.049> doing<00:01:38.170> it<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.409> right

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
for the environment doing it the right

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.700 
for the environment doing it the right
way

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
way

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.529 
way
and<00:01:39.490> what<00:01:39.609> it<00:01:39.700> does<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:39.969> the<00:01:40.030> guitar<00:01:40.359> it's

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:40.539 
and what it does on the guitar it's

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:41.969 
and what it does on the guitar it's
maple<00:01:40.750> back<00:01:40.990> inside<00:01:41.289> so<00:01:41.350> it's<00:01:41.679> naturally

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
maple back inside so it's naturally

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:42.990 
maple back inside so it's naturally
going<00:01:42.039> to<00:01:42.159> be<00:01:42.250> brighter<00:01:42.490> than<00:01:42.609> a<00:01:42.759> rosewood

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
going to be brighter than a rosewood

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.700 
going to be brighter than a rosewood
dreadknot<00:01:43.539> but<00:01:43.780> when<00:01:43.869> you<00:01:43.960> add<00:01:44.109> the<00:01:44.289> walnut<00:01:44.619> it

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
dreadknot but when you add the walnut it

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.899 
dreadknot but when you add the walnut it
seems<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.979> calm<00:01:45.130> it<00:01:45.159> down<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.429> little<00:01:45.579> bit<00:01:45.759> and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
seems to calm it down a little bit and

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:46.889 
seems to calm it down a little bit and
