00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
my last video I talked about how

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.720 
my last video I talked about how
Infinity<00:01:52.530> Ward<00:01:52.770> made<00:01:53.010> changes<00:01:53.400> to<00:01:53.460> kill

collecting<00:01:55.980> tags<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.940> that<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.510> a

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
collecting tags and I think that is a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.120 
collecting tags and I think that is a
good<00:01:57.900> thing<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> should<00:01:58.950> have<00:01:59.070> been

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
good thing I think it should have been

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
good thing I think it should have been
that<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.520> since<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.000> game<00:02:00.120> shipped<00:02:00.510> I<00:02:00.720> don't

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that way since the game shipped I don't

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.890 
that way since the game shipped I don't
understand<00:02:01.920> why<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.520> didn't<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.150> but

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
understand why they didn't do that but

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.110 
understand why they didn't do that but
it<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.110> what<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.500> right<00:02:04.880> but<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.030> like

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
it is what it is right but it's like

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.930 
it is what it is right but it's like
this<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:08.100> made<00:02:08.280> some<00:02:08.459> mistakes<00:02:08.790> in

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
this now and I made some mistakes in

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.550 
this now and I made some mistakes in
that<00:02:09.119> first<00:02:09.330> video<00:02:09.510> especially<00:02:09.959> since<00:02:10.350> I<00:02:10.440> only

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
with the century gun and the IMS and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.289 
with the century gun and the IMS and
lower<00:02:43.709> streaks<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.120> new

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
lower streaks is with this new

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.210 
lower streaks is with this new
killstreak<00:02:45.750> setup<00:02:45.989> you<00:02:46.260> build<00:02:46.590> streaks<00:02:46.950> so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
killstreak setup you build streaks so

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.500 
killstreak setup you build streaks so
quickly<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.970> actually<00:02:48.150> end<00:02:48.450> up

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
quickly that you actually end up

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.630 
quickly that you actually end up
overlapping<00:02:48.840> them<00:02:49.350> or<00:02:49.709> when<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.610> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
overlapping them or when you go in to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.880 
overlapping them or when you go in to
call<00:02:50.849> your<00:02:50.940> second<00:02:51.330> ims<00:02:51.780> or<00:02:52.260> sent<00:02:52.590> your<00:02:52.740> gun

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
call your second ims or sent your gun

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.760 
call your second ims or sent your gun
the<00:02:53.220> first<00:02:53.459> one<00:02:53.640> blows<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.480> already

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
the first one blows up if you already

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.400 
the first one blows up if you already
on<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.100> map<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.090> suggest<00:02:56.540> a<00:02:56.660> Trinity<00:02:57.050> rocket

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
on the map so I suggest a Trinity rocket

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.810 
on the map so I suggest a Trinity rocket
because<00:02:57.560> it's<00:02:57.710> quick<00:02:57.950> you're<00:02:58.280> in<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.550> out<00:02:58.640> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
because it's quick you're in and out and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.300 
because it's quick you're in and out and
if<00:02:59.360> you're<00:02:59.510> relatively<00:03:00.380> in<00:03:00.680> their<00:03:00.830> spawn<00:03:01.100> year

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
if you're relatively in their spawn year

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.750 
if you're relatively in their spawn year
you<00:03:01.490> should<00:03:01.520> be<00:03:01.970> able<00:03:02.090> to<00:03:02.300> collect<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:02.690> tags

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
you should be able to collect the tags

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.580 
you should be able to collect the tags
the<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.000> biggest<00:03:05.210> mistake<00:03:05.630> I<00:03:05.810> made<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:06.350> the

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the the biggest mistake I made and the

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.530 
the the biggest mistake I made and the
first<00:03:06.830> one<00:03:07.040> was<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.310> I<00:03:07.430> ran<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.820> helo<00:03:08.120> pilot

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
first one was that I ran the helo pilot

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.300 
first one was that I ran the helo pilot
now<00:03:08.960> I<00:03:08.990> didn't<00:03:09.380> even<00:03:09.680> know<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.040> I<00:03:10.100> had<00:03:10.130> the

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
now I didn't even know that I had the

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.430 
now I didn't even know that I had the
helo<00:03:10.520> pile<00:03:10.730> on<00:03:10.910> but<00:03:11.630> once<00:03:11.810> I<00:03:11.900> got<00:03:11.930> in<00:03:12.140> the<00:03:12.200> helo

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
helo pile on but once I got in the helo

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.890 
helo pile on but once I got in the helo
pilot<00:03:12.770> all<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> did<00:03:13.160> was<00:03:13.510> scattered<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.630> map

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
pilot all I did was scattered the map

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.610 
pilot all I did was scattered the map
with<00:03:15.200> tags<00:03:15.530> that's<00:03:16.430> bad<00:03:17.140> now<00:03:18.140> as<00:03:18.200> you<00:03:18.260> guys<00:03:18.470> can

not like this some of you may think it's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.410 
not like this some of you may think it's
overpowered<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.500> think<00:03:45.920> it's<00:03:46.070> pretty<00:03:46.190> cool<00:03:46.460> so

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
overpowered I think it's pretty cool so

overpowered I think it's pretty cool so
I'm<00:03:47.510> still<00:03:47.840> not<00:03:47.990> getting<00:03:48.290> kills<00:03:48.800> towards<00:03:49.310> my

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
I'm still not getting kills towards my

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.370 
I'm still not getting kills towards my
