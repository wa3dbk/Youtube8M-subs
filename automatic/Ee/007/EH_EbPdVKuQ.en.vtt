00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.930
 Hello in this video correctly show those are also the own files on theirs 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:15.769
 hard disk 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.279
 can move 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.130
 it does not always make sense to move the folder as it does 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.749
 about the directory structure 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:26.939
 On the way to prove this pretty hidden is the more important 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.029
 Point is not an easier one to notice, however 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.380
 but that my data is separated from those windows data 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.250
 that is Windows and all installed programs reside 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.400
 PC complained 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.390
 and the letters that I wrote down with Oppenau, for example 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 on a completely different hard drive 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.320
 optimally 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.720
 on a completely different physical drive 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.150
 that means if there are two hard drives in the computer then they take one 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.420
 completely different hard drive 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.289
 If you 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.289
 two Windows drives have the same hard drive 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.530
 Minute the 2 2 sa is nothing but it is always the same hard drive 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.100
 just a case of damage to the hard drive 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
 where the data is lost anyway 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.090
 the meaning of this trend is that if our system 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.710
 as under Windows due to a misconstruction of us probably due 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.560
 a Trojan virus 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.620
 times the service refused 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 We do not need long torches to save our data 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.240
 then the c-class is simply formatted and the data becomes again 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.850
 once recorded 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.570
 with our backup copies, especially those of Windows Phone at the Hoffest 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.810
 and so on we rebuilt the system in a short time with something 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.100
 Exercise is so fast that I really no longer worth it 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.880
 to save an affected system 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.860
 Of course you are missing in the beginning because it can be that a beloved one 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.020
 Program not 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.850
 on which is called the VD 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 in this case you have to move to the Internet first 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.430
 Of course, many now say that their own image is more than just that 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.800
 Windows files on the CD 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.620
 consists 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.320
 Strangely, three more runs, for example, add the scanner or modem 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.839
 Driver chips as drivers Video card drivers 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.130
 is all right 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.140
 but all the drivers let us go downhill over a son 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.140
 Program also secured in one go 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.199
 and you also learn about the security service today e 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.399
 appropriate programs have already been presented from self-weighed de 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:28.229
 So here's the first and easiest step, we understand the directory 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:30.209
 own files 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.300
 November under XP and Vista the new non-classic states that use 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.719
 then find their own files on a runway click 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.739
 and should be here on the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.209
 right side of our minister own files 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.899
 be faded in 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.779
 if the classic militia associations and find so also own files 

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:54.769
 Let's change that 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.769
 However, that would not work so easily here 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.720
 now my own files are here in my even Duco Menze Waltz under also 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:03.949
 times faded in 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:06.779
 I can not handle it so well here 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:10.369
 An alternative to that would be if you did not own your own 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:13.459
 own own named own files on your desktop 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.269
 but I have also hidden so far I have this 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.240
 Possibility not 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.159
 I could be dazzling now 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.899
 however, if you like the classic menu 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:22.869
 use 

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.969
 then it makes the most sense very briefly 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.839
 to switch the new medium 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.369
 make the change and return it 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.639
 you click with the right mouse button on a start at Aken war 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.799
 context menu 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.599
 and go there on properties 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.749
 Anna Bligh can choose the two states through the louse 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.699
 in their case then the classic states should be selected as 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:48.699
 You just click on it for a moment 

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.799
 XP 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:52.999
 start 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.359
 so we have your own properties onbrez her right 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.189
 Click on the mouse button then we get the 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.610
 Context menu item properties and have the same in the classic states 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.489
 Not 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.839
 there clicked on it 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.199
 Craig Lady made some 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:14.430
 Ambri is also looking for a text box 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.999
 where the destination directory is specified 

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:18.590
 or will she stay 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.500
 and among them all three banks and medium is also often 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.900
 move 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.490
 Oberlauda Kliekener on it we should already optimally the new 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.520
 directory 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.520
 on the other disk 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.629
 of course I have already done that 

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:36.749
 So if I select this now via Target Dialog 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.900
 I also need them to the plate 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.900
 a folder called masterly 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.150
 I'll click the OK button on the other one 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
 then the new target shoots in here 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.940
 and in the end happy to take over and of course I am aware that 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.620
 now all files are moved that is they are not copied 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.620
 himself to the RC place on a debate 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
 at the end confirm again briefly 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:14.689
 maybe you have to confirm again if 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.689
 Desks are moved for part 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.240
 okay and that was it then 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.680
 Take care to look good in Explorer 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 Here is the purchase from the couple Video Reuters 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.069
 Dr also been old 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.249
 and here is now 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.249
 no directory "own files" in there anymore 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.339
 she will be in the container and the favorite 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.849
 own files 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.689
 though, I mean now 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:45.800
 go bankrupt and listed as before 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.990
 May is allowed 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.990
 Dietenheim here are my complete 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.749
 as you may have noticed in our own files are also Malta 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:02.229
 also two other user specific directories 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.069
 namely own pictures own music 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:07.860
 in case they used these directories at all 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:12.699
 they have moved with that means now and stable on this own 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.089
 Click pictures 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:20.149
 because of the Xplore is because of the world automatically directly d maize may own 

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:23.149
 Pictures 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.020
 that's the same as this directory you 

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:33.879
 What you should not do under any circumstances is the directory Teigeler Teilen 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:36.599
 even copying about the exploit 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.349
 or to move 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.849
 because at the moment where we do not have the windows internal functions for this 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:42.949
 Use process 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:47.279
 the corresponding data will not be rewritten to the registry 

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:51.999
 that is, all programs which visit the folder according to the folder own files 

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:55.139
 in the registry food then there still find the elderly Â» 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:57.119
 meanwhile "wrong" 

00:06:57.119 --> 00:07:00.509
 So that would not bring anything then they have a corresponding part 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.830
 Dialogues where they say where to save the file 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.130
 and so should the file 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.260
 be created there they would then always by hand again to the new 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.539
 Location jump 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:11.810
 that would make the whole thing so pointless on the 8th
