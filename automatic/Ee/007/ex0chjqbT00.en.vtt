 specialist for you to set up your 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.900
 Aquarium I 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.810
 I want to be a beginner what kind of fish 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.340
 That is the ideal to start Let's put 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.250
 the cold-water fish he gets 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.739
 adapted better than the 500 is a very 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.720
 good for beginners or the betas themselves 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.380
 a small aquarium with the system of 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.739
 filtration 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 are two good handsets for right and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.989
 the type of aquarium to begin with would be 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.550
 there is a simple device an aquarium that 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.160
 is not even small in size as I am 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.900
 said the smaller the aquarium the more 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.930
 You have a clean face when you 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.050
 aquarium is with aquarium filter do not 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.750
 lava stone does not wash the aquarium how much 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:37.540
 The less you move the more stabilized it 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.510
 the filter is then you will only change the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.310
 and the inside of the filter will never 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.280
 stir in your tank do not be doing 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.080
 change from water to rock steps down 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.940
 how to draw rock and clean 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.340
 you will never be able to have a colic 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.470
 That's what I thought if I ever 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
 I thought about trading, will you think about switching from 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.150
 water and aquarium lighting 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:01.480
 The lighting depends on what you want. 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 If you want to give the ornament it is not 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.260
 artificial like this here an aquarium 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.180
 beginner do not need no 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.310
 need lighting one to you 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.500
 never leave the aquarium near 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.109
 where it takes only because it produces 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.120
 high will go green its fourth and this 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.190
 You will not be able to improve any more if you 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.350
 You pick an aquarium where it catches 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.540
 sun in your house you will not be able to 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.269
 to stabilize this aquarium and that was the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.739
 fish that Libya can die then goes 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.570
 it is not that he will die but only 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.299
 will stay p will look like 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.359
 dirty idea is not that you're not 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:37.510
 taking care that he left the water tender and 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.190
 will produce alba and water with water that 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.200
 people put on the route initially we 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.060
 Let's put even tap water on it. 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.609
 before we put the prices we 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.370
 thermostat to turn on the achieved water 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.859
 between 26 and 28 degrees 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.750
 we put the anti clear that they are a 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.180
 droplets are two drops per liter of 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.270
 water is a product suitable for 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 water chlorine 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.080
 ah you will wait for 15 more days or 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.990
 less just turning the water without putting anything 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.820
 fish and then put your fish 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.800
 I was doing the adaptation 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.720
 You will arrive and pick him up at a store. 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.330
 specialized it will come within a 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.630
 you'll put it in the bag 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.820
 inside the bag for 15-20 minutes and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.920
 sellers to adapt to not have a 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.870
 there is no change in the pH of the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.700
 water you are mixing the water you 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.520
 has inside the bag next to favor having 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.560
 the fourth until finally drop it in. 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.940
 of the aquarium if it does not give a shock 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.650
 thermal he can die he'll die 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.290
 will develop some types of disease 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.730
 parasitic fungal bacteria are so 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.830
 What's important is the 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.510
 specialist is always look for a 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.260
 specialist at the time of setting up the show 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.570
 aquatic 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.890
 the water temperature is the ideal has 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.230
 fish is already cold 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:51.080
 You go now, for example. 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.850
 where it's extreme cold 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.660
 You see, guy makes swimming underneath. 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:58.820
 ice that is of adaptation without the animals 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.890
 they adapt they have fish that are of water 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.720
 hot if you put in cold water they 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.600
 They will not adapt for what I say. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.760
 the king is a cold water fish 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.680
 so you're a stronger one more 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.330
 tough that you will not have either 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.610
 work only have a text that you do not 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.130
 may in the future place the plant 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.470
 natural because it makes a lot of mess it 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.390
 strip the plants and mess up the aquarium but 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:23.960
 for a beginner best thing that has 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.710
 500 and easy face bessa and fit 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.380
 easy 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.800
 the most common diseases that may have 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.880
 inside a device 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.070
 bacteria and fungi always 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.470
 the main thing we notice when 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.420
 the pet be aware of it to 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.910
 to feed will get a 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:45.340
 different staining will appear stains 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.430
 and cars usually when the bacteria 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.050
 the tail bottom bacteria the tail begins to 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.650
 to look bad still looks like another animal 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.390
 came and bit him back an aquarium of this 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.400
 size for beginners we can 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.350
 mix assists or at first 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.190
 left a species just a species for 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:07.720
 flood the sound space in the house 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.240
 the aquarium can keep the car from 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.920
 some house for it to be the fault 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.710

 do not take direct sun this is a diet is 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.740
 an important tip people acquire 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.990
 aquarium is also what I understand for 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.080
 Part decoration as a therapy is this 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.080
 even the aquarium does not exist after 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.000
 you 're the deal it becomes an addiction you 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.560
 begins to like the animal very much you 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.990
 is always changing 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.060
 You start with the face of yours and then 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.550
 was more for the biggest for an hour 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.960
 until you reach an aquarium of a thousand liters
