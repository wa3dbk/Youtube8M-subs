00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello friends my name is x and 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 this video we will parse the song 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.429
 group valentine strykalo which 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.179
 called street steel makers 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.920
 and help us in this here this not 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.070
 simple device called 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 Capo and you set to 3 okay 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:24.539
 in principle, you can play without him and so in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.510
 principle the song is very simple and by the way 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:33.510
 watch what a cool video you just 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.770
 life so the first chord that us 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.410
 need a chord style 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.399
 clamped very easy we take 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 index finger put it on if 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.960
 count from capo but here is capo 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.390
 we have the first fret if you play without a tone 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.449
 principle from the first fret clamped all 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.510
 we also put our index finger on 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.210
 first fret 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.219
 the second string here is this peace finger 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:05.299
 we put on 2 fret 4 strings and this one 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:08.890
 here we put the finger on the 3 way 5 strings and 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.890
 we have such a sound 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.340
 just further we go accord well 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.550
 card them i think everyone knows how to clamp 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.840
 but nevertheless this finger 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.110
 remove from 1 to 2 strings but these here 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.780
 two fingers we put on the third and 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:35.750
 fourth string on 2 fret 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.750
 the tourist is playing 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 so we do it 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:48.050
 next we need a chord f a chord with can 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:51.360
 clamp in two ways the first 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:56.430
 complicated way but it is standard that is 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.950
 so here we go here with this finger and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.630
 put the ram on the first fret bad 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:11.250
 finger on 2 frets 3 strings but these 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:11.640
 two fingers we put on 3 frets 4 by 5 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.620
 country 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.870
 that is, it turns out we 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.569
 but you can clamp another way 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.480
 we take this one here we put it already 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.650
 on the usual 1 lat 2 strings 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.930
 bad finger put on 2 fret 3 strings and 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.930
 here is this finger we put on 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.960
 third fret 3 strings played only three 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.960
 country 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:50.150
 Well, you can still with this finger 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:54.290
 hold it like this can and can 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:57.079
 Basically, we need a chord g 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.269
 g chord is clamped on one side 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.810
 just another not just generally take 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:08.000
 little finger insert it on the first string 3 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:13.970
 fret this finger on 3 2 strings 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:19.280
 like this and then we have bad hospitals 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:27.130
 goes on 3 6 strings and and here is this finger 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.130
 It goes on 2 lad 5 countries that is 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.960
 In principle, these are all the chords that are needed 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.990
 us for a couplet from Russia 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.990
 but 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.830
 you are us 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.250
 it's pretty easy to fight this song. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.859
 I do not like to know when what type 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.250
 in this song was and tell me because 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:04:00.939
 In principle, everything can be played by ear 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:06.299
 if we talk about combat then i use that 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:06.299
 eat down down up up down up 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:24.729
 down down down down down 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:27.900
 small pause phobia is not laughter and 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.900
 it turns out like this 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.370
 Yes 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.330
 let be 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.289
 few 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.289
 staggers 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.419
 cm 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.760
 Now we start with a chord chord 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.260
 with we already know how to clamp therefore 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.530
 feel free to pinch him there goes 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:10.010
 ends couplet on chord jack and 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.010
 goes on a quarter 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.349
 all we need to do after the chord 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.729
 tv and remove it like this here poor 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.729
 that is, we have a finger 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.479
 just remove his fight remains the same 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.030
 as in the verse the player goes further 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:30.870
 chord c that is, well, you can know the map 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.870
 also how to compress 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.690
 that is, after si comes from ma 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.080
 and the whole chorus is played matan 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:41.080
 choose a finger 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.740
 carry it 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.740
 but 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.100
 eggs 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:07.400
 otherwise this test 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:15.320
 stopped goes top to the sea 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:17.750
 yeah well 

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.620
 Well, that is, the principle of the song is played very 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:27.350
 easy and here's the whole song let's 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:28.910
 repeat the chorus that is there the most important 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.790
 the moment it becomes with words 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:35.140
 top top top well I think it's all for yourself 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.140
 let's you simple 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:42.060
 m 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:42.060
 se 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.120
 about 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.419
 7 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.419
 fret 

00:06:56.419 --> 00:06:59.419
 top top top 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.680
 to the top 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.130
 do not return to rubles 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:18.920
 in general, the song is played quite easily i 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:20.540
