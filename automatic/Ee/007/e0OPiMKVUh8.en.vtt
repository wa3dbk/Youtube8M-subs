if you own one of these you probably
know<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.000> when<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.180> battery<00:00:30.390> dies<00:00:30.750> there's

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
know that when the battery dies there's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.230 
know that when the battery dies there's
really<00:00:31.650> no<00:00:31.890> sense<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.310> replacing<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.940> because

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
really no sense in replacing it because

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.120 
really no sense in replacing it because
you<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.540> almost<00:00:33.780> buy<00:00:34.080> an<00:00:34.230> entire<00:00:34.500> drill<00:00:34.920> with

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
Chuck on the front the reason that we

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.859 
Chuck on the front the reason that we
like<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.469> is<00:01:28.740> because<00:01:29.090> this<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.359> basically

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
like these is because this is basically

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
like these is because this is basically

something usable in a drill in the area
of<00:02:00.179> two<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> four<00:02:00.810> hundred<00:02:00.929> rpms<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:02.069> wouldn't

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
of two to four hundred rpms it wouldn't

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.620 
of two to four hundred rpms it wouldn't
do<00:02:02.429> you<00:02:02.520> much<00:02:02.549> good<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.999> have<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> drill<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
do you much good to have a drill that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
do you much good to have a drill that
spins<00:02:03.899> at<00:02:04.079> 15,000<00:02:04.889> rpms<00:02:05.310> at<00:02:05.520> low<00:02:05.639> voltage<00:02:06.090> you

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
spins at 15,000 rpms at low voltage you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.359 
spins at 15,000 rpms at low voltage you
wouldn't<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.509> able<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.799> effectively<00:02:07.799> remove<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
wouldn't be able to effectively remove a

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.130 
wouldn't be able to effectively remove a
screw<00:02:08.700> or<00:02:08.729> do<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.240> about<00:02:09.360> anything<00:02:09.690> with<00:02:09.869> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
screw or do just about anything with it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.170 
screw or do just about anything with it
so<00:02:10.590> they<00:02:10.709> add<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.039> gear<00:02:11.310> system<00:02:11.730> now<00:02:11.850> what<00:02:12.000> we

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
so they add this gear system now what we

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.330 
so they add this gear system now what we
use<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> gear<00:02:12.690> system<00:02:13.140> for<00:02:13.380> is<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.950> exact

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
use the gear system for is the exact

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.250 
use the gear system for is the exact
opposite<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.150> what<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.420> drill<00:02:15.660> companies<00:02:16.080> use

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
opposite of what the drill companies use

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500 
opposite of what the drill companies use
it<00:02:16.440> for<00:02:16.650> if<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.490> notice<00:02:17.790> when<00:02:17.940> I<00:02:17.970> spin<00:02:18.360> this

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
it for if you notice when I spin this

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.730 
it for if you notice when I spin this
it's<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.810> to<00:02:18.870> make<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.470> really

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
it's going to make like this really

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.839 
it's going to make like this really
winding<00:02:20.310> sound

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.420

you're somebody like me who sees stuff
on<00:02:49.019> YouTube<00:02:49.379> or<00:02:49.590> somebody<00:02:49.889> hooks<00:02:50.129> their

one<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.569> these<00:02:55.010> you're<00:02:56.010> probably<00:02:56.219> not<00:02:56.519> to

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
one of these you're probably not to

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.860 
one of these you're probably not to
impress<00:02:57.030> because<00:02:57.269> you're<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.689> think

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
impress because you're going to think

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.599 
impress because you're going to think
well<00:02:58.049> how<00:02:58.290> does<00:02:58.439> that<00:02:58.590> handle<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.099> load<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
well how does that handle a load and

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:01.640 
well how does that handle a load and
that's<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.389> great<00:03:00.599> question<00:03:00.659> that<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.349> couldn't

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
that's a great question that I couldn't

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.220 
that's a great question that I couldn't
agree<00:03:01.799> with<00:03:01.859> you<00:03:02.010> more<00:03:02.129> on<00:03:02.659> simply<00:03:03.659> hooking<00:03:04.079> up

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
agree with you more on simply hooking up

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.679 
agree with you more on simply hooking up
a<00:03:04.549> generator<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:05.639> one<00:03:05.849> of<00:03:05.939> these<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.299> spinning

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689 
a generator to one of these and spinning

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.140 
a generator to one of these and spinning
it<00:03:06.840> does<00:03:07.439> create<00:03:07.680> voltage<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:08.669> the<00:03:08.790> second

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
it does create voltage but the second

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.550 
it does create voltage but the second
that<00:03:09.269> you<00:03:09.359> hook<00:03:09.540> any<00:03:09.750> device<00:03:10.139> that<00:03:10.379> hat

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
that you hook any device that hat

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.800 
that you hook any device that hat
carries<00:03:10.949> any<00:03:11.159> type<00:03:11.459> of<00:03:11.489> load<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.329> voltage<00:03:12.480> is

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
carries any type of load the voltage is

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.629 
carries any type of load the voltage is
going<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.049> drop<00:03:13.230> significantly<00:03:13.549> so<00:03:14.549> what

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
going to drop significantly so what

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.589 
going to drop significantly so what
we're<00:03:14.760> going<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:14.939> do<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.239> we're<00:03:15.329> going<00:03:15.419> to<00:03:15.480> hook

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
we're going to do is we're going to hook

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.569 
we're going to do is we're going to hook
it<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.049> 12<00:03:16.680> volt<00:03:16.889> fan<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.340> I<00:03:17.400> have

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
it up to this 12 volt fan that I have

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:18.890 
it up to this 12 volt fan that I have
right<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:17.969> and<00:03:18.150> we're<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.480> see<00:03:18.659> how<00:03:18.780> it

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
right here and we're going to see how it

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.349 
right here and we're going to see how it
works<00:03:22.669> we're<00:03:23.669> going<00:03:23.790> to<00:03:23.849> start<00:03:24.090> by<00:03:24.209> hooking

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
works we're going to start by hooking

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.119 
works we're going to start by hooking
the<00:03:24.629> leads<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.109> fan<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.709> then<00:03:28.709> attaching

00:03:29.119 --> 00:03:29.129 
the leads to the fan and then attaching

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:36.199 
the leads to the fan and then attaching
them<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.759> our<00:03:30.060> motor<00:03:34.849> now<00:03:35.849> if<00:03:36.000> everything

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
them to our motor now if everything

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.640 
them to our motor now if everything
works<00:03:36.509> well<00:03:36.780> they<00:03:36.930> should<00:03:37.169> this<00:03:37.409> should

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
works well they should this should

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.439 
works well they should this should
respond<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.220> what<00:03:38.340> I<00:03:38.370> do<00:03:40.909> you<00:03:41.909> can<00:03:42.060> see<00:03:42.090> as<00:03:42.329> I

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
respond to what I do you can see as I

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.839 
respond to what I do you can see as I
turn<00:03:42.479> it<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.859> electrical<00:03:44.430> current<00:03:44.759> is

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
turn it the electrical current is

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.819 
turn it the electrical current is
actually<00:03:45.209> driving<00:03:45.449> this<00:03:45.720> fan<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.439> I<00:03:46.560> go<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
actually driving this fan if I go the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.399 
actually driving this fan if I go the
other<00:03:46.919> direction<00:03:47.040> you<00:03:47.959> can<00:03:48.959> see<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.199> go<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409 
other direction you can see it go the

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:51.289 
other direction you can see it go the
other<00:03:49.470> direction<00:03:49.590> now<00:03:50.250> what<00:03:50.849> I'm<00:03:50.939> going<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.120> do

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
other direction now what I'm going to do

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.740 
other direction now what I'm going to do
is<00:03:51.449> I'm<00:03:51.599> going<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.780> take<00:03:52.849> this<00:03:53.849> rechargeable

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
is I'm going to take this rechargeable

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.960 
is I'm going to take this rechargeable
drill<00:03:54.989> that<00:03:55.169> still<00:03:55.409> works<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.979> I'm<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.939> to

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
drill that still works and I'm going to

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.189 
drill that still works and I'm going to
slide<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.419> Chuck's<00:03:57.689> together<00:04:00.079> we're<00:04:01.079> going

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
slide the Chuck's together we're going

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.509 
slide the Chuck's together we're going
to<00:04:01.290> cheat<00:04:01.500> a<00:04:01.530> little<00:04:01.709> bit<00:04:01.949> and<00:04:02.099> use<00:04:02.189> this<00:04:02.340> as

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
to cheat a little bit and use this as

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.849 
to cheat a little bit and use this as
our<00:04:02.609> drive<00:04:02.970> source<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:04.139> you're<00:04:04.620> not<00:04:04.709> really

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
our drive source so you're not really

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.009 
our drive source so you're not really
accomplishing<00:04:05.219> anything<00:04:05.879> by<00:04:06.150> doing<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.599> but

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
accomplishing anything by doing this but

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.140 
accomplishing anything by doing this but
it<00:04:07.290> does<00:04:07.590> illustrate<00:04:07.949> the<00:04:08.489> principle<00:04:08.969> pretty

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
it does illustrate the principle pretty

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:22.270 
it does illustrate the principle pretty
well

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.290 

now<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.550> reverse<00:04:23.939> it<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:26.729> pain<00:04:26.939> goes<00:04:27.150> the

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
now if I reverse it the pain goes the

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:37.170 
now if I reverse it the pain goes the
opposite<00:04:27.689> direction

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.940 

now<00:04:38.180> if<00:04:38.360> we<00:04:38.510> recreate<00:04:38.930> the<00:04:39.110> current<00:04:39.440> by<00:04:39.560> adding

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
now if we recreate the current by adding

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.620 
now if we recreate the current by adding
a<00:04:40.040> drive<00:04:40.280> mechanism<00:04:40.970> that<00:04:41.120> spins<00:04:41.420> a<00:04:41.510> lot

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
a drive mechanism that spins a lot

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.760 
a drive mechanism that spins a lot
faster<00:04:42.050> than<00:04:42.170> what<00:04:42.320> I<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.470> do<00:04:42.650> by<00:04:42.830> hand<00:04:43.190> I

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
faster than what I can do by hand I

00:04:44.770 --> 00:05:00.430 
faster than what I can do by hand I
check<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:45.920> voltage<00:04:46.040> on<00:04:46.400> that

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.450 

so<00:05:01.440> you<00:05:01.530> can<00:05:01.650> see<00:05:01.800> that<00:05:01.949> that<00:05:02.069> works<00:05:02.190> pretty

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
so you can see that that works pretty

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:08.330 
so you can see that that works pretty
well<00:05:02.580> for<00:05:02.759> what<00:05:03.030> we're<00:05:03.180> doing<00:05:07.009> the<00:05:08.009> next<00:05:08.159> thing

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
well for what we're doing the next thing

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.170 
well for what we're doing the next thing
that<00:05:08.370> we're<00:05:08.580> going<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:08.729> do<00:05:08.819> is<00:05:08.909> we're<00:05:09.030> going<00:05:09.120> to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
that we're going to do is we're going to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.270 
that we're going to do is we're going to
hook<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.449> up<00:05:09.539> to<00:05:09.599> this<00:05:09.780> larger<00:05:10.319> motor<00:05:10.560> recycled

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
hook it up to this larger motor recycled

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.339 
hook it up to this larger motor recycled
from<00:05:11.370> a<00:05:11.520> pump<00:05:11.930> we're<00:05:12.930> going<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.110> hook<00:05:13.169> the

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
from a pump we're going to hook the

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.830 
from a pump we're going to hook the
leads<00:05:13.530> up<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.770> it<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.129> see<00:05:14.430> how<00:05:15.330> well<00:05:15.569> we<00:05:15.720> can

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
leads up to it and see how well we can

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.020 
leads up to it and see how well we can
do<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.110> just<00:05:16.169> by<00:05:16.440> hand<00:05:19.729> okay<00:05:20.729> it's<00:05:20.909> all

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
do this just by hand okay it's all

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:27.170 
do this just by hand okay it's all
hooked<00:05:21.270> up<00:05:21.389> and<00:05:21.629> ready<00:05:21.659> to<00:05:21.870> go<00:05:22.080> and<00:05:25.849> can<00:05:26.849> see<00:05:27.030> it

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
hooked up and ready to go and can see it

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.999 
hooked up and ready to go and can see it
just<00:05:27.389> by<00:05:27.479> me<00:05:27.659> simply<00:05:28.020> turning<00:05:28.440> it<00:05:30.979> does<00:05:31.979> a

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
just by me simply turning it does a

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.619 
just by me simply turning it does a
pretty<00:05:32.280> nice<00:05:32.490> job<00:05:32.729> and<00:05:33.000> I<00:05:33.030> must<00:05:33.240> say<00:05:33.360> that<00:05:33.389> this

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:33.629 
pretty nice job and I must say that this

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:35.629 
pretty nice job and I must say that this
motor<00:05:33.900> makes<00:05:34.169> it<00:05:34.319> much<00:05:34.590> harder<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:35.159> turn<00:05:35.400> this

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
motor makes it much harder to turn this

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.390 
motor makes it much harder to turn this
that<00:05:36.629> is<00:05:36.960> the<00:05:37.289> equivalent<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.860> what<00:05:38.069> a<00:05:38.099> load

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
that is the equivalent of what a load

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.089 
that is the equivalent of what a load
would<00:05:38.580> be<00:05:38.759> as<00:05:39.000> this<00:05:39.719> motors<00:05:40.110> accomplishing<00:05:41.009> a

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099 
would be as this motors accomplishing a

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.809 
would be as this motors accomplishing a
task<00:05:41.129> driving<00:05:42.000> this<00:05:42.180> it<00:05:43.020> creates<00:05:43.319> a<00:05:43.650> load<00:05:43.860> now

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
task driving this it creates a load now

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:46.640 
task driving this it creates a load now
I'm<00:05:45.000> going<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.300> simulate<00:05:45.599> what<00:05:46.080> a<00:05:46.110> short<00:05:46.469> would

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
I'm going to simulate what a short would

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.950 
I'm going to simulate what a short would
be<00:05:46.770> like<00:05:46.979> just<00:05:47.190> to<00:05:47.340> show<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:47.580> how<00:05:48.000> much<00:05:48.330> strain

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 
be like just to show you how much strain

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.600 
be like just to show you how much strain
it<00:05:49.139> can<00:05:49.289> put<00:05:49.530> on<00:05:49.710> whatever<00:05:50.159> you're<00:05:50.370> spinning

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
it can put on whatever you're spinning

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.969 
it can put on whatever you're spinning
your<00:05:50.849> motor<00:05:51.060> with<00:05:51.530> I'm<00:05:52.530> going<00:05:52.620> to<00:05:52.680> take<00:05:52.860> the

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
your motor with I'm going to take the

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.070 
your motor with I'm going to take the
two<00:05:53.129> leads<00:05:53.370> and<00:05:53.610> attach<00:05:53.849> them<00:05:54.030> together<00:05:54.150> and

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
two leads and attach them together and

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.330 
two leads and attach them together and
now<00:05:55.229> when<00:05:55.379> I<00:05:55.409> spin<00:05:55.770> this<00:05:56.449> this<00:05:57.449> becomes

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
now when I spin this this becomes

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:04.180 
now when I spin this this becomes
virtually<00:05:59.509> very<00:06:00.509> difficult<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:03.360> is<00:06:03.840> a

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
virtually very difficult that is a

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.430 
virtually very difficult that is a
maximum<00:06:05.190> load<00:06:05.370> right<00:06:05.669> there<00:06:05.880> so<00:06:06.180> that<00:06:06.419> is<00:06:07.229> why

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
maximum load right there so that is why

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.050 
maximum load right there so that is why
a<00:06:07.469> lot<00:06:07.680> of<00:06:07.710> people<00:06:08.099> who<00:06:08.250> question<00:06:09.029> whether

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
a lot of people who question whether

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.540 
a lot of people who question whether
something<00:06:09.659> can<00:06:09.779> carry<00:06:10.020> a<00:06:10.110> load<00:06:10.380> that<00:06:10.650> explains

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
something can carry a load that explains

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:18.800 
something can carry a load that explains
it<00:06:11.699> now<00:06:11.789> if<00:06:11.849> I<00:06:11.969> undo<00:06:12.300> these<00:06:17.599> spins<00:06:18.599> a<00:06:18.690> lot

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810 
it now if I undo these spins a lot

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.779 
it now if I undo these spins a lot
freely<00:06:19.199> it<00:06:19.349> stopped<00:06:19.949> the<00:06:20.130> second<00:06:20.460> these<00:06:20.580> touch

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
freely it stopped the second these touch

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:24.019 
freely it stopped the second these touch
together<00:06:21.150> move<00:06:21.419> them<00:06:21.509> a<00:06:21.599> hard<00:06:22.880> touch<00:06:23.880> them

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:24.029 
together move them a hard touch them

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:28.399 
together move them a hard touch them
together<00:06:24.150> and<00:06:24.620> it's<00:06:25.620> hard<00:06:25.860> again<00:06:27.289> the<00:06:28.289> other

00:06:28.399 --> 00:06:28.409 
together and it's hard again the other
