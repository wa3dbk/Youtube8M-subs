let's<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> see<00:00:18.210> this<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.050> an<00:00:19.140> MGB

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
let's take a look and see this is an MGB

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.029 
let's take a look and see this is an MGB
that<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.400> fact<00:00:20.460> my<00:00:20.939> son<00:00:21.000> owns<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.320> were<00:00:22.859> you

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
that my in fact my son owns and were you

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.519 
that my in fact my son owns and were you
not<00:00:23.279> able<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.699> get<00:00:23.910> into<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.359> trunk<00:00:24.630> it'd<00:00:25.320> be

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
not able to get into the trunk it'd be

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.290 
not able to get into the trunk it'd be
pretty<00:00:25.740> handy<00:00:26.220> because<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:27.119> some

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
pretty handy because there's some

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.720 
pretty handy because there's some
speakers<00:00:27.750> cut<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> here<00:00:28.980> with<00:00:29.160> these<00:00:29.310> giant

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
speakers cut in here with these giant

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.790 
speakers cut in here with these giant
holes<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.660> if<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.109> reach<00:00:31.380> through<00:00:31.679> and

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
holes so if you can reach through and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
holes so if you can reach through and
get<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.880> with<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.120> latch<00:00:33.510> assembly<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
get on with a latch assembly from the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.680 
get on with a latch assembly from the
inside<00:00:34.800> but<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.100> course<00:00:35.280> those<00:00:35.790> holes<00:00:36.120> are<00:00:36.360> our

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
inside but of course those holes are our

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
inside but of course those holes are our
'add<00:00:37.230> shouldn't<00:00:38.040> be<00:00:38.190> there<00:00:38.430> anyway

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.959 

normally<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.510> trunk<00:00:42.750> assault<00:00:43.170> all<00:00:43.730> locked<00:00:44.730> up

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
normally the trunk assault all locked up

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.060 
normally the trunk assault all locked up
so<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.690> there<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:46.020> problem<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.829> latch

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
so if there is a problem with this latch

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.490 
so if there is a problem with this latch
down<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.239> jammed<00:00:48.750> up<00:00:48.989> against<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
down here it is jammed up against the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.610 
down here it is jammed up against the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
of vice grips on my tool done down here

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.610 
of vice grips on my tool done down here
I<00:02:16.780> can<00:02:17.380> grab<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:17.860> and<00:02:18.130> pop<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.150> up<00:02:19.410> let's<00:02:20.410> see

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
I can grab this and pop it up let's see

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.670 
I can grab this and pop it up let's see
if<00:02:20.740> I<00:02:20.860> can<00:02:21.070> actually<00:02:21.280> do<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:21.850> huh<00:02:22.470> let's<00:02:23.470> go

if I can actually do this huh let's go

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
if I can actually do this huh let's go
ahead<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:23.980> close<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:30.570> let's<00:02:31.570> go<00:02:31.780> inside

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
ahead and close that and let's go inside

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.450 
ahead and close that and let's go inside
here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:34.060> see<00:02:34.270> if<00:02:34.360> this<00:02:34.480> actually<00:02:34.780> works<00:02:35.460> you

here and see if this actually works you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.520 
here and see if this actually works you
know<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.610> didn't<00:02:37.360> discover<00:02:37.780> this<00:02:38.020> technique

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
know I didn't discover this technique

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.690 
know I didn't discover this technique
myself<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:40.660> came<00:02:41.620> up<00:02:41.860> with<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.190> that's<00:02:42.400> going<00:02:42.610> to

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:40.820 

I<00:03:37.520> loaned<00:03:38.520> this<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.910> policeman<00:03:39.630> one<00:03:40.530> time

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
I loaned this to a policeman one time

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.130 
I loaned this to a policeman one time
who's<00:03:41.989> probably<00:03:42.989> stuck<00:03:43.849> stuck<00:03:44.849> closed<00:03:45.180> he

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
who's probably stuck stuck closed he

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.630 
who's probably stuck stuck closed he
said<00:03:46.410> he<00:03:46.500> had<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.680> work<00:03:46.920> on<00:03:47.130> him<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.370> an<00:03:47.459> hour

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
said he had to work on him for an hour

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.850 
said he had to work on him for an hour
and<00:03:47.940> finally<00:03:48.270> got<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.660> was<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.440> proud<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and finally got it was so proud of

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.559 
and finally got it was so proud of
himself<00:03:50.010> he<00:03:50.370> immediately<00:03:50.610> chucked<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> trunk

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 
himself he immediately chucked the trunk

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:53.390 
himself he immediately chucked the trunk
and<00:03:52.260> of<00:03:52.410> course<00:03:52.620> had<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:52.830> do<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.160> all<00:03:53.370> over

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
and of course had to do it all over

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:22.030 
and of course had to do it all over
again<00:03:53.750> then<00:03:54.750> he<00:03:54.900> allowed<00:03:54.989> he<00:03:55.290> been<00:03:55.500> drinking

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.940 

so<00:04:23.040> this<00:04:23.220> is<00:04:23.400> not<00:04:23.639> a<00:04:23.970> very<00:04:24.510> good<00:04:24.950> demonstration

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
so this is not a very good demonstration

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.120 
so this is not a very good demonstration
maybe<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.030> guys<00:04:27.240> should<00:04:27.300> watch<00:04:29.510> yes<00:04:30.919> yes<00:04:31.919> you

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130

you<00:04:43.630> know<00:04:44.630> some<00:04:44.960> Jam<00:04:48.010> take<00:04:49.010> a<00:04:49.040> look<00:04:49.310> at<00:04:49.430> this

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
you know some Jam take a look at this

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.470 
you know some Jam take a look at this

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
you know I should be down about here

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.730 
you know I should be down about here
because<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.480> was<00:04:53.600> up<00:04:53.750> here<00:04:53.960> before<00:04:53.990> I<00:04:54.380> should<00:04:54.650> be
