00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.990 

it's<00:01:07.120> quite<00:01:07.450> like<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> big<00:01:08.530> step<00:01:08.830> from<00:01:09.130> playing

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
it's quite like a big step from playing

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.830 
it's quite like a big step from playing
in<00:01:10.330> lower<00:01:11.320> divisions<00:01:11.890> but<00:01:12.250> when<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.120> first

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
in lower divisions but when I first

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.150 
in lower divisions but when I first
started<00:01:14.320> I<00:01:14.470> thought<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.770> was<00:01:14.890> quite<00:01:15.040> hard

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
started I thought it was quite hard

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.760 
started I thought it was quite hard
because<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:16.210> kids<00:01:16.690> were<00:01:16.810> quite<00:01:17.410> a<00:01:17.440> lot<00:01:17.620> better

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
because the kids were quite a lot better

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.810 
because the kids were quite a lot better
but<00:01:18.490> now<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:19.300> I've<00:01:19.560> been<00:01:20.560> playing<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
but now that I've been playing in the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.030 
but now that I've been playing in the
Champions<00:01:22.270> League<00:01:22.360> it's<00:01:23.140> helped<00:01:23.470> me<00:01:23.530> because

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
Champions League it's helped me because

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.160 
Champions League it's helped me because
I've<00:01:24.340> learned<00:01:24.670> different<00:01:25.390> skills

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.070 

like<00:01:31.170> learning<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.920> playing<00:01:32.370> with<00:01:33.090> harder

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
like learning and playing with harder

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.240 
like learning and playing with harder
people

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.220 

it's<00:01:39.910> good<00:01:40.150> because<00:01:40.360> each<00:01:40.690> coach<00:01:40.960> has

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
it's good because each coach has

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.120 
it's good because each coach has
something<00:01:41.620> to<00:01:41.770> offer<00:01:41.830> and<00:01:42.250> I<00:01:43.680> learned<00:01:44.680> quite<00:01:45.070> a

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
something to offer and I learned quite a

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.420 
something to offer and I learned quite a
lot<00:01:45.220> from<00:01:45.990> different<00:01:46.990> coaches<00:01:47.380> each<00:01:48.070> coach

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
lot from different coaches each coach

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.680 
lot from different coaches each coach
has<00:01:49.060> their<00:01:49.540> own<00:01:49.710> style<00:01:50.710> of<00:01:50.950> coaching

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.700 

I'm<00:01:56.200> just<00:01:56.710> try<00:01:57.130> your<00:01:57.280> best<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:58.080> people<00:01:59.080> keep
