00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.140
 my name is chiquinquirá ramírez let's go 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.670
 to proceed to prepare some little ears 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.270
 baked that are very typical here of 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.270
 the population 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.210
 now let's do the arepitas 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:48.980
 good and its ingredients are 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:53.269
 and baking butter curd cheese 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.730
 smoked panela serum the dough and a 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:01:00.280
 little bit of salt let's start doing 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.879
 the arepa we add the mass we add 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.879
 the butter 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:12.760
 we add a little bit of serum 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.790
 we add a little salt 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.010
 then we add a little bit of 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.880
 bicarbonate this is so that the 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:26.890
 planet I was a bit loose now you 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.860
 we add a piece of cheese this comes 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.710
 being smoked cheese that is prepared here 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.020
 the creole cheese that we say here see 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.900
 whether the fillings or the menus have 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.070
 so with 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.230
 a hand then we proceed to move the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.230
 mass to make the mixture 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.149
 well you feel that it is used a lot here 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.000
 dairy products even though they do not 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.289
 we have a large livestock but I think 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.390
 that in the past in all the houses of the 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.700
 I had a cow I cut out of my 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.289
 house a cow always that's why 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.259
 that you see that there is used a lot 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.230
 curd the smoked cheese and the whey 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.850
 nothing is lost 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:11.110
 until they are well 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.110
 All the ingredients 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.670
 that's a peeled corn cornmeal 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.630
 yellow corn I think of here 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.190
 population 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.560
 1 to prepare it grab it put it with 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:34.550
 a little bit of lime or ash peels it 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.210
 wash and leave it overnight 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:41.840
 so that it does not have the flavor of what 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:45.620
 it is added to remove the shell 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.980
 it is milled and you get the you get the 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.980
 dough 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.200
 that many years ago that people were 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.510
 like to read 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.310
 when visitors come, that's how you 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.310
 I say in time of San Juan 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.930
 San Juan times and when there is no 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.970
 binaries 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.740
 and prepare with the bracket and that 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.010
 now the prepared dough is ready 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:17.830
 mix the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.830
 the curd with a panela 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.620
 let's go a piece of curd 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:41.200
 now we grab a little bit that is not 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.200
 that we are not so thick 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.250
 and now we add we proceed to add 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.250
 the 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.599
 in the curd mixed with panela and 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.390
 Here is a list 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:05.400
 we learned to mom 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.400
 she learned it from mom 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:11.390
 here in the famous cockfights of 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.940
 the era was one of the sales that were going 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.190
 children to sell cheese arepas that 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.730
 if those missives also know it already 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.730
 prepared 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.480
 in the wood oven gives it a better flavor 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.480
 light softer 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.460
 well we are ready now for 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.460
 take them to the oven 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.480
 also good 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.420
 well these are the branches that I use 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.700
 to make the broom to get it out 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:14.110
 remove the flame when baked 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:17.820
 so they do not get watered then I put them 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.660
 inside the center of this stick 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:24.500
 after something like the witch is already 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.500
 list the scab 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.379
 that street there in that milestone that you have there 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.420
 it's ready and we took the breasts 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:43.290
 now we are going to 

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.290
 to put it 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.170
 cover it so that it does not come out on 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:01.440
 altar heat the very hot oven 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:06:01.440
 lasts 10 5 or 10 minutes 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:15.190
 well here we have lists and 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:17.090
 arepitas of baked cheese 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.660
 to eat 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.460
 I hope that my daughters are those of their 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.870
 offspring of those who follow so that 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.870
 do not miss the tradition
