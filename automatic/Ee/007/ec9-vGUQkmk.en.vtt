these<00:00:18.060> kind<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.359> debates<00:00:18.510> before<00:00:18.990> you've

these kind of debates before you've

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.450 
these kind of debates before you've
undoubtedly<00:00:19.380> heard<00:00:19.590> it<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.369> it's

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
undoubtedly heard it but I think it's

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.160 
undoubtedly heard it but I think it's
important<00:00:20.910> what<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.810> Electoral<00:00:22.140> College

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
important what the Electoral College

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.759 
important what the Electoral College
tends<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.850> make<00:00:24.539> majorities<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
tends to do is to make majorities that

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.470 
tends to do is to make majorities that
wouldn't<00:00:26.070> exist<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> popular<00:00:27.029> vote<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
wouldn't exist in the popular vote and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.900 
wouldn't exist in the popular vote and
to<00:00:27.990> amplify<00:00:28.189> majorities<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.220> would<00:00:29.609> be<00:00:29.699> very

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to amplify majorities that would be very

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290 
to amplify majorities that would be very
close<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.619> may<00:00:31.759> may<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.210> aware

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300

presidents have not but there have been
only<00:00:46.230> very<00:00:46.500> few<00:00:46.590> times<00:00:47.100> when<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> person<00:00:47.879> who

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
only very few times when the person who

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.639 
only very few times when the person who
didn't<00:00:48.300> get<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> plurality<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> popular

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
didn't get the plurality of the popular

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.560 
didn't get the plurality of the popular
vote<00:00:49.800> won<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> meantime<00:00:50.489> all<00:00:50.910> these<00:00:51.300> close

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
vote won in the meantime all these close

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.680 
vote won in the meantime all these close
elections<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.410> some<00:00:52.620> cases<00:00:52.800> nobody<00:00:53.280> did<00:00:53.690> but

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
elections in some cases nobody did but

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
elections in some cases nobody did but
people<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.199> of<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.739> person<00:00:56.129> is<00:00:56.250> somebody

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
people think of that person is somebody

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.910 
people think of that person is somebody
who<00:00:56.699> won<00:00:56.879> by<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> majority<00:00:57.449> as<00:00:57.750> he<00:00:57.960> did<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
who won by a majority as he did in the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.400 
who won by a majority as he did in the
electoral<00:00:59.309> college<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.570> think<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.140> helps

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
electoral college and I think that helps

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.250 
electoral college and I think that helps
the<00:01:01.530> president<00:01:01.980> govern<00:01:02.609> secondly<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
federal government people are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
federal government people are
pointy-headed<00:01:20.640> bureaucrats<00:01:21.330> who<00:01:21.570> don't<00:01:21.750> know

the first thing about anything in life
outside<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.299> beltway<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.930> share<00:01:25.439> all<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
outside the beltway I share all the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.429 
outside the beltway I share all the
prejudices<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:27.049> against<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> federal

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
prejudices of against the federal

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.050 
prejudices of against the federal
government<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.009> believe<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.549> preserving

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
government and I believe in preserving

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.630 
government and I believe in preserving
the<00:01:30.509> states<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:31.110> important<00:01:31.770> vital<00:01:32.220> function

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
the states as important vital function

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
the states as important vital function
but<00:01:33.060> functioning<00:01:33.540> parts<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> our<00:01:33.930> system<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
but functioning parts of our system and

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.460 
but functioning parts of our system and
I<00:01:34.920> think<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.400> anything<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.210> draws<00:01:37.020> public

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
I think that anything that draws public

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.130 
I think that anything that draws public
attention<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.369> states<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.030> valuable<00:01:39.960> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
attention to the states is valuable and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
attention to the states is valuable and
if<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.950> follow<00:01:41.189> presidential<00:01:41.909> politics<00:01:42.299> at

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
if you follow presidential politics at

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
if you follow presidential politics at
all<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.049> hear<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> lot<00:01:43.409> about<00:01:43.439> States<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.250> idea

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
all you hear a lot about States the idea

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.550 
all you hear a lot about States the idea
by<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> way<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.240> California<00:01:46.079> doesn't<00:01:46.259> count

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
by the way that California doesn't count

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.469 
by the way that California doesn't count
and<00:01:46.680> then<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.860> disenfranchise<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.880> suggest

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and then you disenfranchise I suggest

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.060

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
you do this go up to Senator Obama

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.310 
you do this go up to Senator Obama
someday<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.970> say<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> know<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:51.390> heard<00:01:51.720> John

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I'm thinking maybe we should just skip

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.249 
I'm thinking maybe we should just skip
the<00:01:57.180> election<00:01:57.540> and<00:01:57.689> we<00:01:57.750> won't<00:01:57.930> bother<00:01:58.079> to

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259

what we do think of that I don't think

he<00:02:01.290> would<00:02:01.409> go<00:02:01.560> along<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.100> similarly<00:02:02.700> if

you're from Texas and you make the same

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.319 
kind of a problem if and when it arises
because<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.750> electors<00:03:52.590> who<00:03:53.340> we<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:54.120> our

because the electors who we and our

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.780 
because the electors who we and our
fellow<00:03:54.569> Americans<00:03:55.049> will<00:03:55.230> choose<00:03:55.579> weaken<00:03:56.579> from

fellow Americans will choose weaken from

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.659 
fellow Americans will choose weaken from
next<00:03:57.060> Tuesday<00:03:57.480> our<00:03:58.379> people<00:03:58.859> precisely

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
next Tuesday our people precisely

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.740 
next Tuesday our people precisely
selected<00:04:00.510> because<00:04:00.930> they<00:04:01.379> are<00:04:01.530> loyal<00:04:02.239> to<00:04:03.239> let's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
selected because they are loyal to let's

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.800 
selected because they are loyal to let's
say<00:04:03.870> Obama<00:04:04.200> and<00:04:04.530> his<00:04:05.190> party<00:04:05.579> or<00:04:06.060> McCain<00:04:06.510> and

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
say Obama and his party or McCain and

say Obama and his party or McCain and
his<00:04:06.840> party<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.489> so<00:04:08.489> if<00:04:09.030> something<00:04:09.810> really

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
his party and so if something really

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.869 
his party and so if something really
needs<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.739> be<00:04:10.829> done<00:04:11.040> if<00:04:11.220> a<00:04:11.310> difficult

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
needs to be done if a difficult

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.289 
needs to be done if a difficult
political<00:04:12.060> judgment<00:04:12.780> needs<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.199> be<00:04:13.349> made

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
political judgment needs to be made

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.400 
political judgment needs to be made
those<00:04:15.299> are<00:04:15.480> people<00:04:15.720> we<00:04:15.840> don't<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.229> worry

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
those are people we don't have to worry

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.849 
those are people we don't have to worry
about<00:04:16.530> engaging<00:04:17.340> in<00:04:17.579> a<00:04:17.639> coup<00:04:17.849> d'etat<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:19.590> if

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
about engaging in a coup d'etat but if

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.800 
about engaging in a coup d'etat but if
it<00:04:20.039> really<00:04:20.310> is<00:04:20.549> important<00:04:21.060> that<00:04:21.150> this<00:04:21.450> person

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
it really is important that this person

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.600 
it really is important that this person
who<00:04:21.930> was<00:04:21.959> elected<00:04:22.380> not<00:04:22.560> be<00:04:22.770> president<00:04:23.280> they

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
who was elected not be president they

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.330 
who was elected not be president they
can<00:04:23.789> make<00:04:23.969> a<00:04:24.000> judgment<00:04:24.570> and<00:04:24.690> they<00:04:25.169> presumably

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
can make a judgment and they presumably

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.850 
can make a judgment and they presumably
as<00:04:26.400> a<00:04:26.460> party<00:04:27.120> we'll<00:04:27.720> select<00:04:27.930> somebody<00:04:28.350> it's

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
as a party we'll select somebody it's

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.980 
as a party we'll select somebody it's
the<00:04:29.010> it's<00:04:29.370> so<00:04:29.639> much<00:04:29.820> better<00:04:30.060> than<00:04:30.570> trying<00:04:30.840> to

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
the it's so much better than trying to

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.390 
the it's so much better than trying to
set<00:04:31.169> up<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.380> system<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.740> brings<00:04:32.100> in<00:04:32.310> the

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
set up a system that brings in the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.189 
set up a system that brings in the
courts<00:04:32.760> or<00:04:32.910> administrative<00:04:33.540> agencies<00:04:33.990> or

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
courts or administrative agencies or

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.500 
courts or administrative agencies or
anything<00:04:34.380> like<00:04:34.650> that<00:04:35.120> this<00:04:36.120> could<00:04:36.330> happen

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
anything like that this could happen

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.200 
anything like that this could happen
it's<00:04:36.930> not<00:04:37.110> particularly<00:04:37.710> likely<00:04:37.889> but<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:39.000> does

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
it's not particularly likely but it does

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.360 
it's not particularly likely but it does
happen<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.780> if<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.500> happened<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.070> case<00:04:41.220> of

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
happen and if it happened in the case of

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.510 
happen and if it happened in the case of
a<00:04:41.430> president<00:04:41.940> this<00:04:42.419> would<00:04:42.660> be<00:04:42.840> ideal<00:04:43.800> so<00:04:44.280> I

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
a president this would be ideal so I

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.219 
a president this would be ideal so I
think<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.240> there<00:04:45.479> are<00:04:45.510> a<00:04:45.720> lot<00:04:45.960> of<00:04:45.990> reasons

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
think that there are a lot of reasons

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.520 
think that there are a lot of reasons
why<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.650> Electoral<00:04:47.190> College<00:04:47.220> serves<00:04:47.820> us<00:04:48.120> well

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
why the Electoral College serves us well

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.040 
why the Electoral College serves us well
there's<00:04:49.530> no<00:04:49.800> I<00:04:50.100> think<00:04:50.490> serious<00:04:51.270> reason<00:04:51.660> to<00:04:51.930> get

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
there's no I think serious reason to get

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.400 
there's no I think serious reason to get

mathematical idea that idea is very very

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.510 
mathematical idea that idea is very very
powerful<00:04:58.260> for<00:04:58.770> many<00:04:58.919> people<00:04:59.250> if<00:04:59.400> it's

powerful for many people if it's

mind but if you're like me and you're

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.060 
mind but if you're like me and you're
more<00:05:05.700> pragmatic<00:05:06.360> and<00:05:06.540> you<00:05:06.780> think<00:05:07.070> something

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
more pragmatic and you think something

more pragmatic and you think something
that<00:05:08.310> just<00:05:08.610> makes<00:05:09.150> our<00:05:09.360> government<00:05:09.900> work<00:05:10.110> a

that just makes our government work a

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:11.960 
that just makes our government work a

little better then I think you should

little better then I think you should
