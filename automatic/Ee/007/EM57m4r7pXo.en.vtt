00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 if something has zinc equinox zinc is the 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.400
 number of deaths that appear at 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.130
 long series appearing in almost 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.139
 each chapter 1 or 2 deaths although 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.660
 some are as normal as others in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.030
 change stand flattened eaten 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 beaten, dismembered, trampled 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.270
 hit and in all the ways that you 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 can you imagine 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.920
 so many that you can even stand out 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.560
 some and that's why these are in my opinion 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.310
 the 10 best zinc deaths 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.380
 zinc equinox 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.240
 at number 10 we have the scene 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.460
 of eren when my house is kidnapped and 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.470
 He wants to go rescue this course 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.270
 it is less impressive death but I 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.100
 like to include it in this list for being 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.320
 the first two deaths that are made 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.120
 also the psychopath attitude and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.339
 cold despite being his first two 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.180
 deaths and being a kid make her be in 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.550
 this position 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.380
 at number 9 we have one of the 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.330
 more classic deaths throughout 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.890
 the classic and recurrent series in the 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.930
 most episodes but that 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.640
 a death is quite effective 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.830
 colorful and sure to be in the second 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.140
 season will be full of this kind of 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.360
 deaths although too censored for 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.270
 my taste and in many cases lacking in 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.130
 blood in this position we have the scene 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.500
 or the best scene where they eat a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.540
 soldier a partly funny situation 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.850
 since the titan is chewing what 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.240
 for a while and until it does not 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.619
 he nails the sword does not react in the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.690
 put number 8 we have the first 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.030
 death made by eren but in this 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.500
 occasion with their way of screaming the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.540
 moment in which my house is 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.580
 cornered and appears to help you is 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.950
 also of the most epic moments of the 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.350
 series since it is the first time in which 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.180
 appear in their new form of titan 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.280
 Death itself is also quite 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.750
 colorful accentuating the moment of the 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.400
 stomp to finish finishing it 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.350
 at number 7 I left 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.720
 following the thread of eren in his way of 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.300
 titan as the best death achieved or 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.610
 In other words, the best murder of 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.260
 eren in its titan form if we put together 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.210
 all the confrontations that have 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.640
 as titan this course takes the 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.140
 palm with the clear exception of the end of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.790
 the series with the fight against the titan 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.010
 female but given that in this 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.530
 confrontation does not die apparently 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.830
 nobody I can not include it here we have 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.870
 death by more epic bite 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.030
 at number 6 we have death 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.710
 of tomÃ¡s that if not for a detail not 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.410
 I would have put it in number 6 of this 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.120
 list if we remember this scene happens 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.980
 at the beginning of the series where after 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.620
 of the clashes and the selection 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.690
 they form this team team on the other hand 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.600
 that lasts quite a bit since then 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.490
 that dies tom dies the rest but the 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.020
 his in particular is the strangest that 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.820
 it is done to me because after being 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.160
 reached by a titan who jumps from a 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.600
 against him and epic 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.190
 star against a building to a 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 considerable speed as of 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.520
 considerable that speed as it is what 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.950
 enough to make a person bleed 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.990
 titan the weird thing is that in those shots not 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.709
 receives neither a scratch on the face nor on 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.470
 hands 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.300
 despite crashing completely against 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.980
 the building so some may say 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.080
 that will have caught him right in the hole 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.209
 of the window but it still would not explain 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.060
 Why titan lip bleeds the 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.870
 same height where you have your hand and how 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.610
 we see in the hand there is no wound 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.200
 and the number 5 position I wanted to put 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.209
 a death that undoubtedly many 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.400
 will find interesting more for the 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.440
 context actually that by the way of 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.569
 dying is not caused by any titan 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.360
 It is also because it is the only one in the whole 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:24.940
 series that receives this post suicide 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.560
 of the soldier of chapter 7 spoke of the 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.870
 episode where shortly after that 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.640
 appeared in the form of a titan on 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.129
 rest of the group decides to regroup 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.690
 inside a building within it is 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.970
 hides a group of soldiers not 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.620
 too much so brave one 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.650
 of them he decides to end his life 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.299
 rather than be eaten attentive to the 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.849
 little smile that she releases when 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.299
 there would be happy alarm for being the same 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:51.069
 the one that ends his life and not a titan 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.290
 in position number 4 we have death 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.720
 more fun and ridiculous at the same time 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.790
 totally unnecessary for the poor man who 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.040
 dies in an unworthy manner and what 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.810
 worse without intending it the titan even 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.670
 I bet many will remember the 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.349
 scene where an abnormal titan runs 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.109
 against a group of people trying 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.239
 go through a door the scene itself is 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.609
 remember for the clumsiness of the titan that goes 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.680
 crashing into the buildings but with 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.709
 so bad luck that in the middle of the street 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:20.109
 a person a group of people not only 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.880
 a person an unfortunate apparently 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.830
 They did not notify him in time and he stayed 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.870
 in the middle of the street pretty lost to 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.120
 tell the truth and that when the titan goes 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.280
 running it simply shoots it without 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.350
 find out nothing or death more 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.940
 unnecessary of the whole series but that if 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.590
 the repeat is in slow motion can 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.350
 be funny until the mode in the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.360
 that goes off 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.100
 in position number 3 we have death 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.140
 most remembered by all the fans of the 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.030
 nothing spectacular series something pretty 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.070
 used in the series as it is being bitten 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.440
 but you win the number 3 position by 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.780
 to be who I am, I mean the mother of 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.150
 eren 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.980
 many people who did not know manga 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.960
 as I was impressed so 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.370
 only with the first chapter in that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.440
 just with the first minutes of 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.110
 start it could feel all the epicidad 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.500
 that released the series a series that we 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.850
 would be surprising in every chapter in 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.740
 the number two place we have to 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.200
 move until the end of the season to 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.300
 the last episodes to find the 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.040
 better deaths this put in a 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.080
 principle had it cataloged as the 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.240
 number one but that after seeing it two 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.880
 sometimes I think there is another much better as 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.590
 we will see in the number one position here without 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.720
 However, we also do not fall short and 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.580
 we have a combo of three murders by 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.710
 part of the female titan to the peloton of the 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.810
 ebb and unexpected deaths like the 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.640
 most of this series and that part is 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.280
 the grace itself but that in this case 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:40.950
 They were even more unexpected many 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.180
 consider the death of Petra as the 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.979
 more tragic 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.900
 finally after these nine 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:48.940
 posts of better deaths we stay 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.070
 with the last one in number one 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.660
 we have another combo of deaths by part 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:55.270
 of the female titan but with a very large 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.310
 difference although these deaths are 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.930
 pretty flashy may they stay 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.539
 slightly behind the number 2 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.210
 with the great difference of the death of 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.280
 the third person in this scene 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.930
 moment when everyone would think 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.180
 that would end up dead, crashing it against 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.430
 the ground dies in the most original way 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.949
 and therefore to me it seems the best 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.129
 way throughout the series 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.989
 Centrifugal dies 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:20.339
 a scene that I had to pause for 

00:06:18.989 --> 00:06:22.050
 understand the position in which he had 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.569
 the soldier was left after giving him so many 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.249
 turns and that as a final detail after 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:29.809
 of all those laps goes flying 

00:06:28.249 --> 00:06:32.359
 at this time I would like me 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:35.599
 You said what you think is the best 

00:06:32.359 --> 00:06:37.699
 death of equine zinc coaching and nothing 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:41.049
 more family subscribe give the xxi you 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.049
 he liked it and see you
