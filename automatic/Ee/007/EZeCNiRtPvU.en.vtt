00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.470

 kindly give the expression of 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.949
 backlash is what we are looking for 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.379
 in second 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.840

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.619
 am president of the winemakers contest 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.429

 who will receive medals and 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:32.540
 in these conditions it's really the 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.130
 consumer taste that we seek to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.110
 find in the medals of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.110
 winemaker at the level of the second 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.530
 the criteria on which I took 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.210
 based for 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.850
 do not judge today already this is the 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.730
 terrible if you can agree 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.260
 java would be it's eye and 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.470
 the aromas that to clear the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.520
 cable 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.550
 I listened to all the wines we ask 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.750
 so I really liked it 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.400
 concretely this month but groulx was 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.400
 in adequacy with this world presented 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.040
 I followed training through 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.450
 motivated independent winemakers 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.430
 to participate in this contest his 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:21.010
 personal c 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.010
 ray the world for wine as an amateur 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.310
 fun and at the same time it's very 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.840
 seriously it's beautiful 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.840
 discovery of 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.060
 one that will stand out 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.770
 pure silver medal 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.150
 France is not awarded a medal when 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.900
 there is a beautiful harmony 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.140
 in guinea 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.090
 a nice balance 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.550
 it's not easy to judge but when 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 gets to repair quickly 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.210
 it was 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.310
 pretty obvious 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.659
 there are at least two points you have 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.280
 presented today that I resume 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.380
