00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi this is James at the turn at our

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.860 
hi this is James at the turn at our
studio<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.300> have<00:00:04.170> here<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.740> vox<00:00:04.980> VT<00:00:05.580> 40-plus<00:00:06.540> so

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
studio I have here the vox VT 40-plus so

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.310 
studio I have here the vox VT 40-plus so
this<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.259> vox<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.859> new<00:00:08.010> model<00:00:08.429> ii<00:00:08.519> now<00:00:09.110> so<00:00:10.110> some

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
this is vox is new model ii now so some

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.410 
this is vox is new model ii now so some
of<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.469> features<00:00:10.830> on<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.190> include<00:00:11.700> there

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
of the features on this include there

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.020 
of the features on this include there
are<00:00:12.679> 33<00:00:13.679> different<00:00:14.009> amps<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> they<00:00:14.610> model

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
are 33 different amps that they model

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.670 
are 33 different amps that they model
two<00:00:15.719> separate<00:00:16.670> channels<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.680> digital

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
two separate channels for digital

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.080 
two separate channels for digital
effects<00:00:20.130> so<00:00:20.279> they<00:00:20.400> got<00:00:20.550> everything<00:00:20.939> from

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
effects so they got everything from

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.590 
effects so they got everything from
distortion<00:00:21.900> not<00:00:22.380> dude<00:00:22.710> boosts<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.670> an

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
distortion not dude boosts and an

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.640 
distortion not dude boosts and an
acoustic<00:00:24.960> effects<00:00:25.590> simulator<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.500> know

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
acoustic effects simulator to you know

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.810 
acoustic effects simulator to you know
delays<00:00:29.269> flanders<00:00:30.269> phasers<00:00:31.009> pitch<00:00:32.009> shift<00:00:32.430> and

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
delays flanders phasers pitch shift and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.600 
delays flanders phasers pitch shift and
then<00:00:33.059> also<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.710> separate<00:00:35.100> one<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.399> their

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
then also on the separate one is their

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.530 
then also on the separate one is their
reverb<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.370> really<00:00:38.820> really<00:00:39.180> blend

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
reverb so you can really really blend

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.450 
reverb so you can really really blend
and<00:00:39.719> mix<00:00:39.809> any<00:00:40.110> sort<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.530> combination<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.280> want

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
and mix any sort of combination you want

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.979 
and mix any sort of combination you want
with<00:00:41.700> all<00:00:41.820> these<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.210> amps<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.870> have

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
with all these different amps that have

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.340 
with all these different amps that have
different<00:00:43.260> types<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.620> distortions<00:00:44.340> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
different types of distortions and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.060 
different types of distortions and
what-have-you<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:47.100> really<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.620> any

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
what-have-you to really get you know any

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.299 
what-have-you to really get you know any
any<00:00:50.640> kind<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.120> sound<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.719> could<00:00:52.710> possibly

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
any kind of sound you could possibly

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.959 
any kind of sound you could possibly
want<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:54.719> also<00:00:54.870> got<00:00:55.140> its<00:00:55.410> 3<00:00:56.070> band<00:00:56.280> eq<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
want it's also got its 3 band eq a

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.270 
want it's also got its 3 band eq a
volume<00:00:57.600> game<00:00:57.770> master<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.359> the<00:01:00.359> power<00:01:00.629> level

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
volume game master and the power level

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.469 
volume game master and the power level
that's<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.460> power<00:01:02.730> level<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:05.360> changes<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's a power level is changes the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.770 
that's a power level is changes the
wattage<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:08.070> outputs<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:08.820> even<00:01:09.689> though

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
wattage that it outputs so even though

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.560 
wattage that it outputs so even though
it's<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.049> 40<00:01:11.010> watt<00:01:11.159> amp<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.000> can<00:01:12.180> put<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> all

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it's a 40 watt amp you can put it all

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.080 
it's a 40 watt amp you can put it all
the<00:01:12.689> way<00:01:12.720> up<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> 60<00:01:13.530> watts<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.130> it'll<00:01:14.970> be

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the way up to 60 watts so it'll be

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.810 
the way up to 60 watts so it'll be
really<00:01:15.299> over<00:01:15.689> driven<00:01:15.990> there<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.549> turn

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
really over driven there or you can turn

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.039 
really over driven there or you can turn
it<00:01:17.880> down<00:01:18.170> to<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.400> i<00:01:20.670> don't<00:01:21.479> know<00:01:21.600> what

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
it down to you know i don't know what

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
it down to you know i don't know what
exactly<00:01:22.470> did<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> say<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> numbers<00:01:23.840> but<00:01:24.840> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
exactly did it say the numbers but you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.289 
exactly did it say the numbers but you
can<00:01:25.170> turn<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.710> down<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.610> even<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.180> very

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
can turn it way down so even at a very

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.380 
can turn it way down so even at a very
very<00:01:27.810> low<00:01:27.960> volume<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.670> still<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.119> really

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
very low volume you can still get really

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.179 
very low volume you can still get really
good<00:01:30.570> over<00:01:30.900> driven<00:01:31.170> sounds<00:01:31.650> but<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.860> can't

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
good over driven sounds but you can't

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.600 
good over driven sounds but you can't
get<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> normal<00:01:32.909> amp<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:34.100> normal<00:01:35.100> high

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
get on a normal amp a normal high

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.440 
get on a normal amp a normal high
wattage<00:01:35.850> amp

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
wattage amp

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.410 
wattage amp
if<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.110> turn<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.820> to<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> level<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.299> you

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
if you turn it down to a level that you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.950 
if you turn it down to a level that you
could<00:01:39.540> talk<00:01:39.810> over<00:01:39.840> say<00:01:40.560> then<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.759> would<00:01:41.960> lose

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
could talk over say then you would lose

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.460 
could talk over say then you would lose
all<00:01:43.470> your<00:01:44.040> gain<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:45.090> your<00:01:45.420> overdrive<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.350> the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
all your gain and your overdrive or the

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
all your gain and your overdrive or the
things<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.630> get<00:01:48.780> really

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
things like that so you can get really

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
things like that so you can get really
good<00:01:49.140> tone<00:01:49.409> at<00:01:49.680> any<00:01:49.950> volume<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.180> get

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
good tone at any volume and you can get

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.660 
good tone at any volume and you can get
all<00:01:51.780> sorts<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.380> different<00:01:52.680> sounds<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.520> also

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
all sorts of different sounds it also

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.090 
all sorts of different sounds it also
has<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> built-in<00:01:54.270> tuner<00:01:54.780> i<00:01:55.100> was<00:01:56.100> bypass<00:01:56.640> and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
has a built-in tuner i was bypass and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.500 
has a built-in tuner i was bypass and
and<00:01:59.360> i<00:02:00.770> guess

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
and i guess

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.820 
and i guess
ten<00:02:03.080> different<00:02:03.590> banks<00:02:04.190> that<00:02:04.430> you<00:02:04.550> can<00:02:05.830> can

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
ten different banks that you can can

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.330 
ten different banks that you can can
save<00:02:08.020> you<00:02:09.020> know<00:02:09.080> different<00:02:09.440> presets<00:02:09.920> in<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
save you know different presets in and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.690 
save you know different presets in and
whatnot<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:11.720> order<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:15.440> know<00:02:15.670> have<00:02:16.670> a

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
whatnot in order to you know have a

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.480 
whatnot in order to you know have a
custom<00:02:17.480> song<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.230> don't<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:18.860> fiddle

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
custom song so you don't have to fiddle

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.950 
custom song so you don't have to fiddle
around<00:02:19.670> with<00:02:19.910> all<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.270> switches<00:02:20.510> find

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
around with all the switches find

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.010 
around with all the switches find
exactly<00:02:21.560> what<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.890> want<00:02:21.920> every<00:02:22.370> time<00:02:23.020> so

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
exactly what you want every time so
