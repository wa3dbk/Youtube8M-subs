00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.600
Say it.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.599
Out loud.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.140
Vampire.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.800
Hey.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.140
What are you doing?

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.200
Nothing. Nothing.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.920
How was work?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.560
I thought I saw you watching TV.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.400
I thought you were working until 5.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.460
No one wants ice cream.
Winter is coming.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.760
What were you watching?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.140
I was watching the...

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.920
Isis...

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.420
Crisis.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.780
Oh.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.380
What season are you up to?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.620
No, I -

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.520
It's not what you think, I -

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.899
Come on, it cannot be that bad.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.080
I was watching porn!

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.980
Okay. One - It's not the 90s anymore.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.080
And two -You can barely handle the sex scenes in Game
of Thrones

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.480
So I know you're lying.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.480
Wait -

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.840
Oh my god.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.500
You like -

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.800
Channel surfing!

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.720
I like channel surfing.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.980
This is so much worse than porn.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.740
I'm living with a Twilight fan.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.260
I don't even like Edward.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.740
He's so possessive of Bella.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.560
That is such a Team Jacob thing to say.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Admit it.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.600
You love Twilight.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.100
No.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.610
Never.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.060
Sure, fang banger.

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.830
I will break you.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.480
[whispers] 
Twilight...

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.600
Twilight...Twilight...Twilight...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.500
No...

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.140
Twilight...Twilight...

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.780
What the hell?

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.820
It's just Edward, watching you sleep.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.460
Should be totally normal for a Twilight fan.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:56.520
I told you.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.120
I don't like Twilight.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.220
I still don't believe you.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.079
How long have you been there?

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:05.490
All I'm hearing is "Edward,
Edward, Edward. "

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:06.480
Ugh.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.550
Bite me.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.600
Exactly.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.859
Take him and get out.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.700
And then the lion fell in love with the lamb.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.920
[Doorbell rings]

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.080
[screams]

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.600
Alright.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.000
I admit it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.110
I like Twilight.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.580
I knew it!

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.780
So can Edward stop stalking me now?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.300
Edward can never stop stalking you.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600
Well, he's not hanging out with me anymore.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.460
He's your problem.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.000
This is so much worse than Twilight.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.840
[TV]
"You better hold on tight, spidermonkey."

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.740
[doorbell rings]

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.660
Shit.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.380
Hide it.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.370
Hide it all.
