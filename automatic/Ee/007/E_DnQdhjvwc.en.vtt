I've had this forever and it does last a

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.729 
I've had this forever and it does last a
long<00:00:53.739> time<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:55.690> gonna<00:00:55.870> generously<00:00:56.350> apply

toothbrush it kind of hard to put on

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.040 
toothbrush it kind of hard to put on
there<00:01:02.739> but<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:04.059> do<00:01:04.270> your<00:01:04.300> best

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
there but just do your best

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.230 
there but just do your best
and<00:01:05.770> depending<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.250> how<00:01:06.400> dry<00:01:06.640> your<00:01:06.790> lips<00:01:06.940> are

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
and depending on how dry your lips are

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.790 
and depending on how dry your lips are
you<00:01:07.390> may<00:01:07.540> need<00:01:07.690> to<00:01:07.840> do<00:01:07.960> this<00:01:08.140> step<00:01:08.380> more<00:01:08.650> than

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
you may need to do this step more than

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.340 
you may need to do this step more than
once

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
once

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.350 
once
where<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:11.440> wet<00:01:11.560> my<00:01:11.710> toothbrush<00:01:12.130> there<00:01:12.400> and

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
where you wet my toothbrush there and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.050 
where you wet my toothbrush there and
then<00:01:13.540> scrub<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:15.010> then<00:01:15.190> you'll<00:01:15.460> feel<00:01:15.700> across

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
then scrub but then you'll feel across

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.960 
then scrub but then you'll feel across
your<00:01:16.360> lips<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.740> you<00:01:17.890> feel<00:01:18.130> any<00:01:18.460> more<00:01:18.700> like

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
your lips and if you feel any more like

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.200 
your lips and if you feel any more like
dry<00:01:19.300> dead<00:01:19.780> hard<00:01:20.140> skin<00:01:20.530> then<00:01:21.040> repeat<00:01:21.670> that<00:01:21.820> step

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
dry dead hard skin then repeat that step

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.359 
dry dead hard skin then repeat that step
another<00:01:23.140> trick<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.680> make<00:01:23.830> sure<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.070> you

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 
another trick is to make sure that you

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:27.780 
another trick is to make sure that you
scrub<00:01:24.720> circular<00:01:25.720> motions<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.100> scrub<00:01:27.580> all

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
scrub circular motions so I scrub all

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.359 
scrub circular motions so I scrub all
across<00:01:28.149> like<00:01:28.720> this<00:01:28.960> way<00:01:29.170> and<00:01:29.440> then<00:01:30.040> come<00:01:30.340> back

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
across like this way and then come back

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.749 
across like this way and then come back
to<00:01:31.060> get<00:01:31.750> any<00:01:31.960> extra<00:01:32.290> I'm<00:01:33.130> going<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.460> rinse<00:01:33.640> my

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
to get any extra I'm going to rinse my

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.160 
to get any extra I'm going to rinse my
lips

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
lips

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
lips

so<00:01:42.190> what<00:01:42.490> that<00:01:42.520> does<00:01:42.730> is<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.720> um<00:01:44.470> just<00:01:45.070> to

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
so what that does is it um just to

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.430 
so what that does is it um just to
things<00:01:45.460> don't<00:01:45.760> exfoliate<00:01:46.000> your<00:01:46.540> lips<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:47.260> now

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
things don't exfoliate your lips so now

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.590 
things don't exfoliate your lips so now
my<00:01:47.680> lips<00:01:47.890> feel<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:48.340> smooth<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.240> they<00:01:49.420> don't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
my lips feel so smooth and they don't

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.090 
my lips feel so smooth and they don't
have<00:01:49.720> any<00:01:49.900> chapstick<00:01:50.350> or<00:01:50.470> anything<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.920> them

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
have any chapstick or anything on them

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.520 
have any chapstick or anything on them
and<00:01:51.340> they're<00:01:52.300> smooth<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:52.990> touch<00:01:53.140> like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
and they're smooth to the touch like

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.550 
and they're smooth to the touch like
it's<00:01:53.950> amazing<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:55.300> what<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.660> also<00:01:55.840> does<00:01:56.230> is

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
it's amazing and what it also does is

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.800 
it's amazing and what it also does is
because<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.730> stimulating<00:01:58.000> your<00:01:58.570> lips

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
because you're stimulating your lips

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.240 
because you're stimulating your lips
like<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.260> over<00:01:59.620> and<00:01:59.740> over<00:01:59.860> and<00:01:59.950> over<00:02:00.040> again

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
like that over and over and over again

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.520 
like that over and over and over again
it's<00:02:00.910> bringing<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.390> lot<00:02:01.570> of<00:02:01.600> blood<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.140> your<00:02:02.320> lip

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
it's bringing a lot of blood to your lip

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's bringing a lot of blood to your lip
and<00:02:02.680> it<00:02:03.640> starts<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.450> plump<00:02:04.780> so<00:02:05.370> now<00:02:06.370> my<00:02:06.730> lips

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
and it starts to plump so now my lips

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.290 
and it starts to plump so now my lips
are<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.150> little<00:02:07.210> bit<00:02:07.720> fuller<00:02:07.960> so<00:02:08.560> if<00:02:08.710> you<00:02:08.890> have

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
are a little bit fuller so if you have

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.600 
are a little bit fuller so if you have
thin<00:02:10.300> lips<00:02:10.600> then<00:02:11.290> what<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.980> can<00:02:12.130> do<00:02:12.280> is<00:02:12.400> just

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
thin lips then what you can do is just

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.400 
thin lips then what you can do is just
exfoliate<00:02:13.300> like<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.690> or<00:02:13.900> maybe<00:02:14.200> not

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
exfoliate like that or maybe not

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.740 
exfoliate like that or maybe not
necessarily<00:02:14.620> with<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.400> lip<00:02:15.580> polish<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.510> just

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
necessarily with the lip polish but just

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.690 
necessarily with the lip polish but just
take<00:02:16.960> your<00:02:17.200> lip<00:02:17.680> brush<00:02:17.950> all<00:02:18.280> right<00:02:18.460> here<00:02:18.670> a
