in-depth yeah pc game build and in this
episode<00:00:08.160> we<00:00:08.790> will<00:00:08.940> be<00:00:09.150> installing<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:10.139> ram

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
episode we will be installing the ram

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.820 
episode we will be installing the ram
modules<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.349> 16<00:00:14.340> gigabytes<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
modules and I have 16 gigabytes of

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.630 
modules and I have 16 gigabytes of
corsair<00:00:16.830> dominator<00:00:18.560> RAM<00:00:19.560> modules<00:00:19.800> for

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
corsair dominator RAM modules for

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.950 
corsair dominator RAM modules for
gigabyte<00:00:21.270> each<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:23.240> these<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.300> running<00:00:24.660> us

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
gigabyte each and these are running us

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.220 
gigabyte each and these are running us
at<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> stopped<00:00:25.769> clock<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.869> 1333<00:00:27.869> hundred

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
at a stopped clock of 1333 hundred

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.080 
at a stopped clock of 1333 hundred
megahertz<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:31.250> let's<00:00:32.250> get<00:00:32.550> started<00:00:33.030> with

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
megahertz and let's get started with

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.780 
megahertz and let's get started with
installation<00:00:33.350> this<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.559> probably<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
installation this will probably be the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.880 
installation this will probably be the
easiest<00:00:36.120> thing<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:37.020> install<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.680> your

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
easiest thing to install on your

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:48.200 
easiest thing to install on your
computer<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.820> top<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.000> my

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
computer so here we are on top of my

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.569 
computer so here we are on top of my
computer<00:00:48.719> again<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.890> will<00:00:50.190> show<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.430> how

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
computer again and I will show you how

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.040 
computer again and I will show you how
to<00:00:50.700> install<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.239> dim<00:00:52.140> modules<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.780> this<00:00:54.780> is

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
to install the dim modules and this is

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.910 
to install the dim modules and this is
random<00:00:55.739> access<00:00:56.129> memory<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.079> which<00:00:58.079> connects

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
random access memory and which connects

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.880 
random access memory and which connects
next<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.280> your<00:00:59.399> CPU<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> your

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
next to your CPU and it does all of your

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600 
next to your CPU and it does all of your
tasks<00:01:02.160> tasks<00:01:03.409> that<00:01:04.409> happen<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> screen<00:01:05.369> of

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
tasks tasks that happen on the screen of

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.120 
tasks tasks that happen on the screen of
your<00:01:05.670> computer<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:09.320> let's<00:01:10.320> just<00:01:10.470> drop<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
your computer and let's just drop that

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.609 
your computer and let's just drop that
out<00:01:11.520> without<00:01:12.680> forcing<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
out without forcing it and this is the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.940 
out without forcing it and this is the
ram<00:01:16.830> module<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.720> huge<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.439> it<00:01:19.740> has<00:01:19.920> a

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
ram module it is huge and it has a

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.880 
ram module it is huge and it has a
really<00:01:20.460> big<00:01:20.610> heat<00:01:21.180> sink<00:01:21.290> yours<00:01:22.290> might<00:01:22.619> meet

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
really big heat sink yours might meet

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.510 
really big heat sink yours might meet
yours<00:01:23.369> might<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.700> considerably<00:01:24.479> smaller<00:01:25.520> but

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
yours might be considerably smaller but

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.100 
yours might be considerably smaller but
since<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:28.970> four<00:01:29.970> modules<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.810> will<00:01:30.990> be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
since I have four modules and I will be

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.560 
since I have four modules and I will be
covering<00:01:31.350> all<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.799> these<00:01:32.220> slots<00:01:32.579> doesn't

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
covering all of these slots doesn't

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
covering all of these slots doesn't
matter<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> put<00:01:34.320> these<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.820> have

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
matter where I put these but if you have

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.270 
matter where I put these but if you have
let's<00:01:36.270> say<00:01:36.479> two<00:01:36.540> modules<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.920> would<00:01:38.040> put

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
let's say two modules and you would put

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.960 
let's say two modules and you would put
like<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:41.729> fill

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
like one on the right one you would fill

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.670 
like one on the right one you would fill
both<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> red<00:01:42.630> spots<00:01:42.960> or<00:01:43.229> both<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
both of the red spots or both of the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.830 
both of the red spots or both of the
black<00:01:43.950> spots<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> black<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.659> red

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
black spots but not a black and a red

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.370 
black spots but not a black and a red
spot<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.700> some<00:01:47.700> people<00:01:47.880> like<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.180> put<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.750> red

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
spot and some people like to put a red

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.670 
spot and some people like to put a red
and<00:01:49.530> red<00:01:50.149> or<00:01:51.149> depending<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.930> color<00:01:52.320> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and red or depending on your color but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.249 
and red or depending on your color but
anyways<00:01:53.430> further<00:01:53.820> away<00:01:54.060> from<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.689> CPU

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
anyways further away from your CPU

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.679 
anyways further away from your CPU
because<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.799> leaves<00:01:56.159> more<00:01:56.549> space<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
because that leaves more space for the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.249 
because that leaves more space for the
cpu<00:01:58.140> cooler<00:01:58.439> and<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.890> module<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.259> installed

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
cpu cooler and this module is installed

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
cpu cooler and this module is installed
this<00:02:04.409> way<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.950> need<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> check<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.579> pins<00:02:05.790> this

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this way you need to check the pins this

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.529 
this way you need to check the pins this
is<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.360> shorter<00:02:07.229> line<00:02:07.469> as<00:02:08.160> it

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
is the shorter line as it

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.959 
is the shorter line as it
here<00:02:08.869> and<00:02:09.079> just<00:02:09.950> check<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.489> those<00:02:10.729> match

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:10.969 
here and just check that those match

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.020 
here and just check that those match
then<00:02:11.719> you<00:02:11.900> open<00:02:12.290> this<00:02:12.439> pin<00:02:12.709> here<00:02:12.739> and<00:02:13.310> this<00:02:13.969> is

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
then you open this pin here and this is

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.509 
then you open this pin here and this is
actually<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> special<00:02:15.049> motherboard<00:02:15.859> because

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
actually a special motherboard because

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.410 
actually a special motherboard because
you<00:02:17.209> don't<00:02:17.390> push<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.560> dim<00:02:19.430> module<00:02:19.909> like

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you don't push down the dim module like

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.080 
you don't push down the dim module like
you<00:02:20.569> would<00:02:20.719> do<00:02:20.870> on<00:02:21.049> other<00:02:21.260> motherboards<00:02:21.620> and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you would do on other motherboards and

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.390 
you would do on other motherboards and
which<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.329> identical<00:02:24.109> sides<00:02:24.379> for<00:02:24.859> these

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
which have identical sides for these

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.729 
which have identical sides for these
holders<00:02:25.879> and<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.930> would<00:02:27.079> just<00:02:27.200> push<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.620> down

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
holders and you would just push it down

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.360 
holders and you would just push it down
but<00:02:28.099> on<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.459> one<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.120> actually<00:02:29.299> slide<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.170> n

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
but on this one you actually slide it n

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.270 
but on this one you actually slide it n
which<00:02:31.370> i<00:02:31.579> think<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:32.030> bad<00:02:32.500> because<00:02:33.500> that

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
which i think is bad because that

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.379 
which i think is bad because that
actually<00:02:34.760> forces<00:02:35.689> these<00:02:36.790> plates<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.269> be

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
actually forces these plates to be

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.559 
actually forces these plates to be
slighted<00:02:38.689> in<00:02:38.870> might<00:02:39.650> cause<00:02:40.030> damage<00:02:41.030> well<00:02:41.359> it's

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
slighted in might cause damage well it's

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.259 
slighted in might cause damage well it's
not<00:02:41.720> going<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.959> cause<00:02:42.109> any<00:02:42.409> damage<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.269> still

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
not going to cause any damage but still

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.509 
not going to cause any damage but still
not<00:02:44.689> something<00:02:45.290> that<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.620> find<00:02:46.389> that<00:02:47.389> enjoyable

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
not something that I find that enjoyable

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:55.110 
not something that I find that enjoyable
and<00:02:50.409> that's<00:02:51.409> why<00:02:51.799> I<00:02:51.829> don't<00:02:52.159> like<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.639> asus

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
and that's why I don't like the asus

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.879 
and that's why I don't like the asus

motherboard sliding because it could
potentially<00:02:58.189> harm<00:02:58.849> if<00:02:59.329> you're<00:02:59.480> going<00:02:59.569> to<00:02:59.659> swap

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
potentially harm if you're going to swap

out<00:03:00.079> DDR<00:03:00.560> modules<00:03:01.209> really<00:03:02.209> often<00:03:02.629> it's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
out DDR modules really often it's

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.690 
out DDR modules really often it's
definitely<00:03:03.680> not<00:03:03.829> going<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:04.129> be<00:03:04.189> a<00:03:04.250> good<00:03:04.459> thing

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700

for<00:03:06.549> your<00:03:07.549> motherboard<00:03:08.510> or<00:03:08.689> for<00:03:09.409> your<00:03:09.560> modules

for your motherboard or for your modules

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.680 
for your motherboard or for your modules
and<00:03:10.519> then<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.629> repeat<00:03:11.780> this<00:03:12.200> that<00:03:12.500> for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
and then you just repeat this that for

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:27.039 
and then you just repeat this that for
every<00:03:14.690> single<00:03:15.079> one<00:03:15.199> of<00:03:15.229> the<00:03:17.019> modules<00:03:26.049> just

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
every single one of the modules just

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.330 
every single one of the modules just
make<00:03:27.229> sure<00:03:27.260> they're<00:03:27.769> secured<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.489> I<00:03:30.340> actually

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
make sure they're secured in I actually

make sure they're secured in I actually
when<00:03:31.760> I<00:03:31.790> was<00:03:31.970> building<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.449> computer<00:03:32.659> for

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
when I was building a computer for

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.379 
when I was building a computer for
someone<00:03:33.379> this<00:03:34.159> was<00:03:34.340> completely<00:03:34.790> new<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.359> me

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
someone this was completely new to me

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.890 
someone this was completely new to me
and<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.590> wasn't<00:03:36.829> plugged<00:03:37.129> in<00:03:37.400> correctly<00:03:37.639> and<00:03:38.209> I

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and it wasn't plugged in correctly and I

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.439 
and it wasn't plugged in correctly and I
spend<00:03:39.199> half<00:03:39.709> an<00:03:39.979> hour<00:03:40.159> trying<00:03:40.699> to<00:03:40.760> fix<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.299> see

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
spend half an hour trying to fix and see

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.719 
spend half an hour trying to fix and see
what's<00:03:41.720> wrong<00:03:41.930> with<00:03:42.139> my<00:03:42.260> computer<00:03:42.370> why<00:03:43.370> isn't

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:43.729 
what's wrong with my computer why isn't

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:46.319 
what's wrong with my computer why isn't
it<00:03:43.819> working<00:03:43.879> why<00:03:44.720> can<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.019> get<00:03:45.260> it<00:03:45.409> for<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> fan

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
it working why can I get it for a fan

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.659 
it working why can I get it for a fan
well<00:03:47.349> finally<00:03:48.349> understood<00:03:49.040> it<00:03:49.190> was<00:03:49.310> because

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:49.669 
well finally understood it was because

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:53.890 
well finally understood it was because
of<00:03:49.699> the<00:03:50.030> really<00:03:50.720> weird<00:03:50.900> way<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:52.430> push<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.000> den

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
there you have a third one and then i

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
overclocking you're probably going to be

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.969 
overclocking you're probably going to be
over<00:04:42.090> vaulting<00:04:42.690> as<00:04:42.810> well<00:04:42.990> but<00:04:43.500> then<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.800> know

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
over vaulting as well but then you know

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:50.870 
over vaulting as well but then you know
what<00:04:44.190> you're<00:04:44.370> doing<00:04:46.760> most<00:04:47.760> likely<00:04:49.880> okay

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
what you're doing most likely okay

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.960 
what you're doing most likely okay
they're<00:04:51.090> all<00:04:51.720> of<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.200> modules<00:04:52.680> are<00:04:53.280> in<00:04:53.639> place
