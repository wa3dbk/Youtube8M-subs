00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 It is very clear to me that I am very 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.790
 Well played since I was only 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.679
 not cologne naive attacks from hamburg 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 but by the technical error of 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.259
 Model is in the ball acceptance 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.790
 you can see how important the first one is 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.619
 contact is what he did before at costa 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.480
 have seen now at modesto the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.330
 stumbles on vacation would the ball and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.769
 as a defender, what do you want to do? 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.810
 I'm not in the running duel for me 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.820
 Foul because I think the model is too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.869
 If there was no one would have fallen 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.450
 what would you say to your 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.920
 neighbor four ranks behind you because the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.870
 now, for the most part, I would 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 I would agree 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.110
 for me it was also out of opposition 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.050
 out and even with a television picture 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.719
 very questionable eleven meters 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.090
 I said in the stadium itself 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.680
 gave the discussion about the red 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.379
 card i do not understand because of that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 then only in the form of this forced last 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.949
 man there must get to the red card 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.410
 Unfortunately God's son is ours 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.010
 double punishment but there is to 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.350
 penalty 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.700
 the first contact was not ideal and 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.250
 then there is a little contact but 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.900
 if the card for the eleven meter then 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.220
 that's all very hard 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.220
 It is not that much harder now 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.380
 the model is not one now 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.440
 I would like to play at the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.870
 let me tell you the situation immediately 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.580
 Of course, everyone always wants it 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.150
 There was a contact we have 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.250
 seen 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.960
 unfortunately the elfmeter is a joke 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.430
 most modern steps on the ball 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.700
 technical errors and filters 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.710
 So that can happen that you like there 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.440
 Does it have perception disorders than 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.360
 umpire so i think that's it 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.090
 the official diction to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.770
 umpire errors do what the 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.570
 Things to do in the city â€‹â€‹discuss what you have 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.370
 I am surprised that the old team 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.100
 did not connect okay were mistakes 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:54.710
 and b is the former umpire 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.300
 now dedicate yourself as an expert 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.470
 Also do not say that is a clear one 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.630
 mistake was a bit 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.090
 settle down and so for me it is whole 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.979
 clear misjudgment 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.690
 and all the more bitter that it is far more influential 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.130
 yes the call had gone over anyway 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.310
 his 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.690
 maybe that would be mine too 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.570
 know exactly what was 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.830
 that's for sure as fast as that 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.780
 recognize the audience but that I had 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.720
 for nonsense me so no one gives no 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.500
 chinese results the team can now 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:30.510
 hand back 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:32.010
 because I contradicted that I am 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.280
 very curious what the dfb will do 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.260
 There are more games that lock a game 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.730
 lock gives because it is wrong as 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.760
 repeat offender not a gay man 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.720
 or if there is said nothing 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.900
 more mistakes seem that will probably 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.840
 not happen because something had whole 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.769
 already approved a game lock 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:56.760
 there is no decision is a 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.560
 play differently crisis not regulated what 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.360
 I do not quite understand the aytekin 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.410
 had then seen the pictures why 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.720
 he does not just stand there and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.580
 says human I've seen wrong 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.010
 the experts were all collectors 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 are louder than anyone in unison say 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.280
 a clear eleven meters 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.500
 the only cream is, however 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.730
 none are again journalists and 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.260
 people have to do with it so the 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.660
 player and responsible but 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.459
 otherwise clearly say eleven meters without 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.410
 if and but there is no discussion 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.350
 but she shoots it really different 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.860
 Evaluate things differently than risk 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.330
 judgment 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.860
 We judge a course 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.750
 bit out of our own game 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.640
 history out that worthy 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.050
 would be completely different anyway 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.200
 As a referee, you often decide 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.230
 enough in the case so everyone say 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.490
 agreed in unison 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.290
 let's just say what has said why 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.060
 if aytekin anyway in front of the camera 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.870
 he does not say then I have me 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.000
 erred convinced that is right there 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.830
 So he had to at least for 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.020
 accept him 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.370
 So the fourth official sit 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.590
 yes after the game in the cabin comes 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.150
 immediately the referee observer the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.070
 the television pictures are sitting in the stands 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.990
 Looks like we'll do it immediately 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:11.050
 play debriefing and discuss 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.370
 critical scenes with the result 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.560
 from everyone is then cabin 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.170
 It's just as correct as setting 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.850
 So you know the new role of 

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.260
 lewis holtby is not very clear how 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.000
 Everyone has seen in the cabin 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.820
 hsv-mediendirektor said there was 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:29.050
 no referee such yet 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.290
 anyone else that left entrance 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.220
 is the hsv cabin right does not point 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.220
 finished 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.759
 if I follow the actual 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.759
 run quietly
