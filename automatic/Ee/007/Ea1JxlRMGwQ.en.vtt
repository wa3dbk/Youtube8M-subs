it could be izuna I guess that's fine
with<00:02:53.250> me<00:02:53.280> as<00:02:53.640> long<00:02:53.700> as<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.630> was<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:55.110> actually

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
with me as long as it was it's actually

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.920 
with me as long as it was it's actually
like<00:02:55.860> toby<00:02:56.280> is<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.400> person<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.150> mudarra<00:02:57.810> I

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
like toby is a person and not mudarra I

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.420 
like toby is a person and not mudarra I
don't<00:02:58.110> want<00:02:58.230> him<00:02:58.319> to<00:02:58.349> be<00:02:58.500> mudarra<00:02:58.890> at<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.190> I

don't want him to be mudarra at all I

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430 
don't want him to be mudarra at all I
think<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.330> if<00:03:00.450> he's<00:03:00.569> mudarra<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.230> just

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
think that if he's mudarra that just

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.320 
think that if he's mudarra that just
kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.739> is<00:03:01.920> stupid<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:02.940> just<00:03:03.120> kind<00:03:03.269> of

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
kind of is stupid that just kind of

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.120 
kind of is stupid that just kind of
doesn't<00:03:03.510> make<00:03:03.750> sense<00:03:04.019> to<00:03:04.260> me<00:03:04.290> hardly<00:03:04.799> at<00:03:04.980> all

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
doesn't make sense to me hardly at all

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.820 
doesn't make sense to me hardly at all
so<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:07.049> know<00:03:07.140> that's<00:03:07.290> why<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.470> want<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:07.680> see<00:03:07.769> as
