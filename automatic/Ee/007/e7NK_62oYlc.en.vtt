 so that the cartridges that the patient 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.359
 he's waiting for us 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.919

 ashton play rock sacks 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.479
 for practical reasons before 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.389
 2 for now, be there 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.900
 once done that's why after disconnecting so that the island a problem 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.719
 The correct one 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:04.719
 now if our next step 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.479
 Fill monsters with ink types 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.489
 with our fifth in the best brand 

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:17.079
 that the Pope the network 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.789
 olive 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.739
 Ana frames that start out for whims 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.599
 the quarry almost always well at the same level hopkins 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.309
 how does it begin to beat oliver 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.620
 the tas so that there is no problem that they get stuck or something like that we are going to 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.659
 cut back a little back let yourself ask for it 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.079
 I remind you that this has to be covered 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.079
 once our but not 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.639
 our position is to say 70 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:51.639
 with your pp recharge ap 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 Let's face our cartridge in this way 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.209
 and I hope we go to rector loustau syringes 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.729
 and wait for the inks 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:13.029
 so that there is no impunity for an air model in our cartridges, either with the 

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:13.969
 tricolor 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:17.449
 it happened in black once the pri done that there is nothing 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:18.759
 Bravo 

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:20.859
 small air spaces 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.280
 let's proceed furthermore interpreted your cartridges the printer 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.870
 quito 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 ap in this way 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 3 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:40.039
 3 here as a colist 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.629
 to the current p 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.490
 ap 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:52.599
 for 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.770
 josÃ© a as 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:58.129
 app 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.129
 for the current 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.740
 how can you see the progress 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.620
 so that our cartridges 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.020
 completely 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.419
 apart 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:12.809
 friend as last room 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:18.729
 I remind you that this should not have because you are already since the rector 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.659
 the network is completely 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.839
 so that there is no problem that spaces are for our flags 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.169
 what we are going to do here wait for the farm with direct 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.789
 short the pretext of matters 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:39.719
 what awaits 

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.930
 He expressed that the idea in this way 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.039
 but equally 15 because there's no problem 

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.879
 or else the way it reverses 

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:52.129
 to explain the quarry circulate correctly 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.930
 Bogota 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.279
 unfortunately, example 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.279
 so you can see that at the time of the vine 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:07.610
 as one of the eights run freely 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.900
 we do not believe by pink again understand 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.900
 barak what to see about what to talk about 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:18.759
 percent 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.169
 we have to give our flags space so that I can run 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.879
 freely 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.879
 acp 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:31.369
 by that time and the current 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:36.039
 As I remember being here by the way 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.069
 We can treat it in this way 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:42.629
 I competed that could happen 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.990
 the way they claim free and free another way 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:56.319
 these serbia 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:58.569
 our steps to 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:02.309
 the systematic and continuous for more p 13 44 h 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.039
 but let's not even help this little manual 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.639
 these efforts a paragraph next purchases zitÃ¡cuaro with the other thing
