just<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:59.040> question<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.399> who<00:01:59.520> executes<00:01:59.939> better

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
just a question of who executes better

just a question of who executes better
and<00:02:00.479> then<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> decide<00:02:00.990> why<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:01.530> went<00:02:01.619> play<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and then you decide why we went play it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.730 
and then you decide why we went play it
harder<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> last<00:02:02.729> games<00:02:03.200> Miami<00:02:04.200> did<00:02:04.439> every

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.270 
writer has ever said now if you think
when<00:02:12.720> Kevin<00:02:12.900> Durant<00:02:13.290> walked<00:02:13.530> off<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.890> court

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
when Kevin Durant walked off the court

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.699 
when Kevin Durant walked off the court
he<00:02:14.459> thought<00:02:14.610> yeah<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.510> didn't<00:02:15.930> play<00:02:16.050> quite<00:02:16.319> hard

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
he thought yeah I didn't play quite hard

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.559 
he thought yeah I didn't play quite hard
enough<00:02:16.980> right<00:02:17.310> now<00:02:17.489> you<00:02:17.730> can<00:02:18.030> say<00:02:18.209> like<00:02:18.420> he

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
enough right now you can say like he

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:19.970 
enough right now you can say like he
wasn't<00:02:18.780> put<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.170> that<00:02:19.290> he<00:02:19.410> wasn't<00:02:19.709> put<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:19.950> a

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
wasn't put it that he wasn't put in a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.949 
wasn't put it that he wasn't put in a
position<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.489> succeed<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:21.420> could<00:02:21.569> say<00:02:21.720> that

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
position to succeed you could say that

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.390 
position to succeed you could say that
they<00:02:22.319> didn't<00:02:22.560> write<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> run<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.250> right

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
they didn't write the run the right

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.680 
they didn't write the run the right
place<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.640> didn't<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.120> ball<00:02:24.239> to<00:02:24.420> him<00:02:24.569> on

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
place I didn't get the ball to him on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:25.940 
place I didn't get the ball to him on
the<00:02:24.780> block<00:02:24.989> enough<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.470> if<00:02:25.560> you<00:02:25.680> were<00:02:25.800> smart

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the block enough and if you were smart

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.650 
the block enough and if you were smart
you'd<00:02:26.550> come<00:02:26.730> out<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:26.940> you'd<00:02:27.030> have<00:02:27.150> substance

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
you'd come out and you'd have substance

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.120 
you'd come out and you'd have substance
you<00:02:27.810> say<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.140> what<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:28.950> many

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
you say you know what this is how many

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.470 
you say you know what this is how many
plays<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.580> ran<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.940> him<00:02:30.060> on<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> block

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
plays they ran to him on the block

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.320 
plays they ran to him on the block
here's<00:02:30.989> how<00:02:31.140> Miami<00:02:31.590> defended<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.160> now<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:33.209> can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
here's how Miami defended it now you can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.570 
here's how Miami defended it now you can
also<00:02:33.540> argue<00:02:33.870> that<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.260> Pat<00:02:34.800> Reilly<00:02:35.190> way<00:02:35.340> is

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
also argue that the Pat Reilly way is

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
also argue that the Pat Reilly way is
always<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.209> same<00:02:36.540> way<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.260> time

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
always the same way all the time

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.530 
always the same way all the time
Miami<00:02:38.190> played<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:38.670> same<00:02:38.880> way<00:02:39.120> all<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
Miami played it the same way all the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.880 
Miami played it the same way all the
time<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.019> then<00:02:40.349> we<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.590> have<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.739> discussion

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
time and then we can have a discussion

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.430 
time and then we can have a discussion
discussion<00:02:41.670> about<00:02:42.120> adjustments<00:02:42.569> like<00:02:43.170> last

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
discussion about adjustments like last

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070 
discussion about adjustments like last
year<00:02:43.709> did<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.489> play<00:02:44.819> harder<00:02:45.299> than<00:02:45.599> the<00:02:45.720> heat<00:02:45.900> is

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
year did we play harder than the heat is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.870 
year did we play harder than the heat is
that<00:02:46.200> what<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.410> think<00:02:46.530> it<00:02:46.680> was<00:02:46.830> no<00:02:47.130> I<00:02:47.310> don't<00:02:47.640> I

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
that what you think it was no I don't I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.390 
that what you think it was no I don't I
think<00:02:48.480> LeBron<00:02:48.750> disappeared<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.799> shrank<00:02:50.099> in

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
think LeBron disappeared and shrank in

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.920 
think LeBron disappeared and shrank in
crunch<00:02:50.670> time<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.150> fourth<00:02:51.329> quarter<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.810> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
crunch time of the fourth quarter and I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.479 
crunch time of the fourth quarter and I
can<00:02:52.230> just<00:02:52.349> show<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.709> numbers<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.250> what<00:02:53.400> he

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
can just show you the numbers of what he

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.789 
can just show you the numbers of what he
didn't<00:02:53.849> do<00:02:54.030> in<00:02:54.239> every<00:02:54.840> week<00:02:55.110> so<00:02:55.349> we<00:02:55.500> get<00:02:55.650> no

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
didn't do in every week so we get no

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.589 
didn't do in every week so we get no
credit<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.220> not<00:02:57.000> putting<00:02:57.329> him<00:02:57.480> into

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
credit for not putting him into

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.180 
credit for not putting him into
positions<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.170> succeed<00:02:58.319> right

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
positions to succeed right

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.069 
positions to succeed right
we<00:02:59.340> played<00:02:59.610> they<00:02:59.790> he<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:00.329> himself<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.900> all

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
we played they he can put himself in all

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.300 
we played they he can put himself in all
he<00:03:01.170> did<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.380> stand<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> perimeter

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
he did you stand out on the perimeter

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.949 
he did you stand out on the perimeter
now<00:03:02.760> how<00:03:03.000> do<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.150> think<00:03:03.299> we<00:03:03.450> defended<00:03:03.870> that

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
now how do you think we defended that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.089 
now how do you think we defended that
why<00:03:04.079> do<00:03:04.140> you<00:03:04.230> think<00:03:04.380> he<00:03:04.500> was<00:03:04.590> standing<00:03:04.980> out

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 
why do you think he was standing out

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.059 
why do you think he was standing out
there<00:03:05.130> I<00:03:06.049> didn't<00:03:07.049> have<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.319> defend<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.739> all

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
there I didn't have to defend it all

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.770 
there I didn't have to defend it all
right<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.549> no<00:03:08.730> matter<00:03:08.849> what<00:03:09.090> we<00:03:09.150> did<00:03:09.480> he<00:03:09.660> was

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
right so no matter what we did he was

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.640 
right so no matter what we did he was
just<00:03:09.930> gonna<00:03:10.079> stand<00:03:10.260> there<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.530> do<00:03:10.620> nothing

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
just gonna stand there and do nothing

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.830 
just gonna stand there and do nothing
well<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.160> that's<00:03:11.610> all<00:03:11.819> I<00:03:11.880> saw<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.569> was<00:03:12.690> that

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
well I that's all I saw that was that

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.449 
well I that's all I saw that was that
was<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> lot<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.170> exactly<00:03:13.739> right<00:03:13.980> chin<00:03:14.220> see

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
was a lot of exactly right chin see

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.759 
was a lot of exactly right chin see
hopefully<00:03:14.640> weight<00:03:15.599> loss<00:03:15.780> saved<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> day

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
hopefully weight loss saved the day

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.379 
hopefully weight loss saved the day
that's<00:03:17.130> you're<00:03:17.489> exactly<00:03:17.880> right<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.239> all

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
that's you're exactly right that's all

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:21.620 
that's you're exactly right that's all
you<00:03:18.630> saw<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.049> didn't<00:03:19.230> look<00:03:19.350> right<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.250> mean<00:03:20.700> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
you saw you didn't look right I mean and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.180 
you saw you didn't look right I mean and
that's<00:03:21.750> a<00:03:21.900> complete<00:03:22.170> insult<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.650> us<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:23.069> say

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
that's a complete insult to us to say

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.770 
that's a complete insult to us to say
you<00:03:23.250> know<00:03:23.430> what<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:24.000> adjustments<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.569> we

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
you know what the adjustments that we

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.449 
you know what the adjustments that we
made<00:03:25.019> what<00:03:25.380> did<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.680> do<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.950> force<00:03:26.160> him<00:03:26.340> out

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
made what did you do to force him out

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.580 
made what did you do to force him out
there<00:03:26.639> we<00:03:27.209> had<00:03:27.780> different<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.350> had<00:03:28.440> like

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
there we had different that we had like

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.590 
there we had different that we had like
six<00:03:29.190> seven<00:03:29.370> different<00:03:29.790> types<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.090> matchups<00:03:30.510> in

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
six seven different types of matchups in

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.479 
six seven different types of matchups in
our<00:03:30.720> zone<00:03:30.930> right<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.829> we<00:03:32.010> played<00:03:32.190> man-to-man

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
our zone right and we played man-to-man

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.590 
our zone right and we played man-to-man
and<00:03:32.819> we<00:03:32.910> had<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> variety<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.510> different

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
and we had a variety of different

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.410 
and we had a variety of different
switches<00:03:34.230> right<00:03:34.380> so<00:03:34.799> we<00:03:34.980> knew<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.190> 90%<00:03:36.090> of

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
switches right so we knew that 90% of

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.460 
switches right so we knew that 90% of
the<00:03:36.510> shots<00:03:36.720> were<00:03:36.840> going<00:03:36.989> to<00:03:37.049> come<00:03:37.170> from<00:03:37.319> the

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
the shots were going to come from the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.410 
the shots were going to come from the
left<00:03:37.680> hand<00:03:37.859> side<00:03:38.100> right<00:03:38.370> we<00:03:38.760> knew<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.389> you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
left hand side right we knew that if you

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.240 
left hand side right we knew that if you
gave<00:03:39.660> him<00:03:39.870> room<00:03:40.079> from<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.410> left<00:03:40.620> he<00:03:40.859> was<00:03:40.980> going

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
gave him room from the left he was going

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.039 
gave him room from the left he was going
to<00:03:41.340> drive<00:03:41.549> now<00:03:42.060> we<00:03:42.120> didn't<00:03:42.389> have<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.630> athletes

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
to drive now we didn't have the athletes

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.690 
to drive now we didn't have the athletes
at<00:03:43.200> Oklahoma<00:03:43.650> City<00:03:43.859> yet<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.069> we<00:03:44.220> had<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.519> plan

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
at Oklahoma City yet so we had to plan

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.910 
at Oklahoma City yet so we had to plan
differently<00:03:45.540> sure<00:03:45.840> so<00:03:46.079> we<00:03:46.290> need<00:03:46.500> to<00:03:46.620> make<00:03:46.769> sure

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
differently sure so we need to make sure

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.009 
differently sure so we need to make sure
that<00:03:47.069> we<00:03:47.220> push<00:03:47.489> them<00:03:47.700> out<00:03:47.880> away<00:03:48.269> and<00:03:48.420> then<00:03:48.870> we

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
that we push them out away and then we

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.509 
that we push them out away and then we
gave<00:03:49.170> him<00:03:49.380> different<00:03:49.560> looks<00:03:49.920> every<00:03:50.190> time<00:03:50.370> he

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
gave him different looks every time he

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.039 
gave him different looks every time he
had<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.790> ball<00:03:50.970> because<00:03:51.269> just<00:03:51.600> making<00:03:51.900> him

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
had the ball because just making him

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.870 
had the ball because just making him
forced<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:53.040> forcing<00:03:53.400> him<00:03:53.519> to<00:03:53.639> make<00:03:53.850> a

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
forced just forcing him to make a

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.360 
forced just forcing him to make a
decision<00:03:54.200> right<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.829> about<00:03:56.069> what<00:03:56.280> he

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
decision right to think about what he

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.339 
decision right to think about what he
had<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.609> do<00:03:56.760> taking<00:03:57.269> the<00:03:57.359> time<00:03:57.569> to<00:03:57.780> read<00:03:57.959> our<00:03:58.200> we

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
had to do taking the time to read our we

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.140 
had to do taking the time to read our we
in<00:03:58.440> his<00:03:58.560> own<00:03:58.739> what<00:03:59.220> type<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.430> zone<00:03:59.730> we<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.030> how

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
in his own what type of zone we and how

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.430 
in his own what type of zone we and how
are<00:04:00.209> we<00:04:00.359> matching<00:04:00.780> up<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.230> type<00:04:01.410> of

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
are we matching up what type of

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.289 
are we matching up what type of
rotations<00:04:02.040> are<00:04:02.190> we<00:04:02.280> in<00:04:02.340> making<00:04:02.910> him<00:04:03.090> think

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
rotations are we in making him think

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:04.580 
rotations are we in making him think
made<00:04:03.540> them<00:04:03.720> pass<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.109> ball<00:04:04.260> around<00:04:04.290> the

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
made them pass the ball around the

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.289 
made them pass the ball around the
perimeter<00:04:04.769> which<00:04:05.370> gave<00:04:05.579> us<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.880> chance<00:04:06.090> to

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
perimeter which gave us a chance to

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.270 
perimeter which gave us a chance to
adjust<00:04:06.420> right<00:04:06.959> now<00:04:07.349> they're<00:04:07.590> smarter<00:04:08.010> they're

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
adjust right now they're smarter they're

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280 
adjust right now they're smarter they're
better<00:04:08.489> team<00:04:08.760> this<00:04:09.000> year<00:04:09.299> they<00:04:09.660> deserved<00:04:10.079> to

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
better team this year they deserved to

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.379 
better team this year they deserved to
win<00:04:10.319> this<00:04:10.590> year<00:04:10.889> but<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.700> know<00:04:11.790> that's<00:04:12.150> the

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
win this year but you know that's the

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:13.879 
win this year but you know that's the
way<00:04:12.540> we<00:04:12.750> played<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.169> and<00:04:13.319> so<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.530> wasn't<00:04:13.739> just

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
way we played it and so it wasn't just

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.979 
way we played it and so it wasn't just
LeBron<00:04:14.370> LeBron<00:04:15.000> actually<00:04:15.450> played<00:04:15.690> it<00:04:15.810> right

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
LeBron LeBron actually played it right

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.810 
LeBron LeBron actually played it right
more<00:04:16.320> often<00:04:16.560> than<00:04:16.709> not<00:04:16.739> he<00:04:17.070> made<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.639> right

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
more often than not he made the right

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.490
