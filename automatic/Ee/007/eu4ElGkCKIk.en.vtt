00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
anthropology which is great there's a

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.529

lot of tools and weapons which is going

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.050 
lot of tools and weapons which is going
to<00:00:14.629> come<00:00:14.750> in<00:00:14.809> handy<00:00:14.840> for<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.230> study<00:00:15.410> group<00:00:16.060> and

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
to come in handy for the study group and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.999 
to come in handy for the study group and
I<00:00:17.510> think<00:00:17.599> right<00:00:18.050> away<00:00:18.140> we<00:00:18.410> explore<00:00:18.740> a<00:00:18.770> little

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
I think right away we explore a little

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.249 
I think right away we explore a little
bit<00:00:19.160> more<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.550> our<00:00:19.640> primal<00:00:20.060> instincts<00:00:20.540> in<00:00:20.720> the

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
bit more of our primal instincts in the

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.260 
bit more of our primal instincts in the
in<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.590> very<00:00:21.830> beginning<00:00:21.950> of<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.369> season<00:00:22.579> we

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
in the very beginning of the season we

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.670 
in the very beginning of the season we
definitely<00:00:23.480> address<00:00:23.930> what<00:00:24.230> happened<00:00:24.529> at<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
definitely address what happened at the

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.380 
definitely address what happened at the
end<00:00:24.770> of<00:00:24.950> last<00:00:25.160> season<00:00:25.400> which<00:00:25.790> i<00:00:25.880> think<00:00:25.939> is<00:00:26.119> good

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
end of last season which i think is good

end of last season which i think is good
and<00:00:26.660> hopefully<00:00:27.439> we<00:00:27.680> could<00:00:27.800> do<00:00:27.919> that<00:00:27.950> and<00:00:28.160> then

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
and hopefully we could do that and then

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.920 
and hopefully we could do that and then
get<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.489> outer<00:00:28.669> space<00:00:28.790> as<00:00:29.210> soon<00:00:29.360> as<00:00:29.450> possible

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:47.839 
the Amazon when she was studying monkeys

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.829 
the Amazon when she was studying monkeys
and<00:00:48.019> stuff<00:00:48.140> and<00:00:49.210> like<00:00:50.210> I<00:00:50.300> said<00:00:50.359> she<00:00:50.539> has<00:00:50.570> a<00:00:50.690> lot

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
and stuff and like I said she has a lot

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.380 
and stuff and like I said she has a lot
of<00:00:50.899> weapons<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.640> definitely<00:00:52.640> very<00:00:52.879> specific

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
of weapons and definitely very specific

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.819 
of weapons and definitely very specific
ideas<00:00:53.780> about<00:00:53.809> how<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.140> use<00:00:54.350> them<00:00:54.499> and<00:00:54.530> isn't

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
ideas about how to use them and isn't

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.619 
ideas about how to use them and isn't
afraid<00:00:54.920> she<00:00:55.699> has<00:00:55.819> actually<00:00:56.179> no<00:00:56.300> fear<00:00:56.510> and

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
afraid she has actually no fear and

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.919 
afraid she has actually no fear and
isn't<00:00:56.839> afraid<00:00:56.899> to<00:00:57.109> use<00:00:57.379> any<00:00:57.679> of<00:00:58.069> these<00:00:58.219> weapons

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
isn't afraid to use any of these weapons

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.899 
isn't afraid to use any of these weapons
so<00:00:59.929> I<00:00:59.960> think<00:01:00.499> that<00:01:00.710> she<00:01:01.010> definitely<00:01:01.190> probably

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
so I think that she definitely probably

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.810 
so I think that she definitely probably
is<00:01:02.870> expecting<00:01:03.559> bad<00:01:03.800> things<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.129> happen<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.729> is

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
is expecting bad things to happen and is

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.940 
is expecting bad things to happen and is
okay<00:01:05.089> with<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.390> kind<00:01:06.170> of<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.290> perfect<00:01:06.710> person

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
okay with that kind of a perfect person

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.360 
okay with that kind of a perfect person
