00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.768
 I have not had issues with Windows Vista so far. 

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:11.779
 This video is a satire on the many complaints about Windows Vista 

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:17.164
 My PC will probably work better now that you have installed the new updates 

00:00:20.414 --> 00:00:21.213
 Dear Customer 

00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:24.806
 Steiner 

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.226
 Steiner could not fix your computer with Windows Vista 

00:00:29.781 --> 00:00:31.401
 Occorred an update error 

00:00:47.687 --> 00:00:54.086
 I would like to talk to: Keute, Jodel, Krebs and Buchdorf 

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:08.375
 This is a disgrace! 

00:01:09.024 --> 00:01:11.496
 I paid $ 499 for a disgrace! 

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:16.571
 That bitch of customer service was completely useless. 

00:01:19.117 --> 00:01:22.203
 I'm glad she got tired 

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:24.765
 she can not even fix my internet! 

00:01:25.012 --> 00:01:27.245
 No one can fix my internet, not even the SS 

00:01:27.997 --> 00:01:30.815
 I tried reinstalling my printer driver five times! 

00:01:33.648 --> 00:01:35.451
 Sir, I can not let you handle Lexmark Coupe 

00:01:35.745 --> 00:01:38.890
 I still can not install the new Office! 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.074
 We tested it on several machines 

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.495
 You cheated the wrong guy! 

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:46.283
 idiots 

00:01:48.245 --> 00:01:52.607
 You think it's untouchable because you're the richest company in the world! 

00:01:52.857 --> 00:01:55.700
 no one makes money without cheating! 

00:01:56.204 --> 00:02:00.330
 Is this my reward for all the years that I bought your operating system? 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.192
 I've spent a fortune with your useless sight, which I'll probably never review 

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:07.793
 XP has always served me well 

00:02:08.686 --> 00:02:12.777
 I really should go back to XP like Stalin! 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:20.277
 You said it was better than the beta 

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.731
 I believed you lying! 

00:02:25.107 --> 00:02:27.589
 vai se fuder bastards 

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.561
 unbelievable... 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:37.760
 you angled me from the start 

00:02:38.619 --> 00:02:42.417
 we felt like a cheap, rushed, German product! 

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:45.838
 the inventor of BSOD will pay! 

00:02:46.261 --> 00:02:49.305
 My, it was so fucking, so I tried to accelerate it! 

00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:52.308
 While it was in the defragmenter the fucking BSOD appeared! 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.980
 you can not be good at everything. 

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:05.812
 voice recognition does not even hear me 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.768
 I can not do my job on these circumstances. 

00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:14.933
 It's too late 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:21.298
 my confidence is over 

00:03:28.565 --> 00:03:34.077
 but when you think I'll buy another Microsoft product you're wrong! 

00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:36.393
 I'd rather buy a Mac 

00:03:39.073 --> 00:03:42.072
 please send your idea to a new video for nicopwn@hotmail.com! 44 00: 03: 42,432 -&gt; 00: 00: 00,000 If I use the idea I'll show you his name. 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.533
