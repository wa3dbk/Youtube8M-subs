00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.220
 you who like fruit plants and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.089
 do not want to wait years to savor the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.830
 fruits 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.290
 pay attention to this report that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.780
 Let's show it is easy to achieve. 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.259
 through a technique called al 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.870
 kia 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.420
 this method is to stimulate the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 root growth on a branch or in the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.490
 stem of a plant all this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.390
 using a piece of plastic or cloth 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.660
 moistened 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.640
 After some time, roots and roots 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.810
 branch can be highlighted to be 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 planted 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.570
 Good, let's see, then, how it works. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.050
 this in practice comes here in the season 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.930
 experimental itajaí in the fruit collection 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.770
 they use two important techniques is 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.320
 for the propagation of seedlings is to obtain seedlings 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.969
 adults that already in a few 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.600
 years, your creative can produce 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.910
 one of them is the call to because the zé 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.699
 Jose is going to show us how you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.340
 does when talking coliseum the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.460
 researcher here gives the first season 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.689
 selection they are josé ramos and he taught 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.229
 I love it here 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.810
 suddenly a lumpy branch in with dilma 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.280
 in 302 to two centimeters 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.990
 so he's going to make it so people 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.270
 selecting in case this branch 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.790
 he does the cleaning on the return in the region of 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.799
 what will be done next door 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.689
 the first one removes this material after 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.330
 he will regret it 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.579
 the Flemish is a cut of about 1 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.820
 feeling all around the new 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:36.689
 while José does not there is a technique 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.090
 very difficult is the only disadvantage is the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:46.619
 bark up the tron in taking out the whole house 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:49.710
 It is not at all the purpose of this cut is to 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.140
 to cut like this is because it was the raw sap 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.479
 she goes upstairs she always goes down the house 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.610
 So, you making that cut yourself. 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.790
 prevents being drafted 100 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.100
 forcing then I regret the tool 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.189
 keep going 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.350
 I'm sorry we used a hormone 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.500
 we go butyric acid was there 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.629
 concentration of 500 ppm thousand favors 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.370
 This is for him from Hindus to 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.739
 marriage 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.610
 there is an exact vegetable hormone 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:24.010
 increases the chance that the designed from 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.010
 Then he picks up a paintbrush tweezers there is 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.599
 here and now it will cover this 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.680
 material with sphagnum picking type 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.989
 of musician 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.590
 could be used in can xaxim find 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.909
 in places such as the coastline is a 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.220
 movement grows 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.980
 it is well that the retention capacity 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.170
 of water is high so you give a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.950
 Descent does not need Argentine charkh 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.810
 migraine 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.040
 leave it for about a month he goes 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.129
 use this material that will keep the 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.060
 unit during the training period 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.160
 is in point of culture 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.620
 immaterial also light then more or 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.940
 minus this volume and use rolls the paper 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 of this pac roll which is in the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.930
 market to do is if those use 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.120
 kitchens né 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.329
 the purpose of transparent paper is to 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.069
 three months from now when 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.140
 the roots appear we'll see 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.950
 then material that is the cut-off point 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.569
 it silvana the advantage given by kia in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.169
 relation to seed ne 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.359
 aci hali had for example on Sunday 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.590
 part of the fruit plants if you give it 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.060
 multiply by seeds it will take time 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.090
 up to ten years to go into production 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.150
 right if you do it for kia or you 're here 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.220
 the album is called if it is called propagation 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.049
 vegetation, it will produce the third 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.209
 year and begins to produce what is already a 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.790
 gain that the rooster would be a cloning 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:43.370
 This is the cock that has already produced 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.930
 then it is already aged me this is 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.579
 that would be a cloning another advantage 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.530
 that he will keep the same 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.250
 feature does not go in for assessment 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.810
 Mom wants to see and Raoni arrived here. 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.620
 would be when he decided to appear 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.139
 roots 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.599
 he is cut we'll see there's a 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:01.940
 material he is disappointed that in three 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.069
 to four months depending on the season but 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.510
 the point that will indicate the cut 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.150
 appearing and the emergence of roots here 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.459
 he is going to issue fines there is cut that 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.799
 louis walsh took this plastic and 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.090
 sang very carefully we'll see how 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.359
 and you do that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.549
 the only advantage to him here would be that the 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.049
 also plant growth it is less 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.880
 and if you multiply the main one is that 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.820
 it tends not to be so with Europe's 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.890
 very large 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.600
 one by one through seed it becomes 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.430
 so she has to forget more 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.350
 so objective care never has 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.960
 sure that fruit will be good 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.700
 may vary and could be 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.710
 different us with implanted in 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.820
 vase plant will not show that it already has 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.410
 a plant 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.410
 come on then let's see pink soon 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:54.270
 We'll see it here so there's already a 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.710
 plant in a rooted twig that we 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:05:00.420
 We cut but it's the root that fell on this I am 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.120
 very visible and invisible 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.220
 here's a part of it being damp to 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.140
 launched strong roots 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.020
 We would have removed plastic steel 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.820
 would bring us a pot or less than six 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.380
 books that this one is that we have a 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.740
 mixture of sand and earth that people 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.220
 prepares more or less for good texture 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.980
 from there, you can move the safe people to the 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:29.670
 level of the soil, for example from the 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:34.830
 Abuna and kills the material that I faced as 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.930
 a land well we have to have the piece 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:38.750
 well to be well that I wanted one more 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.170
 a little 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.140
 This is the process in Riga if well 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:48.540
 after this fight here an example until 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.340
 same year she was a year ago 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.340
 here in the second day 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.310
 many powerful monsters and you can see 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.620
 that the morning twig where the team was 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.290
 mature means that these blocks 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.210
 shoots in three years producing us 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.950
 ground case here of 100 seedlings we 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:09.450
 we made ten or twelve produce in the 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.110
 first year since it is likely to be 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.690
 next 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.530
 if she is well fed reproduce ts 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.580
 a great advantage especially for 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:21.780
 fruit trees that are native to 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:24.930
 many years 10 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.300
 it is usually from seed this is a 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.160
 advantage of grafting gives 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.130
 productive legislative action came the 

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.169
 percentage of interest in the court of 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:37.110
 hormone we have achieved more than 90 per 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.639
 cent in the last year and can always 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.100
 comes from the hormone if you apply and do not 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:46.460
 Mr Manoel would be lower by almost 100% 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:46.460
 but it is a very good result
