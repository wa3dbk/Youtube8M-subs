00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 and here we are at the third video in the sequence 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 video of how you eat and how you do it 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.540
 prepare high quality sandwiches and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.830
 now it's time to talk 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.109
 of how to prepare a sandwich of 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.940
 very high quality clearly when yes 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 talks about high quality ingredients 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.720
 logically we move, however, of price 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.769
 I tell you that the price must surely 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.529
 be interested in worrying about some 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.359
 circumstances but not too scaring me 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.780
 in some circumstances because why a 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.460
 equal quantity of product that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.559
 is used and therefore at a price 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.190
 the more you have the possibility of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.280
 feed more we say people or feed 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 yourself for more times because why 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 when a high quality food is a lot 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.640
 more nutritious and perceived it as a network 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.280
 own palatal level of love 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.780
 organism immediately 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 what to do at this point becomes 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.520
 imperative in the sandwich to choose dosages 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 of macronutrients as we have explained 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.290
 in the previous video and beyond that i 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.659
 dosages the type of food dosages 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.119
 I still remember them for people who are 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.400
 sedentary and do not want to have we say 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.250
 the post prandial slumber the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.100
 ratio of 15 grams of carbohydrates with 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 the 30 grams of protein content that 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.619
 both cheese and ham are others 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.720
 cured meat 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.130
 here it must be maintained if instead it comes 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
 eaten after a sports activity 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.070
 we can stand on the 20 25 grams of bread 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.229
 with the same quantities for every 20 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.000
 25 grams of bread we can use 30 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.280
 grams of protein 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 having said that once you understand 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.590
 the proportions go on quality 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.970
 then ham and salami if possible 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.630
 you should find yourself doing very high 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 quality from say animals bred to 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.250
 been brado arrived with the acorns 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.869
 bred with the comcom what it is that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 from nature and above all that you are 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.360
 moving in this way is the part 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 lean that the fat part is also the part 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.969
 fat that in others is fat 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 saturated 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.439
 instead here they will be unsaturated fats like 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.570
 those of the fish the omega 3 for so much 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.610
 to be understood the mega 6 and therefore with 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.340
 these fatty acids will be good for the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.720
 the body 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.110
 sometimes even better than those of the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.440
 fish because unfortunately they won't have those 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.090
 many heavy metals found in the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.310
 large fish for the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.989
 pollutions of the sea so here is from 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.599
 there we must choose if possible 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.940
 let's try to choose this type of salami 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.709
 to animate it was wild you will discover that 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.870
 they cost a lot maybe it won't be the norm 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.370
 but sometimes it will be a pleasure to enjoy 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.920
 this type of sandwich that becomes a 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.160
 very delicious sandwich we said 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.319
 then bread from this point 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:47.349
 I repeat from da with leavening 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.360
 pasta with sourdough and cheese from 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.040
 raw milk go to inform you what 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.690
 mean raw milk cheese I am 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.660
 cheeses that have a way of 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.239
 more natural preparation to anchor that 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.390
 we say more genuine and therefore have gods 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.160
 stronger flavors more intense but everything 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.840
 this will simplify that step 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.120
 last I remember in the two videos 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.680
 previous long chew here we are 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.299
 right in the gourmet world because 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.090
 logically eat a sandwich of this 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.250
 kind with that bread with those cold cuts with 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.410
 that ham or with that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.630
 cheese clearly we will have to give way 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.239
 to taste buds to savor 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.590
 every single flavor try to separate it 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.989
 give each other information 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.670
 to our brain to please and do it 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:29.380
 come down predigested in our stomach 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.060
 so that it is as respectful as possible 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.280
 of our stomach 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.900
 it will also be a pleasure to prepare for this 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.060
 level sandwiches of this kind also 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.590
 for our children for the people who 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.510
 we know why they will thank you 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.519
 why eat this kind of food 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.889
 also not a simple sandwich when me 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.709
 I do it for myself in this way I tell you 

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.870
 which are sensory experiences 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.180
 of important sensory emotions 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.639
