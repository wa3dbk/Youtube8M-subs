00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
cover for the thermostat which is right

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.120 
cover for the thermostat which is right
there<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:36.440> actually<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.620> controls<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
there that actually what controls the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.370 
there that actually what controls the
temperature<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> water<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.140> also<00:00:40.140> has<00:00:40.350> a

reset button on there and that's just if

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.270 
reset button on there and that's just if
element<00:00:43.380> goes<00:00:44.010> bad<00:00:44.280> or<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:46.350> thermostat

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
element goes bad or the thermostat

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
element goes bad or the thermostat
itself<00:00:47.580> goes<00:00:47.760> bad<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.720> button<00:00:48.989> will

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
itself goes bad that that button will

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.500 
itself goes bad that that button will
trip<00:00:49.290> out<00:00:49.470> but<00:00:50.070> as<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.550> see<00:00:50.699> the<00:00:50.879> cover<00:00:51.330> is

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
trip out but as you can see the cover is

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:51.979

missing
so<00:00:52.850> with<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.000> exposed<00:00:54.480> electrical<00:00:55.290> wiring

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
so with that exposed electrical wiring

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.910 
so with that exposed electrical wiring
to<00:00:57.120> me<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> safety<00:00:57.750> concern<00:00:58.199> so<00:00:58.800> we're

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
to me that's a safety concern so we're

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.939 
to me that's a safety concern so we're
gonna<00:00:59.010> recommend<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.670> get<00:00:59.879> repaired<00:01:00.860> one<00:01:01.860> of

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
gonna recommend that get repaired one of

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.490 
gonna recommend that get repaired one of
the<00:01:02.010> bigger<00:01:02.190> items<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> water<00:01:03.480> heater<00:01:03.750> try

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the bigger items on the water heater try

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.330 
the bigger items on the water heater try
to<00:01:04.559> sneak<00:01:04.830> back<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.790> little<00:01:06.450> tight<00:01:07.280> this<00:01:08.280> is

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to sneak back in a little tight this is

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.230 
to sneak back in a little tight this is
the<00:01:08.730> pressure<00:01:09.659> relief<00:01:09.990> valve<00:01:10.700> on<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> top<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the pressure relief valve on the top of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.149 
the pressure relief valve on the top of
the<00:01:12.300> water<00:01:12.510> heater

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
the water heater

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.170 
the water heater
and<00:01:15.409> one<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.860> noticed<00:01:17.370> a<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.790> it's

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
and one thing that I noticed a it's it's

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.070 
and one thing that I noticed a it's it's
pretty<00:01:18.450> corroded<00:01:19.850> now<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.330> two<00:01:21.900> year

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
pretty corroded now this is a two year

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.330 
pretty corroded now this is a two year
old<00:01:22.110> blurrier<00:01:22.620> so<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:22.830> just<00:01:22.980> wanted<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> point

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
old blurrier so I just wanted to point

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.280 
old blurrier so I just wanted to point
that<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.660> as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.870> see<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.200> got

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that out as well but as you see it's got

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.040 
that out as well but as you see it's got
a<00:01:25.350> lot<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> corrosion<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.420> then<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.930> you

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
a lot of corrosion on it and then if you

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.820 
a lot of corrosion on it and then if you
follow<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.440> pipe<00:01:28.650> down<00:01:29.330> she<00:01:30.330> goes<00:01:30.480> to<00:01:30.830> almost

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
follow the pipe down she goes to almost

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.340 
follow the pipe down she goes to almost
the<00:01:32.010> floor<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:32.730> is<00:01:32.760> correct<00:01:33.300> as<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.110> see

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the floor which is correct as you see

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.390 
the floor which is correct as you see
it's<00:01:34.740> dripping<00:01:35.750> got<00:01:36.750> quite<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> bit<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.010> water

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
it's dripping got quite a bit of water

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.750 
it's dripping got quite a bit of water
on<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.730> ground<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.830> ultimately<00:01:41.190> two

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
on the ground so what ultimately two

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.980 
on the ground so what ultimately two
things<00:01:42.030> this<00:01:42.180> can<00:01:42.450> cause<00:01:42.750> obviously<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
things this can cause obviously the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.280 
things this can cause obviously the
water<00:01:45.990> damage<00:01:46.440> or<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.830> rot<00:01:47.630> not<00:01:48.630> only<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
water damage or the rot not only to the

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.260 
water damage or the rot not only to the
subfloor<00:01:49.740> but<00:01:50.100> also<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.730> wood<00:01:50.910> framing

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
subfloor but also to the wood framing

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.870 
subfloor but also to the wood framing
which<00:01:52.050> is<00:01:52.230> back<00:01:52.500> under<00:01:52.830> here<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:56.040> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
which is back under here and then the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.000 
which is back under here and then the
other<00:01:57.030> thing<00:01:57.330> get<00:01:57.750> rust<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.560> base<00:01:58.740> of<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
other thing get rust on the base of the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.510 
other thing get rust on the base of the
water<00:01:59.190> heater

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
water heater

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
water heater
so<00:02:00.030> we're<00:02:00.180> going<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.360> do<00:02:00.510> is<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:01.020> see<00:02:01.200> that's
