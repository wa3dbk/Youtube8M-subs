00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's not reliable like this obviously

it's not reliable like this obviously
you<00:00:59.090> put<00:00:59.270> it<00:00:59.390> on<00:00:59.540> here<00:00:59.809> and<00:00:59.930> let<00:01:00.050> it<00:01:00.079> warm<00:01:00.320> up

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
you put it on here and let it warm up

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.010 
you put it on here and let it warm up
for<00:01:00.770> a<00:01:00.800> second<00:01:02.079> and<00:01:03.079> you'll<00:01:03.800> see<00:01:04.100> how<00:01:04.309> much

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
for a second and you'll see how much

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.290 
for a second and you'll see how much
more<00:01:06.020> pliable<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:06.680> gets<00:01:06.920> I<00:01:07.220> warned<00:01:07.759> my<00:01:07.820> finger

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
more pliable it gets I warned my finger

up<00:01:08.450> just<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.990> a<00:01:09.050> second<00:01:09.500> and<00:01:09.619> sometimes<00:01:10.070> the

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
up just for a second and sometimes the

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.219 
up just for a second and sometimes the
rice<00:01:10.880> can<00:01:11.240> leave<00:01:11.450> a<00:01:11.479> little<00:01:11.600> bit<00:01:11.930> of<00:01:11.990> moisture

make sure that it's off of my edges of
my<00:01:51.340> no<00:01:52.340> skin<00:01:52.899> or<00:01:53.899> it<00:01:54.229> will<00:01:54.470> lift<00:01:55.869> then<00:02:02.200> once<00:02:03.200> my

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
my no skin or it will lift then once my

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.219 
my no skin or it will lift then once my
shield<00:02:03.709> has<00:02:04.209> cooled<00:02:05.209> just<00:02:05.690> a<00:02:05.840> little<00:02:06.110> bit

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
shield has cooled just a little bit

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.630 
shield has cooled just a little bit
you'll<00:02:06.380> feel<00:02:06.590> like<00:02:06.709> it<00:02:06.860> a<00:02:06.890> little<00:02:07.099> stiffer

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
you'll feel like it a little stiffer

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:28.780 
you'll feel like it a little stiffer
again<00:02:07.959> then<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.349> some<00:02:09.619> clippers

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.690 

and<00:02:29.659> it's<00:02:30.469> still<00:02:30.829> kind<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.129> rough<00:02:31.340> around<00:02:31.459> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and it's still kind of rough around the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.910 
and it's still kind of rough around the
edge<00:02:31.879> all<00:02:32.390> I'm<00:02:32.599> doing<00:02:32.629> is<00:02:33.049> making<00:02:33.349> it<00:02:33.620> short

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920

enough<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.519> i<00:02:34.670> can<00:02:34.760> make<00:02:35.060> sure<00:02:35.239> that<00:02:35.420> i've

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
enough so that i can make sure that i've

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.229 
enough so that i can make sure that i've
got<00:02:35.689> a<00:02:35.719> good<00:02:35.959> tight<00:02:36.170> seal<00:02:36.200> i<00:02:36.799> spin<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.819> really

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
got a good tight seal i spin this really

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.449

tight<00:02:38.510> around<00:02:38.629> the<00:02:38.930> edge<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.590> like<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.159> so

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
tight around the edge just like so so

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.649 
tight around the edge just like so so
that<00:02:40.609> it<00:02:40.700> kind<00:02:40.819> of<00:02:40.939> folds<00:02:41.180> down<00:02:41.420> over<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.109> edge

00:02:43.649 --> 00:02:43.659 
that it kind of folds down over the edge

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:49.089 
that it kind of folds down over the edge
heat<00:02:44.659> it<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:44.930> until<00:02:47.079> my<00:02:48.079> finger<00:02:48.470> starts<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.950> get
