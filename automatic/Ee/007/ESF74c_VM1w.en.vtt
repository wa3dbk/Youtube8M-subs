 first movie if anything in this scene 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.460
 113 barely perceptible by what was spent 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.530
 who is honestly had not noticed 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.719

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.370
 the planet pizza truck makes its 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.980
 appearance in this scene before the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.719
 interview with similes axelrod just a 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.230
 its seconds is appreciable 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.510
 presence on the television 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.130

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.200
 gamma where from woods is original 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.090
 only appreciable in the first movie 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.460
 in the scene where he prepares to 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.070
 beginning though in for race 6 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.110

 key to 103 on its rear spoiler 7 tal 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.670
 once for the fact that they are traveling

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.310
 find the key as the fateful 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.820
 protocol in the movie the world 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.070
 yellow box 8 in the credits of the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.380

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.270
 Luso is within what 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.060
 represents the study facilities 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.310
 pixar in emeryville california and 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.290
 there really is a giant lamp 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.000
 is together with the yellow ball near 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.100
 from the entrance to the main building 9 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.200
 just like in the first movie of 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.960
 karts the cinema exhibits movies that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.330
 parodian pixar deliveries is now 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.430
 the turn of the incredible but only 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.290
 you get to appreciate the outside ad 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.860
 with the title 'the incredible' the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.860
 incredibles in English 10 per second 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.450
 occasion almost at the end of the film 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.880
 the planet pizza truck reappears 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.770
 now in more detail as one of the 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.670
 spectators of the radiator race 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.140
 springs 11 during the credits 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.750
 we'll find some motel dancers 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.610
 possible road parody of moulin red that 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.580
 correspond to the senior aides and not 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.709
 cohen the first cars 12 the parody of the 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.110
 movie ratatouille the restaurant of the 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.739
 international chef taste style 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.700
 of the gustav 13 strollers also in 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.680
 the credits appears luxo jr being this 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.110
 time the son instead of his father his 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.650
 arm is short plus it is on 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.180
 a balloon such as in the short luxo jr 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.930
 where you get on a ball that at the end 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.300
 crushes 14 as the last reference in the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.890
 promotional posters of cars 2 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.110
 came to appreciate a light advertisement 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.990
 with a parody of the toy lotso bear 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.670
 story3 in the movie is no longer reached 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.190
 appreciate also how in those 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.020
 promotional items the only time visible is in 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.240
 the scene below where only if 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.270
 perceptible figure much less 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.670
 letters of the title of the 15 mark as 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.860
 recognition the yellow truck that 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.320
 it's been called john lasseter was made in 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.450
 representation of john lasseter 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:45.030
 pixar co-founder for 25 years of 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.160
 created also appears on the tracks a 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.020
 ad with the legend the pull as 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.410
 if it were a brand of sponsor of 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.630
 tires 16 when looking for details in the 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.700
 scenes that identify the cameos of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.280
 pixar it 's easy to lose the big picture 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.320
 complete the scene where sir thousands 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.330
 axelrod returns to harsh penalties of his 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.030
 attempt to travel the world without GPS 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.040
 the complete scenery of the jungle is the 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.020
 same as they used in the movie when 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.410
 Carl tries to get rid of the faithful dog 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.390
 dog with a ball of his cane 17 as 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.730
 a very ingrained custom of 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.130
 include references to future movies 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.320
 that I had not seen for the same reason in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.540
 the final scene of persecution the bad guys 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.550
 they enter a bar pulling the beers in 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.800
 customers and these are upset 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.810
 giving them a beating is a 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.400
 Medieval style picture whose figures 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.040
 they are the characters in the movie 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.650
 brave who came out later clear 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.840
 that conveys two are both meridia 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.860
 his parents and his brothers in front of 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:46.170
 difficult father to appreciate 18 this last 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.210
 It is very difficult to appreciate but there is 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.980
 a poster like the one used in the promotion 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.650
 from the movie 'the incredible' where 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.840
 only appears incredible mister just for 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.910
 the colors the background style the 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.040
 apparent pose of the vehicle and the letters 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.340
 bottom of the movie title is 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.650
 possible to relate the 19 to start 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.170
 we will see the appearance of the magic key 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.570
 to 113 this time it's a train that's 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.490
 responsible for carrying it as we know it appears 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.670
 in other pixar movies like 'toy 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.490
 story '20 another of the great appeared 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.600
 it's the planet pizza truck 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.700
 originally from 'toy story' here 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.530
 appears as a living car near 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.110
 the commentators of the great race in 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.060
 that rayon will participate that we can see 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.230
 a characterization of elvis also 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 next to the truck 20 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.060
 on the way to california that in 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.920
 convinces its carrier trailer mac 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.710
 of not resting at a stop 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.990
 rest for travelers there are found 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.630
 several trailers talking or resting 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.460
 one of them bears the emblem of a 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.650
 company that has the same logo 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.570
 mister incredible when he used his first 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.850
 blue costume with black in the movie 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.890
 'the incredible' also carries the 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:56.290
 abbreviation incorporated that although 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.570
 means corporation incorporated in 

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:02.530
 English we can imagine that it refers to 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:04.000
 incredible amazing in English 22 when 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.250
 although in visit to the store 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.350
 memories of lychee the little black bug 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.330
 find a snowball with a 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.280
 miniature of the store inside and can 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.320
 note that there is also a figure of 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:17.590
 a snowman identical to the character 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:20.470
 of the Pixar 23 animated short film 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:22.810
 although it is very difficult to see during the 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.820
 rayon trip that in california a 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.220
 scene shows the cables of the poles 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.200
 of light and in a very short instant it 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.680
 appreciate the figure and you hear that 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.810
 trin 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.780
 the little blue birds of the short 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.790
 animated flight of birds 24 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:38.860
 it really is not an exact reference 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:40.600
 but when I saw this scene he called me 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.389
 a lot of attention because I thought 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.760
 have seen before that I remembered then 

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:48.460
 that in the short comic mcs some of the 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.639
 characters were a palm tree a flamenco 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.200
 and an inflatable bathtub with two rings 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:56.230
 possibly there is no relationship and 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.690
 have been put only for decoration 25 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.940
 a rather curious fact is about the 

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:03.580
 stanley character founder of radiator 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:05.770
 springs whose statue we see in the photo at 

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:07.510
 time to present pixar cars too 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:09.970
 presented a short film called 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.770
 jumping that is about a sheep in 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.620
 he manages to observe an old car 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.990
 only seen from the back to 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:19.510
 compare it with stanley we can observe 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:21.430
 a great similarity between them so much that 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:24.040
 it can be assured that it is the same 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:27.550
 auto or at least one that was based 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:29.770
 rigorously in the other 26 finally 

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:31.810
 just as a curious fact in the 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.150
 racing a team with the 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.160
 company to paul as a sponsor is not 

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:39.760
 of wonder that the car is white as 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.740
 an ipad 27 following with the custom of 

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.810
 pixar to include characters 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:46.210
 future deliveries in the last scenes 

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.190
 of incredible action you get to 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:49.960
 appreciate a model and color car 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.650
 identical to the character of dr 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.509
 jackson hornet 'this was all friends 

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:57.970
 I hope you liked me now 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:59.620
 credits if you did not like it just look 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.300
 another video x of not commenting 

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:03.430
 offensive x try to do the best 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.110
 possible x if you do not like my videos not 

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:06.639
