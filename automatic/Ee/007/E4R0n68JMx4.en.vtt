00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
now to transform is really simple the

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.450 
now to transform is really simple the
first<00:01:22.060> thing<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.570> is<00:01:23.100> rotate<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.460> back<00:01:24.850> piece

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460
