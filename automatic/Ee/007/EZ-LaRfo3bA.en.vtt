we launched the dermalogica products in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.410 
we launched the dermalogica products in
1987<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.949> were<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.430> first<00:00:26.670> company<00:00:27.390> to

launch and became famous for what we

things of which are most proud is when I

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.479 
things of which are most proud is when I

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
look at products that are being

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
look at products that are being
developed<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.390> don't<00:01:06.900> know<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
developed now I don't know that you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.070 
developed now I don't know that you
could<00:01:07.500> really<00:01:07.740> introduce<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.280> product<00:01:08.520> without

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
could really introduce a product without

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.300 
could really introduce a product without
recognizing<00:01:10.080> those<00:01:10.290> differences<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:11.159> we

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
recognizing those differences that we

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.609 
recognizing those differences that we
established<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> years<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.470> get

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
established and over the years we get

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.530 
established and over the years we get
lots<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.920> questions<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.460> why<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.180> use<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
lots of questions about why we use this

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.969 
lots of questions about why we use this
ingredient<00:01:15.930> why<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.439> don't<00:01:16.710> use<00:01:16.950> that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
ingredient why we don't use that

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.999 
ingredient why we don't use that
ingredient<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.689> always<00:01:18.900> provokes<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.860> lot

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
ingredient and it always provokes a lot

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.190 
ingredient and it always provokes a lot
of<00:01:20.130> conversation<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.119> lot<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.509> discussion

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
of conversation and a lot of discussion

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.679 
of conversation and a lot of discussion
so<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.400> first<00:01:23.729> differences<00:01:24.299> was<00:01:24.540> that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
so one of our first differences was that

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.070 
so one of our first differences was that
we<00:01:24.810> don't<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.380> FB<00:01:25.710> alcohol<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.030> sometimes<00:01:27.960> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
we don't use FB alcohol and sometimes I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.800 
we don't use FB alcohol and sometimes I
hear<00:01:28.259> people<00:01:28.590> say<00:01:28.829> Diana<00:01:29.820> Oh<00:01:29.970> dermalogica

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
hear people say Diana Oh dermalogica

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.780 
hear people say Diana Oh dermalogica
doesn't<00:01:31.140> use<00:01:31.259> any<00:01:31.409> alcohol<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:31.979> its<00:01:32.280> products

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
doesn't use any alcohol in its products

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.280 
doesn't use any alcohol in its products
and<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.390> correct<00:01:33.630> them<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.869> say<00:01:34.049> no<00:01:34.259> no

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and I have to correct them and say no no

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.249 
and I have to correct them and say no no
because<00:01:34.650> not<00:01:34.920> all<00:01:35.189> alcohols<00:01:36.060> are<00:01:36.450> created

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
because not all alcohols are created

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.280 
because not all alcohols are created
equal<00:01:38.180> usually<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> alcohol

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
equal usually when we think of alcohol

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.109 
equal usually when we think of alcohol
with<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:41.009> less<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> thinking<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.729> vodka

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
with one less you thinking of a vodka

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.749 
with one less you thinking of a vodka
gimlet<00:01:42.329> you're<00:01:43.110> thinking<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.799> alcohol<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
gimlet you're thinking of alcohol that

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.700 
gimlet you're thinking of alcohol that
looks<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> sort<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.600> drying<00:01:45.990> alcohol

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
looks like this sort of drying alcohol

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.060 
looks like this sort of drying alcohol
rate<00:01:46.860> seventy<00:01:47.430> percent<00:01:47.549> alcohol<00:01:48.500> but<00:01:49.500> we're

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
rate seventy percent alcohol but we're

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.200 
rate seventy percent alcohol but we're
going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> talk<00:01:50.430> about<00:01:50.549> some<00:01:50.700> other<00:01:51.060> things

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to talk about some other things

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.260 
going to talk about some other things
that<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.570> also<00:01:51.780> alcohols<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.700> do<00:01:53.939> use

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that are also alcohols that we do use

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.170 
that are also alcohols that we do use
and<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.409> indeed<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.460> beneficial<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and and indeed are very beneficial to

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.350 
and and indeed are very beneficial to
the<00:01:57.299> skin<00:01:57.600> when<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.829> developed<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.909> product

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.789 
the skin when we developed the product
line<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> first<00:02:01.380> products<00:02:01.710> we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
line one of the first products we

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.880 
line one of the first products we
developed<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.219> multi<00:02:02.640> active<00:02:02.969> toner<00:02:03.299> and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
developed was multi active toner and

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.980 
developed was multi active toner and
it's<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.040> hydrating<00:02:05.820> spirit<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.479> evens<00:02:06.840> out

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
it's a hydrating spirit that evens out

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's a hydrating spirit that evens out
the<00:02:07.049> porosity<00:02:07.469> of<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.860> skin<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.459> does<00:02:08.520> not

why a drying alcohol what the word SD
alcohol<00:02:53.319> means<00:02:53.889> and<00:02:54.190> then<00:02:54.400> what<00:02:54.609> are<00:02:54.730> some<00:02:54.849> of

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
alcohol means and then what are some of

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.140 
alcohol means and then what are some of
the<00:02:55.000> beneficial<00:02:55.480> alcohols<00:02:55.959> well<00:02:56.620> SD<00:02:57.609> alcohol

the beneficial alcohols well SD alcohol

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.929 
the beneficial alcohols well SD alcohol
simply<00:02:58.720> means<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:59.220> denatured<00:03:00.220> alcohol<00:03:00.340> right

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939

simply means a denatured alcohol right
and<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.510> reason<00:03:01.780> they<00:03:01.900> do<00:03:01.959> that<00:03:02.049> is<00:03:02.260> because

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
and the reason they do that is because

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.440 
and the reason they do that is because
they<00:03:03.010> don't<00:03:03.220> want<00:03:03.400> people<00:03:03.430> to<00:03:03.879> take<00:03:04.030> alcohol

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
and think they can drink it so you

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.309 
and think they can drink it so you
denature<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.299> number<00:03:07.689> that<00:03:07.840> often<00:03:08.230> is

toner would strip away the residue and

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.069 
toner would strip away the residue and
then<00:03:30.760> you'd<00:03:30.879> say<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.269> client<00:03:31.690> if<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:31.930> was

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
then you'd say to the client if I was

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.199

that<00:03:39.909> is<00:03:40.239> it's<00:03:40.510> also<00:03:40.720> your<00:03:41.049> own<00:03:41.169> natural

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:41.379 
that is it's also your own natural

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.110 
that is it's also your own natural
lipids<00:03:41.799> and<00:03:42.069> that's<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.459> problem<00:03:42.699> with<00:03:42.970> using

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
lipids and that's the problem with using

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.879 
lipids and that's the problem with using
alcohol<00:03:43.629> in<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.989> product<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.470> why<00:03:44.560> we<00:03:44.709> would

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
alcohol in a product and why we would

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:47.309 
alcohol in a product and why we would
never<00:03:45.159> use<00:03:45.459> it<00:03:45.489> not<00:03:46.150> only<00:03:46.329> is<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.629> an<00:03:46.870> irritant

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
never use it not only is it an irritant

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:49.289 
never use it not only is it an irritant
to<00:03:47.409> skin<00:03:47.799> people<00:03:48.159> don't<00:03:48.370> realize<00:03:48.699> that<00:03:48.729> it

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
to skin people don't realize that it

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
all seen that redness on but it

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.830 
all seen that redness on but it
dehydrates<00:03:54.579> the<00:03:54.699> natural<00:03:55.180> lipids<00:03:55.359> from<00:03:55.659> the

token that natural lipid barrier is what

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.050 
token that natural lipid barrier is what
keeps<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.650> water<00:04:11.859> in<00:04:12.250> the<00:04:12.280> tissues<00:04:12.819> down

keeps the water in the tissues down

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.780 
keeps the water in the tissues down

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
what you're going to see here so this is

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.200 
what you're going to see here so this is
an<00:05:47.410> alcohol<00:05:47.980> so<00:05:48.340> just<00:05:48.670> because<00:05:48.850> it's<00:05:49.090> an

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
an alcohol so just because it's an

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.150 
an alcohol so just because it's an
alcohol<00:05:49.630> all<00:05:49.840> it<00:05:50.080> means<00:05:50.110> from<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.740> chemist

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
alcohol all it means from a chemist

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.040 
alcohol all it means from a chemist
point<00:05:51.460> of<00:05:51.550> view<00:05:51.700> is<00:05:51.880> that<00:05:51.940> it<00:05:52.480> has<00:05:52.600> a<00:05:52.630> hydroxyl

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
point of view is that it has a hydroxyl

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.620 
point of view is that it has a hydroxyl
group<00:05:53.560> on<00:05:53.740> it<00:05:54.040> it<00:05:54.430> doesn't<00:05:54.730> necessarily<00:05:55.480> mean

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
group on it it doesn't necessarily mean

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.050 
group on it it doesn't necessarily mean
it's<00:05:55.810> a<00:05:55.930> drying<00:05:56.350> lightweight<00:05:57.100> alcohol<00:05:57.700> like

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
it's a drying lightweight alcohol like

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.820 
it's a drying lightweight alcohol like
this<00:05:58.390> which<00:05:58.720> we<00:05:58.870> want<00:05:59.050> to<00:05:59.110> completely<00:05:59.530> shy

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
this which we want to completely shy

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.200 
this which we want to completely shy
away<00:05:59.980> from<00:06:00.100> but<00:06:00.550> it<00:06:00.640> gives<00:06:00.730> you<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:00.910> fatty

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 
away from but it gives you a fatty

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.490 
away from but it gives you a fatty
alcohol<00:06:01.900> fatty<00:06:02.320> on<00:06:02.560> with<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:03.220> yes<00:06:03.430> solubilize

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
alcohol fatty on with it yes solubilize

alcohol fatty on with it yes solubilize
another<00:06:05.500> ingredient<00:06:05.830> into<00:06:06.490> the<00:06:06.580> formula

another ingredient into the formula

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.450 
another ingredient into the formula
exactly<00:06:07.810> so<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.080> know<00:06:08.380> don't<00:06:08.590> say<00:06:09.040> when<00:06:09.340> we

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
exactly so you know don't say when we

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.730 
exactly so you know don't say when we
say<00:06:09.610> it's<00:06:09.790> alcohol<00:06:09.970> free<00:06:10.450> we<00:06:10.630> mean<00:06:10.840> it's<00:06:11.050> free

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
say it's alcohol free we mean it's free

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.790 
say it's alcohol free we mean it's free
of<00:06:11.950> drying<00:06:12.430> my<00:06:12.730> alcohol<00:06:13.480> stripping<00:06:14.200> alcohols

of drying my alcohol stripping alcohols

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.140 
of drying my alcohol stripping alcohols
it's<00:06:15.040> important<00:06:15.490> to<00:06:15.580> position<00:06:16.030> that

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
it's important to position that

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.760 
it's important to position that
correctly<00:06:16.540> when<00:06:16.720> we're<00:06:17.110> talking<00:06:17.290> to<00:06:17.560> clients

and alcohols and say it's a dry we don't

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.480 
and alcohols and say it's a dry we don't
use<00:06:19.930> drying<00:06:20.200> alcohols<00:06:20.740> because<00:06:21.250> of<00:06:21.340> course

some alcohols are beneficial to the skin

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.500 
some alcohols are beneficial to the skin
because<00:06:23.650> they're<00:06:23.800> fatty<00:06:24.010> exactly<00:06:24.910> yeah<00:06:25.150> it's

go to to learn as much as they can about

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.370 
go to to learn as much as they can about
dermalogica<00:06:55.510> and<00:06:55.630> the<00:06:55.690> ingredients<00:06:56.170> that<00:06:56.260> we

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
dermalogica and the ingredients that we

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.320 
dermalogica and the ingredients that we
use<00:06:56.410> well<00:06:57.100> I<00:06:57.160> think<00:06:57.250> the<00:06:57.430> best<00:06:57.670> place<00:06:57.970> is<00:06:58.300> to

use well I think the best place is to

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.240
