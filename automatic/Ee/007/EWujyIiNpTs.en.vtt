because i got one of these this is a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.049 
because i got one of these this is a
hdmi<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.719> component<00:00:10.200> converter<00:00:10.700> with<00:00:11.700> audio

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
hdmi to component converter with audio

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.509 
hdmi to component converter with audio
which<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.509> very<00:00:12.719> important<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.250> this<00:00:14.250> one

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
which is very important and this one

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.750 
which is very important and this one
cost<00:00:14.910> about<00:00:15.299> forty<00:00:15.809> five<00:00:15.900> dollars<00:00:16.379> from<00:00:17.250> B&amp;H

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
cost about forty five dollars from B&amp;H

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.859 
cost about forty five dollars from B&amp;H
and<00:00:18.710> we're<00:00:19.710> set<00:00:19.980> up<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.150> sony<00:00:21.539> playstation

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
and we're set up is the sony playstation

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.700 
and we're set up is the sony playstation
4<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.490> hdmi<00:00:24.029> goes<00:00:24.539> into<00:00:24.930> this<00:00:25.050> component

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
4 the hdmi goes into this component

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160 
4 the hdmi goes into this component
converter<00:00:26.039> whether<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.269> converter<00:00:27.930> box

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
converter whether this converter box

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.780 
converter whether this converter box
right<00:00:28.410> here<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:29.189> runs<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> 5<00:00:30.029> volt<00:00:30.650> DC<00:00:31.700> so<00:00:32.700> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
right here it runs on a 5 volt DC so the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930 
right here it runs on a 5 volt DC so the
hdmi<00:00:33.149> comes<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:34.219> outputs<00:00:35.219> using<00:00:35.880> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
hdmi comes in and outputs using the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.840 
hdmi comes in and outputs using the
component<00:00:36.360> cables<00:00:36.860> now<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.700> other

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
component cables now this is the other

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.549 
component cables now this is the other
end<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> component<00:00:39.570> cable<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:40.230> goes

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
end of the component cable this goes

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.910 
end of the component cable this goes
into<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> PBR<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.930> i<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.260> either<00:00:43.379> use<00:00:43.469> my

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
into the PBR so i can either use my

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.299 
into the PBR so i can either use my
Elgato<00:00:44.340> i<00:00:44.789> can<00:00:44.910> use<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> HD<00:00:45.899> PVR<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.590> does<00:00:47.219> not

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
Elgato i can use the HD PVR it does not

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.740 
Elgato i can use the HD PVR it does not
really<00:00:47.460> matter<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:48.090> capture<00:00:48.390> device<00:00:48.629> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
really matter what capture device you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.939 
really matter what capture device you
have<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:49.230> long<00:00:49.410> as<00:00:49.649> accepts<00:00:50.399> component<00:00:51.390> inputs

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
have as long as accepts component inputs

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.450 
have as long as accepts component inputs
then<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:54.570> USB<00:00:54.840> same<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.829> goes<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
then on the USB same thing goes to the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.529 
then on the USB same thing goes to the
computer<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:58.160> hdmi<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.520> on<00:01:00.030> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
computer and the hdmi out on the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
computer and the hdmi out on the
hauppauge<00:01:02.420> on<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.600> size<00:01:03.809> hdmi<00:01:04.320> out<00:01:04.500> this

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
hauppauge on this size hdmi out this

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.320 
hauppauge on this size hdmi out this
goes<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> TV<00:01:06.799> so<00:01:07.799> here's<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.520> TV<00:01:09.090> a

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
goes out to the TV so here's the TV a

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.010 
goes out to the TV so here's the TV a
one<00:01:10.200> hand<00:01:10.350> should<00:01:10.470> point<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.780> with<00:01:12.780> this

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
one hand should point out is with this

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.240 
one hand should point out is with this
setup<00:01:13.400> there's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.760> risk<00:01:15.030> because<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
setup there's a little risk because the

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
setup there's a little risk because the
edge<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.490> those<00:01:17.670> TV<00:01:17.970> screens<00:01:18.240> must<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> over

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
edge of those TV screens must be over

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.929 
edge of those TV screens must be over
here<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.860> i<00:01:19.890> lose<00:01:20.159> about<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.580> inches

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
here so i lose about two inches

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.600 
here so i lose about two inches
everything<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.960> shift<00:01:22.290> about<00:01:22.530> two<00:01:22.710> inches<00:01:23.040> too

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
everything is shift about two inches too

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.749 
everything is shift about two inches too
far<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.210> left<00:01:24.799> so<00:01:25.799> over<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.549> two

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
far to the left so over here is two

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.560 
far to the left so over here is two
inches<00:01:26.990> of<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.229> black<00:01:28.470> bar<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:30.390> this

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
inches of just black bar and on this

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.609 
inches of just black bar and on this
side<00:01:31.460> it's<00:01:32.460> essentially<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.240> inches<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
side it's essentially two inches on the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.640 
side it's essentially two inches on the
left<00:01:34.799> border<00:01:35.310> that's<00:01:35.520> not<00:01:35.700> showing<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.240> screen

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
left border that's not showing a screen

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
left border that's not showing a screen
but<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.820> something<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.180> have<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.329> live

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
but this is something I have to live

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.730 
but this is something I have to live
