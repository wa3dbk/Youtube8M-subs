bubble you want to use your snipers

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.979 
bubble you want to use your snipers
first<00:02:05.039> then<00:02:05.640> switch<00:02:05.849> to<00:02:06.000> fly<00:02:06.420> moves<00:02:06.660> until<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:06.989 
first then switch to fly moves until it

00:02:06.989 --> 00:02:08.749 
first then switch to fly moves until it
gets<00:02:07.170> close<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.069> use<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.550> heavy

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
gets close so you can use your heavy

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
gets close so you can use your heavy
making<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> most<00:02:09.509> of<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.989> your<00:02:10.229> heavy<00:02:10.410> ammo

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
making the most of all your heavy ammo

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.920 
making the most of all your heavy ammo
but<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.610> said<00:02:11.819> though<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.030> will<00:02:12.510> need<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
but like I said though you will need the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.960 
but like I said though you will need the
point<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.379> spawn<00:02:13.620> next<00:02:14.010> year<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.760> does

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
point you spawn next year when this does

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.430 
point you spawn next year when this does
happen<00:02:15.180> though<00:02:15.390> eventually<00:02:15.540> when<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.170> mind

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
happen though eventually when that mind

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.199 
happen though eventually when that mind
spawns<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.099> void<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.550> guys<00:02:17.760> one

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
spawns to the void of you guys one

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.300 
spawns to the void of you guys one

right border over to you players keep

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.870 
right border over to you players keep
hitting<00:02:27.470> that<00:02:27.500> bus<00:02:27.830> as<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.430> can<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:28.700> in<00:02:28.819> the

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
hitting that bus as you can see in the

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.910 
hitting that bus as you can see in the
video<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.360> do<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.810> I<00:02:30.020> take<00:02:30.319> out<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> guys<00:02:30.770> that

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
video I do this I take out the guys that

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.589 
video I do this I take out the guys that
spawn<00:02:31.220> on<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.430> right<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.819> eventually<00:02:32.209> you

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
spawn on the right and eventually you

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.390 
spawn on the right and eventually you
will<00:02:32.870> do<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.349> would<00:02:33.650> say<00:02:33.830> it's<00:02:33.950> as<00:02:34.040> simple<00:02:34.190> as

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
will do it I would say it's as simple as

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.220 
will do it I would say it's as simple as
that<00:02:34.550> but<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.790> isn't<00:02:35.060> quite<00:02:35.209> simple<00:02:35.780> now<00:02:35.989> what

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that but it isn't quite simple now what

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.380 
that but it isn't quite simple now what
made<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.709> so<00:02:36.950> clutch<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.580> that<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:37.970> got<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
made this so clutch is that I got the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.150 
made this so clutch is that I got the
devourer<00:02:38.690> in<00:02:38.900> essence<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.560> didn't<00:02:40.010> even

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
devourer in essence and didn't even

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.520 
devourer in essence and didn't even
realize<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.060> got<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.450> 1<00:02:41.810> second<00:02:42.350> left

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
realize it it got to 1 second left

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.890 
realize it it got to 1 second left
before<00:02:43.160> we<00:02:43.280> killed<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> bus<00:02:43.819> a<00:02:44.030> second<00:02:44.660> longer

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
before we killed the bus a second longer

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.229 
before we killed the bus a second longer
I<00:02:45.230> would've<00:02:45.770> died<00:02:45.950> meaning<00:02:46.520> the<00:02:46.580> mine<00:02:46.819> I<00:02:46.850> had

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
I would've died meaning the mine I had

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.970 
I would've died meaning the mine I had
to<00:02:47.390> dismantle<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.140> the<00:02:48.260> enemies<00:02:48.709> I<00:02:48.860> was

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
to dismantle and the enemies I was

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.100 
to dismantle and the enemies I was
keeping<00:02:49.220> at<00:02:49.670> they<00:02:49.910> could<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.510> ruined<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.959> all

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
keeping at they could have ruined it all

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.720 
keeping at they could have ruined it all
and<00:02:51.680> I<00:02:51.739> didn't<00:02:51.950> even<00:02:52.010> realize<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.610> until

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
and I didn't even realize this until

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.610 
and I didn't even realize this until
watching<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.330> video<00:02:53.569> back<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:54.140> how<00:02:54.380> actually

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
watching the video back of how actually

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.770 
watching the video back of how actually
closed<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.250> really<00:02:55.640> was<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.269> guys<00:02:56.450> that<00:02:56.480> is<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
closed it really was but guys that is a

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.840 
closed it really was but guys that is a
technique<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.290> use<00:02:57.709> just<00:02:58.400> keep<00:02:58.580> trying

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
technique I use just keep trying

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.240 
technique I use just keep trying
eventually<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.840> will<00:03:00.170> do<00:03:00.380> it<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:01.010> I

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
eventually you will do it but like I

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.039 
eventually you will do it but like I
said<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.670> really<00:03:01.700> want<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.299> point<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.780> spawn

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
said you really want that point to spawn

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.500 
said you really want that point to spawn
next<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.530> guys<00:03:03.739> and<00:03:04.069> one<00:03:04.580> person<00:03:05.120> when

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
next to you guys and one person when

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.970 
next to you guys and one person when
that<00:03:05.690> point<00:03:05.930> does<00:03:06.140> spore<00:03:06.380> next<00:03:06.620> to<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:06.769> guys

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
that point does spore next to you guys

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.800 
that point does spore next to you guys
needs<00:03:07.519> to<00:03:07.700> start<00:03:07.970> shooting<00:03:08.209> at<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.540> enemies

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
needs to start shooting at the enemies

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.570 
needs to start shooting at the enemies
that<00:03:08.900> spawn<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.290> right<00:03:09.650> while<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.430> other

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
that spawn on you right while the other

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.460 
that spawn on you right while the other
two<00:03:10.760> guys<00:03:10.970> concentrate<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.780> putting<00:03:12.019> damage

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
two guys concentrate on putting damage

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.890 
two guys concentrate on putting damage
into<00:03:12.799> that<00:03:12.920> bus<00:03:13.190> and<00:03:13.489> weapons<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.299> said<00:03:14.510> do

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
into that bus and weapons like I said do

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.440 
into that bus and weapons like I said do
really<00:03:15.290> matter<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:15.739> need<00:03:16.069> powerful<00:03:16.730> high

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
really matter you need powerful high
