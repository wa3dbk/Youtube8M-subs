00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.460 
fact that they're only kind of similar
to<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.910> episodes<00:03:32.360> they're<00:03:32.630> supposedly<00:03:33.020> based

but<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.270> guess<00:04:10.540> there<00:04:10.990> are<00:04:11.020> a<00:04:11.230> few<00:04:11.590> nice<00:04:11.830> rights

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
but I guess there are a few nice rights

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.010 
but I guess there are a few nice rights
some<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.880> them<00:04:12.970> actually<00:04:13.150> maintained<00:04:13.810> that

time<00:04:17.200> it<00:04:17.350> only<00:04:17.680> makes<00:04:17.980> you<00:04:18.070> wish<00:04:18.250> the<00:04:18.459> game<00:04:18.700> did

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030
