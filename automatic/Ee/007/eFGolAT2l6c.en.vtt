on<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.410> lower<00:00:48.560> part<00:00:48.890> here<00:00:48.920> because<00:00:49.850> we're

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
on the lower part here because we're

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.639 
on the lower part here because we're
running<00:00:50.149> a<00:00:50.360> lower<00:00:50.510> larger<00:00:51.200> lower<00:00:51.350> bearing

running a lower larger lower bearing

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.380 
running a lower larger lower bearing
here<00:00:51.950> the<00:00:52.280> cross<00:00:52.489> section<00:00:52.880> is<00:00:52.940> much<00:00:53.120> bigger

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
here the cross section is much bigger

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.630 
here the cross section is much bigger
which<00:00:54.050> means<00:00:54.079> that<00:00:54.680> it's<00:00:54.860> stiffer<00:00:55.160> and<00:00:55.520> it's

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
which means that it's stiffer and it's

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.850 
which means that it's stiffer and it's
also<00:00:55.790> lighter<00:00:56.149> next<00:00:57.050> part<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.380> this<00:00:57.500> bike<00:00:57.680> is

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
also lighter next part of this bike is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.680 
also lighter next part of this bike is
the<00:00:57.980> seat<00:00:58.190> mast<00:00:58.430> and<00:00:58.670> cap<00:00:58.820> design<00:00:59.180> so<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.540> is

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
the seat mast and cap design so this is

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.360 
the seat mast and cap design so this is
the<00:00:59.780> cap<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.170> this<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> mast<00:01:00.770> so<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.190> cap

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
the cap and this is the mast so the cap

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.270 
the cap and this is the mast so the cap
actually<00:01:01.610> goes<00:01:01.880> down<00:01:02.120> over<00:01:02.149> the<00:01:02.540> mast<00:01:03.280> what

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
actually goes down over the mast what

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.609 
actually goes down over the mast what
this<00:01:04.790> design<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.270> enabling<00:01:05.869> us<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.080> do<00:01:06.320> is<00:01:06.470> move

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
this design is enabling us to do is move

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.440 
this design is enabling us to do is move
the<00:01:06.830> clamp<00:01:07.100> away<00:01:07.490> from<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.000> part<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
the clamp away from this part of the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.240 
the clamp away from this part of the
frame<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:08.930> that<00:01:09.080> now<00:01:09.350> we<00:01:09.410> can<00:01:09.710> actually<00:01:09.860> right

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
frame so that now we can actually right

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.609 
frame so that now we can actually right
tune<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.790> bike<00:01:10.970> right<00:01:11.720> here<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.259> that<00:01:12.410> there's

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
tune the bike right here so that there's

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.770 
tune the bike right here so that there's
a<00:01:12.680> more<00:01:13.190> vertical<00:01:13.430> compliance<00:01:14.180> in<00:01:14.300> this<00:01:14.539> part

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
a more vertical compliance in this part

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.870 
a more vertical compliance in this part
of<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:14.960> frame<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:15.200> there's<00:01:15.530> ride<00:01:16.250> quality<00:01:16.850> a

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
of the frame so there's ride quality a

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.999 
of the frame so there's ride quality a
ride<00:01:17.180> field<00:01:17.630> designed<00:01:18.200> into<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.710> part<00:01:18.950> of

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
ride field designed into that part of

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.320 
ride field designed into that part of
the<00:01:19.070> frame<00:01:19.250> because<00:01:19.520> we've<00:01:19.700> moved<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.090> clamp

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
the frame because we've moved the clamp

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.359 
the frame because we've moved the clamp
around<00:01:20.659> there's<00:01:21.320> two<00:01:21.500> different<00:01:21.650> size<00:01:22.010> caps

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
around there's two different size caps

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.160 
around there's two different size caps
that<00:01:22.549> we<00:01:22.700> offer<00:01:23.030> here<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.750> then<00:01:23.869> three

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
that we offer here and then three

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.080 
that we offer here and then three
different<00:01:24.500> offsets<00:01:24.950> so<00:01:25.220> we<00:01:25.610> can<00:01:25.760> fit<00:01:25.940> just

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
different offsets so we can fit just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.020 
different offsets so we can fit just
about<00:01:26.210> any<00:01:26.479> rider<00:01:26.780> on<00:01:27.350> any<00:01:27.560> bike<00:01:27.799> we're<00:01:28.700> making

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
about any rider on any bike we're making

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.840 
about any rider on any bike we're making

chainstay<00:01:50.180> yoke<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:50.630> this<00:01:51.049> bike<00:01:51.259> is

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
chainstay yoke so this bike is

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.620 
chainstay yoke so this bike is
incredibly<00:01:52.460> stiff<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:52.909> responsive<00:01:53.420> in<00:01:53.540> the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
incredibly stiff and responsive in the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.469 
incredibly stiff and responsive in the
bottom<00:01:53.869> bracket<00:01:53.930> area<00:01:54.970> it's<00:01:55.970> also<00:01:56.060> lighter

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
bottom bracket area it's also lighter

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.539 
bottom bracket area it's also lighter
because<00:01:56.780> we<00:01:57.110> are<00:01:57.259> are<00:01:57.830> using<00:01:58.040> a<00:01:58.250> technology

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
because we are are using a technology

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.910 
because we are are using a technology
that's<00:01:59.119> called<00:01:59.390> net<00:01:59.659> molding<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.619> bottom

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
that's called net molding so the bottom

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.289 
that's called net molding so the bottom

total weight on this bike as it sits

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.840 
total weight on this bike as it sits
here<00:02:10.030> is<00:02:10.119> 15<00:02:10.479> pounds<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.110> we're<00:02:11.560> almost<00:02:11.830> over

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
here is 15 pounds so we're almost over

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.800 
here is 15 pounds so we're almost over
under<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.870> UCI<00:02:14.200> weight<00:02:14.500> limit
