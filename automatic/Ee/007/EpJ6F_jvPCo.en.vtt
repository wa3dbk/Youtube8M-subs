00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.029
 6th 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.129
 We're going to prepare now. 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.799
 our little sister 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.679
 and reached the goal 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.039
 I'll prepare the butter with garlic 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.860
 for this I'll tell you three tablespoons of butter at room temperature 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.730
 with a tablespoon 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 of salt with seasoning 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 and with the equivalent of the presidency 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 more or less a tablespoon 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 the impasse 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.940
 and I'm going to ask my one mile piece 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.700
 so mine is part of the rump for those who do not know 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.360
 she has the sense of fiber also to cut to stay soft like what we 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.230
 let's do it 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.620
 Look here the fiber ran to the side here is the other so we know how I 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.010
 I'll cut like you used to so I make a mark with a knife. 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.220
 so I see that the 5th fiber in that sense 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950
 she runs and in that sense 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.740
 and here in the sense 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.869
 1 slightly different then what I'll do since she's cutting 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.869
 Running like this, I'm going to make marks like this. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.560
 on the perpendicular as I did 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.580
 pass this page 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.900
 a sudden deference because she'll give a touch of black pepper 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.260
 River 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.260
 done that I'll bring peace to oscar 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:25.999
 our goal 

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:27.369
 as a suggestion 

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:30.399
 so mine made with 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.399
 I used a colored pepper stew 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.059
 and how to decorate your minced steering wheel 

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:38.419
 on the meta site 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:42.719
 accompaniment of tomato vinaigrette en so here is the suggestion for you
