the<00:02:40.580> video<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.060> doing<00:02:41.300> it<00:02:41.420> but<00:02:41.570> first<00:02:41.810> after

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
the video of doing it but first after

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.770 
the video of doing it but first after
perfected<00:02:42.470> myself<00:02:42.830> for<00:02:43.670> drums<00:02:44.030> kilcannon<00:02:44.480> so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
perfected myself for drums kilcannon so

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.270 
perfected myself for drums kilcannon so
that's<00:02:44.930> really<00:02:45.200> really<00:02:45.350> helpful<00:02:45.620> it's<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
that's really really helpful it's a

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.130 
that's really really helpful it's a
Kendall's<00:02:46.460> like<00:02:46.670> seventy<00:02:47.090> percent<00:02:47.210> done<00:02:47.600> the

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
Kendall's like seventy percent done the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.510 
Kendall's like seventy percent done the
for<00:02:48.380> drones<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.800> still<00:02:48.980> probably<00:02:49.160> kill<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
for drones can still probably kill the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.390 
for drones can still probably kill the
cannon<00:02:49.820> just<00:02:50.060> because<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:51.020> yes<00:02:51.710> I<00:02:52.160> don't<00:02:52.340> know

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
cannon just because it yes I don't know

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.460 
cannon just because it yes I don't know
why<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.700> can<00:02:53.660> suck<00:02:54.140> when<00:02:54.320> they're

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
why it just can suck when they're

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.500 
why it just can suck when they're
morphing<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.040> yeah<00:02:55.670> it's<00:02:55.940> really<00:02:56.120> helpful<00:02:56.360> I

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
morphing and yeah it's really helpful I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.060 
morphing and yeah it's really helpful I
probably<00:02:56.690> post<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.990> video<00:02:57.140> when<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.410> perfect

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
probably post a video when I perfect

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.610 
probably post a video when I perfect

for<00:04:46.530> that<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.830> because<00:04:46.860> carapace<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:47.580> just<00:04:47.879> so

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
for that is because carapace is just so

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.179 
for that is because carapace is just so

temperature with me and I did pick pick

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:02.490 
temperature with me and I did pick pick
off<00:07:00.400> that<00:07:00.580> temp<00:07:00.820> and<00:07:01.030> I'll<00:07:01.180> run<00:07:01.360> I<00:07:01.600> just<00:07:02.350> need

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
off that temp and I'll run I just need

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.050 
off that temp and I'll run I just need
to<00:07:02.530> pick<00:07:02.680> off<00:07:02.830> a<00:07:02.860> temp<00:07:03.190> and<00:07:03.430> now<00:07:03.820> i'm<00:07:03.910> going<00:07:04.000> to

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:04.060 
to pick off a temp and now i'm going to

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.740 
to pick off a temp and now i'm going to
try<00:07:04.150> to<00:07:04.210> one<00:07:04.300> pass<00:07:04.710> damn<00:07:05.710> bad<00:07:06.430> idea<00:07:06.730> it's<00:07:07.480> bad

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:07.750 
try to one pass damn bad idea it's bad

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.180 
try to one pass damn bad idea it's bad
when<00:07:07.930> you<00:07:08.020> double<00:07:08.260> take<00:07:08.410> to<00:07:08.440> double<00:07:08.830> think

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:09.190 
when you double take to double think

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.430 
when you double take to double think
something<00:07:09.610> because<00:07:09.970> if<00:07:10.660> you<00:07:10.810> overthink<00:07:11.290> it

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 
something because if you overthink it

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.810 
something because if you overthink it
then<00:07:11.740> you're<00:07:12.070> going<00:07:12.190> to<00:07:12.280> go<00:07:12.340> back<00:07:12.610> you're

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820 
then you're going to go back you're

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
then you're going to go back you're
going<00:07:12.940> to<00:07:13.030> go<00:07:13.120> and<00:07:13.240> you're<00:07:13.360> going<00:07:13.450> to<00:07:13.540> go<00:07:13.630> back

going to go and you're going to go back

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.360 
going to go and you're going to go back
and<00:07:13.870> then<00:07:14.140> when<00:07:14.380> you<00:07:14.470> do<00:07:14.650> it<00:07:14.770> over<00:07:15.100> all<00:07:15.220> that

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
and then when you do it over all that

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.500 
and then when you do it over all that
you're<00:07:15.520> going<00:07:15.610> to<00:07:15.700> lose<00:07:15.790> like<00:07:15.940> so<00:07:16.180> much<00:07:16.300> extra

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:16.510 
you're going to lose like so much extra

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:17.940 
you're going to lose like so much extra
units<00:07:16.840> like<00:07:16.960> if<00:07:17.110> you<00:07:17.200> think<00:07:17.380> I'm<00:07:17.770> gonna<00:07:17.890> go

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:17.950 
units like if you think I'm gonna go

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.380 
units like if you think I'm gonna go
tech<00:07:18.190> and<00:07:18.400> they're<00:07:18.520> like<00:07:18.670> no<00:07:18.700> way<00:07:18.940> I<00:07:18.970> can<00:07:19.270> do

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
tech and they're like no way I can do

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.400 
tech and they're like no way I can do
that<00:07:19.420> then<00:07:19.720> you're<00:07:19.810> like<00:07:19.960> oh<00:07:20.080> I'm<00:07:20.170> gonna<00:07:20.230> go

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.410 
that then you're like oh I'm gonna go
attack<00:07:20.620> him<00:07:20.770> and<00:07:20.890> you<00:07:21.010> double<00:07:21.550> think<00:07:21.700> it<00:07:21.820> or

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:22.420 
attack him and you double think it or

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.000 
attack him and you double think it or
overthink<00:07:22.990> it<00:07:23.110> then<00:07:23.470> you're<00:07:23.770> gonna<00:07:23.830> be

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
overthink it then you're gonna be

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.000 
screwed because you in to do so many

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.300 
screwed because you in to do so many
units<00:07:25.300> in<00:07:25.510> just<00:07:25.690> the<00:07:25.780> thinking<00:07:26.080> process<00:07:26.230> and<00:07:26.830> I

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
units in just the thinking process and I

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:28.530 
units in just the thinking process and I
have<00:07:27.520> Burrell<00:07:27.730> except<00:07:28.120> I<00:07:28.180> don't<00:07:28.240> want<00:07:28.480> to

guard then it really rapes them and I

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.130 
guard then it really rapes them and I
don't<00:08:16.090> know<00:08:16.150> if<00:08:16.270> this<00:08:16.419> is<00:08:16.450> a<00:08:16.570> helpful<00:08:16.750> or<00:08:17.020> not
