00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.979
 many of us would like to have a dog that will be a real companion 

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:30.339
 or warrior of the road but I have the feeling that there are some things 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.370
 important to know before you can take a trip for this I have 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.329
 invited my old friend as well as expert of martin di vita dog dogs 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.130
 to face the road with my puppy 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.520
 the pleasure my gimp 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.570
 I heard you want advice on traveling with your Syrian dog I imagine 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.879
 are some things to know before traveling with a real puppy 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.500
 certainly because traveling for a puppy can be enough 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.390
 traumatic 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.480
 accelerations, braking and so on can disturb him a lot but 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.420
 the good news is that it is possible to train them and in the end they can't wait 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 to jump in the car to go somewhere 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 then you march what the first thing I need to know to put my puppy 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.900
 on the road so to speak 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.219
 excellent gimp question 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.649
 people often forget a very important thing when they go to get a 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:24.770
 new puppy at the pet store prunes a breeder gets it up in 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.630
 car to take it home and unfortunately we do not realize that that is his 

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.979
 first experience of this kind right so make sure you have a 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.590
 towel is even more important a friend who can keep the dog like her 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.669
 people too must travel safely bye what are the options to do yes 

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.960
 that is a dog make sure in the car the cars are not equipped of series with 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:47.770
 safety belts for dogs 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.320
 youtube there are safety belts for dogs to be fixed to 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.530
 normal car safety belts 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.340
 my friend giorgio that wonderful 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.010
 george is beautiful and right 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.160
 now put it on because I put an ok harness on it 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.780
 a safety harness 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.499
 this is an ungrateful caring for dogs 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:12.379
 in the car there are seat belts you join them and you get a dog 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.269
 perfectly safe on the fantastic back seat and easy belts 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.259
 for puppies exact so if you have to make a sharp braking bone for yours 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.740
 misfortune in the accident 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.410
 this little dog does not become a bullet fired from the back seats 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.930
 right judgment my puppy resembles me who suffers a bit from 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.639
 claustrophobia in the car 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.489
 well some dogs can't stand harness so you have to get used to it 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.609
 we can do it at home we can put on the harness and sit with them in the car 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:41.370
 drink a coffee or read a book 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 turning on the air conditioning if necessary none of the Mohicans drink the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.989
 coffee badly better this way 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.010
 then when it looks calm and comfortable with harness you can proceed 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.139
 always remember to praise him when you are good and when he is calm and 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:01.090
 It is necessary that you get used to it and I suppose that the more you are water it juke it too 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.880
 certainly not 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.199
 obviously at the beginning you do very short laps and then you go home immediately 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.989
 maybe later let him eat and associate the car trip with something 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.369
 pleasant not immediately with a visit to the vet because you understand a needle in the 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:17.640
 neck a thermometer and back association 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.259
 Not registered There are other options to consider for car doors 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:28.069
 you have to use ny transports for honest sheep and dogs are in the 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.779
 transport in the trunk at the back there feel comfortable safe is one 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:36.429
 space for them a little hole 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:40.599
 when my puppy is comfortable with short gvt then I can start 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.860
 with intercontinental travel 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.520
 sure after a while the puppy will think I have the keys to the car siatel garage 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.860
 we go around and jump abortion will be happy yes 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.310
 but right tel to wait before getting on before getting out of the car yes and 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.950
 don't forget your steps every now and then there's some bisognino to do like that 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.450
 I like to stop for lunch at the pits I like to think that it becomes the boss 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.349
 of the staff that takes care of him 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.199
 yours are great tips as there is always something we haven't talked about 

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:15.079
 also important to you should be obvious 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.849
 but unfortunately every year many dogs die in accidents or because they come 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.610
 left too long in closed cars 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.690
 excessive dehydration heat dehydration 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.260
 many bad accidents happen so never leave a dog in a car in 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.819
 cost for fingers for no reason 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:38.390
 l too important a tip for newborn wines 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.540
 I feel safe if I have to take my dog ​​in the car to take a trip 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.590
 highway 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.550
 mail you tell me tivoli 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.560
 eyepiece sitav with my dog ​​not in the literal sense but take a plane in 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.499
 In this case, what rules should I follow 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.620
 it's a great question for those who have traveled with dogs often across the Atlantic 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.250
 it must be remembered that every dog ​​must have its documents vaccinations 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.020
 updated is a certificate from the right sanitary veterinarian 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.729
 the airline must see these documents and it is better if you are traveling than 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.280
 early morning or late afternoon in case of waiting it is cooler on the runway than 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.349
 take off 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:18.830
 I also prefer direct flights 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.080
 small dogs under 20 pounds I think they are around 8 pounds can be 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.969
 transported special cages under the seat the larger ones instead go 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:28.849
 in the hold 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.330
 school carla that you speak as an expert who knows his business thanks a lot of martins is

 It was a pleasure to have you here as always 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.349
 people just remember that traveling with your puppy is always a pleasure if he 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:44.349
 he is used he has taught how to behave in the car 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.500
 I will not do that. 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.720
