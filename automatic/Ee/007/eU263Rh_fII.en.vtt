things which are important one is the

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.490 
things which are important one is the
the<00:05:24.770> commercial<00:05:25.340> side<00:05:25.720> and<00:05:26.720> the<00:05:26.840> other<00:05:27.020> one<00:05:27.140> is

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
the commercial side and the other one is

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.350 
the commercial side and the other one is
a<00:05:27.560> site<00:05:28.630> which<00:05:29.630> gives<00:05:30.020> us<00:05:30.229> the<00:05:30.530> opportunity<00:05:31.360> to

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360

to fulfill our ideas
I<00:05:35.570> will<00:05:36.220> first<00:05:37.220> mention<00:05:37.700> to<00:05:37.850> the<00:05:37.970> second<00:05:38.330> one

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
I will first mention to the second one

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.280 
I will first mention to the second one
because<00:05:40.840> it's<00:05:41.840> a<00:05:41.960> relationship<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.860> all<00:05:43.130> other

experiences we had in the world
especially<00:05:47.330> in<00:05:47.870> Europe<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:49.780> possibilities

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
especially in Europe the possibilities

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.460 
especially in Europe the possibilities
to<00:05:51.229> create<00:05:51.470> no<00:05:52.040> new<00:05:52.790> ideas<00:05:52.820> and<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.780> do<00:05:54.050> new

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
to create no new ideas and to do new

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.570 
to create no new ideas and to do new
things<00:05:55.360> more<00:05:56.360> regional<00:05:57.020> architecture<00:05:57.919> is

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
things more regional architecture is

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.130 
things more regional architecture is
much<00:05:58.880> greater<00:05:59.180> in<00:05:59.620> China<00:06:00.620> because<00:06:01.040> the<00:06:01.610> the<00:06:02.510> it

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
much greater in China because the the it
