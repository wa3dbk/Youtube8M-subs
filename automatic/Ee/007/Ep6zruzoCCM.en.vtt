that acid oh like acid is make it makes
up<00:01:32.280> most<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.850> fat<00:01:33.150> that's<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.479> avocados

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
up most of the fat that's in avocados

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
up most of the fat that's in avocados
and<00:01:34.530> it's<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:34.920> similar<00:01:35.430> fat<00:01:35.759> composition

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
and it's a very similar fat composition

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
and it's a very similar fat composition
to<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> olive<00:01:37.619> oil<00:01:37.710> which<00:01:37.950> we

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
to that in all is in olive oil which we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.800 
to that in all is in olive oil which we
already<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.700> they're<00:01:38.970> good<00:01:39.270> for<00:01:39.420> us<00:01:39.570> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
already know they're good for us and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.760 
already know they're good for us and
last<00:01:40.590> but<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:40.829> least<00:01:40.890> number<00:01:41.610> four<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.840> I've

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
last but not least number four so I've

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.770 
last but not least number four so I've
avocados<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.490> actually<00:01:44.970> help<00:01:45.180> regulate<00:01:45.750> your

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
avocados can actually help regulate your

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
avocados can actually help regulate your
blood<00:01:46.049> sugar<00:01:46.409> levels<00:01:46.799> because<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
blood sugar levels because they are a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.850 
blood sugar levels because they are a
relatively<00:01:48.030> low<00:01:48.390> carb<00:01:48.780> food<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.710> also

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
relatively low carb food and are also

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.550 
relatively low carb food and are also
low<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:50.700> sugar<00:01:51.000> content<00:01:51.720> which<00:01:52.229> makes<00:01:52.439> them

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
low in sugar content which makes them

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
low in sugar content which makes them
really<00:01:52.740> low<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.490> glycemic<00:01:53.520> index<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
really low on the glycemic index and

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.810 
really low on the glycemic index and
they<00:01:55.140> also<00:01:55.290> contain<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.710> lot<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> dietary<00:01:56.549> fiber

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
they also contain a lot of dietary fiber

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
they also contain a lot of dietary fiber
I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.420> avocado<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:58.110> 78<00:01:58.530> grams<00:01:58.890> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I think one avocado has 78 grams of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.469 
I think one avocado has 78 grams of
fiber<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> which<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.119> known<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> help

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
fiber in it which is known to help

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.910 
fiber in it which is known to help
regulate<00:02:00.899> your<00:02:00.930> blood<00:02:01.079> sugar<00:02:01.350> levels<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
regulate your blood sugar levels so

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.500 
regulate your blood sugar levels so
that's<00:02:02.549> plus<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> everything

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
that's plus and that is everything

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.240 
that's plus and that is everything
I<00:02:04.570> hope<00:02:04.870> you<00:02:04.960> guys<00:02:05.080> enjoyed<00:02:05.440> this<00:02:05.590> segment<00:02:05.830> and
