00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.330 

going<00:00:02.200> into<00:00:02.380> the<00:00:02.440> season<00:00:02.590> six<00:00:02.860> battles<00:00:03.220> I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.340 
going into the season six battles I

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.059 
going into the season six battles I
think<00:00:03.670> that<00:00:03.820> we<00:00:04.090> still<00:00:04.300> have<00:00:04.510> a<00:00:04.540> lot<00:00:04.810> to<00:00:05.109> learn

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
think that we still have a lot to learn

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.330 
think that we still have a lot to learn
about<00:00:06.130> the<00:00:06.670> team<00:00:06.880> so<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.799> battle<00:00:09.100> rounds<00:00:09.280> are

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.340 
about the team so the battle rounds are

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.590 
about the team so the battle rounds are
almost<00:00:09.580> the<00:00:09.670> time<00:00:09.820> where<00:00:10.000> I<00:00:10.030> get<00:00:10.299> to<00:00:10.420> really

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:10.600 
almost the time where I get to really

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.420 
almost the time where I get to really
dig<00:00:10.869> in<00:00:11.020> to<00:00:11.080> see<00:00:11.379> what's<00:00:12.010> happening<00:00:12.340> because

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
dig in to see what's happening because

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.830 
dig in to see what's happening because
the<00:00:12.610> Blind<00:00:12.820> Auditions<00:00:12.879> are<00:00:13.240> so<00:00:13.360> crazy<00:00:13.660> and

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
the Blind Auditions are so crazy and

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.199 
the Blind Auditions are so crazy and
quick<00:00:14.110> and<00:00:14.320> frantic<00:00:15.250> so<00:00:15.340> this<00:00:15.459> is<00:00:15.580> basically<00:00:16.090> a

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
quick and frantic so this is basically a

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.029 
quick and frantic so this is basically a
moment<00:00:16.539> to<00:00:16.660> take<00:00:17.289> stock<00:00:17.619> and<00:00:17.650> what's

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
moment to take stock and what's

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.999 
moment to take stock and what's
happening<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:20.320> some<00:00:20.470> quick<00:00:20.560> decisions

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
happening and make some quick decisions

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.279 
happening and make some quick decisions
but<00:00:21.130> also<00:00:21.220> kind<00:00:21.609> of<00:00:21.810> start<00:00:22.810> to<00:00:22.900> narrow<00:00:23.050> it<00:00:23.259> down

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
but also kind of start to narrow it down

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.249 
but also kind of start to narrow it down
based<00:00:23.679> on<00:00:23.919> kind<00:00:24.730> of<00:00:24.849> a<00:00:25.259> instantaneous

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
based on kind of a instantaneous

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:27.720 
based on kind of a instantaneous
reaction<00:00:26.650> it's<00:00:26.800> almost<00:00:27.039> kind<00:00:27.339> of<00:00:27.400> like<00:00:27.579> the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
reaction it's almost kind of like the

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.880 
reaction it's almost kind of like the
blinds<00:00:27.970> in<00:00:28.089> a<00:00:28.179> way<00:00:28.329> because<00:00:28.630> you<00:00:29.529> prepared

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
blinds in a way because you prepared

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.929 
blinds in a way because you prepared
them<00:00:30.009> a<00:00:30.039> little<00:00:30.249> bit<00:00:30.339> for<00:00:30.519> it<00:00:30.550> but<00:00:30.759> at<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.909> end

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
them a little bit for it but at the end

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.429 
them a little bit for it but at the end
of<00:00:31.089> the<00:00:31.150> day<00:00:31.269> you're<00:00:31.480> seeing<00:00:31.749> them<00:00:31.869> like<00:00:32.110> only

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
of the day you're seeing them like only

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.939 
of the day you're seeing them like only
for<00:00:32.560> the<00:00:32.619> second<00:00:32.920> time<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.809> it's<00:00:35.410> just<00:00:35.559> kind<00:00:35.920> of

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
for the second time so it's just kind of

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.979 
for the second time so it's just kind of
whittling<00:00:36.250> away<00:00:36.340> at<00:00:36.850> something<00:00:37.239> but<00:00:37.390> it's

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:37.989 
whittling away at something but it's

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.240 
whittling away at something but it's
hard<00:00:38.260> in<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.440> beginning<00:00:38.530> because<00:00:39.010> you<00:00:39.039> don't

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
hard in the beginning because you don't

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.010 
hard in the beginning because you don't
know<00:00:39.370> everybody<00:00:39.699> very<00:00:39.910> well<00:00:40.059> so<00:00:40.510> it's<00:00:40.989> a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
know everybody very well so it's a

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.790 
know everybody very well so it's a
challenging<00:00:41.440> part<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.039> the<00:00:42.100> process<00:00:42.399> for<00:00:42.489> me

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.190 

every<00:00:45.250> team<00:00:45.820> every<00:00:46.150> season<00:00:46.720> is<00:00:46.990> very

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
every team every season is very

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.940 
every team every season is very
different

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
different

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.570 
different
I<00:00:47.980> can't<00:00:48.870> remember<00:00:49.870> any<00:00:50.470> team<00:00:50.920> being<00:00:51.190> like<00:00:51.400> any

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
I can't remember any team being like any

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.670 
I can't remember any team being like any
other<00:00:51.790> sometimes<00:00:52.780> you<00:00:52.930> have<00:00:53.080> people<00:00:53.470> where

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
other sometimes you have people where

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.170 
other sometimes you have people where
you<00:00:53.800> start<00:00:54.100> off<00:00:54.250> with<00:00:54.280> everybody<00:00:54.940> being<00:00:55.090> so

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
you start off with everybody being so

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.470 
you start off with everybody being so
strong<00:00:55.810> and<00:00:56.140> then<00:00:56.230> all<00:00:57.220> of<00:00:57.340> a<00:00:57.490> sudden<00:00:57.520> somebody

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
strong and then all of a sudden somebody

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.120 
strong and then all of a sudden somebody
has<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.660> bad<00:00:58.810> day<00:00:58.870> or<00:00:59.290> multiple<00:00:59.590> people<00:00:59.980> have<00:01:00.100> a

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
has a bad day or multiple people have a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.470 
has a bad day or multiple people have a
bad<00:01:00.280> day<00:01:00.490> of<00:01:00.610> people<00:01:00.820> who<00:01:00.970> were<00:01:01.090> banking<00:01:01.360> on

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
bad day of people who were banking on

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.350 
bad day of people who were banking on
from<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.750> beginning<00:01:02.670> people<00:01:03.670> surprised<00:01:04.150> you

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
from the beginning people surprised you

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.580 
from the beginning people surprised you
that<00:01:04.540> weren't<00:01:04.720> as<00:01:04.930> strong<00:01:05.050> in<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.290> beginning

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
that weren't as strong in the beginning

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.900 
that weren't as strong in the beginning
that<00:01:05.710> wind<00:01:05.890> up<00:01:06.040> really<00:01:06.340> kind<00:01:06.520> of<00:01:06.580> coming<00:01:06.820> into

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:06.910 
that wind up really kind of coming into

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:08.940 
that wind up really kind of coming into
their<00:01:07.060> own<00:01:07.090> and<00:01:07.210> being<00:01:07.480> great<00:01:07.780> there's<00:01:08.740> no

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
their own and being great there's no

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.980 
their own and being great there's no
rhyme<00:01:09.190> or<00:01:09.220> reason<00:01:09.370> to<00:01:09.610> it<00:01:09.730> it<00:01:09.940> just<00:01:10.120> kind<00:01:10.960> of

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
rhyme or reason to it it just kind of

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.540 
rhyme or reason to it it just kind of
happens<00:01:11.290> right<00:01:11.380> before<00:01:11.650> your<00:01:11.740> eyes<00:01:11.800> so<00:01:12.190> I<00:01:12.220> like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
happens right before your eyes so I like

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.800 
happens right before your eyes so I like
the<00:01:12.700> fact<00:01:12.730> that<00:01:12.970> it's<00:01:13.090> actually<00:01:13.150> happening<00:01:13.660> in

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
the fact that it's actually happening in

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.490 
the fact that it's actually happening in
real<00:01:13.930> time<00:01:13.960> there's<00:01:14.410> no<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.750> know<00:01:16.870> smoke<00:01:17.350> and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
real time there's no you know smoke and

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:18.930 
real time there's no you know smoke and
mirrors<00:01:17.800> but<00:01:17.950> it<00:01:18.190> makes<00:01:18.550> it<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:18.729> much<00:01:18.790> more

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
mirrors but it makes it that much more

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.760 
mirrors but it makes it that much more
challenging<00:01:19.450> for<00:01:19.479> me<00:01:19.660> to<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.350> do<00:01:20.470> it<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.650> right

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
challenging for me to to do it the right

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.480 
challenging for me to to do it the right
way

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 

I<00:01:23.640> started<00:01:24.180> last<00:01:24.390> year<00:01:24.630> not<00:01:24.869> having<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
I started last year not having a

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.499 
I started last year not having a
strategy<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
strategy because I don't think you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.850 
strategy because I don't think you
really<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.869> have<00:01:27.899> a<00:01:28.020> strategy<00:01:28.500> when<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.649> comes

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
really can have a strategy when it comes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
really can have a strategy when it comes
to<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.610> music<00:01:30.149> and<00:01:30.360> something<00:01:31.200> that's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
to this and music and something that's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.889 
to this and music and something that's
very<00:01:31.470> kind<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.430> visceral<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.720> the

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
very kind of visceral and and in the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.260 
very kind of visceral and and in the
moment<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.320> think<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.740> have<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.270> from

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
moment I think that you have to be from

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.149 
moment I think that you have to be from
my<00:01:36.509> perspective<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.080> have<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> prepare

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
my perspective I have to kind of prepare

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.950 
my perspective I have to kind of prepare
them<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.820> their<00:01:38.970> best<00:01:39.149> but<00:01:39.390> then<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.720> have<00:01:39.840> to

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
them to be their best but then I have to

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.929 
them to be their best but then I have to
kind<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.229> be<00:01:40.439> unprepared<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.189> what<00:01:41.700> I'm<00:01:41.820> gonna

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
kind of be unprepared for what I'm gonna

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
kind of be unprepared for what I'm gonna
hear<00:01:42.210> because<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.810> don't<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.649> I

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
hear because I don't really know and I

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
hear because I don't really know and I
think<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:45.000> try<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.210> give<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.600> what

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
think that you try to give them what

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200 
think that you try to give them what
they<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.490> at<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.670> crucial<00:01:47.850> point

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
they need and then at that crucial point

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.969 
they need and then at that crucial point
we<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.479> decide<00:01:48.780> it's<00:01:49.080> like<00:01:49.229> okay<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.890> we

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
we have to decide it's like okay here we

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:50.899 
we have to decide it's like okay here we
go

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
go

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.669 
go
you<00:01:51.539> have<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.689> forget<00:01:51.960> about<00:01:52.020> all<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> advice

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
you have to forget about all the advice

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.699 
you have to forget about all the advice
and<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:54.030> based<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.470> whether<00:01:55.470> somebody

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
and not go based on whether somebody

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.469 
and not go based on whether somebody
improved<00:01:56.190> or<00:01:56.369> didn't<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.940> based<00:01:57.149> on<00:01:57.270> who's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
improved or didn't and go based on who's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
improved or didn't and go based on who's
gonna<00:01:57.569> actually<00:01:57.840> win<00:01:58.319> the<00:01:58.470> battle<00:01:58.740> round<00:01:58.920> and

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
gonna actually win the battle round and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.560 
gonna actually win the battle round and
that's<00:01:59.240> that's<00:02:00.240> hard<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.899> do

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.550 

I've<00:02:03.600> actually<00:02:03.750> learned<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.110> lot<00:02:04.230> from<00:02:04.290> other

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
I've actually learned a lot from other

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.190 
I've actually learned a lot from other
coaches<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> experience<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.900> seeing

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
coaches just the experience of seeing

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.010 
coaches just the experience of seeing
how<00:02:07.320> they<00:02:07.500> work<00:02:08.420> taking<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.810> best

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
how they work taking I think the best

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.480 
how they work taking I think the best
attributes<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.740> all<00:02:10.830> have<00:02:11.009> as<00:02:11.130> coaches

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
attributes that they all have as coaches

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.030 
attributes that they all have as coaches
of<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.730> other<00:02:12.390> five<00:02:12.810> people<00:02:13.410> because<00:02:13.950> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
of the other five people because you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.800 
of the other five people because you
know<00:02:14.100> there's<00:02:14.280> been<00:02:14.340> six<00:02:14.580> of<00:02:14.760> us<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.030> far<00:02:15.209> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
when we came to do the show for the

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.240 
when we came to do the show for the
first<00:02:30.460> time<00:02:30.700> Mark<00:02:31.180> Burnett<00:02:31.890> sat<00:02:32.890> in<00:02:33.010> a<00:02:33.040> room

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
concern was how do we be the antithesis

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.630 
concern was how do we be the antithesis
of<00:02:38.320> what<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.530> lot<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.740> these<00:02:38.800> shows<00:02:39.040> are<00:02:39.280> which

feel badly for the about what they're
doing<00:02:58.150> even<00:02:58.300> if<00:02:58.630> they're<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.870> worst<00:02:59.080> thing<00:02:59.320> in

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
doing even if they're the worst thing in

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.900 
doing even if they're the worst thing in
the<00:02:59.470> world<00:02:59.530> even<00:02:59.890> if<00:03:00.070> they're<00:03:00.190> doing<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.640> just

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
the world even if they're doing it just

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.440 
the world even if they're doing it just
to<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.150> rise<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:03.760> subscribe<00:03:04.270> to

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
to get a rise I just don't subscribe to

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.510 
to get a rise I just don't subscribe to
the<00:03:04.540> idea<00:03:04.570> that<00:03:04.900> we're<00:03:05.110> supposed<00:03:05.530> to<00:03:05.590> sit<00:03:06.490> here

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
the idea that we're supposed to sit here

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.500 
the idea that we're supposed to sit here
and<00:03:06.700> make<00:03:06.790> people<00:03:07.030> feel<00:03:07.060> badly<00:03:07.360> about

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and make people feel badly about

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.060 
and make people feel badly about
themselves<00:03:07.750> in<00:03:08.140> an<00:03:08.320> already<00:03:08.500> high-pressure

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
themselves in an already high-pressure

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.040 
themselves in an already high-pressure
situation<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.760> was<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.000> big<00:03:10.270> thing

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
situation so that was a big thing

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.960 
situation so that was a big thing
I<00:03:13.110> believe<00:03:14.070> that<00:03:14.190> because<00:03:14.520> it<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.700> a<00:03:14.730> very

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
I believe that because it is a very

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.050 
I believe that because it is a very
positive<00:03:15.270> leaning<00:03:15.900> show<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.610> spirit<00:03:18.000> of

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
positive leaning show that the spirit of

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.060

been a lot harsher kind of cruel

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.030

but they don't believe that that ever

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.920 
but they don't believe that that ever
gets<00:03:40.260> anyone<00:03:40.530> everywhere

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.240 

I<00:03:43.019> think<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.319> voice<00:03:43.469> has<00:03:43.739> made<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:43.950> lot<00:03:44.099> of

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
I think the voice has made a lot of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.520 
I think the voice has made a lot of
people's<00:03:44.459> dreams<00:03:44.670> coming<00:03:44.909> true<00:03:44.939> and<00:03:45.239> and<00:03:45.870> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
people's dreams coming true and and the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.220 
people's dreams coming true and and the
success<00:03:46.980> factor<00:03:47.459> really<00:03:47.909> is<00:03:48.390> all<00:03:48.780> relative

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
success factor really is all relative

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.709 
success factor really is all relative
you<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:49.859> don't<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.640> anybody<00:03:51.420> has

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:51.719 
you know I don't think that anybody has

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.690 
you know I don't think that anybody has
ever<00:03:51.750> gone<00:03:52.319> on<00:03:52.379> the<00:03:52.859> voice<00:03:53.010> in<00:03:53.340> front<00:03:53.519> of
