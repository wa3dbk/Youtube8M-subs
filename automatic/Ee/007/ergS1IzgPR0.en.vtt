00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello welcome saun like in this video 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.200
 I'll teach you to make a dish so 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.559
 original like this 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.270
 they are very simple food to cook and 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.880
 very very cheap the truth is only 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.560
 an egg a fran for like this and then 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.750
 they are also going to need a toothpick like 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.680
 this one to remove teeth and now we're going to 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.680
 explain what we have to do 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.100
 very well once we have it we have to 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.360
 cut a little the side let's try 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 they are a little bit it does not matter if it looks good or 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.170
 bad the only thing is to cut a little so that 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.310
 when you rotate, have a base like here 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.200
 left 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.570
 and this we can already want to eat if 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.390
 we want and now relying on this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.900
 base what we are going to do is cut 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.730
 leaving a space at the end as they are 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.430
 cut from here 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.910
 and look from central to as much as possible 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.620
 well this way once we have it 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.270
 with the toothpick we had said 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.549
 previously 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.549
 we're going to close it a bit more here 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.180
 and we are going to close it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 with the stick 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.860
 and so in this way we're going to do what 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.860
 that is good 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.570
 and this is where we will now put 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.540
 our our egg let's see how 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.460
 we cook it 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.750
 when we have the paella to be able to be 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.660
 wide of the entity so will be hooked 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.440
 much less let's add a little 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.270
 of oil 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.220
 I like oil much more than 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.220
 olive but good here as you want 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.900
 we start well 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.450
 that reaches everywhere and that is well 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.210
 hot once we have the oil well 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.480
 hot what we're going to do is put 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.430
 the frankfurt that we had for the part 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.720
 from below here we have already made the cut 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.800
 as you see and then we will give you the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.300
 return therefore what we did 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.800
 by the top and then we will give 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.020
 the turn 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 once a little has been done by the side 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.780
 is on the opposite side of the where 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.470
 we have made the cut we will give the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.870
 return 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.160
 we leave like this we see a little so that the 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.160
 oil also enter the center 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.790
 and that's what we 're going to do is with a lot 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.210
 careful let's introduce the game in 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.210
 inside 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.170
 the game to be able to be I would recommend that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.250
 stop is the clear of the yolk 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.250
 in the middle 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.900
 Now we can add a little salt 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.910
 and wait for it to cook well 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.910
 egg 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.680
 What I'm doing is removing this 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.950
 part of here so that really 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.260
 take advantage of this area that is within the 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.950
 This French has what we are going to throw away but 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.260
 what are we going to eat 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.470
 once we have the egg made 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.849
 we can have it to have the toothpick 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.400
 and then finish decorating the plate 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.910
 they are a bit of salad or what 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.440
 that we want 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.960
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.930
 this dish you can see is very original and 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.130
