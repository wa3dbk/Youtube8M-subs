00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.530
 true 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:38.760
 I've been about six months 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.970

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.100
 they brought the cannon too so now 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.550

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:53.380
 for flight number 224 we will show 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:58.370
 the canyon where you enter then 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.100

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.480
 place where he enters the canyon 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.300
 I go in front of the canyon where 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.710
 enter the cannon balls where you 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.990

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.710

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.380
 start your warm-up exercise 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.380
 and trust 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.190
 if the first exercise is 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.669
 to the people 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.129

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:37.509
 Saints to do well at all 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:41.700
 data to men for whom they have 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:43.560
 deceased because this is a is a number 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.290
 the meter of the circus numbers that 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.970
 more victims has had so 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.070
 with that of the police says the last 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.590
