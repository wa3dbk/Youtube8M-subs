00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:20.100 

to<00:02:10.450> clarify<00:02:10.690> because<00:02:18.840> again<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:20.020> are

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
to clarify because again there are

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.320 
to clarify because again there are
charges<00:02:20.380> that<00:02:20.680> we<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.130> go<00:02:21.760> anywhere<00:02:22.150> other

charges that we can go anywhere other

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.430 
charges that we can go anywhere other
than<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.510> highway<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:22.900> for<00:02:23.050> this<00:02:23.140> for

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
than the highway but for this for

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.320 
than the highway but for this for
driving<00:02:23.860> it's<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.640> like<00:02:24.760> a<00:02:24.790> parking<00:02:25.150> lot<00:02:25.180> if

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
driving it's just like a parking lot if

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.840 
driving it's just like a parking lot if
it's<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.510> private<00:02:25.810> parking<00:02:26.110> lot<00:02:26.490> it's<00:02:27.490> just

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
it's a private parking lot it's just

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.820 
it's a private parking lot it's just
basically<00:02:28.090> property<00:02:28.570> damage<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.380> again<00:02:29.680> it's

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
basically property damage and again it's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.040 
basically property damage and again it's
a<00:02:30.010> part<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.750> stakeholders<00:02:31.750> here<00:02:31.900> which

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
a part of the stakeholders here which

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.180 
a part of the stakeholders here which
would<00:02:32.140> be<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.350> TPC<00:02:32.890> either<00:02:33.370> own<00:02:33.490> investigate

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
would be the TPC either own investigate

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:49.100 
would be the TPC either own investigate
but<00:02:34.790> really<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> only<00:02:35.390> appropriate<00:02:36.260> charges

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.440 

no<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.650> mean<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.220> damage<00:02:50.760> is<00:02:51.000> great<00:02:51.240> here

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
no I mean as the damage is great here

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.030 
no I mean as the damage is great here
because<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.960> sheer<00:02:52.410> size<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.890> these

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
because of the sheer size of these

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.680 
because of the sheer size of these
vehicles<00:02:53.280> since<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.730> late<00:02:53.910> even<00:02:54.270> at<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> slow

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
vehicles since the late even at a slow

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.570 
vehicles since the late even at a slow
speed<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:55.140> see<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> damage<00:02:56.460> occurred

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
speed can see that the damage occurred

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.580 
speed can see that the damage occurred
on<00:02:57.150> both<00:02:57.660> cabins

on both cabins

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.800 
on both cabins
you<00:02:59.460> know<00:02:59.550> both<00:02:59.880> most<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.270> these<00:03:00.330> buses<00:03:00.540> do
