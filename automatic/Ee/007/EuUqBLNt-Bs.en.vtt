00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
I wanted to talk about the balancing of

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
I wanted to talk about the balancing of
gears<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> war<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:43.020> your<00:00:43.230> opinions<00:00:43.620> are

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
gears of war and what your opinions are

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.979 
gears of war and what your opinions are
on<00:00:44.010> how<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.399> should<00:00:44.550> be<00:00:44.579> balanced<00:00:44.940> because<00:00:45.090> in

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
on how it should be balanced because in

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
on how it should be balanced because in
my<00:00:46.140> mind<00:00:46.170> there's<00:00:46.410> two<00:00:46.680> ways<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.129> again<00:00:47.340> we

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
my mind there's two ways that again we

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
my mind there's two ways that again we
balanced<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.120> there's<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.079> top<00:00:49.320> down

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
balanced and there's the top down

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
balanced and there's the top down
approach<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.520> then<00:00:50.700> there's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> bottom<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
approach and then there's the bottom of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.330 
approach and then there's the bottom of
the<00:00:51.390> ocean<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.500> might<00:00:52.649> not<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.829> I'm<00:00:53.010> talking

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the ocean you might not know I'm talking

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950 
the ocean you might not know I'm talking
about<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.699> what<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.090> mean<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> top<00:00:54.780> down

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
about but what I mean is the top down

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
about but what I mean is the top down
approach<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.649> balance<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> game<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
approach is you balance the game for the

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.939 
approach is you balance the game for the
highest<00:00:56.730> level<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> airplay<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.680> highest

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
highest level of airplay so the highest

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
highest level of airplay so the highest
level<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.219> competitive<00:00:59.760> play<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.480> know<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
level of competitive play you know the

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.900 
level of competitive play you know the
top<00:01:00.870> two<00:01:01.050> sort<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> take<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.460> statistics

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
top two sort of you take the statistics

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
top two sort of you take the statistics
from<00:01:03.000> top<00:01:03.270> drunk<00:01:03.570> games<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.309> how<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.430> plays

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
from top drunk games and how it plays

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.580 
from top drunk games and how it plays
out<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:06.060> scenario<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.720> then<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.409> apply

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
out in that scenario and then you apply

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.030 
out in that scenario and then you apply
bonds<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.490> situation<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.890> from<00:01:10.890> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
bonds to that situation and from that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
bonds to that situation and from that
it's<00:01:11.369> almost<00:01:11.640> however<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.720> plays<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
it's almost however it plays out in the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.260 
it's almost however it plays out in the
lower<00:01:13.439> level<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.490> quick

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
lower level so you know quick

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
lower level so you know quick
free-for-all<00:01:15.750> where<00:01:16.110> people<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.470> basically

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
free-for-all where people have basically

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.010 
free-for-all where people have basically
just<00:01:17.100> playing<00:01:17.310> for<00:01:17.430> fun<00:01:17.600> most<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.689> time<00:01:18.840> I'd

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
just playing for fun most the time I'd

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.200 
just playing for fun most the time I'd
say<00:01:19.200> however<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.100> plays<00:01:20.130> out<00:01:20.400> there<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.850> just

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
say however it plays out there is just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.330 
say however it plays out there is just
you<00:01:21.570> know<00:01:21.780> ice<00:01:21.960> incidental<00:01:22.500> last<00:01:22.680> however<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
you know ice incidental last however it

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.649 
you know ice incidental last however it
plays<00:01:23.369> however<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.909> plays<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> turns<00:01:24.509> out

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
plays however it plays if it turns out

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.090

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
to be imbalanced in favor of the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
to be imbalanced in favor of the
Russians<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.060> retro<00:01:27.390> heavy<00:01:27.630> if<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.380> you

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
Russians out to be retro heavy if it you

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.469 
Russians out to be retro heavy if it you
know<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.490> grenades<00:01:29.759> overpowered<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
know I if it grenades overpowered and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
know I if it grenades overpowered and
then<00:01:31.380> that's<00:01:31.650> just<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.400> know<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.700> just

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
then that's just you know that's just

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.310 
then that's just you know that's just
how<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.170> game's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
how it is because if the game's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.539 
how it is because if the game's
objectively<00:01:34.799> balanced<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.369> highest

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
objectively balanced at the highest

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.370 
objectively balanced at the highest
level<00:01:35.939> than<00:01:36.270> any<00:01:36.479> imbalances<00:01:37.020> at<00:01:37.200> lower

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
level than any imbalances at lower

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
level than any imbalances at lower
levels<00:01:37.740> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.310> down<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.790> players

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
levels would be down to the players

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.539 
levels would be down to the players
themselves<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.750> their<00:01:39.840> play<00:01:40.020> styles<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.619> so

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
themselves and their play styles and so

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.870 
themselves and their play styles and so
you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.509> think<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.740> mean<00:01:44.490> that's<00:01:44.610> what

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
you know I think that I mean that's what

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.130 
you know I think that I mean that's what
i<00:01:44.909> would<00:01:45.210> find<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:45.990> desirable

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
i would find not to be more desirable

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.200 
i would find not to be more desirable
whereas<00:01:46.740> i'm<00:01:47.640> not<00:01:47.790> sure<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:47.970> you'll<00:01:48.119> agree

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
whereas i'm not sure if you'll agree

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.910 
whereas i'm not sure if you'll agree
with<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:48.689> I<00:01:48.899> feel<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.200> epic<00:01:49.619> may<00:01:49.860> be

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
with this but I feel like epic may be

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.219 
with this but I feel like epic may be
going<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.640> sort<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> bottom-up<00:01:51.630> approach

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
going for the sort of bottom-up approach

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.090 
going for the sort of bottom-up approach
which<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.340> say<00:01:53.579> they<00:01:53.759> see<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:55.350> know<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
which is and say they see you know that

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.090 
which is and say they see you know that
free-for-all<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.729> dominated<00:01:57.210> by<00:01:57.210> Russia's

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
free-for-all is dominated by Russia's

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
free-for-all is dominated by Russia's
then<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.280> decide<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.969> well<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.750> lungs

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
then they decide that well the lungs

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.600 
then they decide that well the lungs
must<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.259> under<00:02:01.439> powers<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.009> will<00:02:02.340> buff<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
must be under powers so will buff the

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.719 
must be under powers so will buff the
Lancer<00:02:02.909> but<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.719> actual<00:02:04.049> fact<00:02:04.310> the<00:02:05.310> Lancer<00:02:05.610> at

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
Lancer but in actual fact the Lancer at

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.550 
Lancer but in actual fact the Lancer at
launch<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.119> already<00:02:06.390> very<00:02:06.450> powerful<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.229> am

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
launch was already very powerful in am

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.589 
launch was already very powerful in am
in<00:02:08.099> team<00:02:08.459> ranked<00:02:08.910> team<00:02:09.060> deathmatch<00:02:09.420> and

things<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.259> now<00:02:10.800> play<00:02:11.039> I've<00:02:11.250> been

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
things like that and now play I've been

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.710 
things like that and now play I've been
playing<00:02:11.700> around<00:02:11.819> execution<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.569> day

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
playing around execution all day

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.580 
playing around execution all day
yesterday<00:02:12.989> and

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
yesterday and

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.559 
yesterday and
just<00:02:13.800> literally<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.400> light<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.239> answer<00:02:15.540> is

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
just literally the light the answer is

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.350 
just literally the light the answer is
so<00:02:15.870> powerful<00:02:16.080> yet<00:02:16.500> again<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.980> I<00:02:17.910> just<00:02:18.209> don't

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
so powerful yet again and I just don't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.490 
so powerful yet again and I just don't
want<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.540> game<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.720> descend<00:02:19.080> into<00:02:19.230> another

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
want the game to descend into another

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.900 
want the game to descend into another
lumps<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.830> flesh<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.370> well<00:02:20.580> 3<00:02:20.700> was

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
lumps of flesh like is well 3 was

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.309 
lumps of flesh like is well 3 was
there's<00:02:21.120> no<00:02:21.209> stopping<00:02:21.569> poll<00:02:21.720> which<00:02:21.900> is<00:02:22.050> great

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
there's no stopping poll which is great

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.290 
there's no stopping poll which is great
not<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.040> reload<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:23.519> is<00:02:23.670> great<00:02:23.879> but<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.120> mean

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
not to reload which is great but I mean

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.059 
not to reload which is great but I mean
I<00:02:24.330> think<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.780> can<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.019> from<00:02:25.110> this<00:02:25.260> video<00:02:25.530> the

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
I think you can see from this video the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.880 
I think you can see from this video the
hip<00:02:26.220> Violante<00:02:26.790> is<00:02:26.849> incredibly<00:02:27.599> accurate<00:02:27.890> it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
hip Violante is incredibly accurate it

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.430 
hip Violante is incredibly accurate it
and<00:02:29.180> close<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.390> medium-range<00:02:30.629> lon<00:02:31.049> two<00:02:31.200> drops

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and close and medium-range lon two drops

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.520 
and close and medium-range lon two drops
people<00:02:31.769> know<00:02:32.280> almost<00:02:32.519> instantly<00:02:33.319> and<00:02:34.319> it's

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
people know almost instantly and it's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.190 
people know almost instantly and it's
just<00:02:34.709> it's<00:02:35.069> just<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.879> this<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:36.930> change

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
just it's just if this is the change

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.390 
just it's just if this is the change
that<00:02:37.290> they<00:02:37.379> have<00:02:37.500> to<00:02:37.650> make<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.099> make<00:02:38.190> people

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that they have to make to make people

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.580 
that they have to make to make people
use<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.819> Lancer<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.390> infrared<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.319> all<00:02:40.410> and

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
use the Lancer in infrared for all and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.309 
use the Lancer in infrared for all and
in<00:02:40.650> quick<00:02:40.860> march<00:02:41.040> TDM<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.819> domination<00:02:42.150> then<00:02:42.989> I

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
in quick march TDM and domination then I

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.809 
in quick march TDM and domination then I
can<00:02:43.560> understand<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.099> a<00:02:44.160> way<00:02:44.280> but<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.640> has<00:02:44.790> a

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
can understand it in a way but it has a

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.150 
can understand it in a way but it has a
knock-on<00:02:45.090> effect<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.810> then<00:02:46.590> at<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> higher

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
knock-on effect and then at the higher

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.089 
knock-on effect and then at the higher
levels<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.849> Lancer<00:02:48.150> becomes<00:02:48.450> still<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.470> ruins

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
levels the Lancer becomes still it ruins

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.009 
levels the Lancer becomes still it ruins
the<00:02:50.220> game<00:02:50.250> and<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.329> know<00:02:51.450> it's<00:02:51.630> just<00:02:51.900> a

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
the game and you know it's just a

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.620 
the game and you know it's just a
problem<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.560> both<00:02:53.519> ways<00:02:53.819> have<00:02:54.150> their<00:02:54.420> flaws

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
problem so both ways have their flaws

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.240 
problem so both ways have their flaws
but<00:02:54.930> look<00:02:55.260> at<00:02:55.349> that<00:02:55.440> I<00:02:55.470> mean<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.709> can<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:55.980> I'll

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
but look at that I mean I can just I'll

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.339 
but look at that I mean I can just I'll
out<00:02:56.579> strafe<00:02:56.970> someone<00:02:57.239> with<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.450> Lancer<00:02:57.810> when

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
out strafe someone with the Lancer when

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.170 
out strafe someone with the Lancer when
they've<00:02:58.500> got<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.709> notion<00:02:58.829> is<00:02:59.220> praised<00:02:59.940> it's

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
they've got the notion is praised it's

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.100 
they've got the notion is praised it's
been<00:03:00.299> nice<00:03:00.390> knowing<00:03:00.629> there's<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.840> on-screen

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
been nice knowing there's the on-screen

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.670 
been nice knowing there's the on-screen
reticle<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.840> it's<00:03:03.840> incredibly<00:03:04.290> accurate<00:03:04.470> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
reticle and it's incredibly accurate I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.640 
reticle and it's incredibly accurate I
think<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.340> an<00:03:06.299> utter<00:03:06.510> user<00:03:06.780> doesn't<00:03:07.019> stand<00:03:07.349> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
think that an utter user doesn't stand a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380 
think that an utter user doesn't stand a
chance<00:03:07.709> against<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.700> rifle<00:03:08.970> user<00:03:09.150> at<00:03:09.269> long

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
chance against a rifle user at long

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.690 
chance against a rifle user at long
range<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:09.989> a<00:03:10.379> rifle<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.069> shouldn't<00:03:11.489> really

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
range so a rifle you shouldn't really

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.400 
range so a rifle you shouldn't really
stand<00:03:12.060> much<00:03:12.209> of<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.390> chance<00:03:12.420> in<00:03:12.930> this<00:03:13.170> range

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
stand much of a chance in this range

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.650 
stand much of a chance in this range
that<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.590> mean<00:03:13.739> now<00:03:13.890> like<00:03:14.299> they've<00:03:15.299> added<00:03:15.540> in

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that I mean now like they've added in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.479 
that I mean now like they've added in
the<00:03:16.049> melee<00:03:16.230> for<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.650> one<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.129> which<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.370> can

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the melee for the one so which I can

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.860 
the melee for the one so which I can
understand<00:03:17.819> because<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.420> von't<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:18.720> you're

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
understand because you von't if you're

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.090 
understand because you von't if you're
going<00:03:19.139> with<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.319> Lancer<00:03:19.590> you<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:19.980> have

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
going with a Lancer you don't have

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.580 
going with a Lancer you don't have
anything<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.730> defend<00:03:20.850> yourself<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.590> that's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
anything to defend yourself so that's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.319 
anything to defend yourself so that's
okay<00:03:22.889> but<00:03:23.069> i<00:03:23.100> think<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.609> hipfire<00:03:23.850> should

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
okay but i think the hipfire should

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:25.970 
okay but i think the hipfire should
probably<00:03:24.750> be<00:03:24.900> you<00:03:25.139> know<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.380> little<00:03:25.530> bit<00:03:25.739> less

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
probably be you know a little bit less

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.559 
probably be you know a little bit less
viable<00:03:26.250> because<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.790> hit<00:03:26.940> file<00:03:27.209> on<00:03:27.359> today's

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
viable because the hit file on today's

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.330 
viable because the hit file on today's
pretty<00:03:27.959> much<00:03:28.109> as<00:03:28.500> strong<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:28.980> nasher<00:03:29.220> is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
pretty much as strong as the nasher is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.150 
pretty much as strong as the nasher is
from<00:03:29.489> close<00:03:29.700> range<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:31.019> then<00:03:31.290> at<00:03:31.769> long<00:03:31.950> range

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
from close range and then at long range

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.490 
from close range and then at long range
obviously<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.880> far<00:03:33.120> superior<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.569> either<00:03:34.319> of

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
obviously it's far superior to either of

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.069 
obviously it's far superior to either of
the<00:03:34.590> shotguns<00:03:34.950> i'm<00:03:35.819> specifically<00:03:36.810> referring

the shotguns i'm specifically referring

balanced around quick much free for all

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.909 
balanced around quick much free for all
because<00:04:19.109> that's<00:04:19.229> where<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> majority<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.859> the

on the competitive play and then let

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.020 
on the competitive play and then let
let's<00:04:29.530> this<00:04:29.710> sort<00:04:29.889> of<00:04:29.950> let<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.430> quick<00:04:30.850> much

let's this sort of let the quick much
sort<00:04:31.480> itself<00:04:31.600> out<00:04:31.960> I'll<00:04:32.350> do<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.650> think<00:04:32.830> that

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
sort itself out I'll do you think that

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.980 
sort itself out I'll do you think that
that's<00:04:33.430> undesirable<00:04:34.030> because<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.870> is<00:04:34.960> a

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
that's undesirable because it is a

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.830 
that's undesirable because it is a
dilemma<00:04:35.320> you<00:04:35.500> can't<00:04:35.710> really<00:04:35.889> have<00:04:36.100> both<00:04:36.840> if

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
dilemma you can't really have both if

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.570 
dilemma you can't really have both if
the<00:04:37.900> competitive<00:04:38.620> players<00:04:38.830> had<00:04:39.100> it<00:04:39.250> how<00:04:39.370> they

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the competitive players had it how they

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.300 
the competitive players had it how they
wanted<00:04:39.910> it<00:04:40.030> then<00:04:40.620> they<00:04:41.620> all<00:04:41.830> quit<00:04:42.010> match<00:04:42.190> would

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
wanted it then they all quit match would

we saw in the first couple of weeks of
the<00:04:47.020> game<00:04:47.169> but<00:04:47.500> now<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:47.919> lancers<00:04:48.190> been

the game but now that the lancers been
both<00:04:48.490> you<00:04:48.910> know<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.480> in<00:04:49.660> danger<00:04:49.810> of<00:04:49.960> turning

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
both you know it's in danger of turning

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.800 
both you know it's in danger of turning
to<00:04:50.350> a<00:04:50.410> rifle<00:04:50.740> fest<00:04:50.919> again<00:04:51.070> and<00:04:51.370> this<00:04:52.150> this

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
few posts I'm assuming this is a sort of

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.310 
few posts I'm assuming this is a sort of

a conscious effort to interact with the
community<00:05:11.470> a<00:05:11.740> lot<00:05:11.800> more<00:05:12.040> but<00:05:12.220> yeah<00:05:13.060> it's<00:05:13.210> good

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
community a lot more but yeah it's good

the<00:05:15.160> lead<00:05:15.310> I<00:05:15.610> think<00:05:16.060> he's<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.300> lead<00:05:16.480> level

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
the lead I think he's the lead level

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.450 
the lead I think he's the lead level

here he basically said the debate for

here he basically said the debate for
them<00:05:20.890> has<00:05:20.979> always<00:05:21.220> been<00:05:21.400> is<00:05:21.669> the<00:05:22.120> National

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
them has always been is the National

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.570 
them has always been is the National
actually<00:05:23.050> a<00:05:23.080> problem<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.950> national<00:05:24.220> dominant

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
actually a problem the national dominant

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.879 
actually a problem the national dominant
and<00:05:24.729> quit<00:05:24.880> much<00:05:25.060> because<00:05:25.570> if<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.590> guns<00:05:26.770> are

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:26.889 
and quit much because if the guns are

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:28.469 
and quit much because if the guns are
balanced<00:05:27.340> and<00:05:27.520> everybody<00:05:27.910> chooses<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.360> not

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
balanced and everybody chooses the not

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.510 
balanced and everybody chooses the not
sure<00:05:28.600> because<00:05:28.750> they<00:05:29.200> like<00:05:29.410> it<00:05:29.650> so<00:05:30.190> if

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
sure because they like it so if

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.740 
sure because they like it so if
everybody's<00:05:30.970> choosing<00:05:31.300> I<00:05:31.419> should<00:05:31.630> just

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
everybody's choosing I should just

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.090 
everybody's choosing I should just
purely<00:05:32.020> because<00:05:32.200> they<00:05:32.500> like<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.680> not<00:05:32.950> sure

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
purely because they like the not sure

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.940 
purely because they like the not sure
then<00:05:33.610> that's<00:05:34.090> obviously<00:05:34.419> no<00:05:34.570> problem<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.860> he

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
then that's obviously no problem and he

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.650 
then that's obviously no problem and he
says<00:05:36.100> he<00:05:36.190> has<00:05:36.310> no<00:05:36.340> issue<00:05:36.669> with<00:05:36.850> that<00:05:37.030> but<00:05:37.479> it's

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
says he has no issue with that but it's

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.080 
says he has no issue with that but it's
the<00:05:37.870> problem<00:05:38.080> is<00:05:38.320> if<00:05:38.620> say<00:05:39.520> eighty<00:05:39.700> percent<00:05:39.850> of

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
the problem is if say eighty percent of

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.730 
the problem is if say eighty percent of
kills<00:05:40.690> in<00:05:40.870> quit<00:05:41.110> much<00:05:41.229> free-for-all<00:05:41.620> or

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
kills in quit much free-for-all or

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.890 
kills in quit much free-for-all or
whatever<00:05:41.950> the<00:05:42.070> statistics<00:05:42.580> are<00:05:42.729> turn<00:05:43.690> out<00:05:43.810> to

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
whatever the statistics are turn out to

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.779 
whatever the statistics are turn out to
be<00:05:43.990> from<00:05:44.169> the<00:05:44.260> NASA<00:05:44.440> and<00:05:44.860> that<00:05:45.220> indicates<00:05:45.460> an

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
be from the NASA and that indicates an

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:47.730 
be from the NASA and that indicates an
actual<00:05:46.120> imbalance<00:05:46.630> in<00:05:46.840> the<00:05:46.870> gun<00:05:47.229> mechanics

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
actual imbalance in the gun mechanics

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.320 
actual imbalance in the gun mechanics
then<00:05:48.250> that<00:05:48.430> is<00:05:48.520> a<00:05:48.550> problem<00:05:48.760> that's<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.180> thing

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
then that is a problem that's the thing

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.460 
then that is a problem that's the thing
they<00:05:49.419> have<00:05:49.539> to<00:05:49.570> wrestle<00:05:49.870> with<00:05:50.050> because<00:05:50.320> it's

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
they have to wrestle with because it's

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.950 
they have to wrestle with because it's
very<00:05:50.590> hard<00:05:50.830> to<00:05:50.919> tell<00:05:51.190> whether<00:05:51.940> it's<00:05:52.450> actually

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
very hard to tell whether it's actually

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.050 
very hard to tell whether it's actually
we<00:05:53.560> you<00:05:53.800> know<00:05:53.919> what's<00:05:54.100> causing<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.550> and<00:05:54.669> they

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
we you know what's causing it and they

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.490 
we you know what's causing it and they
kind<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.300> have<00:05:55.419> to<00:05:55.539> just<00:05:55.570> play<00:05:55.930> the<00:05:56.080> game<00:05:56.260> and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
kind of have to just play the game and

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.920 
kind of have to just play the game and
have<00:05:56.650> an<00:05:56.950> intuitive<00:05:57.280> feel<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:57.910> it<00:05:57.940> and<00:05:58.180> whether

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 
have an intuitive feel to it and whether

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.630 
have an intuitive feel to it and whether
whether<00:05:59.560> it<00:05:59.710> feels<00:05:59.919> in<00:06:00.100> balanced<00:06:00.400> or<00:06:00.520> whether

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:00.640 
whether it feels in balanced or whether

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.430 
whether it feels in balanced or whether
it<00:06:00.789> doesn't<00:06:01.060> and<00:06:01.210> having<00:06:01.539> said<00:06:01.720> that<00:06:01.750> from<00:06:02.320> my

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
it doesn't and having said that from my

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.440 
it doesn't and having said that from my
experience<00:06:02.890> personally<00:06:03.370> I<00:06:03.669> do<00:06:03.850> feel<00:06:04.120> that<00:06:04.150> the

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:04.450 
experience personally I do feel that the

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.659 
experience personally I do feel that the
lancers<00:06:04.810> are<00:06:04.960> quite<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.560> bit<00:06:05.770> too<00:06:05.950> too<00:06:06.400> strong

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
lancers are quite a bit too too strong

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.020 
lancers are quite a bit too too strong
now<00:06:06.820> I<00:06:07.030> mean<00:06:07.600> in<00:06:08.140> this<00:06:08.470> game<00:06:08.680> I'm<00:06:08.950> being<00:06:09.700> really

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.030 
now I mean in this game I'm being really

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:11.310 
now I mean in this game I'm being really
hyper<00:06:10.330> aggressive<00:06:10.570> with<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:10.900> getting<00:06:11.229> in

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
hyper aggressive with it getting in

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.080 
hyper aggressive with it getting in
close-range<00:06:11.800> situations<00:06:12.100> them<00:06:12.640> I<00:06:12.729> mean<00:06:12.970> this

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
close-range situations them I mean this

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.390 
close-range situations them I mean this
map<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.690> pretty<00:06:14.229> much<00:06:14.320> all<00:06:14.530> close<00:06:14.740> range<00:06:15.039> and

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
map is pretty much all close range and

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.340 
map is pretty much all close range and
you<00:06:15.729> know<00:06:15.850> it's<00:06:16.450> just<00:06:16.510> easy<00:06:16.810> for<00:06:17.020> me<00:06:17.080> to<00:06:17.110> tear

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
you know it's just easy for me to tear

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.190 
you know it's just easy for me to tear
through<00:06:17.500> people<00:06:18.660> who<00:06:19.660> are<00:06:19.780> using<00:06:19.900> an<00:06:20.050> usher

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
through people who are using an usher

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480 
through people who are using an usher
and<00:06:20.320> I<00:06:20.380> just<00:06:20.530> don't<00:06:20.710> think<00:06:20.979> that's<00:06:21.190> really

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
and I just don't think that's really

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.659 
and I just don't think that's really
desirable<00:06:21.910> and<00:06:22.150> then<00:06:23.250> added<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.280> that<00:06:24.370> when

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
desirable and then added to that when

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.279 
desirable and then added to that when
you've<00:06:25.000> got<00:06:25.180> you<00:06:25.419> know<00:06:25.450> for<00:06:25.930> people<00:06:26.080> and

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289 
you've got you know for people and

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:28.650 
you've got you know for people and
execution<00:06:26.740> team<00:06:26.950> firing<00:06:27.370> one<00:06:27.640> person<00:06:28.060> you<00:06:28.300> you

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
execution team firing one person you you

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.930 
execution team firing one person you you
get<00:06:28.840> down<00:06:29.020> I<00:06:29.410> mean<00:06:29.740> it's<00:06:29.950> just<00:06:30.010> really<00:06:30.400> far

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
get down I mean it's just really far

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.610 
get down I mean it's just really far
faster<00:06:31.180> than<00:06:31.330> it<00:06:31.510> was<00:06:31.630> in<00:06:31.660> gears<00:06:32.020> 3<00:06:32.260> even<00:06:32.500> with

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
faster than it was in gears 3 even with

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:33.900 
faster than it was in gears 3 even with
active<00:06:32.919> reload<00:06:33.190> and<00:06:33.340> headshots<00:06:33.669> and

basically<00:06:34.870> what<00:06:35.020> I'm<00:06:35.140> trying<00:06:35.320> to<00:06:35.380> say<00:06:35.440> is<00:06:35.560> I

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
basically what I'm trying to say is I

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.980 
basically what I'm trying to say is I
just<00:06:36.610> don't<00:06:36.760> think<00:06:36.970> that<00:06:37.030> balancing<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.810> game

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:37.990 
just don't think that balancing the game

know you don't have teammates you've got

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.760 
know you don't have teammates you've got
nine<00:07:10.150> hostile<00:07:10.540> players<00:07:10.810> instead<00:07:11.050> of<00:07:11.200> five<00:07:11.470> and

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
nine hostile players instead of five and

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.680 
nine hostile players instead of five and
there<00:07:12.520> are<00:07:12.580> people<00:07:12.850> everywhere<00:07:12.970> you<00:07:13.480> can't

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
there are people everywhere you can't

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.690 
there are people everywhere you can't
really<00:07:13.840> control<00:07:14.740> them<00:07:14.950> up<00:07:15.130> you've<00:07:15.430> got<00:07:15.580> no

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
really control them up you've got no

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.180 
really control them up you've got no
teammates<00:07:16.030> to<00:07:16.180> get<00:07:16.330> you<00:07:16.420> back<00:07:16.630> and<00:07:16.900> I<00:07:16.930> think<00:07:17.890> it

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.190 
teammates to get you back and I think it

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.550 
teammates to get you back and I think it
that<00:07:18.430> leads<00:07:18.670> itself<00:07:18.970> to<00:07:19.300> a<00:07:19.660> lot<00:07:19.960> of<00:07:20.050> shotgun

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
that leads itself to a lot of shotgun

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.350 
that leads itself to a lot of shotgun
play<00:07:20.740> and<00:07:20.980> I<00:07:21.280> think<00:07:21.340> that<00:07:21.520> buffing<00:07:21.910> the<00:07:22.000> rifles

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:22.360 
play and I think that buffing the rifles

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.060 
play and I think that buffing the rifles
due<00:07:22.810> to<00:07:22.960> that<00:07:23.050> would<00:07:23.230> almost<00:07:23.380> be<00:07:23.650> buffing<00:07:23.950> them

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:24.070 
due to that would almost be buffing them

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.890 
due to that would almost be buffing them
on<00:07:24.310> an<00:07:24.460> illusion<00:07:24.940> of<00:07:25.060> imbalance<00:07:25.570> not<00:07:25.810> an

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:25.900 
on an illusion of imbalance not an

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.980 
on an illusion of imbalance not an
actual<00:07:26.170> imbalance<00:07:26.890> and<00:07:27.540> but<00:07:28.540> yeah<00:07:28.690> thanks<00:07:28.960> a

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990 
actual imbalance and but yeah thanks a

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.450 
actual imbalance and but yeah thanks a
