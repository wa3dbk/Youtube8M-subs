00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.500
 First of all, that one of one 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.190
 point a to a point as possible 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.770
 efficiently moved without any 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.970
 saltos et cetera or turns and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.940
 his body stops on one 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 uses the best possible way and in spring 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.510
 is it then more intent on the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.160
 artistic expression during the movement 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.839
 that means you do any 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 turns or flips and is not anymore 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.570
 so on the efficiently considered bauble 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.010
 one lives out his creativity and there 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.010
 It is actually even the main difference 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 because I find it important that adolescents 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.450
 I would have a contact point earlier 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.759
 like to have had and but there was 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.080
 unfortunately not and that you good 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.970
 Body feeling develops and simply the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.470
 situation can assess well so that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.149
 then you can also estimate driven 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.800
 and just do that and it can I 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.990
 and then not for example 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.270
 we see we have 50 participants and 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.250
 the offer is accepted and we 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.080
 try it as faithful as philosophy 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
 possible to teach the people and that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.860
 i also like to keep that young 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.049
 just a certain amount of people 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 instructions are there because that 's pretty much 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.170
 a lot in films and in which corners 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.460
 data and looks like that and thus that is 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.439
 whole country in the safe frame and 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.710
 so we find that important 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710
 offer 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.270
 right at the beginning as we said we are her 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100
 on the bases concentrates 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.440
 means one exercises first properly 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.880
 move to develop a body sensation 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.800
 there are the basics such as 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.360
 precision jumps that others 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.860
 jump and land properly clean 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.060
 just do not cushion your joints 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.890
 harms the whole story 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.540
 then it comes to pick up and we continue 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.740
 progresses the more comes then 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.330
 of course, also such playful 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.610
 things like from spring with pure so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.610
 saltos and turns and such things 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.770
 I started with the course in 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.080
 summer 2007 quite to the actual 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 youtube video looked fully horny wants 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.980
 I also went out there then 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.210
 also a playground in sandbox down 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.060
 skipped tumbled and made 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.590
 so I say 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.630
 then I never actually leave 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.040
 With parkour I have stopped since 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 I was small and I always climbed around 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.280
 and hopped and trees 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.959
 changed and so on but so with 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.120
 I have professional instructions 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.769
 Only then are you five and half years old 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.220
 and only then a regular training 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.750
 introduced after by currently 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.420
 facebook through youtube through the whole 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.110
 Forums, you actually noticed something like that 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:07.720
 Behind it is and what I continue 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.370
 I have to say that it is in the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.849
 Contrary to other sports of mine 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.290
 opinion is safe because you 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.180
 just yourself and the obstacle 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.220
 no foreign influence from outside no 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.690
 one of the opponents for example one 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.239
 you could stop inflicting injury 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.099
 already knew exactly what was 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.910
 body on it has a big one 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:26.380
 self-assessment and 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.150
 bring a sense of responsibility 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.349
 if someone is driving then land 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.239
 also not directly in formula 1 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.310
 wear and so it is natural with us 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.750
 we too start small at their rising 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.739
 slowly and thus countryman 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.480
 responsible with the things 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.280
 deal and the last decision 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.599
 stay with us always we can yes 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.720
 Let's say today is a good day for 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.829
 I suppose the conditions are perfect 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.610
 So basically it is for everyone 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.250
 age suitable 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.690
 most kids were already with three 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.350
 other people to run around then and run 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.300
 then make it up 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.690
 get bigger but with us you can 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.430
 only from twelve then we plug in 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.830
 three different courses once from 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.630
 12 to 16 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.210
 Thursdays then Fridays from 16 Ours 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.270
 taxis free training and then so 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.890
 sundays contents the people doing the die 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.060
 the whole thing a bit longer 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.430
 you do not necessarily do it 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.540
 stand all the time and Thursdays 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.570
 So that's all the basics and there it is 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.680
 is really with guidance with it 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.980
 the first a basic understanding of 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.880
 get parkour and a bit 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.420
 I would make a mess for the movement 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.420
 say it now
