00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.099 
welcome to ping skills lessons we're
going<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.700> talk<00:00:05.850> about<00:00:06.149> the<00:00:06.450> basic<00:00:06.899> serve

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
going to talk about the basic serve

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.750 
going to talk about the basic serve
today<00:00:07.500> now<00:00:07.919> this<00:00:08.100> is<00:00:08.250> one<00:00:08.430> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.610> most

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
today now this is one of the most

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.430 
today now this is one of the most
important<00:00:09.420> things<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.809> you<00:00:09.930> must<00:00:10.230> learn

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
important things that you must learn

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.830 
important things that you must learn
because<00:00:10.830> every<00:00:11.639> rally<00:00:11.820> starts<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:12.510> a<00:00:12.539> serve

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
because every rally starts with a serve

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.539 
because every rally starts with a serve
so<00:00:13.500> it's<00:00:13.680> really<00:00:13.830> important<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.309> get<00:00:14.400> this

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
so it's really important to get this

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.820 
so it's really important to get this
right<00:00:14.789> now<00:00:15.539> Alice<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.470> go<00:00:16.590> through

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
right now Alice is going to go through

start<00:00:24.779> off<00:00:24.900> with<00:00:31.369> a<00:00:32.540> bounce<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:33.810> side

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
start off with a bounce on your side

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720 
start off with a bounce on your side
bounce<00:00:34.770> on<00:00:34.980> their<00:00:35.160> side

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
bounce on their side

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.620 
bounce on their side
keep<00:00:36.330> the<00:00:36.510> bounce<00:00:36.750> backs<00:00:37.160> if<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.630> actually

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
keep the bounce backs if you actually

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.290 
keep the bounce backs if you actually
say<00:00:40.080> those<00:00:40.290> words<00:00:40.560> to<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.370> kids<00:00:41.610> start<00:00:42.210> off

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
say those words to the kids start off

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.850 
say those words to the kids start off
with<00:00:42.510> you'll<00:00:42.960> find<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.320> they'll<00:00:43.500> be<00:00:43.620> able<00:00:43.710> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with you'll find that they'll be able to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.930 
with you'll find that they'll be able to
get<00:00:43.980> better<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.800> balanced<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.820> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
get better so it's balanced out and it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.130 
get better so it's balanced out and it
doesn't<00:00:48.120> need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> be<00:00:48.540> any<00:00:48.750> more<00:00:48.840> complicated

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
doesn't need to be any more complicated

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.680 
doesn't need to be any more complicated
than<00:00:49.650> that

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
than that

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
than that
the<00:00:51.690> things<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.500> focus<00:00:52.770> on

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the things to really focus on

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
the things to really focus on
to<00:00:54.390> get<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> bat<00:00:54.900> and<00:00:55.050> ball<00:00:55.170> nice<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.650> close

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
to get the bat and ball nice and close

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.520 
to get the bat and ball nice and close
together<00:00:56.600> about<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.840> far<00:00:58.110> apart

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
together about that far apart

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.560 
together about that far apart
certainly<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.580> isn't<00:00:59.820> very<00:00:59.970> much<00:01:00.270> margin

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
certainly there isn't very much margin

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.620 
certainly there isn't very much margin
for<00:01:00.900> error<00:01:01.110> and<00:01:01.860> then<00:01:02.310> all<00:01:02.730> they're<00:01:03.150> focusing

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
for error and then all they're focusing

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.530 
for error and then all they're focusing
on<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.470> keys<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.760> just<00:01:06.620> bouncing<00:01:07.620> out

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
on is the keys so it's just bouncing out

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
on is the keys so it's just bouncing out
and<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.870> basic<00:01:10.170> serve<00:01:10.410> as<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.770> said

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
and that's the basic serve as I said

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.070 
and that's the basic serve as I said
don't<00:01:11.400> make<00:01:11.670> any<00:01:11.940> more<00:01:12.150> complicated<00:01:12.570> keep<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
don't make any more complicated keep it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.080 
don't make any more complicated keep it
as<00:01:13.170> simple<00:01:13.320> as<00:01:13.560> possible

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.480 

okay<00:01:18.090> once<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.570> player<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.140> do<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.950> bounce

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
okay once the player can do this bounce

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.139 
okay once the player can do this bounce
bounce

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
bounce

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.020 
bounce

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
looks living to focus on is to make sure

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.969 
looks living to focus on is to make sure
that<00:01:24.360> they're<00:01:24.570> hitting<00:01:25.290> that<00:01:25.560> ball<00:01:25.740> from

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
that they're hitting that ball from

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
that they're hitting that ball from
behind<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.520> line<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> paper<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.509> the

person's point so now we want to get the
kids<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.460> focus<00:01:35.610> on<00:01:35.909> being<00:01:36.600> behind<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.080> line

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
kids to focus on being behind the line

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.219 
kids to focus on being behind the line
so<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:37.950> here<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.640> next<00:01:38.789> level<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.869> bounce

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
so from here the next level is it bounce

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.950 
so from here the next level is it bounce
bounce

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.930 

again<00:01:46.960> keeping<00:01:47.830> it<00:01:47.920> simple<00:01:48.100> just<00:01:48.430> giving<00:01:48.820> them

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
again keeping it simple just giving them

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.160 
again keeping it simple just giving them
one<00:01:49.120> simple<00:01:49.870> level<00:01:50.140> at<00:01:50.230> the<00:01:50.320> time<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:51.040> work<00:01:51.550> on

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
one simple level at the time to work on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.780 
one simple level at the time to work on
the<00:01:53.170> line<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:59.170> next<00:01:59.290> level<00:01:59.650> of<00:01:59.740> serving<00:02:00.160> is<00:02:00.430> to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
the line the next level of serving is to

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.150 
the line the next level of serving is to
get<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.360> players<00:02:01.630> to<00:02:01.900> be<00:02:02.020> able<00:02:02.230> to<00:02:02.470> hold<00:02:03.010> the

ball correctly and also throw the ball
up<00:02:05.260> begin<00:02:05.770> another<00:02:06.070> rule<00:02:06.370> of<00:02:06.610> serving<00:02:07.860> so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
up begin another rule of serving so

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.280 
up begin another rule of serving so
focus<00:02:09.850> on<00:02:09.970> now<00:02:10.149> is<00:02:10.420> getting<00:02:10.660> them<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.990> hold<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
focus on now is getting them to hold the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.910 
focus on now is getting them to hold the
ball<00:02:11.470> on<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.800> tray<00:02:12.160> tray<00:02:12.970> being<00:02:13.240> their<00:02:13.450> hand<00:02:13.920> the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
ball on a tray tray being their hand the

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.130 
ball on a tray tray being their hand the
next<00:02:15.190> thing<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.210> get<00:02:16.480> them<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.780> throw<00:02:16.960> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
next thing is to get them to throw the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:28.710
