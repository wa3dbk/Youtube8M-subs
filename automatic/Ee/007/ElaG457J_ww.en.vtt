00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.400
 today we are going to make some fondant babies 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.029
 good you see how we keep our 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.410
 fondant let's use meat-colored fondant 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:16.800
 blue color fondant we have put a 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.090
 form is intense and a blue clarito 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.100
 we have also put a rose we are going to 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.690
 make a baby and a baby then 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.810
 we will use the best for the hair a 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.460
 yellow fondant I also have here cmc 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.460
 size are the powders we use to 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.679
 toughen the fondant and fat so you do not 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.210
 the fondant sticks to my hands 

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.399
 because the first thing we always do that 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.530
 we model , you already know is to make a ball 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.999
 let's think about how we are going to do 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.940
 baby size 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:49.540
 a love to this is a baby a little big 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.650
 they make a little smaller 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.660
 we make our blue fondant ball 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.460
 well you know that our videos are 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.770
 we recorded in the workshop they have not 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.720
 interrupted I could not record this is 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.370
 our baby now I'm going to make you to the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.310
 girl so you do not say that you do not 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.720
 I teach then we do the same with the 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.770
 rose that what we had done with the 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:16.360
 blue we throw a little cmc and knead 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:19.750
 we form a ball you see and now 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.690
 look at this is my ball I'm going to make a 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.950
 cylinder and now with these two fingers 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.500
 I do so I am creating the legs of the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.729
 baby that are a little shorter and the 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.640
 little arms that are a little longer you see 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.300
 the only thing I do is this once I 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.720
 I've this 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.790
 with a short knife stake these 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.730
 it's my legs that the only thing I have 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 what to do is to put a tad down 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.090
 the baby is crawling the bum to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.090
 above 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.510
 and humans do this the same what 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.470
 short in 2 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.470
 and I give it shape 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.380
 this is going to be the front part now 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:16.150
 I put the bum upset you know 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.240
 that babies especially while 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.640
 crawl ours is crawling go 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 control culete up then we 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.740
 we put the culete up 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.659
 we already have this first part now 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.330
 let's make the head we 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:36.159
 we assume that the baby is with a body 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.440
 I already say crawling then you do not need 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:41.560
 that we put feet to him we are going to do now 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.470
 the head as babies are stubborn 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.599
 let's make a fat ball is with 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.080
 meat color you know we have another 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.470
 video of how meat is made 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.060
 a bit big, I'm going to take it a little 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.640
 we always measure to see a bit the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.330
 proportion 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.040
 Well, you see this ball is going 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.470
 to be worth here both a little more facts 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.720
 is going to be worth 22 and now what I'm going to 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:10.920
 do is put a little diluted cmt 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.540
 here to hit our head 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.520
 he gets diluted , you know what is 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.150
 cmc powder mixed with water 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:23.500
 if this is our head it is worth then 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.780
 fix with a be here mouth I do 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.910
 a mouth the frame a little so that it does not 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.640
 stay in now in the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:33.010
 ends of the mouth I do a few 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.760
 little dots and I'm going to hit him with a 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:40.300
 little of cmc in the nose and is eye other 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.450
 little flesh color and he stuck his nose and 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.450
 is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.470
 well, I'll put the little eyes on them later 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.390
 because I want them to be painted then 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.330
 it is better to dry the fondant I will 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.700
 put the hands with a bit of cbc and 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.650
 I also put the hands and now 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.319
 As a girl, we can put you up 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.629
 a bow on the kick and let's see it 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.480
 I'm putting his hands, there's no 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.700
 to work hard with two balls we 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.810
 ok and now we give him a kick and 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.810
 and a little bow 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.600
 Well, this is a close-up of 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.180
 our babies, we have the other 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.670
 sorry we have painted your eyes 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.440
 because the baby is drier 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.500
 we will paint now another thing that we can 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.640
 do is put a pacifier then what 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.200
 that what we have done is also 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.480
 make him there's a slit like it's 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.969
 where the diaper changes but you see what 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.050
 easy is our babies 

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:44.840
 that is, summarize flying 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.090
 now we turn that ball into a 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.690
 Narrower cylinder on both sides 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.590
 and with your finger carefully alice masters 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.330
 here and here - in the back 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.400
 because they are the legs that go like 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.610
 caught because he is crawling and a little 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.669
 more in the front 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.139
 we create like a snake you see the 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:11.110
 culete goes up here and here it falls like that and 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:15.669
 then here it stays smoother for the 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:19.950
 little arms cut in front and behind to 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:21.930
 simple hands and feet 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.910
 well we've done a little bit the way 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.760
 the legs a little the way in the 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.030
 hands of the little arms forgiveness and we have 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.580
 made the indentation the culete with the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.660
 button now let's put the head 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:37.200
 Well , we have already put the head 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.480

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:45.110
 the two babies 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.699

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.699
