00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.590
 hello and welcome 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.390
 raw energy that's not me I wanted 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.340
 I show you how to make vegetables today 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.380
 Noodles makes several questions then 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.750
 get and not easy 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.690
 was her need to a delicious vegetable 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.490
 from good to noodles can handle 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.320
 there you can, for example, as in this 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.010
 Now you can take the zucchini 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.750
 also pickled gherkins and also dry 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.309
 that believes everything very well there 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.589
 also the possibility of some pumpkin 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.300
 to process noodles because there must 

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.039
 Try her a little bit and with it 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.170
 really looks like real spaghetti 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:50.350
 or noodles we have to do this here first 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:52.719
 we are now skulling a gvo here 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.219
 Spirelli does not call himself that in 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.739
 different colors and I'll take a look 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:00.190
 If you see that well, it has a side 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:03.010
 here where you strip something thicker 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.019
 can do and a side with the man 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.810
 can make thinner strips 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.850
 I always like it when she is not like that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.369
 That's why I'm transformed 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.030
 the zucchini now here times in thinner 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 spaghetti 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.980
 and that remains then we take that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.230
 one more for the sauce just like that 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.060
 peel even from the zucchini and 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.280
 Here you can see you have so beautiful 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.710
 zucchini spaghetti here but such a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.510
 snowing tower thus are carriers 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 tower with it and impale the 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.750
 can here 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.060
 and could continue to rotate though 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.920
 that this is just close to this stream 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.420
 has can be the best I shoot with a 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.560
 cut off that comes everything 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.530
 even with the sauce 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.040
 yes and i have the rest of here now 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.710
 the zucchini reingetan the bowls couple 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 small rat tomatoes a garlic clove 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:10.140
 and two huge ones with dates and me 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.140
 must now grumble sauce 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.030
 and so see the vegetable noodles with the 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.860
 Tomato sauce out if it's a bit 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.630
 nicely decorated i still have one 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.010
 few flakes made over here the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.750
 Taste very good here too 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.460
 noodles and who would like to finish 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.620
 Add a little more salt 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.270
 while avoiding the salt if possible 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.920
 I just want to leave it as it is 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.020
 that tastes very good is a nice one 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.460
 portion does not have very many calories 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.380
 because the only calorie diet is running 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.970
 are coming from these two dates though 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 you want it calories denser 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.440
 just a real date 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.430
 tomato sauce with a lot of data or if 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.230
 her a little one too 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.400
 between meal so needs with little 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.300
 calories then that's really a lot 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.890
 good choice 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.720
 maybe even if you have one 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.950
 I ate too little 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.330
 I wish you much fun while copying 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.330
 and see you soon
