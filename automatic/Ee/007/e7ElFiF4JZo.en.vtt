00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.390 
comes to that thing he's not too fast so
maybe<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.470> could<00:01:25.650> get<00:01:25.740> better<00:01:25.950> safety<00:01:26.189> we

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
maybe we could get better safety we

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.770 
maybe we could get better safety we
can't<00:01:26.640> be<00:01:26.759> picky<00:01:27.000> about<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.659> our

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
can't be picky about that so get our

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.630 
can't be picky about that so get our
second<00:01:28.140> left<00:01:28.290> tackle<00:01:28.740> probably<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.520> move

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
second left tackle probably have to move

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
second left tackle probably have to move
one<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.090> these<00:01:30.210> guys<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.750> tackle

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
one of these guys to right tackle

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.140 
one of these guys to right tackle
cuz<00:01:31.710> I'm<00:01:31.920> Donald<00:01:32.280> Payne<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.549> Corti<00:01:32.850> Glenn<00:01:33.030> are

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
cuz I'm Donald Payne and Corti Glenn are

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
cuz I'm Donald Payne and Corti Glenn are
both<00:01:33.299> pretty<00:01:33.420> decent<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.290> we'll<00:01:34.380> figure<00:01:34.560> that

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
both pretty decent so we'll figure that

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
both pretty decent so we'll figure that
out<00:01:34.920> along<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> think

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
out along the way we go I think

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
out along the way we go I think
Donnellan<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.900> play<00:01:37.079> some<00:01:37.259> right<00:01:37.439> tackle<00:01:37.770> as

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
Donnellan can play some right tackle as

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.600 
Donnellan can play some right tackle as
we<00:01:38.189> get<00:01:38.340> Cam<00:01:38.640> Newton<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> say<00:01:40.439> cam<00:01:41.189> at

mad<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.940> rule<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> always

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
mad and that is the one rule that always

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.210 
mad and that is the one rule that always
applies<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.049> get<00:02:49.230> we're<00:02:49.709> starting<00:02:49.920> at<00:02:50.040> way

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
applies as we get we're starting at way

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.589 
applies as we get we're starting at way
too<00:02:50.250> many<00:02:50.700> tight<00:02:50.940> ends<00:02:51.120> we're<00:02:51.299> sorry

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
too many tight ends we're sorry

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.789 
too many tight ends we're sorry
this<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:51.870> one<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.049> those<00:02:52.140> packing<00:02:52.500> goes<00:02:52.620> with

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
this is one of those packing goes with

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.680 
this is one of those packing goes with
them<00:02:52.890> no<00:02:53.220> no<00:02:53.459> no<00:02:53.610> don't<00:02:53.819> give<00:02:53.970> me<00:02:54.090> no<00:02:54.209> tight<00:02:54.480> end

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
them no no no don't give me no tight end

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.300 
them no no no don't give me no tight end
then<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.079> pull<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.379> 800<00:02:55.829> more<00:02:55.920> tight<00:02:56.099> ends

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
then we just pull it 800 more tight ends

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.770 
then we just pull it 800 more tight ends
hopefully<00:02:57.030> that's<00:02:57.180> not<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.540> way<00:02:57.660> it

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
hopefully that's not the way it

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780 
hopefully that's not the way it
continues<00:02:58.110> Wow<00:02:58.829> right<00:02:59.160> on<00:02:59.280> cue<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.579> we<00:02:59.670> got

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
continues Wow right on cue and we got

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.100 
continues Wow right on cue and we got
next<00:02:59.970> you're<00:03:00.060> better<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.360> fact<00:03:00.510> this<00:03:00.989> is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
next you're better in fact this is

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.199 
next you're better in fact this is
something<00:03:01.230> we<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.590> definitely<00:03:02.069> use<00:03:02.310> because

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
something we can definitely use because

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.690 
something we can definitely use because
how<00:03:03.750> we<00:03:04.260> can<00:03:04.410> use<00:03:04.530> any<00:03:04.799> extra<00:03:05.190> place<00:03:05.370> we<00:03:05.579> can

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
how we can use any extra place we can

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.430 
how we can use any extra place we can
get<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.360> two<00:03:06.569> extra<00:03:06.930> players<00:03:07.170> out<00:03:07.410> of

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
get so this is two extra players out of

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.839 
get so this is two extra players out of
the<00:03:07.530> vendor<00:03:07.739> pack<00:03:07.890> two<00:03:08.040> girls<00:03:08.250> are<00:03:08.400> better<00:03:08.489> and

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
the vendor pack two girls are better and

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.759 
the vendor pack two girls are better and
potentially<00:03:09.510> any<00:03:09.660> Silver's<00:03:09.989> and<00:03:10.140> we<00:03:10.349> may<00:03:10.530> end

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
potentially any Silver's and we may end

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.559 
potentially any Silver's and we may end
up<00:03:10.920> using<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.430> I'll<00:03:11.519> definitely<00:03:11.910> take<00:03:12.360> this

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
up using so I'll definitely take this

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.780 
up using so I'll definitely take this
free<00:03:12.900> pull<00:03:13.140> out<00:03:13.319> there<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:13.829> we<00:03:14.190> get<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.400> Bradley

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
free pull out there and we get a Bradley

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.479 
free pull out there and we get a Bradley

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
Roby's only been 80 overall not the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.550 
Roby's only been 80 overall not the
nine-year-old<00:03:21.510> he<00:03:21.660> could<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.049> if<00:03:22.139> we<00:03:22.230> combine

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
nine-year-old he could be if we combine

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.620 
nine-year-old he could be if we combine

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
out there so our quarterback depth is

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.800 
out there so our quarterback depth is
subtly<00:03:26.459> looking<00:03:26.760> good<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.090> safety<00:03:27.329> depth<00:03:27.690> is

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
subtly looking good or safety depth is

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.300 
subtly looking good or safety depth is

make<00:05:40.280> sure<00:05:40.430> we<00:05:40.580> all<00:05:40.760> build<00:05:41.090> up<00:05:41.240> every<00:05:41.690> position

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
make sure we all build up every position

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.210 
make sure we all build up every position
on<00:05:42.080> the<00:05:42.139> offensive<00:05:42.620> line<00:05:42.800> at<00:05:42.950> least<00:05:43.099> that

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:43.220 
on the offensive line at least that

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.790 
on the offensive line at least that
would<00:05:43.370> be<00:05:43.520> nice<00:05:43.760> so<00:05:44.410> we're<00:05:45.410> starting<00:05:45.500> to<00:05:45.680> get<00:05:45.740> a

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
would be nice so we're starting to get a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.790 
would be nice so we're starting to get a
lot<00:05:46.039> of<00:05:46.720> secondary<00:05:47.720> help<00:05:48.020> as<00:05:48.199> we<00:05:48.349> pull<00:05:48.530> a<00:05:48.560> right

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
lot of secondary help as we pull a right

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.320 
lot of secondary help as we pull a right
tackle<00:05:49.039> there<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.370> lot<00:05:49.520> of<00:05:49.550> tackles<00:05:50.030> not<00:05:50.150> enough

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
tackle there a lot of tackles not enough

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.730 
tackle there a lot of tackles not enough
guards<00:05:50.570> that's<00:05:50.810> our<00:05:50.930> problem<00:05:51.110> right<00:05:51.289> now<00:05:51.440> as

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
guards that's our problem right now as

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800 
guards that's our problem right now as
the<00:05:52.250> rest<00:05:52.460> of<00:05:52.520> this<00:05:52.610> thing<00:05:52.669> is<00:05:52.910> not<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.090> hot<00:05:53.479> so

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 
the rest of this thing is not so hot so

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:55.570 
the rest of this thing is not so hot so
what<00:05:54.289> we<00:05:54.410> want<00:05:54.590> is<00:05:54.680> maybe<00:05:55.010> another<00:05:55.190> linebacker

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
what we want is maybe another linebacker

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.760 
what we want is maybe another linebacker
I<00:05:56.240> think<00:05:56.810> we<00:05:56.900> have<00:05:57.020> two<00:05:57.169> middle<00:05:57.320> linebackers

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
I think we have two middle linebackers

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.170 
I think we have two middle linebackers
maybe<00:05:57.979> like<00:05:58.130> an<00:05:58.220> outside<00:05:58.580> linebacker<00:05:58.760> would

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
maybe like an outside linebacker would

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.820 
maybe like an outside linebacker would
work<00:05:59.389> and<00:05:59.720> then<00:05:59.960> we<00:06:00.110> want<00:06:00.289> the<00:06:00.500> rest<00:06:00.650> of<00:06:00.710> our

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
work and then we want the rest of our

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.350 
work and then we want the rest of our
offense<00:06:01.130> and<00:06:01.250> I'm<00:06:01.370> built<00:06:01.610> up<00:06:01.789> maybe<00:06:02.120> not<00:06:02.330> a

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
offense and I'm built up maybe not a

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.450 
offense and I'm built up maybe not a
wide<00:06:02.539> receiver<00:06:02.840> that's<00:06:03.800> too<00:06:03.949> much<00:06:04.070> to<00:06:04.160> ask<00:06:04.250> and

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
wide receiver that's too much to ask and

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.920 
wide receiver that's too much to ask and
we<00:06:04.520> just<00:06:04.669> pulled<00:06:04.849> Wes<00:06:05.000> Welker<00:06:05.180> right<00:06:05.479> on<00:06:05.630> cue

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
we just pulled Wes Welker right on cue

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.900 
we just pulled Wes Welker right on cue
that<00:06:06.289> is<00:06:06.440> a<00:06:06.470> slot<00:06:06.889> wide<00:06:07.099> receiver<00:06:07.490> and<00:06:07.760> it's

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:07.910 
that is a slot wide receiver and it's

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:09.490 
that is a slot wide receiver and it's
fine<00:06:08.270> is<00:06:08.449> right<00:06:08.630> there<00:06:08.840> so<00:06:09.169> that's<00:06:09.289> a<00:06:09.349> really

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
fine is right there so that's a really

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.770 
fine is right there so that's a really
good<00:06:09.680> pull<00:06:09.919> and<00:06:10.160> our<00:06:10.280> last<00:06:10.460> guy<00:06:10.729> is<00:06:10.789> a<00:06:11.240> James

good pull and our last guy is a James
Casey<00:06:12.080> there's<00:06:12.380> one<00:06:12.500> position<00:06:12.680> I<00:06:12.830> really<00:06:13.039> did

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
Casey there's one position I really did

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:14.830 
Casey there's one position I really did
not<00:06:13.280> care<00:06:13.340> about<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:14.300> is<00:06:14.419> the<00:06:14.539> full-back

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840 
not care about that is the full-back

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.180 
not care about that is the full-back
position<00:06:14.870> but<00:06:15.320> we<00:06:15.410> got<00:06:15.530> it<00:06:15.620> anyway<00:06:15.830> so<00:06:15.889> Wes

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
position but we got it anyway so Wes

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.909 
position but we got it anyway so Wes
will<00:06:16.370> be<00:06:16.539> slow<00:06:17.539> he<00:06:18.110> isn't<00:06:18.320> he's<00:06:18.770> an

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
will be slow he isn't he's an

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.430 
will be slow he isn't he's an
exceptionally<00:06:19.639> slow<00:06:19.910> receiver<00:06:20.360> 82<00:06:20.720> speed<00:06:21.050> we

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
exceptionally slow receiver 82 speed we

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.200 
exceptionally slow receiver 82 speed we
might<00:06:21.650> actually<00:06:21.889> have<00:06:22.160> tightens<00:06:22.669> faster<00:06:23.060> than

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
might actually have tightens faster than

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.940 
might actually have tightens faster than
Wes<00:06:23.360> Welker<00:06:23.570> but<00:06:24.349> we<00:06:24.440> will<00:06:24.560> still<00:06:24.680> put<00:06:24.770> him<00:06:24.890> in

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:24.950 
Wes Welker but we will still put him in

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.899 
Wes Welker but we will still put him in
the<00:06:25.039> side<00:06:25.159> anyways<00:06:25.490> because<00:06:25.610> he's<00:06:25.760> got<00:06:25.880> great

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:25.909 
the side anyways because he's got great

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:27.310 
the side anyways because he's got great
catching<00:06:26.330> traffic<00:06:26.659> so<00:06:26.750> we<00:06:26.780> got<00:06:26.960> four<00:06:27.140> more

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.230 
catching traffic so we got four more
better<00:06:27.500> bags<00:06:27.770> left<00:06:28.039> four<00:06:28.550> more<00:06:28.789> chances<00:06:28.969> to

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
better bags left four more chances to

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.679 
better bags left four more chances to
get<00:06:29.450> some

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:29.689 
get some

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:31.029 
get some
got<00:06:29.869> actually<00:06:30.199> eight<00:06:30.349> more<00:06:30.529> chances<00:06:30.830> to<00:06:30.889> get

got actually eight more chances to get

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:33.639 
got actually eight more chances to get
some<00:06:31.159> guards<00:06:31.610> and<00:06:31.789> some<00:06:32.229> my<00:06:33.229> back<00:06:33.469> because

that's when we need them
I<00:06:34.429> guess<00:06:34.729> defense<00:06:35.029> line<00:06:35.239> help<00:06:35.419> will<00:06:35.539> work<00:06:35.659> on

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:35.809 
I guess defense line help will work on

00:06:35.809 --> 00:06:37.329 
I guess defense line help will work on
do<00:06:35.929> we<00:06:36.019> put<00:06:36.169> a<00:06:36.199> single<00:06:36.409> left<00:06:36.679> and<00:06:36.860> gold<00:06:37.249> or

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:37.339 
do we put a single left and gold or

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:38.679 
do we put a single left and gold or
better<00:06:37.489> so<00:06:37.639> that<00:06:37.759> was<00:06:37.849> a<00:06:37.999> good<00:06:38.299> pull<00:06:38.539> right

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
better so that was a good pull right

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.659 
better so that was a good pull right
there<00:06:38.749> as<00:06:39.110> we<00:06:39.289> pull<00:06:39.469> a<00:06:39.499> Santonio<00:06:40.129> Holmes<00:06:40.369> I
