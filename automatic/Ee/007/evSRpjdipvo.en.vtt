00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
me so that I don't have to slice it up

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.399 
me so that I don't have to slice it up
into<00:00:54.369> individual<00:00:54.970> files<00:00:55.269> in<00:00:55.659> order<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.290> do

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600

and<00:01:07.840> see<00:01:08.080> if<00:01:08.170> there's<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.380> checkmark<00:01:08.830> you<00:01:09.400> can

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
and see if there's a checkmark you can

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.039 
and see if there's a checkmark you can
turn<00:01:09.670> that<00:01:09.790> on<00:01:09.850> and<00:01:09.970> off<00:01:10.150> just<00:01:10.390> by<00:01:10.510> tapping<00:01:10.780> it

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
turn that on and off just by tapping it

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.230 
turn that on and off just by tapping it
like<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:11.380> once<00:01:12.189> you<00:01:12.310> turn<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.700> Photoshop

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
like that once you turn it on Photoshop

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.630 
like that once you turn it on Photoshop
then<00:01:13.420> generates<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:14.200> folder<00:01:14.860> wherever<00:01:15.310> this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
then generates a folder wherever this

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.700 
then generates a folder wherever this
file<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:16.000> saved<00:01:16.210> or<00:01:16.509> on<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.049> desktop<00:01:17.470> if<00:01:17.619> it

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
hasn't been saved yet and then as you

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.749 
hasn't been saved yet and then as you
create<00:01:19.810> your<00:01:19.990> layers<00:01:20.500> over<00:01:20.920> here<00:01:21.340> it

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
create your layers over here it

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.400 
create your layers over here it
automatically<00:01:22.240> generates<00:01:22.450> assets<00:01:23.050> based<00:01:23.260> on

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
automatically generates assets based on

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.260 
automatically generates assets based on
those<00:01:23.530> layer<00:01:23.710> names<00:01:24.040> now<00:01:24.700> you<00:01:25.000> have<00:01:25.120> to<00:01:25.180> be

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
those layer names now you have to be

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.640 
those layer names now you have to be
kind<00:01:25.360> of<00:01:25.450> careful<00:01:25.630> with<00:01:25.900> how<00:01:26.050> you<00:01:26.080> name<00:01:26.500> your

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
kind of careful with how you name your

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.710 
kind of careful with how you name your
layers<00:01:26.770> so<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.760> append<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.390> file

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
layers so you have to append the file

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.420 
layers so you have to append the file
extension<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.530> file<00:01:29.740> type<00:01:30.010> that<00:01:30.040> you<00:01:30.280> want

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
extension of the file type that you want

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.220 
extension of the file type that you want
so<00:01:31.030> for<00:01:31.180> instance<00:01:31.480> on<00:01:31.600> these<00:01:31.750> background

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
so for instance on these background

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.630 
so for instance on these background
layers<00:01:32.380> if<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.590> want<00:01:32.770> to<00:01:32.830> name<00:01:32.980> them<00:01:33.160> something

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
layers if I want to name them something

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.420 
layers if I want to name them something
dot<00:01:34.240> jpg<00:01:34.780> then<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.260> would<00:01:35.380> generate<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:35.710> jpg<00:01:36.159> so

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
dot jpg then it would generate a jpg so

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.110 
dot jpg then it would generate a jpg so
in<00:01:36.580> this<00:01:36.670> case<00:01:36.880> we'll<00:01:37.060> call<00:01:37.210> this<00:01:37.390> blue<00:01:38.400> BG<00:01:39.430> dot

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
in this case we'll call this blue BG dot

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.649 
in this case we'll call this blue BG dot
jpg<00:01:40.900> in<00:01:41.610> addition<00:01:42.610> to<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.940> file<00:01:43.210> extension

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
jpg in addition to the file extension

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.690 
jpg in addition to the file extension
you<00:01:43.750> can<00:01:43.780> also<00:01:44.140> append<00:01:44.620> things<00:01:45.070> like<00:01:45.250> quality

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
you can also append things like quality

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.500 
you can also append things like quality
settings<00:01:46.030> so<00:01:46.150> I<00:01:46.210> could<00:01:46.390> say<00:01:46.600> green<00:01:47.380> dot<00:01:48.070> jpg<00:01:48.790> 10

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
settings so I could say green dot jpg 10

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.480 
settings so I could say green dot jpg 10
to<00:01:50.050> give<00:01:50.170> it<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.320> quality<00:01:50.500> setting<00:01:50.890> of<00:01:50.979> 10<00:01:51.220> and

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490
