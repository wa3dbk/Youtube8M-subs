know that somebody else is going to have
the<00:00:29.930> same<00:00:30.080> issues<00:00:30.410> that<00:00:30.440> I<00:00:30.620> did<00:00:30.920> and<00:00:31.340> this<00:00:31.850> is

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
the same issues that I did and this is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.340 
the same issues that I did and this is
pretty<00:00:32.210> cool<00:00:32.480> with<00:00:32.989> your<00:00:33.140> fuel<00:00:33.350> line<00:00:34.839> if<00:00:35.839> it's

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
pretty cool with your fuel line if it's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.660 
pretty cool with your fuel line if it's
come<00:00:36.800> undone<00:00:37.160> or

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
come undone or

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.329 
come undone or
not<00:00:38.539> remembered<00:00:39.019> but<00:00:39.469> if<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:39.710> cracked<00:00:40.070> or

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
not remembered but if it's cracked or

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.779 
not remembered but if it's cracked or
broken<00:00:40.429> or<00:00:41.390> leaking<00:00:41.989> or<00:00:42.170> whatever<00:00:42.499> and<00:00:42.949> they

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
broken or leaking or whatever and they

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:51.119 
broken or leaking or whatever and they
have<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:45.350> new<00:00:46.120> it's<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:47.239> coupling<00:00:47.659> and<00:00:48.670> it's<00:00:49.670> a

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
have this new it's a coupling and it's a

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:55.569 
have this new it's a coupling and it's a
pressure<00:00:52.129> fit<00:00:52.399> so<00:00:52.670> look<00:00:53.239> at<00:00:53.390> it<00:00:54.309> see<00:00:55.309> right

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
pressure fit so look at it see right

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:01.779 
pressure fit so look at it see right
there<00:00:58.749> right<00:00:59.749> there<00:00:59.989> so<00:01:00.589> it's<00:01:01.370> really<00:01:01.519> cool

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
there right there so it's really cool

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.450 
there right there so it's really cool
because<00:01:01.999> you<00:01:02.210> know<00:01:03.850> rather<00:01:04.850> than<00:01:05.000> putting<00:01:06.460> you

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
because you know rather than putting you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.639 
because you know rather than putting you
know<00:01:07.549> having<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:07.880> heat<00:01:08.060> up<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.329> hose<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:08.960> then

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649 
know having to heat up the hose and then

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.899 
know having to heat up the hose and then
putting<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.420> insert<00:01:11.420> on<00:01:11.659> each<00:01:11.899> side<00:01:12.909> it's

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
putting that insert on each side it's

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.550 
putting that insert on each side it's
really<00:01:14.299> hard<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.600> do<00:01:14.719> and<00:01:14.869> you<00:01:14.930> end<00:01:15.079> up<00:01:15.110> kink<00:01:15.409> in

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
really hard to do and you end up kink in

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.810 
really hard to do and you end up kink in
it<00:01:15.649> and<00:01:15.770> messing<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.100> all<00:01:16.159> up<00:01:16.219> but<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:16.549> can<00:01:16.700> see

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
it and messing it all up but you can see

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.800 
it and messing it all up but you can see
this<00:01:16.939> is<00:01:17.200> really<00:01:18.200> nice<00:01:18.380> job<00:01:18.619> here<00:01:18.860> but<00:01:19.850> um<00:01:20.119> yeah

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
this is really nice job here but um yeah

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.380 
this is really nice job here but um yeah
that's<00:01:21.320> you<00:01:22.070> just<00:01:22.250> push<00:01:22.490> them<00:01:22.640> push<00:01:23.119> them<00:01:23.180> in

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's you just push them push them in

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.950 
that's you just push them push them in
both<00:01:23.689> sides<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:24.409> then<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.100> locks<00:01:25.280> in<00:01:25.610> and

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
both sides and and then it locks in and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.109 
both sides and and then it locks in and
and<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.110> does<00:01:27.259> not<00:01:27.439> leak<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.700> then<00:01:28.850> over<00:01:29.060> here

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and it does not leak and then over here

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:39.069 
and it does not leak and then over here
I<00:01:30.789> did<00:01:31.789> this<00:01:32.060> I<00:01:35.289> got<00:01:36.289> this<00:01:36.469> at<00:01:36.649> chucks<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.079> and

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
I did this I got this at chucks and and

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.349 
I did this I got this at chucks and and
it<00:01:39.469> all<00:01:39.590> fit<00:01:39.890> no<00:01:40.789> leaks

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
it all fit no leaks

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:43.779 
it all fit no leaks
nothing<00:01:41.930> at<00:01:42.020> all<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:43.130> original<00:01:43.429> one<00:01:43.609> was

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
nothing at all and the original one was

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.779 
nothing at all and the original one was
was<00:01:44.149> leaking<00:01:44.539> right<00:01:45.070> right<00:01:46.070> at<00:01:46.219> that<00:01:46.369> ninety

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
was leaking right right at that ninety

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.889 
was leaking right right at that ninety
and<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.630> could<00:01:47.810> not<00:01:47.960> get<00:01:48.200> it<00:01:48.350> a<00:01:49.390> good<00:01:50.390> seal<00:01:50.659> on<00:01:50.689> it

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
and I could not get it a good seal on it

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.230 
and I could not get it a good seal on it
so<00:01:51.439> anyway<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.340> went<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.670> Chuck's<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:55.179> then<00:01:56.179> I

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
so anyway I went to Chuck's and then I

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.359 
so anyway I went to Chuck's and then I
found<00:01:56.420> this<00:01:56.749> thing<00:01:56.810> here<00:01:57.259> in<00:01:57.499> that<00:01:57.679> it<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.249> so

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
found this thing here in that it is so

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:58.870 
found this thing here in that it is so
much<00:01:58.429> easier

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
much easier

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.239 
much easier
I<00:01:58.999> mean<00:01:59.179> took<00:01:59.329> like<00:01:59.929> two<00:02:00.079> minutes<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:00.530> do<00:02:00.649> you

00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:01.249 
I mean took like two minutes to do you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:03.160 
I mean took like two minutes to do you
know<00:02:01.369> I<00:02:01.399> just<00:02:01.609> cut<00:02:01.820> cut<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.329> the<00:02:02.780> right<00:02:02.929> side

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
know I just cut cut this the right side

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.319 
know I just cut cut this the right side
there<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.590> fit<00:02:03.799> then<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.460> left<00:02:04.640> side<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.179> know

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
there to fit then the left side you know

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:07.090 
there to fit then the left side you know
so<00:02:05.659> it<00:02:05.840> wouldn't<00:02:06.229> be<00:02:06.289> too<00:02:06.380> long<00:02:06.740> or<00:02:06.920> too<00:02:06.950> short

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so it wouldn't be too long or too short

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.789 
so it wouldn't be too long or too short
to<00:02:08.060> fit<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.539> then<00:02:08.659> suck<00:02:09.019> them<00:02:09.170> together<00:02:09.349> nope

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
to fit and then suck them together nope

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.960 
to fit and then suck them together nope
easy<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.450> done<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:14.470> if<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:15.370> want<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.700> know<00:02:15.790> how

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
easy and done so if you want to know how

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.309 
easy and done so if you want to know how
to<00:02:16.030> fix<00:02:16.299> fuel<00:02:16.720> line

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
to fix fuel line

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.100 
to fix fuel line
broken<00:02:18.129> or<00:02:18.760> cracked<00:02:18.819> fuel<00:02:19.360> line<00:02:19.569> that's<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
broken or cracked fuel line that's the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
broken or cracked fuel line that's the
way<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.379> do<00:02:20.500> it<00:02:20.650> shucks<00:02:21.099> has<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:21.549> couplings

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
way to do it shucks has these couplings

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780 
way to do it shucks has these couplings
here<00:02:22.590> are<00:02:23.590> butt<00:02:23.860> connectors<00:02:24.280> if<00:02:24.459> you<00:02:24.579> want<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
here are butt connectors if you want to

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.210 
here are butt connectors if you want to
call<00:02:24.939> them<00:02:25.030> that<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.360> don't<00:02:25.540> know<00:02:25.769> anyway<00:02:26.769> it

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
call them that I don't know anyway it

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.130 
call them that I don't know anyway it
