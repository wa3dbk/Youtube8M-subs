 and experts 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:15.469
 so few movies 

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.550
 we can 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 even 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:27.619
 for him

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.320
 it goes wrong great novelty functions to point out that it is 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.200
 Republic 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.850
 then apart from the lifter of de Gaulle the cross like others at the bottom 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.090
 according to sony 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.079
 for for users 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.380
 which are 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.080
 we produce nokia 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.030
 his features to his righteous 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.040
 become easier to shoppeople line the platform 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.549
 for example the main flat screen here is 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:04.769
 if the press 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.970
 on an empire on the screen 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.380
 very easily count to customize the main screen 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.310
 to go away in the detail of the tenders at the earliest 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.480

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.840
 in the cult movie 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.270
 so that's very important 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.410
 m of course 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.720
 the record price ap crisis for paul 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.300
 there is too little 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.740
 now Cameroon example 12 megapixels 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.650
 same peak point 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.650
 very good question poutine 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.930
 writing 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.310
 the quality of the photos at 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.780
 videos it's really great 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.730
 and of course we can also see 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.450
 mnequin victims of photos and videos 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.510

 whose act 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.979
 for example he knew knowing that even though four 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.290
 this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.500
 and then 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.669
 multi late what grows angel wings 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:12.050
 six years old 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.050

 off to get in just like that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.179
 my heart is very easily 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:38.669
 by getting involved very involved 

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:42.669

 with this output its optics in organic control 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.209
 ali children I do not see what price 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:54.729
 almost 500 m 

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:57.879
