00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.450
 salty recipe 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.309
 I'll make a cool pea that isn't one 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.320
 simple pea omelette with fita 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.120
 very long tango then how 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 ingredients we must use 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.490
 oil a clove of garlic half 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 egg onion peas 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.170
 naturally I will also use some 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 potatoes that I have previously of 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.679
 then the smoked bacon sector 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:42.120
 they start by putting 3 tablespoons of oil 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:49.940
 about these will already be two in one 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:53.510
 pan put a clove of garlic 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:56.370
 a clove of garlic cut in half I 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.070
 and I remove it after a while so just that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.070
 the flavors and add the peas 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:09.210
 sometimes it can be very good e 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.299
 also very fast business then and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.689
 cut onion in half then for 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.430
 to avoid crying we can wash the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.540
 show we have just a little bit of onion 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.540
 given a bit of everything yesterday 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.789
 ok let's add the onion, turn on the 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.899
 gas 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.700
 remember to put a lid on 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.700
 otherwise it burns everything 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.869
 let me soften the ci a little 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:03.080
 It poses then we remove the garlic and 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.780
 add the other ingredients of 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:18.200
 brother treat the eggs and add a 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:21.310
 we put it a little weird from 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.620
 part because we have to use it due 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.390
 and then we start to cut the potatoes that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.670
 I have previously boiled and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 take them to pour directly with with 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.910
 the skin breasts abundant water without 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 salt and salt for 20 minutes 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.600
 about 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.310
 where you notice that the potato is decocted 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.590
 and it was all right when 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.420
 influencing it with a fork from 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.540
 some time enter quietly 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.540
 then we remove the peel and keep it 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.560
 at radini and so small so serious e 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.690
 let us proceed with the other two io ne 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.370
 I do prepare then check not 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 yes peas and see if the onions do 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.570
 they are softened it seems so yes they are 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.040
 so let's leave it still soft 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.860
 you who can add it also a 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.360
 drop of water and let go in 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.260
 bathroom surround it 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.950
 it would increase our own morbidity 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.950
 just the axes 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.690
 let's look at where they are 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:39.140
 here we are understanding onions they seem to me 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.180
 so I didn't see you so this 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:52.720
 it is another black hand that we proceed 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.720
 adding the potatoes and bacon 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.530
 let's make the facade because it dampens 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.800
 a little bit except the potato and gods 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:31.600
 children then let us leave I will be able to give a 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.380
 according to now the flame now back the 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.380
 pan from the fire 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.640
 add the walls 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:52.560
 let's try to amalgamate them already 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.820
 on the coast and increase the flame 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:58.710
 in short, we must keep an eye on it 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.330
 at least a 5 10 minutes trying to 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.850
 unplug our city is giving gods 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:11.850
 edges of the palermo seems to be 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.850
 detached 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:19.740
 I think now it's time to shoot 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.380
 cook a little bit even where it is in the 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:30.390
 applied we leave the p2 minutini a 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:32.580
 fire not too high we remove the 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.260
 cover 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.010
 I did not understand is ready to implant 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:41.550
 so let's get out and leave a little bit 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:44.580
 cool here is our city until 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:46.700
 well, good appetite and next year 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.700
 Hello
