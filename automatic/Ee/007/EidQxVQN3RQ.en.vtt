shirts I recommend just practicing on

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.300 
shirts I recommend just practicing on
some<00:02:20.110> shirt<00:02:20.320> so<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.590> you're<00:02:20.860> not<00:02:21.010> attached

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
some shirt so that you're not attached

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.180 
some shirt so that you're not attached
to<00:02:21.519> you<00:02:21.670> first<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:23.470> way<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.709> can<00:02:23.950> kind<00:02:24.160> of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
to you first that way you can kind of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.350 
to you first that way you can kind of
get<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> hang<00:02:24.549> of<00:02:24.640> it<00:02:24.760> before<00:02:25.120> you<00:02:25.150> go

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
get the hang of it before you go

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.039 
get the hang of it before you go
screwing<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:25.959> on<00:02:26.080> your<00:02:26.260> fever<00:02:26.680> shirts<00:02:28.049> I've

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
screwing up on your fever shirts I've

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.210 
screwing up on your fever shirts I've
done<00:02:29.260> that<00:02:29.410> more<00:02:29.560> than<00:02:29.709> once<00:02:30.780> just<00:02:31.780> ties

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
done that more than once just ties

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.830 
done that more than once just ties
together

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.589 

so<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:39.230> depends<00:02:39.680> on<00:02:39.799> how<00:02:40.730> loose<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:41.390> want

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
so it depends on how loose do you want

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.429 
so it depends on how loose do you want
the<00:02:41.720> shirt<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.349> or<00:02:42.890> how<00:02:43.129> tight<00:02:43.900> how<00:02:44.900> fancy

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:45.439 
the shirt to be or how tight how fancy

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:47.140 
the shirt to be or how tight how fancy
you<00:02:45.530> want<00:02:45.739> these<00:02:45.890> knots<00:02:46.189> to<00:02:46.430> be<00:02:46.579> you<00:02:46.670> like

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
you want these knots to be you like

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.550 
you want these knots to be you like
right<00:02:47.420> now<00:02:47.540> upset<00:02:47.930> medium<00:02:48.290> looseness

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
right now upset medium looseness

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.259 
right now upset medium looseness
actually<00:02:49.280> probably<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.700> most<00:02:49.819> comfortable

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
actually probably the most comfortable

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.170 
actually probably the most comfortable
for<00:02:50.569> me<00:02:51.010> maybe<00:02:52.010> I'll<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.430> a<00:02:52.459> few<00:02:52.909> more<00:02:53.060> rows<00:02:55.180> and

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
for me maybe I'll do a few more rows and

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.460 
for me maybe I'll do a few more rows and
you<00:02:56.209> don't<00:02:56.450> know<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.900> do<00:02:56.989> every<00:02:57.260> single

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
you don't know have to do every single

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.099 
you don't know have to do every single
strand<00:02:58.159> so<00:02:58.549> maybe<00:02:59.000> I'll<00:02:59.150> start<00:02:59.269> on<00:02:59.540> the<00:02:59.659> second

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
strand so maybe I'll start on the second

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.770 
strand so maybe I'll start on the second
one<00:03:00.609> and<00:03:01.609> this<00:03:02.000> one<00:03:02.180> I'm<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.359> going<00:03:02.569> to<00:03:02.629> do

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
one and this one I'm just going to do

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.630 
one and this one I'm just going to do
one<00:03:02.989> handed<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.439> show<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.680> how<00:03:03.890> loose<00:03:04.159> you<00:03:04.459> can

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
one handed to show you how loose you can

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.630 
one handed to show you how loose you can
make<00:03:04.790> these<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.950> it's<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.280> a<00:03:07.340> different

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
make these and it's just a different

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.300 
make these and it's just a different
style<00:03:07.819> it's<00:03:08.120> different<00:03:09.159> basically<00:03:10.159> how<00:03:10.280> I

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
style it's different basically how I

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.479 
style it's different basically how I
make<00:03:10.519> all<00:03:10.639> my<00:03:10.790> shirts<00:03:12.250> some<00:03:13.250> sort<00:03:13.459> of

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
make all my shirts some sort of

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:19.149 
make all my shirts some sort of
variation<00:03:13.790> of<00:03:14.329> this<00:03:14.540> style<00:03:17.560> so<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.590> would<00:03:18.980> just

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 
variation of this style so I would just

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:21.429 
variation of this style so I would just
cut<00:03:19.879> that<00:03:20.030> last<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.510> in<00:03:20.599> half<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.139> tie<00:03:21.379> it

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
cut that last one in half and tie it

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.819 
cut that last one in half and tie it
with<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.799> others<00:03:22.040> over<00:03:22.310> here<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:24.560> may<00:03:24.739> or

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
with the others over here and you may or

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.080 
with the others over here and you may or
may<00:03:24.920> not<00:03:24.950> want<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.310> make<00:03:25.400> too<00:03:25.670> many<00:03:25.849> knots

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
may not want to make too many knots

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.629 
may not want to make too many knots
because<00:03:26.450> they<00:03:27.019> do<00:03:27.439> get<00:03:27.620> kind<00:03:27.859> of<00:03:27.920> bulky<00:03:28.280> at<00:03:28.519> the

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
because they do get kind of bulky at the

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.129 
because they do get kind of bulky at the
sides<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.349> think<00:03:30.769> that<00:03:30.859> looks<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.159> cool

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
sides so I think that looks pretty cool

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.110 
sides so I think that looks pretty cool
you<00:03:33.139> may<00:03:33.319> or<00:03:33.409> may<00:03:33.470> not<00:03:33.560> like<00:03:33.950> a<00:03:34.310> lot<00:03:34.700> of<00:03:34.819> space

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
you may or may not like a lot of space

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.629 
you may or may not like a lot of space
here<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:36.319> you<00:03:36.379> can<00:03:36.590> make<00:03:36.739> these<00:03:36.950> lines<00:03:37.250> really

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
here so you can make these lines really

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.280 
here so you can make these lines really
smaller<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.510> don't<00:03:38.689> even<00:03:38.810> need<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.170> have

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
smaller you don't even need to have

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.129 
smaller you don't even need to have
cuffs<00:03:39.620> on<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.829> four<00:03:40.010> other<00:03:40.040> shirt<00:03:40.629> but<00:03:41.629> I<00:03:41.660> like

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
cuffs on the four other shirt but I like

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:50.050 
cuffs on the four other shirt but I like
the<00:03:42.290> style<00:03:42.590> so<00:03:48.250> on<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.340> front<00:03:49.489> here<00:03:49.760> I<00:03:49.790> just

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
the style so on the front here I just

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.330 
the style so on the front here I just
cut<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.510> bottom<00:03:50.750> two<00:03:51.349> strings<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:52.190> then<00:03:52.310> I

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
cut the bottom two strings and then I

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.750 
cut the bottom two strings and then I
tie<00:03:52.669> them<00:03:52.849> together<00:03:53.090> at<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.419> sides<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:58.639> then

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
tie them together at the sides and then

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.460 
tie them together at the sides and then
I'm<00:03:58.879> going<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.030> do<00:03:59.180> one<00:03:59.389> more<00:03:59.419> row<00:03:59.780> at<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.199> top

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
I'm going to do one more row at this top

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.050 
I'm going to do one more row at this top
one<00:04:00.650> I<00:04:00.680> didn't<00:04:00.919> start<00:04:01.310> with<00:04:01.459> it<00:04:01.579> last<00:04:01.730> time<00:04:02.000> so

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
one I didn't start with it last time so

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.500 
one I didn't start with it last time so
this<00:04:02.629> time<00:04:02.870> I'm<00:04:03.019> going<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.199> loop<00:04:03.349> it<00:04:04.329> like<00:04:05.329> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
this time I'm going to loop it like that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:10.539 
this time I'm going to loop it like that
and<00:04:05.810> then<00:04:05.989> pull<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:07.069> next<00:04:07.250> one<00:04:07.340> through<00:04:09.549> keep

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549

I'm<00:04:24.140> not<00:04:24.290> going<00:04:24.440> to<00:04:24.500> loop<00:04:24.650> all<00:04:24.800> this<00:04:25.010> I'm<00:04:25.910> just

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
I'm not going to loop all this I'm just

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.910 
I'm not going to loop all this I'm just
going<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.360> pull<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.110> rest<00:04:27.230> these<00:04:27.410> three<00:04:27.680> cuz

so<00:04:40.550> far<00:04:42.010> I'll<00:04:43.010> have<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.310> find<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.700> way<00:04:44.480> to<00:04:44.540> get

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
so far I'll have to find a way to get

00:04:44.750 --> 00:05:04.220 
so far I'll have to find a way to get
these<00:04:44.930> sleeves

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.460 

so<00:05:05.230> this<00:05:05.530> is<00:05:05.650> how<00:05:05.800> it<00:05:05.920> turned<00:05:05.950> out<00:05:06.250> I<00:05:07.470> think

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
so this is how it turned out I think

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.810 
so this is how it turned out I think
it's<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.800> little<00:05:08.980> better<00:05:09.130> than<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.670> original

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
it's a little better than the original

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.370 
it's a little better than the original
