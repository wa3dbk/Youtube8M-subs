people<00:01:59.550> on<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.730> server<00:01:59.940> depending<00:02:00.330> on<00:02:00.390> how

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
people on the server depending on how

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.660 
people on the server depending on how
big<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> world<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.410> think<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.130> should<00:02:02.310> be<00:02:02.430> so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
big the world is I think it should be so

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.180 
big the world is I think it should be so
cool<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.110> board<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.230> houses<00:02:04.410> and<00:02:04.620> survive<00:02:05.040> in

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
cool to board up houses and survive in

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.500 
cool to board up houses and survive in
them<00:02:05.310> through<00:02:05.640> raids<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.120> stuff<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:06.480> I

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
them through raids and stuff like that I

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.109 
them through raids and stuff like that I
think<00:02:06.690> it'll<00:02:06.810> be<00:02:06.900> absolutely<00:02:07.050> awesome<00:02:07.530> but

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119
