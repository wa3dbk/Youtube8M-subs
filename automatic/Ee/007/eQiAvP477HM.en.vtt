fan<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.230> direction<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.739> there<00:00:40.920> were

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

respected<00:00:43.440> them<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.829> thought<00:00:44.010> they

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
respected them because I thought they

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.510

then I think I pretty much stayed out of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350 
then I think I pretty much stayed out of
trouble<00:00:49.590> for<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> most<00:00:50.219> part<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.090> really

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.050 
wasn't a huge High School Musical fan
but<00:03:10.690> you<00:03:11.590> know<00:03:13.890> anyway<00:03:14.890> my<00:03:15.040> point<00:03:15.340> here<00:03:15.580> with

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
but you know anyway my point here with

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.060 
but you know anyway my point here with
all<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.330> being<00:03:16.540> said<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:17.050> yes<00:03:17.320> saying

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
all that being said is yes saying

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.440 
all that being said is yes saying
leaving<00:03:18.430> one<00:03:18.550> direction<00:03:18.580> is<00:03:19.120> probably

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
leaving one direction is probably

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.449 
leaving one direction is probably
shaking<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:20.019> out<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.680> think<00:03:21.190> we'll<00:03:21.340> get

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
shaking you out but I think we'll get

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.640 
shaking you out but I think we'll get
through<00:03:21.760> because<00:03:22.000> things<00:03:22.900> happen<00:03:23.170> in<00:03:23.440> life

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
through because things happen in life

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.550 
through because things happen in life
and<00:03:23.980> we<00:03:24.550> can<00:03:24.820> move<00:03:24.970> past<00:03:25.239> things<00:03:25.570> together<00:03:25.810> as

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
and we can move past things together as

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.650 
and we can move past things together as
one<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.190> just<00:03:27.370> remember<00:03:27.850> there's<00:03:28.480> been

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
one and just remember there's been

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.479 
one and just remember there's been
breakups<00:03:29.110> before<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.769> they'll<00:03:29.860> be<00:03:29.980> breakups

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
breakups before and they'll be breakups

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.949 
breakups before and they'll be breakups
again<00:03:30.790> anyway<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.420> hope<00:03:31.510> you<00:03:31.630> guys<00:03:31.720> liked<00:03:31.870> the
