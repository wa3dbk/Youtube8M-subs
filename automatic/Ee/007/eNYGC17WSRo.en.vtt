00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.619
 hello with you lyudmila and video lesson 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.810
 on sewing 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:22.900
 Today I will sew a warm bathrobe 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.900
 female of mahra 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:35.550
 gown on the belt shawl collar 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:36.090
 ahead smell long sleeve and with right 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.000
 parties 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.890
 patch pocket usually bathrobe 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.489
 more detailed article you can 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.620
 I like to sew on my site 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:54.650
 maybe this is something more detailed 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.199
 wrote and there you can find a pattern and 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.800
 so the choice of fabric 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.339
 I think that each pepper itself 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.000
 fabric is better to sew a warm bathrobe 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.690
 there how would I recommend the mahra of course in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.500
 First of all that's out of it and I'll sew 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:19.070
 fleece in general, all bulk are lush such 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.640
 fluffy fabric 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.360
 the king himself process to blood I did not become 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.630
 show 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.240
 I think every thing here can 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.200
 carve a pattern you can take on 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.290
 my site 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:40.110
 I love to sew fabric consumption so I would like 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:46.520
 still say how much fabric you need for a bathrobe 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 buy here you need to take the length of the product 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:54.120
 correct and measure from the base of the neck and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.970
 up to the desired length you want 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:02.490
 bathrobe plus sleeve length 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.780
 this will be the consumption of fabric in your own way 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.810
 growth each 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.590
 Here I have cut all the belt width 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:19.560
 Belt 10 centimeters length as much 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:23.700
 how many people need this pick up with 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.370
 I wrestle a little shawl collar 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.319
 I'll tell you later how we all will 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.500
 sew sleeves sleeves do not forget 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.680
 cut that lobar here passes for 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.610
 sleeves this is important selection too 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:45.030
 cut out topped up I did not say down here 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.610
 here I recommend doing right 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.220
 the sleeve is narrowing a little bit here 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.319
 right why because hands will 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.650
 bottom hemmed it here so that 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.950
 it is better 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:02.340
 Sasha 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.660
 hatch sleeve how are we gonna get up tete me 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:10.010
 I will schematically say here we will 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.900
 shoulder strap already assembled 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:17.040
 the sleeve will also be assembled here 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:23.190
 here we combine the highest point 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:30.110
 okat sleeves and we will grind in a pair 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:33.690
 he has no sleeve here 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.030
 shelves and backs pattern a little 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.830
 simplified because in one bathrobe it 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.700
 not the thing that should sit 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.810
 perfect on the figure so there is no 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.810
 this and a sloping sleeve 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.459
 so here it is part of the lower part 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.690
 collar 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:02.700
 I 'll show you how to sew 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:08.320
 podbor is the movement of love 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.850
 for a belt they have a belt inserted here 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.930
 here here is the front of the collar will be 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.040
 selection of shifting shawl collar here 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.470
 so here it will be 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:27.790
 I'm about all the codes, this one 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:33.330
 collar will complement the smaller part 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.330
 will complement the back of the neck and 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.810
 sticking around here 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.600
 to the collar which is also a pick up price to 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.600
 district here so here 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.090
 because here here will be collected shoulder here 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:59.320
 approximately it will all be like this I think 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:06.210
 it's all clear then here's what else I 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:06.210
 I wanted to say about the fact that the pocket 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:14.470
 immediately can be noted on the shelf on 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:20.290
 dressing gown 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:26.020
 pocket on the right side example natalya 8 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:31.930
 centimeters from 8 centimeters down as 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:36.700
 would its standard location on on 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.890
 menswear pocket sewn on 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:41.710
 left shelf 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:45.040
 men's and women's clothing is different 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:47.980
 that in women's clothes right shelf 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.900
 finds on the left well here ahead where 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.760
 clasp or here we are in this case 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:58.200
 the smell of men's clothes left half on 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.020
 right therefore 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:05.560
 female right she male it will be 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:08.350
 on the left, by the example of the pocket, I will show how 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:12.600
 You can cut out the fact is that on such 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:15.840
 the fabric is not chalk with a pencil nothing 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.060
 write lines and no matter how 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.340
 You can immediately apply the patterns to 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.050
 fabric a little with ears of needle for 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:28.960
 to not move and immediately cut 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:34.690
 scissors on the example of the team I 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.160
 show here I have a pocket pattern in 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:40.300
 estimating a meter in length and 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:43.150
 18 centimeters wide, I put it on 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:49.139
 lobar lobar now I have a piece here 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:52.139
 share on the edge and shear 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.139
 needles 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:15.210
 allowance leaves little for their 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:25.740
 need to cut centimeter registry 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:29.270
 more less here I leave a little 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.270
 torture for pocket 

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:38.090
 all this way all you can find 

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:38.090
 on the front
