I<00:00:26.430> want<00:00:26.670> almost<00:00:27.390> three<00:00:27.930> full<00:00:28.260> coils<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.340> I'm

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
I want almost three full coils so I'm

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.400 
I want almost three full coils so I'm
going<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.289> cut<00:00:31.880> this<00:00:32.880> memory<00:00:33.329> wire<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.930> need

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to cut this memory wire you need

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.620 
going to cut this memory wire you need
to<00:00:34.530> use<00:00:34.710> memory<00:00:34.980> wire<00:00:35.190> shears<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.700> cut<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.059> if

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
to use memory wire shears to cut this if

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.889 
to use memory wire shears to cut this if
we<00:00:36.840> end<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.170> with<00:00:37.290> some<00:00:37.469> extra<00:00:38.809> that'll<00:00:39.809> be

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
we end up with some extra that'll be

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.350 
we end up with some extra that'll be
okay<00:00:42.590> okay<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:44.520> first<00:00:44.700> thing<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.000> need<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
okay okay the first thing we need to do

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.990 
okay okay the first thing we need to do
is<00:00:45.660> make<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.350> loop<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> end<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.789> beads

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
is make a loop on the end so the beads

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.220 
is make a loop on the end so the beads
don't<00:00:48.180> slide<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> I'm<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> be

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
don't slide off and I'm going to be

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.880 
don't slide off and I'm going to be
using<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.620> wire<00:00:49.800> looping<00:00:50.070> tool<00:00:50.930> or<00:00:51.930> pliers

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:06.190 

I'm<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> place<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.489> end<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> tool

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.020 

I'm<00:01:06.290> gonna<00:01:06.409> put<00:01:06.680> it<00:01:06.800> back<00:01:07.010> in<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.400> pliers<00:01:07.670> and

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
I'm gonna put it back in the pliers and

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.850 
I'm gonna put it back in the pliers and
kind<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:08.420> get<00:01:08.750> back<00:01:08.960> up<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.550> got<00:01:10.550> a<00:01:10.580> nice<00:01:10.790> loop

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
kind of get back up I got a nice loop

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.140 
kind of get back up I got a nice loop
and<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.979> first<00:01:13.220> thing<00:01:13.340> I'm<00:01:13.430> gonna<00:01:13.550> do<00:01:13.820> is<00:01:13.850> I

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
have laid out my beads in the color

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.460 
have laid out my beads in the color
order<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:17.510> want<00:01:17.720> them<00:01:17.869> in<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.200> I've<00:01:18.260> also

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.610 

after<00:03:01.360> every<00:03:01.600> pave<00:03:01.930> there's<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.200> two<00:03:02.410> inch

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
after every pave there's a two inch

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:08.280 
after every pave there's a two inch
piece<00:03:03.240> of<00:03:04.240> tubing

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.589 

in<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.040> project<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.760> probably<00:03:10.120> best<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
in this project it's probably best to

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.399 
in this project it's probably best to
over<00:03:11.260> cut<00:03:12.239> this<00:03:13.239> memory<00:03:13.629> water<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.140> that<00:03:14.170> you

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
over cut this memory water so that you

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.119 
over cut this memory water so that you
make<00:03:14.620> sure<00:03:14.769> you<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:14.920> enough<00:03:16.799> wire<00:03:17.799> to<00:03:18.040> get

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
make sure you have enough wire to get

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:23.640 
make sure you have enough wire to get
all<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.640> pieces<00:03:18.849> on<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.870> then<00:03:23.170> we<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.439> trim

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
all the pieces on and then we can trim

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.130 
all the pieces on and then we can trim
the<00:03:23.769> end

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.500 

okay<00:03:29.710> then<00:03:30.400> I'm<00:03:30.520> going<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.850> slide<00:03:31.030> on<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.270> last

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
okay then I'm going to slide on the last

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.270 
okay then I'm going to slide on the last
piece<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.900> tubing<00:03:32.170> here<00:03:32.440> which<00:03:32.620> is<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.920> 1<00:03:33.070> inch

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
piece of tubing here which is the 1 inch

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.700 
piece of tubing here which is the 1 inch
and<00:03:33.580> then<00:03:33.790> one<00:03:34.030> club<00:03:34.270> a<00:03:34.390> bead<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.990> I<00:03:35.320> do<00:03:35.380> have

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
and then one club a bead and I do have

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.550 
and then one club a bead and I do have
more<00:03:35.890> wire<00:03:36.040> than<00:03:36.310> I<00:03:36.370> need<00:03:36.550> but<00:03:37.320> that's<00:03:38.320> alright

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
more wire than I need but that's alright

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.490 
more wire than I need but that's alright
now<00:03:39.520> we've<00:03:39.700> got<00:03:39.880> that<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.840> everything<00:03:41.260> lays

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
now we've got that and everything lays

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.880 
now we've got that and everything lays
just<00:03:41.890> right<00:03:42.130> -<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.550> this<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:47.350> what<00:03:47.710> we're<00:03:47.830> gonna

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
just right - on this so what we're gonna

just right - on this so what we're gonna
do<00:03:48.190> now<00:03:48.400> is<00:03:48.790> we're<00:03:49.390> going<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.690> trim<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.940> end

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
do now is we're going to trim the end

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.490 
do now is we're going to trim the end
we're<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.570> gonna<00:03:52.780> give<00:03:52.990> us<00:03:53.080> enough<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.380> make

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
we're just gonna give us enough to make

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.410 
we're just gonna give us enough to make
a<00:03:53.530> loop<00:03:53.740> on<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.430> I'm<00:03:54.880> gonna<00:03:55.030> need<00:03:55.090> about<00:03:55.360> a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
a loop on here I'm gonna need about a

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.170 
a loop on here I'm gonna need about a
quarter<00:03:56.200> inch<00:03:56.470> or<00:03:56.680> so<00:03:57.000> remember<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.090> you

the<00:04:03.220> end<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.650> wire<00:04:05.830> looping<00:04:06.130> tool<00:04:06.600> and

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the end in the wire looping tool and

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.190 
the end in the wire looping tool and
wrap<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.500> make<00:04:09.400> another<00:04:09.700> loop<00:04:09.910> on<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.270> end<00:04:10.330> and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800 
wrap it make another loop on the end and
there<00:04:11.920> we<00:04:12.070> have<00:04:12.220> finished<00:04:12.550> our<00:04:12.670> posh<00:04:13.270> pave
