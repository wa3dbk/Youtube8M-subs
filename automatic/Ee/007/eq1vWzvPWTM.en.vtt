00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
this cockpit looks really big for a 24

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.190 
this cockpit looks really big for a 24
foot<00:02:28.680> boat<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.400> you'd<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.910> right

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
foot boat and you'd be right

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.199 
foot boat and you'd be right
that's<00:02:31.200> because<00:02:31.500> cobalt<00:02:31.920> uses<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.550> process

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
that's because cobalt uses a process

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.780 
that's because cobalt uses a process
called<00:02:33.390> free<00:02:33.750> space<00:02:34.110> reclamation<00:02:34.550> what<00:02:35.550> that

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
called free space reclamation what that

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.330 
called free space reclamation what that
means<00:02:36.030> during<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> build<00:02:37.170> process<00:02:37.350> they

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
means during the build process they

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.550 
means during the build process they
shave<00:02:38.670> fiberglass<00:02:39.300> off<00:02:39.630> both<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.140> hull<00:02:40.320> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
shave fiberglass off both the hull and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.620 
shave fiberglass off both the hull and
the<00:02:40.680> deck<00:02:40.890> before<00:02:41.250> they<00:02:41.370> join<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.450> that

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
the deck before they join it and that

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.130 
the deck before they join it and that
creates<00:02:43.050> an<00:02:43.730> extra<00:02:44.730> foot<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.239> interior<00:02:45.660> volume

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
creates an extra foot of interior volume

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.509 
creates an extra foot of interior volume
and<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> can<00:02:46.590> see<00:02:46.769> that<00:02:46.950> here<00:02:47.160> in<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.340> cockpit
