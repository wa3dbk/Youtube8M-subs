00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
went into this hoping that we'd be able

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.899 
went into this hoping that we'd be able
to<00:01:12.810> win<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.280> considering<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.430> had<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> better

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
to win this considering we had a better

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.179 
to win this considering we had a better
team<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.390> paper<00:01:15.650> consider<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.040> had

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
team on paper consider because we had

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
team on paper consider because we had
Lopez<00:01:17.820> Bob<00:01:18.659> mer<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.890> had<00:01:20.119> come<00:01:21.119> any<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.450> think

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
Lopez Bob mer we had come any I think

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.010 
Lopez Bob mer we had come any I think
his<00:01:21.930> name<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.470> goalkeeper<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:24.020> would

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
his name is the goalkeeper so we would

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
his name is the goalkeeper so we would
actually<00:01:25.259> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> try<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.100> win<00:01:26.220> this<00:01:26.570> to

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
actually want to try and win this to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.940 
actually want to try and win this to
manage<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.080> get<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.500> win<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.130> league<00:01:29.909> or

back doesn't even get the ball and takes
Lopez<00:04:45.280> out<00:04:45.460> I'm<00:04:45.639> surprised<00:04:46.360> a<00:04:46.389> keeper<00:04:46.840> didn't

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
Lopez out I'm surprised a keeper didn't

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.920 
Lopez out I'm surprised a keeper didn't
actually<00:04:47.139> get<00:04:47.410> sent<00:04:47.710> off<00:04:47.860> but<00:04:48.669> I'm<00:04:49.060> not<00:04:49.810> too

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
bothered we got the penalty so because

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.700 
bothered we got the penalty so because
of<00:04:52.750> that<00:04:52.900> we'd<00:04:53.620> let<00:04:54.580> lopes<00:04:55.120> stand<00:04:55.630> up<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.080> with

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
of that we'd let lopes stand up and with

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.800 
of that we'd let lopes stand up and with
a<00:04:56.740> beautiful<00:04:57.250> penalty<00:04:57.910> there<00:04:58.180> even<00:04:58.720> though

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
a beautiful penalty there even though

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.390 
a beautiful penalty there even though
they<00:04:58.870> keep<00:04:59.139> a<00:04:59.320> move<00:04:59.500> a<00:04:59.530> little<00:04:59.860> bit<00:05:00.010> to<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
they keep a move a little bit to the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.580 
they keep a move a little bit to the
left<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:01.120> didn't<00:05:01.510> do<00:05:01.630> anything<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:02.199> manage<00:05:02.470> to

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
left but didn't do anything to manage to

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.920 
left but didn't do anything to manage to
save<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.100> so<00:05:03.610> we<00:05:03.940> don't<00:05:03.970> well<00:05:04.419> there<00:05:04.660> to

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
save it so we don't well there to

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.230 
save it so we don't well there to
actually<00:05:05.139> manage<00:05:05.770> to<00:05:05.889> go<00:05:06.340> through<00:05:06.880> one<00:05:07.060> up

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
actually manage to go through one up

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.460 
actually manage to go through one up
after<00:05:07.660> going<00:05:07.870> 1-nil<00:05:08.560> down<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:09.100> then<00:05:09.970> we<00:05:10.470> did

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
after going 1-nil down and then we did

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.290 
after going 1-nil down and then we did
get<00:05:11.650> another<00:05:11.949> chance<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.580> keep<00:05:12.880> it<00:05:13.060> makes<00:05:13.210> a

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
get another chance but keep it makes a

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240 
get another chance but keep it makes a
good<00:05:13.419> save<00:05:13.690> there<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:14.139> look<00:05:14.710> at<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.010> for<00:05:15.190> a

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
good save there and look at that for a

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.800 
good save there and look at that for a
shot<00:05:15.520> that<00:05:15.669> comes<00:05:15.910> off<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.150> crossbar<00:05:16.479> which

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
to only get yellow card I think I think

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.689 
to only get yellow card I think I think
you<00:05:31.270> was<00:05:31.810> lucky<00:05:32.080> he<00:05:32.440> didn't<00:05:33.099> get<00:05:33.160> ready<00:05:33.550> for

you was lucky he didn't get ready for
this<00:05:33.789> I<00:05:33.970> see<00:05:34.240> from<00:05:34.389> the<00:05:34.479> replay<00:05:34.900> he<00:05:35.500> did<00:05:35.770> going

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
this I see from the replay he did going
