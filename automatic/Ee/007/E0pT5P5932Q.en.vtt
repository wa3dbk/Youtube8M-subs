00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.970
 that's why microsofts surface pro is 3 bp 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.690
 have a nice 12 inches 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.150
 screen with 2160 x 1440 pixels 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.219
 resolution we have this time we have one 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.199
 pen again including the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.090
 We can afford pro-version with the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 two buttons but can work with one 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.570
 we delete with the other thing out 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.869
 go and every page where I just 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.090
 at the end the power controllers loud and 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.660
 I could start drawing here myself 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.609
 I also have different ones 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.109
 Adjustments for my foundation 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.669
 when I can has never 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.690
 example that here with the button pressure 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.280
 only one area 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.239
 every line is deleted that I can 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.809
 for example, however, the same 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.520
 adjust 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.950
 with the stock graser I can here 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.790
 delete entire areas and had to 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 I really pull 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.579
 I can just here, so to speak, to you 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.670
 make the same also 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.809
 Cozy is here in the settings 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.879
 I'll give you all that metal 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.260
 then later just just show 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 a small overview so that's the one 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
 pen service with the keyboard 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.140
 there is, however, will have to do it again 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 a backlight feels 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.199
 very good and has a little new one 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.210
 Function with everyone 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.220
 magnets inside so that we up here 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 I should be able to do it differently 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.890
 I'll show you sooner 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.970
 go to going around that a 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.580
 has changed a bit then we have 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 a larger display get here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 windows button now side then the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.170
 keyboard would not match anymore 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.210
 we run the windows button 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.830
 press and of course is closer to one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 sign with become means in hand 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.280
 hold and then we draw on it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.049
 but can see the same connection 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.159
 continue to be the old keyboard 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.509
 also with the new product you 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.939
 function 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:33.020
 then we have the possibility here 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.939
 clearly as I said a few things too 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.340
 include as for example now 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.020
 headphones and speakers here 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.070
 volume control otherwise we have the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.750
 speakers are now at the 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.259
 front here once and on 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.020
 your side 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.710
 also there if we are upstairs and that 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.630
 look at the device 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.250
 It is a complete fanless design 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.110
 so no it is not a lister in there and 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.429
 but switch and a microphone 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.319
 like the camera here in front of the 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.600
 Of course hd otherwise has one 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.439
 displayport here and usb 3.0 connection 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.090
 or 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.049
 here is the power plug that I too 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.520
 he has changed a bit now 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.649
 namely here directly into the tablet rhine 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.269
 is again magnetic and can be in 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.769
 Both directions are connected each 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.160
 after you like the cable straight 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.120
 better to hand is otherwise can 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920
 you see, we can of course here 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.980
 continue to fold out the stand 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.390
 is the minimum angle you are then 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.180
 However, we can do that now 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.700
 really actually up to an almost 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.049
 unfold completely flat position here 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.640
 which of course is very nice to type 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.049
 if you do not use a keyboard 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.790
 wanted that I can now, however, the 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.950
 quite simply connect 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.959
 he makes magnetic again , of course 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.250
 click as advertised and know 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.959
 especially if I fold this up 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.219
 becomes the right keyboard then 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.349
 we have such a small angle here 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:45.640
 which is really nice if you are 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:45.640
 just wanted to tip over 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.300
 if you can do that here 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 of course, the viewing angle 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.890
 supermicro sudden big ones like high 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.000
 high quality work too 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.200
 use and we can go again 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.090
 briefly in the camera look 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.830
 which concerns the back side here 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.959
 really good if with 5 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.310
 megapixel full hd and if I go back 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.400
 want to switch to the rear camera 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.750
 I just that she would do below 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 view the camera is natural 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.650
 also nice and fast 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.480
 wonderful for conference calls too 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.190
 among other things and that's it 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.099
 with the first impression of microsoft 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.390
 Surface Pro 3 Temple I hope it has 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.180
 you just like it again 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.519
 the surface pro2 gives and still speaks 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.569
 times separately until the next time 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.379
 has looked and injured ours 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.379
