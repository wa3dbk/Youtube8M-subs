00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
Skylanders in the future well it seems

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.340 
Skylanders in the future well it seems
now<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.750> demands<00:01:40.170> placed

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
required from the latest consoles that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.389 
required from the latest consoles that

a vehicle with him not having any

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.600 
a vehicle with him not having any
fingers<00:03:00.990> but<00:03:01.140> it<00:03:01.560> seems<00:03:01.830> like<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.250> handlebars
