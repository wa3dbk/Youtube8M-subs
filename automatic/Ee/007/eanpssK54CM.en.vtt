00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:14.299
 the start &amp; stop system very simple and immediate operation in fact ad 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.400
 example stopping is a traffic light here we take the clutch 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.720
 let's set the neutral gear by releasing the clutch 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.210
 engine turns off all mad autonomously 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.260
 to rekindle - engine here is who we will go to get the cements back on 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.460
 clutch to engage the gear resume the clutch 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
 the engine starts up 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 The advantages of the start &amp; stop system are quite obvious first of all train 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.750
 there is the economic one in fact there is a reduction in consumption 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.460
 The fuel is spoken more or less starting from 8% less 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.570
 then there is also an ecological advantage in fact with automatic shutdown 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.970
 engine we also have cv2 reductions 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.550
 finally there is also an east reduction of noise pollution, in fact ecostat 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.230
 stop the in the engine automatically you spend so here is that hey joe or bass 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.630
 quid archives also those who are outside and in the city we know well that silence 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.510
 rather than the reduction of noise pollution 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.070
 in this period of stress and is absolutely advantageous 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.310
 the advantages are much more obvious bin when they call you machines in the city 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.530
 where the stops are obviously much more frequent 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.370
 so here we have considerable savings 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.360
 if consumption that the ecological keith noise pollution 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.170
 the start stop system is such a versatile system that it can be 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.560
 used 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.729
 and for every type of motorization 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.890
 and fatty petrol 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.860
 and the hybrid earthquake diesel 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.750
 and also for you the local machine change using manual automatic gearbox 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.600
 eeeeh given the greater attention to New Year's environmental issues here 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.810
 that the start stop over system used by many homes 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.000
 automakers 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.620
 It is limited on machines and also as a tool 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.160
 A league
