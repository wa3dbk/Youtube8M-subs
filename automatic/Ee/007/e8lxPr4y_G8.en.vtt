00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.690 
window feature so let's take two apps
again<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.219> Twitter<00:01:59.850> app<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:01.350> other

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
again one is a Twitter app and the other

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.700 
again one is a Twitter app and the other
again<00:02:02.729> let's<00:02:03.000> take<00:02:03.600> something

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
again let's take something

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.370 
again let's take something
this<00:02:06.549> is<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.940> email<00:02:07.240> app<00:02:07.540> but<00:02:07.840> let's<00:02:08.110> take<00:02:08.319> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
this is the email app but let's take the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is the email app but let's take the
internet<00:02:09.190> app<00:02:09.340> again<00:02:10.230> so<00:02:11.230> as<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:11.590> can<00:02:11.709> see

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
internet app again so as you can see

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.500 
internet app again so as you can see
both<00:02:12.160> these<00:02:12.459> work<00:02:13.180> in<00:02:13.510> tandem<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:15.180> once<00:02:16.180> we

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
both these work in tandem and once we

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.820 
both these work in tandem and once we
open<00:02:16.900> another<00:02:17.290> app<00:02:17.530> like<00:02:17.830> for<00:02:18.040> example<00:02:18.180> music

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
open another app like for example music

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.180 
open another app like for example music
it'll<00:02:20.830> let<00:02:20.980> us<00:02:21.100> browse<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.800> other<00:02:23.800> multi

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
it'll let us browse the other multi

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.520 
it'll let us browse the other multi
windows<00:02:24.520> and<00:02:24.790> let<00:02:25.180> us<00:02:25.330> choose<00:02:25.630> you<00:02:26.410> know

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
windows and let us choose you know

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.059 
windows and let us choose you know
whatever<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:27.069> want<00:02:27.600> to<00:02:28.600> keep<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.930> here<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.890> this

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
whatever we want to keep it here so this

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.940 
whatever we want to keep it here so this
is<00:02:30.250> how<00:02:30.430> multi<00:02:30.760> window<00:02:30.880> works<00:02:31.270> but<00:02:32.140> apart<00:02:32.860> from

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
is how multi window works but apart from

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.890 
is how multi window works but apart from
the<00:02:33.160> normal<00:02:33.550> multi<00:02:33.970> window<00:02:34.090> feature<00:02:34.239> you<00:02:34.720> can

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
the normal multi window feature you can

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.440 
the normal multi window feature you can
also<00:02:35.170> use<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.950> same<00:02:36.190> app<00:02:36.489> for<00:02:36.940> two<00:02:37.120> windows

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
also use the same app for two windows

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.020 
also use the same app for two windows
for<00:02:37.660> example<00:02:37.690> if<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.200> want<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.620> tabs<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.910> be

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
for example if you want to tabs to be

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.420 
for example if you want to tabs to be
running<00:02:40.540> side<00:02:40.989> by<00:02:41.019> side<00:02:41.380> then<00:02:42.040> that's<00:02:42.250> a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
running side by side then that's a

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.570 
running side by side then that's a
viable<00:02:42.670> option<00:02:42.940> too<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> that's<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:45.130> feature

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
viable option too so that's a feature

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.850 
viable option too so that's a feature
that<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.970> present<00:02:46.810> on<00:02:46.900> only<00:02:47.110> some<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.709> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
that is present on only some of the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.000 
that is present on only some of the
first<00:02:48.220> party<00:02:48.489> apps<00:02:48.670> from<00:02:48.910> Samsung<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.860> is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
first party apps from Samsung so it is

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.830 
first party apps from Samsung so it is
not<00:02:51.190> available<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.670> all<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.030> apps<00:02:52.150> but<00:02:52.450> even

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
not available in all the apps but even

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.229 
not available in all the apps but even
in<00:02:52.989> apps<00:02:53.260> like<00:02:53.530> chat<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.190> you<00:02:54.790> can<00:02:54.970> actually

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
in apps like chat on you can actually

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.500 
in apps like chat on you can actually
drag<00:02:55.750> files<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:57.040> images<00:02:57.550> between<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.360> two

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
drag files and images between the two

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.910 
drag files and images between the two
windows<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:59.019> example<00:02:59.410> if<00:02:59.470> you<00:02:59.560> receive<00:02:59.830> a

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
windows for example if you receive a

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.160 
windows for example if you receive a
file<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.370> one<00:03:00.580> window<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:01.090> will<00:03:01.239> obviously<00:03:01.660> be

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
file in one window you will obviously be

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.440 
file in one window you will obviously be
able<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.590> drag<00:03:03.430> between<00:03:03.670> them<00:03:04.030> which<00:03:04.300> is<00:03:04.420> a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
able to drag between them which is a
