these<00:00:53.969> environments<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.750> they<00:00:54.870> would<00:00:55.020> point

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
these environments and they would point

these environments and they would point
it<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.530> these<00:00:55.649> certain<00:00:55.949> conditions<00:00:56.399> and

it at these certain conditions and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.920 
it at these certain conditions and
measure<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> entire<00:00:57.149> spectrum<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.809> then

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
measure the entire spectrum and then

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.119 
measure the entire spectrum and then
they<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.079> it<00:00:58.170> over<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.829> over<00:00:58.890> again

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
and then bring it back to the lab and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
and then bring it back to the lab and
we'd<00:01:00.660> analyze<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.170> data<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.530> look<00:01:01.680> at<00:01:01.829> it

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
we'd analyze this data and look at it

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.410 
we'd analyze this data and look at it

we're seeing the same spectral peaks in
these<00:01:07.080> places<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.680> know<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.310> we<00:01:08.430> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
these places and we know that we can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
these places and we know that we can
filter<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:09.000> spectral<00:01:09.420> Peaks<00:01:09.630> specifically

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530

this<00:01:33.780> big<00:01:34.020> bell<00:01:34.229> curve<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.250> would<00:01:35.369> absorb

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
this big bell curve and you would absorb

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.069 
this big bell curve and you would absorb
everything<00:01:36.270> underneath<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.810> bell<00:01:37.049> curve

now<00:01:37.560> we<00:01:37.619> had<00:01:37.829> these<00:01:37.950> small<00:01:38.280> peaks<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> we

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
now we had these small peaks that we

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.370 
now we had these small peaks that we

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
could build in the environment and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080 
could build in the environment and
everything<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.340> between<00:01:41.369> there<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:41.939> still

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
everything in between there would still

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
everything in between there would still
come<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.500> let<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.070> now<00:01:44.549> we<00:01:44.610> had

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
come to you and be let in and now we had

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.130 
come to you and be let in and now we had
this<00:01:44.909> lens<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.299> worked<00:01:45.509> over<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> greater

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
this lens that worked over a greater

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
this lens that worked over a greater
amount<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> environments<00:01:47.310> so<00:01:47.670> when<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.939> can

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
amount of environments so when you can

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.539 
amount of environments so when you can
take<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> picture<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.350> really<00:01:49.860> understand<00:01:50.340> how

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
take a picture and really understand how

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.010 
take a picture and really understand how
color<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.180> made

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
color is made

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
color is made
image<00:01:52.350> then<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.189> design<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.909> lens<00:01:54.329> around

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
image then you can design a lens around

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.649 
image then you can design a lens around
those<00:01:55.799> real<00:01:56.189> colors<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.270> have

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
those real colors that you actually have

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.780 
those real colors that you actually have
data<00:01:58.049> gaining<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.920> understanding<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.640> how

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
data gaining that understanding of how

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.240 
data gaining that understanding of how
it<00:01:59.939> worked<00:02:00.210> enable<00:02:00.990> us<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.619> tailor<00:02:01.920> these

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it worked enable us to tailor these

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
it worked enable us to tailor these
lenses<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.180> every<00:02:03.720> light<00:02:04.110> environment<00:02:04.710> that

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
lenses to every light environment that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.639 
lenses to every light environment that
our<00:02:05.070> athletes<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.729> working<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.590> through<00:02:07.590> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
our athletes are working in through that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.839 
our athletes are working in through that
interaction<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.489> athlete<00:02:08.789> and

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
interaction with the athlete and

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.370 
interaction with the athlete and
understanding<00:02:09.479> what's<00:02:09.720> important<00:02:10.170> for<00:02:10.259> them

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
understanding what's important for them

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.320 
understanding what's important for them
to<00:02:10.440> see<00:02:10.769> once<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.640> understand<00:02:12.090> the

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
to see once we understand the

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.600 
to see once we understand the
environment<00:02:12.989> we'll<00:02:13.739> go<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.099> and<00:02:14.280> we'll<00:02:14.340> turn

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
environment we'll go in and we'll turn

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.190 
environment we'll go in and we'll turn
the<00:02:14.760> knob<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.150> we'll<00:02:15.300> accentuate<00:02:15.930> their

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
the knob and we'll accentuate their

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.160 
the knob and we'll accentuate their
objective<00:02:16.830> desire<00:02:17.540> we've<00:02:18.540> done<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> bunch<00:02:19.019> of

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
objective desire we've done a bunch of

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.050 
objective desire we've done a bunch of
color<00:02:19.349> science<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.980> looking<00:02:20.489> at<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
color science and looking at the the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.850 
color science and looking at the the
biology<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> eye<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.959> found<00:02:22.680> that

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
biology of the eye and found that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.440 
biology of the eye and found that
there's<00:02:23.040> two<00:02:23.340> specific<00:02:23.880> colors<00:02:24.150> where<00:02:24.360> your

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
there's two specific colors where your

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.539 
there's two specific colors where your
eye<00:02:24.480> is<00:02:24.660> very<00:02:25.140> sensitive<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.830> detail<00:02:26.400> so

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
eye is very sensitive to detail so

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.979 
eye is very sensitive to detail so
there's<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> very<00:02:26.910> specific<00:02:27.060> blue<00:02:27.569> and<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.840> very

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
there's a very specific blue and a very

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.680 
there's a very specific blue and a very
specific<00:02:28.200> orange<00:02:28.980> so<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> Prizm<00:02:29.790> snow<00:02:30.209> we're

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
specific orange so in Prizm snow we're

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.240 
specific orange so in Prizm snow we're
going<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:30.989> and<00:02:31.110> adapting<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.860> boosting

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
going in and adapting it and boosting

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.470 
going in and adapting it and boosting
those<00:02:32.400> colors<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.730> filtering<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> other

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
those colors and filtering the other

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.830 
those colors and filtering the other
colors<00:02:33.870> out

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
colors out

colors out
when<00:02:36.230> we<00:02:36.320> first<00:02:36.470> tried<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.740> with<00:02:36.920> Lindsey<00:02:37.400> Vonn

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
when we first tried it with Lindsey Vonn

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.860 
when we first tried it with Lindsey Vonn
one<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> feedback<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.540> got<00:02:38.630> was<00:02:38.690> that

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
one of the feedback that we got was that

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.320 
one of the feedback that we got was that
she<00:02:39.590> didn't<00:02:39.920> have<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.220> close<00:02:40.700> her<00:02:40.850> eyes<00:02:40.880> when

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
she didn't have to close her eyes when

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.790 
she didn't have to close her eyes when
she<00:02:41.360> goes<00:02:41.600> around<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.080> corner<00:02:42.410> which<00:02:42.590> we

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
she goes around the corner which we

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.650 
she goes around the corner which we
didn't<00:02:43.070> understand<00:02:43.400> at<00:02:43.550> first<00:02:43.580> she<00:02:44.540> was

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
didn't understand at first she was

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.820 
didn't understand at first she was
starting<00:02:44.900> out<00:02:44.990> in<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.170> trees<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.590> kind<00:02:45.710> of<00:02:45.740> a

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
starting out in the trees in kind of a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.470 
starting out in the trees in kind of a
lower<00:02:46.010> light<00:02:46.250> condition<00:02:46.730> so<00:02:47.120> when<00:02:47.240> she<00:02:47.330> came

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
lower light condition so when she came

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.390 
lower light condition so when she came
around<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.750> tree<00:02:47.960> suddenly<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.620> bright<00:02:48.890> sunny

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
around a tree suddenly a bright sunny

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.890 
around a tree suddenly a bright sunny
light<00:02:49.850> in<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.150> eyes<00:02:50.300> you<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.720> kind<00:02:50.870> of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
light in your eyes you have to kind of

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.210 
light in your eyes you have to kind of
close<00:02:51.050> your<00:02:51.260> eyes<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.440> let<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.650> eyes<00:02:51.770> adapt

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
close your eyes and let your eyes adapt

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.550 
close your eyes and let your eyes adapt
but<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:52.910> prism<00:02:53.360> there's<00:02:53.810> not<00:02:54.020> that<00:02:54.170> big<00:02:54.230> of<00:02:54.410> a

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
but with prism there's not that big of a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.170 
but with prism there's not that big of a

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
still blocking most of that light so

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.890 
still blocking most of that light so
your<00:02:58.190> eyes<00:02:58.310> don't<00:02:58.490> have<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> adjust<00:02:59.120> nearly<00:02:59.750> as

your eyes don't have to adjust nearly as

your eyes don't have to adjust nearly as
much<00:03:00.230> in<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.340> case<00:03:01.490> of<00:03:01.760> snow<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.810> about

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
much in the case of snow think about

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.960 
much in the case of snow think about
good<00:03:03.230> light<00:03:03.470> and<00:03:03.500> bad<00:03:03.830> light<00:03:04.070> good<00:03:04.520> light<00:03:04.730> is

good light and bad light good light is

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.300 
good light and bad light good light is
what<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.630> would<00:03:05.750> call<00:03:06.110> the<00:03:06.260> colors<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:07.160> your

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
what I would call the colors that your

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:09.640 
what I would call the colors that your
eye<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.430> very<00:03:07.790> sensitive<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.540> bad<00:03:09.050> light<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.620> a

eye is very sensitive to bad light is a

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.440 
eye is very sensitive to bad light is a
color<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.190> maybe<00:03:10.400> washes<00:03:10.910> out<00:03:11.060> your<00:03:11.239> color

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
color that maybe washes out your color

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.690
