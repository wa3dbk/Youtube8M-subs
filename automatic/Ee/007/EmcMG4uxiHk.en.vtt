kind of strategy to this I can kind of

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.620 
kind of strategy to this I can kind of
run<00:01:38.440> backwards<00:01:39.040> but<00:01:39.310> that's<00:01:40.060> about<00:01:40.390> it<00:01:40.450> I

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
run backwards but that's about it I

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.719 
run backwards but that's about it I
can't<00:01:41.080> go<00:01:41.410> past<00:01:42.119> 1.44<00:01:43.119> anything<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:44.649> q<00:01:45.520> op

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
can't go past 1.44 anything this q op

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.040 
can't go past 1.44 anything this q op
fucking<00:01:46.600> code<00:01:47.080> name<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.590> robots<00:01:48.040> asshole<00:01:48.759> is

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
fucking code name the robots asshole is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.740 
fucking code name the robots asshole is
probably<00:01:50.050> impossible<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.820> don't<00:01:52.300> think<00:01:52.539> Oh

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
probably impossible I don't think Oh

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.150

this is how it's done

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.639 
this is how it's done
now<00:02:00.670> this<00:02:00.850> is<00:02:01.030> truly<00:02:01.420> a<00:02:01.600> flawless<00:02:02.259> running

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
now this is truly a flawless running

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.120 
now this is truly a flawless running
stance<00:02:03.009> oh<00:02:03.569> yeah<00:02:04.569> this<00:02:04.720> is<00:02:04.840> good<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.979> how
