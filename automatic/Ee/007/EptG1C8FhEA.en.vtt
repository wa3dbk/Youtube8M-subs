from<00:01:44.670> afar<00:01:45.060> however<00:01:45.689> on<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:45.960> flip<00:01:45.990> side<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
from afar however on the flip side it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
from afar however on the flip side it
does<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> con<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.490> his<00:01:47.610> accuracy<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
does have a con with his accuracy and

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.330 
does have a con with his accuracy and
that<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.780> if<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.320> moving<00:01:49.619> then<00:01:50.189> you're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that is if you are moving then you're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.340 
that is if you are moving then you're
likely<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.820> miss<00:01:51.060> shots<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> rescue

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
likely to miss shots because the rescue

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.319 
likely to miss shots because the rescue
becomes<00:01:52.770> quite<00:01:53.040> big<00:01:53.399> even<00:01:54.090> when<00:01:54.210> you're

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
becomes quite big even when you're

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
becomes quite big even when you're
walking<00:01:54.509> quite<00:01:54.899> slowly<00:01:55.170> looking<00:01:55.770> back<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.009> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
walking quite slowly looking back at the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.740 
walking quite slowly looking back at the
pros<00:01:56.280> o<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.670> revolver<00:01:57.090> does<00:01:57.299> come<00:01:57.570> with<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
pros o the revolver does come with a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.230 
pros o the revolver does come with a
decent<00:01:58.079> bullet<00:01:58.590> damage<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:59.460> rated<00:01:59.790> 5<00:02:00.030> out<00:02:00.210> of

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
decent bullet damage it's rated 5 out of

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.709 
decent bullet damage it's rated 5 out of
10

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
10

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.389 
10
so<00:02:00.840> each<00:02:01.020> individual<00:02:01.590> bullet<00:02:01.920> is<00:02:02.070> doing<00:02:02.310> a

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
so each individual bullet is doing a

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.310 
so each individual bullet is doing a
nice<00:02:02.610> amount<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:03.030> damage<00:02:03.360> with<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> default

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
nice amount of damage with a default

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.319 
nice amount of damage with a default
revolver<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.100> can<00:02:05.280> easily<00:02:05.549> take<00:02:05.880> someone

revolver you can easily take someone

extra shots the revolver has an average
rate<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.610> fire<00:02:16.060> it's<00:02:16.570> not<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.810> fastest<00:02:17.260> firing

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
rate of fire it's not the fastest firing

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.530 
rate of fire it's not the fastest firing
gun<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.520> has<00:02:18.670> never<00:02:18.880> hindered<00:02:19.120> me<00:02:19.360> when

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
gun but this has never hindered me when

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.690 
gun but this has never hindered me when
using<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.620> biggest<00:02:20.920> con<00:02:21.130> though<00:02:21.310> in<00:02:21.520> my

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
using it the biggest con though in my

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060 
using it the biggest con though in my
opinion<00:02:21.730> for<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> revolver<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.170> its<00:02:23.620> reload

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
opinion for the revolver is its reload

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.430 
opinion for the revolver is its reload
time<00:02:24.430> it<00:02:24.880> takes<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.240> long<00:02:25.510> time<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.930> reload<00:02:26.260> this

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
time it takes a long time to reload this

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.590 
time it takes a long time to reload this
gun<00:02:26.650> as<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> player<00:02:27.430> puts<00:02:27.730> each<00:02:27.910> individual

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
gun as the player puts each individual

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.390 
gun as the player puts each individual
bullet<00:02:28.870> in<00:02:28.990> separately<00:02:29.560> when<00:02:30.010> using<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
bullet in separately when using the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.950 
bullet in separately when using the
revolver<00:02:30.910> if<00:02:31.060> you're<00:02:31.240> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> middle<00:02:31.690> of<00:02:31.810> a

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
revolver if you're in the middle of a

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.960 
revolver if you're in the middle of a
firefight<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:32.830> run<00:02:32.980> out<00:02:33.070> of<00:02:33.100> ammo<00:02:33.520> it's

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
firefight and you run out of ammo it's

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.060 
firefight and you run out of ammo it's
better<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.390> retreat<00:02:34.750> and<00:02:35.050> reload<00:02:35.380> rather<00:02:35.860> than

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
better to retreat and reload rather than

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.890 
better to retreat and reload rather than
hold<00:02:36.370> your<00:02:36.580> ground<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.030> reload<00:02:37.330> if<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.840> are

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
hold your ground and reload if you are

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.840 
hold your ground and reload if you are
solely<00:02:38.200> relying<00:02:38.620> on<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.920> revolver<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:39.700> I

solely relying on the revolver and I

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.730 
solely relying on the revolver and I
would<00:02:40.060> advise<00:02:40.360> taking<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.930> survival<00:02:41.440> skill

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
would advise taking the survival skill

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.250 
would advise taking the survival skill
pistol<00:02:42.520> auto<00:02:42.730> zoom<00:02:43.120> as<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.600> helps<00:02:43.900> your

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
pistol auto zoom as this helps your

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.290 
pistol auto zoom as this helps your
accuracy<00:02:44.680> when<00:02:45.040> using<00:02:45.280> pistols<00:02:45.610> great<00:02:46.120> way

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
accuracy when using pistols great way

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300 
accuracy when using pistols great way
anyway<00:02:46.900> let's<00:02:47.080> quickly<00:02:47.260> go<00:02:47.470> back<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:47.860> recap

anyway let's quickly go back and recap
the<00:02:48.640> pros<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.090> cons<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.870> revolver

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
the pros and cons for the revolver

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.160 
the pros and cons for the revolver
firstly<00:02:51.250> it<00:02:51.430> has<00:02:51.640> great<00:02:52.030> accuracy<00:02:52.660> when<00:02:53.050> you

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
firstly it has great accuracy when you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.770 
firstly it has great accuracy when you
remain<00:02:53.470> stationary<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.700> also<00:02:54.850> has<00:02:55.240> good

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
remain stationary it also has good

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.710 
remain stationary it also has good
bullet<00:02:56.350> damage<00:02:56.680> but<00:02:57.190> unfortunately<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.360> lacks

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
bullet damage but unfortunately it lacks

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.470 
bullet damage but unfortunately it lacks
accuracy<00:02:59.350> when<00:03:00.040> you're<00:03:00.160> moving<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:01.090> has<00:03:01.270> a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
accuracy when you're moving and it has a

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.110 
accuracy when you're moving and it has a
very<00:03:01.840> slow<00:03:02.290> reload<00:03:02.740> speed<00:03:03.100> overall<00:03:03.820> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
very slow reload speed overall the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.720 
very slow reload speed overall the
revolver<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> very<00:03:05.170> good<00:03:05.470> all-round<00:03:05.980> gun<00:03:06.340> it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
revolver is a very good all-round gun it

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.850 
revolver is a very good all-round gun it
is<00:03:06.790> a<00:03:06.910> great<00:03:07.270> sidearm<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:08.200> accompany<00:03:08.500> any

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
is a great sidearm to accompany any

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.830 
is a great sidearm to accompany any
weapon<00:03:09.400> in<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:09.760> game<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.270> whereas<00:03:10.570> it<00:03:10.720> may

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
weapon in the game and whereas it may

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080 
weapon in the game and whereas it may
lack<00:03:11.110> the<00:03:11.140> stealth<00:03:11.790> possibilities<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.970> the

lack the stealth possibilities of the

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.090 
lack the stealth possibilities of the
nine-millimeter<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.080> makes<00:03:14.590> up<00:03:14.770> for<00:03:14.800> this

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
nine-millimeter it makes up for this

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.190 
nine-millimeter it makes up for this
with<00:03:15.520> power<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.300> that's<00:03:16.510> why<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.750> revolver

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
with power and that's why the revolver

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.740 
with power and that's why the revolver
gets<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.470> total<00:03:17.740> score<00:03:18.100> of<00:03:18.220> 6<00:03:18.790> out<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:18.970> 10<00:03:19.240> it's<00:03:19.690> a

gets a total score of 6 out of 10 it's a

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.180 
gets a total score of 6 out of 10 it's a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
great little sidearm and can be deadly
