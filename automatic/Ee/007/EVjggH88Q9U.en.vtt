00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.060

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.150
 grief went to heaven and happened to a 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.150

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.980

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.050
 They were at one end to the port 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.830

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.830

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:18.710
 Charlie Sheen let me when the 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.570
 insects attack your home it's too late 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.550
 now for the first time you do not have to 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.650
 worry about killing them in their passage in 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:26.870
 the new love without winning 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.270
 protective barrier insects are 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.650
 they remain outside applied in main 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.650
 spotlights like frames 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.160
 of the child 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:07.340
 this step through the arch or dad and the 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:10.630
