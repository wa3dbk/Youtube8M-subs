00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.840 

Oh

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.280 

flip<00:00:22.850> outrage<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.990> third<00:00:24.710> generation<00:00:24.950> and

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:26.290 
flip outrage the third generation and

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.560 
flip outrage the third generation and
the<00:00:27.850> Panasonic<00:00:28.850> ta<00:00:29.210> one<00:00:30.490> here<00:00:31.490> we<00:00:31.670> have<00:00:32.029> what<00:00:32.540> I

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
the Panasonic ta one here we have what I

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.630 
the Panasonic ta one here we have what I
would<00:00:32.750> call<00:00:33.970> slightly<00:00:34.970> more<00:00:36.280> extreme<00:00:37.280> low

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
would call slightly more extreme low

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.320 
would call slightly more extreme low
light<00:00:37.940> situation<00:00:38.840> and<00:00:39.790> from<00:00:40.790> what<00:00:41.000> I<00:00:41.059> can<00:00:41.150> tell

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
light situation and from what I can tell

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.960 
light situation and from what I can tell
in<00:00:42.280> the<00:00:43.280> two<00:00:43.520> screens<00:00:44.030> i<00:00:45.220> would<00:00:46.220> say<00:00:46.520> that<00:00:46.760> both

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
in the two screens i would say that both

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.440 
in the two screens i would say that both
cameras<00:00:47.629> are<00:00:48.190> doing<00:00:49.190> an<00:00:50.140> equally<00:00:51.140> good<00:00:51.590> job

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
cameras are doing an equally good job

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.600 
cameras are doing an equally good job
now<00:00:53.450> i<00:00:53.480> think<00:00:53.630> the<00:00:54.320> flips<00:00:55.899> colorings<00:00:56.899> i<00:00:57.610> would

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610 
now i think the flips colorings i would

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.510 
now i think the flips colorings i would
say<00:00:58.820> are<00:00:59.000> actually<00:00:59.360> better<00:00:59.630> than<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.770> Panasonic

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
say are actually better than a Panasonic

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.010 
say are actually better than a Panasonic
and<00:01:02.260> the<00:01:03.260> quality<00:01:03.860> of<00:01:04.040> the<00:01:04.670> picture<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.810> the

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
and the quality of the picture that the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.580 
and the quality of the picture that the
flip<00:01:06.259> is<00:01:06.410> doing<00:01:06.770> is<00:01:07.460> slightly<00:01:07.910> better<00:01:08.590> than

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
flip is doing is slightly better than

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.219 
flip is doing is slightly better than
the<00:01:10.090> Panasonic<00:01:11.090> I<00:01:12.399> couldn't<00:01:13.630> pants<00:01:14.630> the<00:01:14.960> pants

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
the Panasonic I couldn't pants the pants

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.200 
the Panasonic I couldn't pants the pants
my<00:01:15.410> PA<00:01:15.680> one<00:01:15.950> doesn't<00:01:16.310> have<00:01:16.340> a<00:01:16.490> 60<00:01:16.880> frames<00:01:17.119> per

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
my PA one doesn't have a 60 frames per

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.749 
my PA one doesn't have a 60 frames per
second<00:01:17.630> say<00:01:17.869> so<00:01:18.740> I've<00:01:18.860> had<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.100> do<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.460> in<00:01:19.610> the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
second say so I've had to do it in the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.219 
second say so I've had to do it in the
normal<00:01:20.149> 720p<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:22.850> flip<00:01:23.149> what<00:01:23.539> I<00:01:23.660> have<00:01:23.960> found

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
normal 720p the flip what I have found

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.859 
normal 720p the flip what I have found
out<00:01:24.500> today<00:01:24.740> only<00:01:25.280> does<00:01:25.610> 50<00:01:26.030> frames<00:01:26.209> per<00:01:26.450> second

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
out today only does 50 frames per second

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.389 
out today only does 50 frames per second
not<00:01:27.649> 60<00:01:28.929> so<00:01:29.929> that<00:01:30.350> was<00:01:30.530> interesting<00:01:30.709> to<00:01:31.250> find

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
not 60 so that was interesting to find

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.949 
not 60 so that was interesting to find
that<00:01:31.670> helped<00:01:32.470> but<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:33.590> you<00:01:33.770> can<00:01:33.920> see<00:01:34.959> both

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:35.959 
that helped but as you can see both

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:39.010 
that helped but as you can see both
cameras<00:01:36.709> are<00:01:36.979> doing<00:01:37.369> equally<00:01:37.789> well<00:01:38.119> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
cameras are doing equally well the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.199 
cameras are doing equally well the
coloring<00:01:39.500> is<00:01:39.530> probably<00:01:39.950> better<00:01:40.250> on<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:42.289> flip

00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.209 
coloring is probably better on the flip

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:52.270 
coloring is probably better on the flip
then<00:01:44.209> I<00:01:45.340> mean<00:01:47.440> yes<00:01:49.660> now<00:01:50.660> as<00:01:50.990> far<00:01:51.289> as<00:01:51.349> the<00:01:51.979> amount

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
then I mean yes now as far as the amount

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.330 
then I mean yes now as far as the amount
you<00:01:52.429> getting<00:01:52.700> your<00:01:52.849> picture<00:01:53.030> is<00:01:53.330> concerned<00:01:53.869> I

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
you getting your picture is concerned I

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.499 
you getting your picture is concerned I
would<00:01:55.340> actually<00:01:55.429> say<00:01:55.670> there's<00:01:56.060> more<00:01:56.300> in<00:01:56.390> the

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
would actually say there's more in the

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.080 
would actually say there's more in the
flip<00:01:57.340> than<00:01:58.340> the<00:01:58.459> Panasonic<00:01:59.000> yes<00:02:00.310> ok<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.759> let's

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
flip than the Panasonic yes ok so let's

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.660 
flip than the Panasonic yes ok so let's
go<00:02:02.330> and<00:02:02.390> have<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.539> look<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:03.830> see<00:02:03.860> how<00:02:04.130> these<00:02:04.369> two

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
go and have a look to see how these two

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.690 
go and have a look to see how these two
cameras<00:02:05.149> fair<00:02:05.509> now<00:02:05.869> hold<00:02:06.050> on<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.229> minute<00:02:06.700> before

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
cameras fair now hold on a minute before

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.650 
cameras fair now hold on a minute before
i<00:02:07.910> do<00:02:08.060> that<00:02:08.950> let's<00:02:09.950> just<00:02:10.069> dip<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.550> light<00:02:11.030> a<00:02:11.060> bit

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.870 

now<00:02:14.660> two<00:02:15.230> cameras<00:02:16.239> seems<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.390> do<00:02:17.510> just<00:02:17.870> as<00:02:18.020> well

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
now two cameras seems to do just as well

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.120 
now two cameras seems to do just as well
now<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.270> know<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.780> flip<00:02:21.020> hasn't<00:02:21.410> got<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> la<00:02:21.770> soon

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
now I know the flip hasn't got a la soon

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.470 
now I know the flip hasn't got a la soon
and<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:24.530> panasonic<00:02:25.160> has<00:02:26.110> loads<00:02:27.969> so<00:02:28.969> don't

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
and the panasonic has loads so don't

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.280 
and the panasonic has loads so don't
think<00:02:29.689> i'll<00:02:29.810> compare<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:31.400> two<00:02:31.670> zooms

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.860 

right<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.160> let's<00:02:37.700> go<00:02:37.940> and<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.150> look<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.690> what

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
right so let's go and of look see what

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.310 
right so let's go and of look see what
it's<00:02:39.020> like<00:02:39.310> outside<00:02:40.720> okie<00:02:41.720> dokie<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:45.020> here<00:02:45.170> we

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
it's like outside okie dokie so here we

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.530 
it's like outside okie dokie so here we
have<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.650> Flip<00:02:45.860> Ultra<00:02:45.980> HD<00:02:46.250> third<00:02:46.820> generation

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
have the Flip Ultra HD third generation

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.330 
have the Flip Ultra HD third generation
and<00:02:47.920> the<00:02:48.920> Panasonic<00:02:49.790> ta1<00:02:50.500> straight<00:02:51.500> away<00:02:51.860> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
and the Panasonic ta1 straight away the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.100 
and the Panasonic ta1 straight away the
flip<00:02:52.700> does<00:02:53.030> a<00:02:53.530> much<00:02:54.530> better<00:02:54.560> job<00:02:55.570> than<00:02:56.570> the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
flip does a much better job than the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.920 
flip does a much better job than the
Panasonic<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.040> the<00:02:58.790> Panasonic<00:02:59.420> everything's

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
Panasonic on the Panasonic everything's

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.710 
Panasonic on the Panasonic everything's
orange<00:03:00.440> and<00:03:00.940> there's<00:03:01.940> also<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.300> bit<00:03:02.420> of<00:03:02.510> lens

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
orange and there's also a bit of lens

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.860 
orange and there's also a bit of lens
flare<00:03:06.730> yep<00:03:07.730> there's<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> bit<00:03:08.210> of<00:03:08.240> lens<00:03:08.540> flare

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
flare yep there's a bit of lens flare

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.480 
flare yep there's a bit of lens flare
and<00:03:10.090> basically<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:12.650> flip<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.130> doing<00:03:13.400> a

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 
and basically the flip is doing a

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.320 
and basically the flip is doing a
marvelous<00:03:13.880> job<00:03:14.480> I<00:03:15.580> mean<00:03:16.580> that<00:03:16.760> clarity<00:03:17.300> of

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
marvelous job I mean that clarity of

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.940 
marvelous job I mean that clarity of
picture<00:03:18.160> is<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.490> suppose<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.210> where<00:03:20.390> the

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
picture is I suppose is where the

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.950 
picture is I suppose is where the
55-second<00:03:21.950> is<00:03:22.040> cutting<00:03:22.520> in<00:03:22.690> but<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:23.810> is<00:03:23.930> just

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:23.960 
55-second is cutting in but that is just

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.220 
55-second is cutting in but that is just
really<00:03:24.650> good<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.910> it's<00:03:29.750> going<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.140> be

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
really good so it's going to be

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.360 
really good so it's going to be
interesting<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:31.120> see<00:03:32.530> once<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.680> guys<00:03:33.950> choose

interesting to see once you guys choose

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.340 
interesting to see once you guys choose
which<00:03:34.700> kodak<00:03:35.240> you<00:03:35.480> want<00:03:36.130> to<00:03:37.130> see<00:03:37.370> which<00:03:37.640> kodak

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.710 

the<00:03:42.350> interesting<00:03:42.830> to<00:03:42.980> see<00:03:43.190> what<00:03:43.970> the<00:03:44.120> kodak<00:03:44.540> is

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
the interesting to see what the kodak is

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.900 
the interesting to see what the kodak is
like<00:03:45.940> compared<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.300> the<00:03:47.630> flip<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:49.220> flip

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
like compared to the flip I think flip

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.940 
like compared to the flip I think flip
is<00:03:50.060> going<00:03:50.240> to<00:03:50.300> do<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.420> better<00:03:50.570> job<00:03:50.690> than<00:03:51.500> all<00:03:51.770> of

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
is going to do a better job than all of

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.190 
is going to do a better job than all of
my<00:03:52.130> cameras<00:03:52.580> in<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.150> low<00:03:53.360> light<00:03:53.570> situation

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
my cameras in this low light situation

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.650 
my cameras in this low light situation
but<00:03:55.130> what<00:03:55.340> we've<00:03:55.520> also<00:03:55.730> got<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.240> take<00:03:56.450> into

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
but what we've also got to take into

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.170 
but what we've also got to take into
consideration<00:03:57.470> is<00:03:58.130> the<00:03:58.190> fact<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:58.910> white

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
consideration is the fact that the white

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.590 
consideration is the fact that the white
from<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.840> snow<00:04:00.190> is<00:04:01.190> probably<00:04:01.730> increase<00:04:02.300> in

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
from the snow is probably increase in

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.449 
from the snow is probably increase in
the<00:04:03.560> level<00:04:03.590> of<00:04:03.920> light<00:04:04.720> that<00:04:05.720> we<00:04:05.930> can<00:04:06.140> see<00:04:06.500> that

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:07.459 
the level of light that we can see that

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.270 
the level of light that we can see that
make<00:04:07.640> sense<00:04:08.170> that<00:04:09.170> is<00:04:09.260> my<00:04:09.410> new<00:04:09.560> phrase<00:04:09.800> if<00:04:10.130> that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
make sense that is my new phrase if that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.850 
make sense that is my new phrase if that
makes<00:04:10.459> any<00:04:10.580> sense<00:04:10.700> haha<00:04:11.590> ok<00:04:12.590> well<00:04:12.800> that's

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
makes any sense haha ok well that's

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860 
makes any sense haha ok well that's
enough<00:04:13.100> for<00:04:13.220> me<00:04:13.280> hope<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.420> can<00:04:14.510> join<00:04:14.630> these

enough for me hope you can join these

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.289 
enough for me hope you can join these
