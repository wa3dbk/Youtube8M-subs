of the main points to the trek verb 1

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.570 
of the main points to the trek verb 1
is<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.980> hydroformed<00:00:37.980> aluminum

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580

advantage of this oval and square tubing

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.020 
advantage of this oval and square tubing
it<00:00:57.870> over<00:00:58.230> just<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.620> traditional<00:00:59.160> round<00:00:59.399> tube<00:00:59.760> is

it over just a traditional round tube is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.290 
it over just a traditional round tube is
that<00:01:00.899> they<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.320> make<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.710> bike<00:01:02.000> lighter<00:01:03.000> and

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
that they can make the bike lighter and

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.510 
that they can make the bike lighter and
stronger<00:01:03.719> than<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> was<00:01:04.649> just<00:01:04.920> traditional

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
stronger than if it was just traditional

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.480 
stronger than if it was just traditional
round<00:01:05.820> tubes<00:01:06.380> definite<00:01:07.380> benefit<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.039> even<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
round tubes definite benefit to even the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.539 
round tubes definite benefit to even the
novice<00:01:08.850> rider<00:01:09.180> trek<00:01:10.140> also<00:01:10.530> includes<00:01:11.040> mounts

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
novice rider trek also includes mounts

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.920 
novice rider trek also includes mounts
so<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.090> carry<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.420> water<00:01:12.689> bottle

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
so that you can carry a water bottle

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.170 
so that you can carry a water bottle
easily<00:01:13.560> without<00:01:13.920> having<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.310> strap<00:01:14.700> anything

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
easily without having to strap anything

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
easily without having to strap anything

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.340 
frame the next thing to look at on this
bike<00:01:19.920> would<00:01:20.310> be<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.210> has<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.450> bull<00:01:21.869> Shimano

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
bike would be that it has a bull Shimano

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
bike would be that it has a bull Shimano
tourney<00:01:22.890> drivetrain<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.080> your

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
tourney drivetrain so all of your

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.289 
tourney drivetrain so all of your
shifting<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:26.040> handled<00:01:26.490> from<00:01:26.729> Shimano

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
shifting is handled from Shimano

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.820 
shifting is handled from Shimano
it<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> 21<00:01:29.100> speed<00:01:29.549> bicycle<00:01:30.330> which<00:01:30.900> simply

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
it is a 21 speed bicycle which simply

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.740 
it is a 21 speed bicycle which simply
means<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.460> have<00:01:32.640> seven<00:01:33.150> gears<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
means that you have seven gears in the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.920 
means that you have seven gears in the
back<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.619> number<00:01:35.400> 17<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.270> hardest<00:01:36.689> to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
back from number 17 the hardest to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.950 
back from number 17 the hardest to
number<00:01:37.229> one<00:01:37.439> being<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> easiest<00:01:38.520> so<00:01:39.420> most<00:01:39.780> of

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
number one being the easiest so most of

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.480 
number one being the easiest so most of
the<00:01:40.049> time<00:01:40.259> you're<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.530> going<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.860> shift<00:01:40.950> 1

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
the time you're just going to shift 1

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.359 
the time you're just going to shift 1
through<00:01:41.729> 7<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.900> if<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.259> come<00:01:43.560> into<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
through 7 now if you come into a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.030 
through 7 now if you come into a
situation<00:01:44.909> where<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.869> steep<00:01:46.350> hill<00:01:46.650> or

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
situation where you have a steep hill or

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.870 
situation where you have a steep hill or
a<00:01:47.210> very<00:01:48.210> downhill<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.470> can<00:01:49.649> change<00:01:49.920> ranges<00:01:50.700> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
a very downhill you can change ranges in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.359 
a very downhill you can change ranges in
the<00:01:51.030> front<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.960> make<00:01:52.170> all<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.470> these<00:01:52.770> 70

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the front to make all of these 70

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.030 
the front to make all of these 70
they're<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.820> lot<00:01:54.149> easier<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.840> lot<00:01:55.020> harder<00:01:55.320> so

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
they're a lot easier or a lot harder so

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.520 
they're a lot easier or a lot harder so
it<00:01:56.100> sounds<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:56.909> complicated<00:01:57.540> but<00:01:57.869> very

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
it sounds a little complicated but very

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.670 
it sounds a little complicated but very
simple<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.159> use<00:01:59.399> very<00:01:59.790> easy<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:01.140> first<00:02:01.409> time

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
simple to use very easy the first time

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.090 
simple to use very easy the first time
you<00:02:01.829> ride<00:02:02.070> one<00:02:02.310> you'll<00:02:02.520> be<00:02:02.579> amazed

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
you ride one you'll be amazed

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.460
