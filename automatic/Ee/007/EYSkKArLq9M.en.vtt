00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
you know I didn't expect everyone to

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.130 
you know I didn't expect everyone to
like<00:00:12.830> my<00:00:13.490> book<00:00:13.730> when<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.030> was<00:00:14.120> published<00:00:14.330> but<00:00:14.870> I

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:15.140 
like my book when it was published but I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.460 
like my book when it was published but I
didn't<00:00:15.740> think<00:00:15.890> it<00:00:16.040> would<00:00:16.130> make<00:00:16.280> people<00:00:16.520> mad

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
didn't think it would make people mad

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.130 
didn't think it would make people mad
but<00:00:18.470> I<00:00:18.619> have<00:00:19.310> since<00:00:19.580> learned<00:00:19.670> that<00:00:20.140> sometimes

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
but I have since learned that sometimes

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.890 
but I have since learned that sometimes
people<00:00:22.070> don't<00:00:22.190> just<00:00:22.550> don't<00:00:22.700> not<00:00:23.450> like<00:00:23.690> your

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
people don't just don't not like your

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.400 
people don't just don't not like your
work<00:00:24.110> they<00:00:24.500> they<00:00:25.279> consider<00:00:25.790> it<00:00:26.120> an<00:00:26.540> offense

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
work they they consider it an offense

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.650 
work they they consider it an offense
this<00:00:28.100> is<00:00:28.250> in<00:00:28.370> the<00:00:28.460> days<00:00:28.610> when<00:00:28.820> Amazon<00:00:29.300> was<00:00:29.480> kind

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
this is in the days when Amazon was kind

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.920 
this is in the days when Amazon was kind
of<00:00:29.690> a<00:00:29.780> new<00:00:29.960> thing<00:00:30.260> and<00:00:31.270> as<00:00:32.270> a<00:00:32.360> first-time

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
of a new thing and as a first-time

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.720 
of a new thing and as a first-time
novelist<00:00:33.500> I<00:00:33.739> thought<00:00:34.040> it<00:00:34.129> would<00:00:34.220> be<00:00:34.340> fun<00:00:34.580> to

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
novelist I thought it would be fun to

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.270 
novelist I thought it would be fun to
read<00:00:35.000> what<00:00:35.660> people<00:00:35.840> had<00:00:36.140> said<00:00:36.410> about<00:00:36.680> my<00:00:36.890> book

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
read what people had said about my book

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.090 
read what people had said about my book
I<00:00:37.790> don't<00:00:38.600> read<00:00:38.960> it<00:00:39.110> I<00:00:39.410> kind<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:39.770> read<00:00:39.920> any

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
I don't read it I kind of read any

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.710 
I don't read it I kind of read any
reviews<00:00:40.190> anymore<00:00:40.850> but<00:00:41.000> definitely<00:00:41.420> not<00:00:41.540> am

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:41.720 
reviews anymore but definitely not am

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.770

fun<00:00:42.170> ones<00:00:42.409> but<00:00:42.980> one<00:00:43.159> of<00:00:43.280> them<00:00:43.400> said<00:00:43.699> that<00:00:44.089> it

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
fun ones but one of them said that it

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.229 
fun ones but one of them said that it
was<00:00:44.960> like<00:00:45.140> an<00:00:45.260> MFA<00:00:45.800> exercise<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.760> read<00:00:46.970> like<00:00:47.000> an

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
was like an MFA exercise it read like an

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.149 
was like an MFA exercise it read like an
MFA<00:00:47.600> exercise<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.320> that<00:00:48.739> really<00:00:48.920> hurt

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:49.159 
MFA exercise and that really hurt

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:51.610 
MFA exercise and that really hurt
because<00:00:49.400> it<00:00:49.430> actually<00:00:49.970> was<00:00:50.540> an<00:00:50.690> MFA<00:00:51.080> exercise

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
because it actually was an MFA exercise

other kinds but up until that point as a

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
other kinds but up until that point as a
writer<00:01:14.520> I'd<00:01:14.730> only<00:01:14.910> tried<00:01:15.240> short<00:01:15.570> stories<00:01:15.900> or

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
that's not quite true I did write a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.210 
that's not quite true I did write a
novel<00:01:18.000> but<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:18.960> bad<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.950> didn't

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
novel but it was really bad and I didn't

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.670 
novel but it was really bad and I didn't
do<00:01:20.280> anything<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> enjoy<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
do anything with it but I enjoy the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
do anything with it but I enjoy the
experience<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.220> writing<00:01:23.550> it<00:01:23.670> even<00:01:23.940> though<00:01:24.060> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
experience of writing it even though it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.450 
experience of writing it even though it
didn't<00:01:24.570> work<00:01:24.630> out<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.410> wanted<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> write<00:01:26.400> a

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
didn't work out so I wanted to write a

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.920 
didn't work out so I wanted to write a
novel<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> hope<00:01:27.180> would<00:01:27.360> be<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.690> first

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
novel that I hope would be my first

novel that I hope would be my first
published<00:01:28.290> novel<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:29.040> got<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.940> idea<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.960> I

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
published novel I got this idea just I

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.710 
published novel I got this idea just I
think<00:01:31.830> watching<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.759> plane<00:01:33.000> fly<00:01:33.360> overhead

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
think watching a plane fly overhead

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.200 
think watching a plane fly overhead
while<00:01:34.290> walking<00:01:34.680> across<00:01:34.920> campus<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.700> I'd

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
while walking across campus and I'd

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.040 
while walking across campus and I'd
gotten<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.630> idea<00:01:37.080> about<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.830> guy<00:01:38.960> surviving<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
gotten this idea about a guy surviving a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.710 
gotten this idea about a guy surviving a
plane<00:01:40.259> crash<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.860> no<00:01:41.160> one<00:01:41.369> knowing<00:01:41.910> it<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
plane crash and no one knowing it at the

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.290 
plane crash and no one knowing it at the
time<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.530> was<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.040> ambitious<00:01:44.580> a<00:01:44.729> book<00:01:45.030> as<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
time it was as ambitious a book as I

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.900 
time it was as ambitious a book as I
think<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.600> was<00:01:45.750> capable<00:01:45.960> of<00:01:46.710> writing<00:01:47.190> in<00:01:47.580> those

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
think I was capable of writing in those

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.820 
think I was capable of writing in those
days<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.240> was<00:01:48.270> much<00:01:48.630> less<00:01:48.780> confident<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
days I was much less confident in the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.630 
days I was much less confident in the
process<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.430> I<00:01:50.460> I<00:01:51.330> made<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.770> was<00:01:52.890> about<00:01:53.130> 25

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
process so I I made it was about 25

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.910 
process so I I made it was about 25
single<00:01:54.600> spaced<00:01:54.810> page<00:01:55.110> outline<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.890> that

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
single spaced page outline so that

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
single spaced page outline so that
everyday<00:01:56.280> when<00:01:56.580> I<00:01:56.610> sat<00:01:56.850> down<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.060> knew<00:01:57.300> exactly

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
everyday when I sat down I knew exactly

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.050 
everyday when I sat down I knew exactly
what<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.990> was<00:01:58.140> going<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.560> write<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.790> didn't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
what I was going to write it didn't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.810 
what I was going to write it didn't
leave<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> lot<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.420> room<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:01.700> inspiration<00:02:02.700> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
leave a lot of room for inspiration I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.490 
leave a lot of room for inspiration I
suppose<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.600> inspiration<00:02:04.140> isn't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
suppose but inspiration isn't

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
suppose but inspiration isn't
trustworthy<00:02:05.130> anyway

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
trustworthy anyway

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
trustworthy anyway
so<00:02:06.479> so<00:02:07.350> yeah<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> book<00:02:07.799> seems<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.070> little

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
so so yeah if the book seems a little

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.039 
so so yeah if the book seems a little
schematic<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.910> why<00:02:09.090> it's<00:02:09.299> because<00:02:09.570> I<00:02:09.600> in

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
schematic that's why it's because I in

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.050 
schematic that's why it's because I in
fact<00:02:10.229> had<00:02:10.530> a<00:02:10.560> schematic<00:02:11.010> that<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.459> was<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.940> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
cottage cause it kinda guy he's like and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.750 
cottage cause it kinda guy he's like and
it<00:02:24.810> would<00:02:24.900> take<00:02:25.110> a<00:02:25.140> really<00:02:25.260> long<00:02:25.620> time<00:02:25.830> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
it would take a really long time to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.449 
it would take a really long time to
print<00:02:27.030> out<00:02:27.180> anything<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.130> think<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.370> took

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
print out anything and I think it took

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.560 
print out anything and I think it took
about<00:02:29.640> eight<00:02:29.760> months<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.180> write<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.420> first

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
about eight months to write the first

about eight months to write the first
draft<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:31.140> sent<00:02:31.739> query<00:02:32.640> letter<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.090> the

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
draft I sent query letter that's the

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.390 
draft I sent query letter that's the
literary<00:02:33.540> agents<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.080> one<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.950> them<00:02:35.040> told<00:02:35.250> me

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
literary agents and one of them told me

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.289 
literary agents and one of them told me
to<00:02:35.459> go<00:02:35.549> ahead<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.820> send<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.030> when<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> was

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
to go ahead and send it when it was

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.870 
to go ahead and send it when it was
finished<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:37.080> did<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:37.650> she<00:02:38.040> represented<00:02:38.730> me

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
finished so I did and she represented me

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.760 
finished so I did and she represented me
and<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.269> sold<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.810> book

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
and and sold the book

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.290 
and and sold the book
I<00:02:44.340> remember<00:02:45.340> seeing<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.610> book<00:02:45.760> cover<00:02:46.000> for<00:02:46.240> the

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
I remember seeing the book cover for the

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.850 
I remember seeing the book cover for the
first<00:02:46.480> time<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.960> it's<00:02:47.080> a<00:02:47.140> really<00:02:47.470> nice<00:02:47.620> book

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
first time and it's a really nice book

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.220 
first time and it's a really nice book
cover<00:02:48.070> I<00:02:48.400> thought<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.450> fit<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> book<00:02:50.020> really

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
cover I thought it fit the book really

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.080 
cover I thought it fit the book really
well<00:02:50.500> it<00:02:50.830> wasn't<00:02:51.100> anything<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.820> could

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
well it wasn't anything that I could

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.780 
well it wasn't anything that I could
have<00:02:52.120> imagined<00:02:52.750> on<00:02:52.960> my<00:02:53.110> own<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:54.610> was

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
have imagined on my own and it was

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.550 
have imagined on my own and it was
eye-catching<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.480> bookstore<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:56.170> think

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
eye-catching in the bookstore I think

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.250 
eye-catching in the bookstore I think
that's<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.860> first<00:02:57.040> time<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.670> felt<00:02:58.270> like<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
that's the first time it felt like a

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.250 
that's the first time it felt like a
real<00:02:59.590> thing<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:01.030> know<00:03:01.180> when<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:01.510> saw<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.140> it

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
real thing you know when I saw what it

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.900 
real thing you know when I saw what it
was<00:03:02.290> going<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.770> look<00:03:02.920> like<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.400> other<00:03:03.520> people

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
was going to look like to other people

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.160 
was going to look like to other people
who<00:03:04.030> were<00:03:04.150> seeing<00:03:04.390> it<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.690> first<00:03:04.750> time

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
who were seeing it for the first time

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.380 
who were seeing it for the first time
you<00:03:05.590> know<00:03:05.710> and<00:03:05.920> back<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.700> future<00:03:07.030> when<00:03:07.240> the

moment you know and it does come you
know<00:03:14.770> that<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.250> you<00:03:15.580> do<00:03:15.700> get<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.940> box<00:03:16.120> of

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
know that the you do get the box of

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.210 
know that the you do get the box of
books<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:16.660> there<00:03:16.840> they<00:03:16.960> are<00:03:16.990> but<00:03:17.740> you've<00:03:17.890> seen

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
books and there they are but you've seen

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.030 
books and there they are but you've seen
so<00:03:18.730> many<00:03:18.940> gradual<00:03:19.870> iterations<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.620> it<00:03:20.740> up<00:03:20.890> to

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
so many gradual iterations of it up to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.450 
so many gradual iterations of it up to
that<00:03:21.190> point<00:03:21.520> it's<00:03:22.420> more<00:03:22.660> like<00:03:22.840> well<00:03:23.770> there<00:03:24.370> it

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
that point it's more like well there it

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.520 
that point it's more like well there it
is<00:03:24.520> pretty<00:03:24.970> much<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.750> what<00:03:26.080> I<00:03:26.110> was<00:03:26.260> expecting

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
is pretty much just what I was expecting

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.250 
is pretty much just what I was expecting
you<00:03:27.100> know<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.550> by<00:03:28.030> that<00:03:28.210> time<00:03:28.240> if<00:03:28.870> you're

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
you know and by that time if you're

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.930 
you know and by that time if you're
lucky<00:03:29.410> you're<00:03:29.680> on<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.040> another<00:03:30.220> project<00:03:30.610> that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
lucky you're on to another project that

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.180 
lucky you're on to another project that
is<00:03:31.360> sort<00:03:31.750> of<00:03:31.810> commanding<00:03:32.260> your<00:03:32.350> attention<00:03:32.860> so

is sort of commanding your attention so

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.660 
is sort of commanding your attention so
that<00:03:34.410> catharsis<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.650> one<00:03:36.190> might<00:03:36.400> hope<00:03:36.640> for

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
that catharsis that one might hope for

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.240 
that catharsis that one might hope for
if<00:03:37.240> one<00:03:37.570> is<00:03:37.750> fantasizing<00:03:38.380> about<00:03:38.440> writing<00:03:39.130> and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.040 
publishing a novel never happens but the
the<00:03:42.760> pleasures<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.210> you<00:03:43.390> do<00:03:43.630> get<00:03:43.810> at<00:03:43.960> least

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
the pleasures that you do get at least

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.890 
the pleasures that you do get at least
in<00:03:44.260> my<00:03:44.380> experience<00:03:44.530> are<00:03:45.270> are<00:03:46.270> deeper<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.810> more

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
in my experience are are deeper and more

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.940 
in my experience are are deeper and more
more<00:03:47.260> satisfying<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:49.200> the<00:03:50.200> process<00:03:50.680> is

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
more satisfying and that the process is

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.220 
more satisfying and that the process is
deeply<00:03:51.340> pleasurable<00:03:51.700> for<00:03:52.000> me<00:03:52.060> but<00:03:52.510> once<00:03:52.959> it's

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
deeply pleasurable for me but once it's

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.560 
deeply pleasurable for me but once it's
out<00:03:53.440> in<00:03:53.709> the<00:03:53.740> open<00:03:53.860> once<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.820> ones<00:03:55.270> that<00:03:55.420> the

it's it's it's frightening and

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
eliminating one thing I didn't expect is

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.340 
eliminating one thing I didn't expect is
that<00:04:03.250> even<00:04:03.700> positive<00:04:04.150> reviews<00:04:04.690> would<00:04:04.870> make<00:04:05.140> me

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
that even positive reviews would make me

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.390 
that even positive reviews would make me
feel<00:04:05.560> terrible<00:04:06.250> about<00:04:06.520> myself<00:04:07.020> just<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:09.010> you

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
know the the feeling of being seen and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.970 
know the the feeling of being seen and
talked<00:04:12.730> about<00:04:12.880> is<00:04:13.600> both<00:04:14.050> flattering<00:04:14.709> and

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
talked about is both flattering and

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.220 
talked about is both flattering and
horrifying<00:04:15.640> but<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.420> work<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.750> do<00:04:16.900> comes

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
horrifying but the work you do comes

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.320 
horrifying but the work you do comes
from<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.530> particular<00:04:18.010> place<00:04:18.310> in<00:04:18.580> yourself<00:04:19.090> and

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
from a particular place in yourself and

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.970 
from a particular place in yourself and
it<00:04:19.390> means<00:04:19.600> certain<00:04:19.870> things<00:04:20.260> to<00:04:20.500> you<00:04:20.650> and

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
it means certain things to you and

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.550 
it means certain things to you and
people<00:04:21.220> are<00:04:21.459> never<00:04:21.790> gonna<00:04:22.060> get<00:04:22.420> that<00:04:22.660> so<00:04:23.230> even

people are never gonna get that so even

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.200 
people are never gonna get that so even
if<00:04:23.680> they<00:04:23.800> like<00:04:24.070> it<00:04:24.280> there's<00:04:24.610> this<00:04:24.820> sense<00:04:25.060> that

your interpretation of my work there's a

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.380 
your interpretation of my work there's a
little<00:04:38.800> part<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.160> myself<00:04:39.370> that<00:04:39.880> feels<00:04:40.240> that

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
little part of myself that feels that

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.480 
little part of myself that feels that
way<00:04:40.510> even<00:04:40.750> with<00:04:40.990> a<00:04:41.020> positive<00:04:41.530> review<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.190> it's

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
way even with a positive review and it's

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.030 
way even with a positive review and it's
a<00:04:42.580> rare<00:04:42.820> one<00:04:43.060> that<00:04:43.360> really<00:04:44.080> gets<00:04:44.410> at<00:04:44.590> what<00:04:44.830> was

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
a rare one that really gets at what was

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.409 
a rare one that really gets at what was
interesting<00:04:45.460> to<00:04:45.550> me<00:04:45.580> about<00:04:45.910> the<00:04:46.000> book<00:04:46.150> of

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
interesting to me about the book of

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.570 
interesting to me about the book of
course<00:04:46.660> ultimately

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
course ultimately

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.040 
course ultimately
it<00:04:47.879> doesn't<00:04:48.120> matter<00:04:48.240> what's<00:04:48.539> interesting<00:04:48.750> to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
it doesn't matter what's interesting to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.290 
it doesn't matter what's interesting to
me<00:04:49.080> about<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.439> book<00:04:49.789> there<00:04:50.789> was<00:04:50.879> a<00:04:50.939> hope<00:04:51.120> that

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
me about the book there was a hope that

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.210 
me about the book there was a hope that
I<00:04:51.330> could<00:04:51.419> write<00:04:51.659> a<00:04:51.689> best-seller<00:04:52.139> no<00:04:53.009> one<00:04:53.099> ever

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
I could write a best-seller no one ever

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.580 
I could write a best-seller no one ever
said<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.610> to<00:04:53.639> me<00:04:53.819> but<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.120> think<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:55.050> was<00:04:55.319> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
said that to me but I think that was the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.249 
said that to me but I think that was the
expectation<00:04:56.009> and<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:57.479> course<00:04:57.689> like<00:04:57.930> almost

00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 
expectation and of course like almost

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.320 
expectation and of course like almost
everyone<00:04:58.560> else<00:04:58.800> it<00:04:58.979> didn't<00:04:59.189> pan<00:04:59.400> out<00:04:59.550> my

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
everyone else it didn't pan out my

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.820 
everyone else it didn't pan out my
career's<00:05:00.569> panned<00:05:00.840> out<00:05:00.930> fine<00:05:01.199> but<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.530> think

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
career's panned out fine but I think

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.890 
career's panned out fine but I think
that<00:05:02.460> you<00:05:02.789> know<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.060> book<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.419> think<00:05:03.599> sold

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
that you know the book I think sold

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.689 
that you know the book I think sold
about<00:05:04.080> 80,000<00:05:04.919> copies<00:05:05.069> and<00:05:05.430> they<00:05:05.550> thought

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
about 80,000 copies and they thought

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.159 
about 80,000 copies and they thought
okay<00:05:05.969> that's<00:05:06.090> a<00:05:06.240> really<00:05:06.539> great<00:05:06.750> first<00:05:07.020> effort

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
okay that's a really great first effort

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.589 
okay that's a really great first effort
and<00:05:07.560> next<00:05:08.310> time<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:08.639> gonna<00:05:08.759> be<00:05:08.939> half<00:05:09.120> a<00:05:09.270> million

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
and next time is gonna be half a million

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.689 
and next time is gonna be half a million
but<00:05:10.259> next<00:05:10.469> time<00:05:10.620> was<00:05:10.770> actually<00:05:10.949> about<00:05:11.340> ten

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
but next time was actually about ten

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.770 
but next time was actually about ten
thousand

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.050 

your<00:05:17.770> first<00:05:18.010> book<00:05:18.130> is<00:05:18.310> the<00:05:18.460> thing<00:05:18.700> that<00:05:18.730> your

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
your first book is the thing that your

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.920 
your first book is the thing that your
entire<00:05:19.420> life<00:05:19.780> has<00:05:20.470> gone<00:05:21.190> up<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.720> creating<00:05:22.720> and

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
entire life has gone up to creating and

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.920 
entire life has gone up to creating and
then<00:05:23.889> all<00:05:24.610> you<00:05:24.760> do<00:05:24.910> from<00:05:25.090> then<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.450> is<00:05:25.600> just<00:05:25.810> do

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
then all you do from then on is just do

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.810 
then all you do from then on is just do
that<00:05:26.080> again<00:05:26.440> over<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.070> over<00:05:27.160> in<00:05:27.550> different

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
that again over and over in different

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.710 
that again over and over in different
ways<00:05:28.120> in<00:05:28.650> retrospect<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.800> vastly<00:05:30.430> prefer<00:05:30.720> this

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
ways in retrospect I vastly prefer this

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.409
