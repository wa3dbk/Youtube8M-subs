00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
spot on the gear there right there to go

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.420 
spot on the gear there right there to go
up<00:01:09.750> into<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.200> gear<00:01:10.670> eat<00:01:12.259> there<00:01:13.259> you<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
up into the gear eat there you see the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.130 
up into the gear eat there you see the
shaft<00:01:14.700> will<00:01:14.909> not<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.270> any<00:01:15.509> farther<00:01:15.810> into<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
shaft will not go any farther into the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
shaft will not go any farther into the
gear<00:01:16.439> than<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.610> even<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:17.969> you<00:01:18.060> cut

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
I'm going to do today I'm going to grind

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
I'm going to do today I'm going to grind
off<00:01:34.009> okay<00:01:35.600> right<00:01:36.600> here<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.899> can<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.229> that

flat<00:01:37.710> spot<00:01:37.950> I'm<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.549> try<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:38.909> grind<00:01:39.390> on

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
flat spot I'm gonna try and grind on

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940 
flat spot I'm gonna try and grind on
grind<00:01:40.619> that<00:01:41.159> flat<00:01:41.490> spot<00:01:41.960> longer<00:01:42.960> down<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.770> that

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
grind that flat spot longer down so that

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.459 
grind that flat spot longer down so that
the<00:01:44.700> shaft<00:01:45.179> can<00:01:45.630> go<00:01:45.750> farther<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.259> into<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
the shaft can go farther up into the

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.529 
the shaft can go farther up into the
gear<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.039> I'll<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.609> cut<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.999> sleeve<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
gear and I'll also cut the sleeve on the

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.389 
gear and I'll also cut the sleeve on the
gear<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:48.929> because<00:01:49.170> that'll<00:01:49.950> also<00:01:50.130> be

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
gear off because that'll also be

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.649 
gear off because that'll also be
required<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.030> he<00:01:51.329> didn't<00:01:51.539> say<00:01:51.630> anything

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
required but he didn't say anything

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.649 
required but he didn't say anything
about<00:01:52.109> the<00:01:52.350> shaft<00:01:53.090> grinding<00:01:54.090> that<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.450> his

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
about the shaft grinding that in his

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.630 
about the shaft grinding that in his
video<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.289> that's<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:55.859> only<00:01:56.039> way<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> can<00:01:56.340> find

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
video but that's the only way I can find

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.279 
video but that's the only way I can find

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
again and as you can see I have the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.760 
again and as you can see I have the
alias<00:02:11.760> props<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> chefs<00:02:12.569> install<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.680> on<00:02:13.740> my

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
alias props and chefs install it on my

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
alias props and chefs install it on my
ominous<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.490> just

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
ominous and just

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.920 
ominous and just
I<00:02:15.420> predicted<00:02:16.220> not<00:02:17.220> only<00:02:17.790> did<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.600> cut

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
I predicted not only did you have to cut

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.100 
I predicted not only did you have to cut
the<00:02:19.520> gear<00:02:20.520> sleeves<00:02:21.060> down<00:02:21.420> most<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> way<00:02:22.050> so

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
the gear sleeves down most of the way so

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.960 
the gear sleeves down most of the way so
that<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.650> prop<00:02:22.860> can<00:02:23.040> sit<00:02:23.280> down<00:02:23.400> over<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.730> shaft

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
that the prop can sit down over a shaft

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.280 
that the prop can sit down over a shaft
um<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.840> had<00:02:24.990> to<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.350> dremel<00:02:25.830> tool<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.580> um

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
um I had to use a dremel tool to um

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.050 
um I had to use a dremel tool to um
there's<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.350> flat<00:02:28.620> spot<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:29.069> the<00:02:29.220> shaft<00:02:29.490> on<00:02:29.760> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
there's a flat spot on the shaft on the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.490 
there's a flat spot on the shaft on the
Ilia<00:02:30.300> shop<00:02:30.510> but<00:02:30.690> doesn't<00:02:30.930> go<00:02:30.990> down<00:02:31.170> far<00:02:31.470> enough

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
Ilia shop but doesn't go down far enough

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.620 
Ilia shop but doesn't go down far enough
to<00:02:31.709> let<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.190> pin<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.940> all<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.180> way<00:02:33.240> up<00:02:33.390> through

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
to let the pin go all the way up through

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.420 
to let the pin go all the way up through
so<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.020> have<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.380> flatten<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.770> out<00:02:34.890> most<00:02:35.310> of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
so you have to flatten that out most of

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
so you have to flatten that out most of
the<00:02:35.490> way<00:02:35.640> down<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.720> goes<00:02:36.750> up<00:02:36.900> through

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
the way down and then it goes up through

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.020 
the way down and then it goes up through
and<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.070> see<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.430> worked<00:02:38.640> out<00:02:38.790> really

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
and you can see that worked out really

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
and you can see that worked out really
well<00:02:39.120> I<00:02:39.600> put<00:02:40.020> my<00:02:40.140> bearings<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.620> everything

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
well I put my bearings and everything

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.949 
well I put my bearings and everything

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
back in and they all spin they all spend

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.410 
back in and they all spin they all spend
good<00:02:43.140> they're<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.590> right<00:02:43.680> order<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:44.420> yeah

good they're in the right order so yeah

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
good they're in the right order so yeah

motors um
the<00:03:03.300> blades<00:03:03.660> were<00:03:04.110> I<00:03:04.380> think<00:03:04.709> two<00:03:04.950> dollars<00:03:05.340> for

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
the blades were I think two dollars for

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.060 
the blades were I think two dollars for
a<00:03:05.550> set<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.570> can<00:03:06.690> get<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> colors<00:03:07.170> black<00:03:07.470> you

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
a set of you can get a colors black you

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:09.259 
a set of you can get a colors black you
can<00:03:08.190> get<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.310> bunch<00:03:08.459> of<00:03:08.519> different<00:03:08.790> colors<00:03:09.090> so

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
can get a bunch of different colors so

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.210 
can get a bunch of different colors so
it's<00:03:09.989> four<00:03:10.140> dollars<00:03:10.260> for<00:03:10.410> blades<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.040> think

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it's four dollars for blades and I think

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.479 
it's four dollars for blades and I think
it<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.519> um<00:03:11.850> four<00:03:12.660> dollars<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.110> shaft<00:03:13.489> or

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489
