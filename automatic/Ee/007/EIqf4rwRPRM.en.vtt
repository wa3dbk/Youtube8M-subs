00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:10.620
 short macroscopic or barrel-eyed 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.250
 This kind of deep-sea fish only 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 representatives of the macropinnies 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.140
 belonging to the squad spine shaped 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.590
 they have a clear head of you which they 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.150
 can see with their tubular eyes 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.660
 the head through which the fish watches 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.560
 prey helps protect eyes 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 first opened in 1939 dwells on 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.750
 very large depths therefore few 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.690
 studied particular was not entirely clear was 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 principle of fish view was supposed to be 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 should be feeling a little too big 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.789
 difficulties due to what she sees 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.370
 just up and only in the year 2009 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.010
 the structure of the eye has been fully studied 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.739
 This fish seems to 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.300
 trying to study her earlier fish is simply not 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.620
 transferred pressure change of pressure 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.979
 macropinna belongs to the family a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.280
 pitstop about who vy fish for which 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.810
 characteristic cylindrical eyes opening 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.830
 initial description of the species were made in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.930
 1939 was bertom than chapman 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.509
 but the first photos of live fish were 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.600
 received only in 2004 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.549
 it is a relatively small fish the most 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.090
 large and famous specimens reached 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.460
 about 15 centimeters long body 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.640
 covered with large dark scales fins 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.380
 large wide round for this species 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.409
 characteristic long intestine with 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 numerous blind processes 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.399
 wide mouth and narrow mouth what is 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.490
 the main limitation of loot size 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.229
 suitable for eating the most 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.090
 remarkable feature of this species 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.970
 is a transparent dome 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.030
 shell that covers her head 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.200
 top and sides and large usually 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.140
 sent up 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.140
 cylindrical eyes which 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 is under this shell dense 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.350
 elastic covering shell 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.100
 attached to the back of the ezdak 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.160
 and tanks at the back and on the sides to the wide and 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.920
 transparent around the eye bones which 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.200
 provide eye protection this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.450
 the covering structure is usually lost 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.250
 or at least very much 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.040
 damaged by lifting and fish on 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.470
 surface in the grass and nets therefore up 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.500
 last time and existence not 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.300
 was known under the shell coating 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.090
 is filled transparent 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.910
 fluid chamber which is actually and 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.880
 Fish eyes are eyes are output 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.100
 painted in bright green 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.490
 eyes are separated thin bone 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.130
 septum which warms back 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.990
 expands and accommodates the brain 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.420
 ready of each eye but behind the mouth 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.150
 there is a large rounded pocket 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 which contains olfactory recipes 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.860
 hydrochloric outlet that is what is up 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.770
 first look at photos of live fish 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:12.000
 seems like eyes really is 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.740
 olfactory organ green eye color 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.250
 this fish is caused by the presence in them 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.290
 specific yellow pigment 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.750
 It was believed that this pigment provides 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.360
 needles special light filtering 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.660
 coming from the top and reduces it bright 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.720
 allowing the fish to distinguish 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.550
 bioluminescence of potential mining 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.170
 macropinna microsd ohm is common in 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.110
 subtropical and temperate waters 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.660
 north pacific near 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.210
 coast north of non kuril 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.800
 Bering Sea Islands near the western 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:50.250
 coast of Canada and the United States south of 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.110
 California Gulf Vertical 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.770
 this species is found at depths from 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.690
 500 to 800 meters with the largest 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.440
 specimens are fished for large 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.630
 the depth of the fish in ordinary habitat 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.700
 usually motionless or slow 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.400
 move in a horizontal position 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.580
 all fins at the same time fully plan 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.080
 straightened pectoral fins 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.580
 oriented horizontally and abdominal 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.000
 tilted down at an angle of approximately 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.640
 30 degrees due to the large open 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.079
 fin fish reaching 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.419
 stabilized water column 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:26.550
 when the fish moves all the fins 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.710
 remain fully outstretched and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.430
 movement provided tail 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.340
 fin 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.580
 case of danger fish presses to the body 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.270
 large pectoral and pelvic fins and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.770
 makes sharp jerks beat him and tail 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:43.830
 due to the special structure of the eye 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.840
 muscles these fish are able to move 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.580
 its cylindrical eyes from 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.280
 vertical position in which they 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.099
 usually located horizontally when they 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.750
 directed forward in this case the mouth 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:56.490
 it comes in view that 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.400
 provides an opportunity to capture 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.710
 prey such visual features 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.469
 the apparatus make two possible 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.000
 fundamental approach to the search for food in 

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:08.340
 the first fish is capable of being 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.419
 horizontal position with eyes 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.900
 upward 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:15.270
 notice potential prey on themselves 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.400
 when the fish moves the body up the bag 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.800
 prey to grab her eyes 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:23.370
 move forward leaving the loot in 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.229
 visual field and secondly with unchanged 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.330
 horizontal body fish 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.729
 able to keep track of potential 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.940
 food objects that go down 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:36.060
 moving your eyes on top when hit 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.210
 eating place on level and mouth fish 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.210
 enough
