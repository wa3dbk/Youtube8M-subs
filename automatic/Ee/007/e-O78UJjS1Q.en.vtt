00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.079
 animals will finally pass some stretches 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.079
 I recorded there 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.680

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.390
 damn it 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.960
 no one like that 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.480
 it's normal 

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.609
 OK 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.250
 and is the strong left an eco sport 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.939
 current to power during a test 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.539
 week 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.489
 Yes, what was really cool was a lot of 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.849
 time we tested this enough 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.129
 beautiful and even now let's go 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:20.030
 show you is the most 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.580
 Simple , safe and simple cycle 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.180
 transport the animal inside a car 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.220
 that in case the ecosport is accurate good 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.780
 although two things basically 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.530
 reminding that this method serves both 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.829
 for cats beauty cats 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.630
 Bizarre thing from an exact pectoral guide 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:43.610
 no and do not excuse pectoral collar no 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:48.260
 wear a collar that goes around the neck 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:50.599
 animal because you brake it 's simple it's just 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.700
 Do you think of physics in inertia? 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.739
 when you stop the car to part 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.630
 she is loose goes forward with that 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.799
 part that is not released from the animal to 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.200
 bottom 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.970
 that is, if the animal is here, do not 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.160
 it's hanging neck 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.109
 You'll focus on him because he's going to 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.790
 front and his neck will stay to 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.200
 back years can kill your 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.620
 Little animal and if you are 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.709
 using a breastplate collar that your 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.690
 dog went ahead with the brake that 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.180
 will stay on the dog's logical chest 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.190
 will hurt i feel hurt you 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.790
 You're not going to kill your animal, are you? 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.069
 is protecting him understood and the most 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.380
 important of all I have always followed the guide 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.060
 and the material good quality collar has 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.470
 that being strong and the dog was 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.799
 heavy 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.709
 we have one that says this is the 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.239

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.329

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.150
 people commented how you can see here 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.030

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.549
 that you have on the tab is that you will put 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.620
 on the leash and on that side you have the 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.510
