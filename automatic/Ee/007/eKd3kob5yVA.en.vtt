so<00:00:44.340> how<00:00:44.550> do<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.760> set<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.030> an<00:00:45.960> estimated<00:00:46.469> data

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so how do you set up an estimated data

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.130 
so how do you set up an estimated data
you<00:00:47.039> say<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.760> can<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> show<00:00:48.510> or<00:00:48.870> hide

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
you say how can you show or hide

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.950 
you say how can you show or hide
estimated<00:00:49.950> ADA<00:00:50.219> usage<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:51.120> Windows<00:00:51.539> 8<00:00:51.719> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
estimated ADA usage in Windows 8 but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.529 
estimated ADA usage in Windows 8 but
we'll<00:00:52.350> discuss<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.969> be<00:00:54.120> done<00:00:54.329> in

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we'll discuss how this can be done in

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.740 
we'll discuss how this can be done in
the<00:00:54.780> Windows<00:00:55.079> 8<00:00:55.199> 1<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.710> PC<00:00:56.039> so<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.480> this

about that Wi-Fi connection you can see

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.700 
about that Wi-Fi connection you can see
the<00:01:26.549> option<00:01:26.909> data<00:01:27.119> usage<00:01:27.720> so<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.530> see

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the option data usage so you can see

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.890 
the option data usage so you can see
show<00:01:29.009> my<00:01:29.280> estimated<00:01:29.909> data<00:01:30.090> use<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
show my estimated data use in the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740 
show my estimated data use in the
network<00:01:31.229> list<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.220> need<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.640> switch<00:01:33.390> turn

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
network list so you need to switch turn

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.130 
network list so you need to switch turn
so<00:01:34.020> just<00:01:34.259> move<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.619> slider<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.369> will<00:01:35.520> be

so just move the slider and it will be

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.649 
so just move the slider and it will be
on<00:01:37.140> position<00:01:37.740> now<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:39.000> back<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> the

on position now let's go back to the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.960 
on position now let's go back to the
network<00:01:39.840> connections<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:41.280> let's<00:01:41.520> go<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
network connections so let's go back to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.200 
network connections so let's go back to
network<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.040> if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.159> click<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.090> can

see<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.630> estimated<00:01:45.960> data<00:01:46.290> usage<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.520> says

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
see the estimated data usage so it says

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.370 
see the estimated data usage so it says
212<00:01:48.899> MB<00:01:49.320> since<00:01:49.950> past<00:01:50.460> 11<00:01:50.820> hours<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:52.140> how

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.930 
cumulative I may tell you since the last
reset<00:02:08.260> so<00:02:08.710> it's<00:02:08.830> pretty<00:02:09.100> useful<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.760> want

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
reset so it's pretty useful if you want

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.660 
reset so it's pretty useful if you want
to<00:02:10.270> use<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.110> data<00:02:11.290> usage<00:02:11.620> for<00:02:12.130> a<00:02:12.160> particular

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
to use the data usage for a particular

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.450 
to use the data usage for a particular
month<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.180> if<00:02:13.780> you're<00:02:13.930> running<00:02:14.050> on<00:02:14.320> a<00:02:14.460> limited

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
month and if you're running on a limited

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.080 
month and if you're running on a limited
plan<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> few<00:02:17.320> payoffs<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:18.550> particular

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
plan you have a few payoffs a particular

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.970 
plan you have a few payoffs a particular
amount<00:02:19.270> of<00:02:19.420> GB<00:02:19.840> then<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.260> can<00:02:20.470> see<00:02:20.710> whether

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
amount of GB then you can see whether

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.900 
amount of GB then you can see whether
you<00:02:21.100> consumed<00:02:21.960> the<00:02:22.960> data<00:02:23.220> allowed<00:02:24.220> later<00:02:24.580> for

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
you consumed the data allowed later for

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.850 
you consumed the data allowed later for
that<00:02:25.060> limit<00:02:25.450> for<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.900> month<00:02:26.200> using<00:02:26.500> this

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
that limit for that month using this

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.100 
that limit for that month using this
option<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.640> it's<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.850> really<00:02:28.180> good<00:02:28.330> of<00:02:28.480> option

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
option so it's a really good of option

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.630 
option so it's a really good of option
you<00:02:29.200> don't<00:02:29.350> have<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.710> use<00:02:29.830> third-party<00:02:30.400> tools

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
you don't have to use third-party tools

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.200 
you don't have to use third-party tools

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
started with hiding or enabling the data

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.300 
started with hiding or enabling the data
usage<00:02:51.220> in<00:02:51.910> Windows<00:02:52.330> 8.1<00:02:52.510> PC<00:02:53.080> so<00:02:53.830> that's<00:02:54.130> all
