00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
they had three sizes of mesh I we can't

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.380 
they had three sizes of mesh I we can't
see<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.780> clearly<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:44.399> was<00:01:44.790> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
largest size that's what's up close up

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.819 
largest size that's what's up close up
and<00:01:50.220> that's<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> mesh<00:01:50.670> there<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and that's the mesh there this was the

and that's the mesh there this was the
medium<00:01:53.310> size<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.350> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
medium size that was that and this is

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.209 
medium size that was that and this is
the<00:01:57.509> smaller<00:01:57.780> size<00:01:57.840> really<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:58.649> fine<00:01:58.950> and

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
using then we go watch watch it with a

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.229 
using then we go watch watch it with a
little<00:02:24.840> hook<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:25.319> as<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> can<00:02:26.519> see<00:02:26.640> with<00:02:26.970> the

little hook and as you can see with the

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.600 
little hook and as you can see with the
large<00:02:27.540> size<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.290> does<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.860> through<00:02:29.129> but<00:02:29.489> it

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
large size it does go through but it

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.539 
large size it does go through but it
goes<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> little<00:02:30.180> bit<00:02:30.299> too<00:02:30.810> easy

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
goes to a little bit too easy

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.949 
goes to a little bit too easy
with<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:33.510> small<00:02:33.810> it's<00:02:34.349> just<00:02:35.030> too<00:02:36.030> small<00:02:36.379> like
