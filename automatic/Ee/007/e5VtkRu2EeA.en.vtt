00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hey this is the second version of my

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.889 
hey this is the second version of my
webcam<00:00:04.560> Mouse<00:00:04.830> program<00:00:05.460> I<00:00:05.700> have<00:00:06.450> made<00:00:06.870> a

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
webcam Mouse program I have made a

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.080 
webcam Mouse program I have made a
couple<00:00:07.140> changes<00:00:07.259> for<00:00:07.980> instance<00:00:08.340> I<00:00:08.519> now<00:00:08.730> track

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
couple changes for instance I now track

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.509 
couple changes for instance I now track
three<00:00:09.420> colors<00:00:09.750> instead<00:00:10.139> of<00:00:10.230> just<00:00:10.380> one<00:00:10.620> so<00:00:11.400> if

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
three colors instead of just one so if

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.549 
three colors instead of just one so if
my<00:00:11.639> first<00:00:11.910> color<00:00:12.120> selected<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.780> go<00:00:13.410> ahead

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
my first color selected here go ahead

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.780 
my first color selected here go ahead
and<00:00:13.650> click<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.889> this<00:00:14.070> guy<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.309> have<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.639> nice

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
and click on this guy and have a nice

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.970 
and click on this guy and have a nice
green<00:00:15.089> line<00:00:15.299> alright<00:00:15.480> then<00:00:15.719> we'll<00:00:16.619> hang<00:00:16.800> grab

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
green line alright then we'll hang grab

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.609 
green line alright then we'll hang grab
this<00:00:17.130> second<00:00:17.490> guy<00:00:17.779> come<00:00:18.779> around<00:00:18.810> about<00:00:19.350> there

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
this second guy come around about there

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.590 
this second guy come around about there
you<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> white<00:00:20.520> line<00:00:20.730> I'm<00:00:21.000> clearing<00:00:21.330> there

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
you see a white line I'm clearing there

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.900 
you see a white line I'm clearing there
you<00:00:22.470> go<00:00:22.619> for<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> third<00:00:23.039> color<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.730> red

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
you go for a third color so that red

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.150 
you go for a third color so that red
green<00:00:24.060> blue<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:25.230> see<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.590> turn<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> pen

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
green blue you see if I turn the pen

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
green blue you see if I turn the pen
each<00:00:26.580> one<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:26.970> colors<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.510> being

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
each one of the colors is being

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.359 
each one of the colors is being
displayed<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.380> pen<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.890> got<00:00:29.070> this<00:00:29.189> nice

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
displayed on the pen and I got this nice

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.930 
displayed on the pen and I got this nice
little<00:00:29.750> lines<00:00:30.750> right<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.470> show

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
little lines right there to show

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
little lines right there to show
basically<00:00:32.940> from<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.350> position<00:00:34.350> where<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
basically from a position where the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.340 
basically from a position where the
lines<00:00:35.070> are<00:00:35.280> where<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.640> colors<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.239> now<00:00:37.020> up

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
lines are where the colors are at now up

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.200 
lines are where the colors are at now up
here<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.680> can<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> top<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.850> have

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
here you can kind of see the top I have

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.900 
here you can kind of see the top I have
three<00:00:39.840> color<00:00:40.079> graphs<00:00:40.890> if<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.340> will<00:00:41.489> showing

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
three color graphs if you will showing

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.220 
three color graphs if you will showing
the<00:00:42.030> amount<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.510> pixels<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
the amount of pixels that are in that I

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.590 
the amount of pixels that are in that I
guess<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.500> X<00:00:46.710> portion<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.120> then<00:00:48.390> if

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
guess is the X portion there and then if

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
guess is the X portion there and then if
I<00:00:48.719> turn<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.079> turn<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.860> pen<00:00:50.070> sideways<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.700> can

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
I turn I turn the pen sideways you can

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.750 
I turn I turn the pen sideways you can
see<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.270> big<00:00:51.510> jump<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.989> graph<00:00:52.530> this<00:00:52.860> way<00:00:53.070> for<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
see a big jump in graph this way for the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.779 
see a big jump in graph this way for the
Y<00:00:53.969> portion<00:00:54.480> now<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.280> figure

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Y portion now I use that then to figure

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.720 
Y portion now I use that then to figure
out<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.510> amount<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> pixels<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.399> area

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
out the amount of pixels in that area

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.170 
out the amount of pixels in that area
then<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.270> find<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.050> most<00:01:01.770> pixels<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.579> times<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
then I find the most pixels I times that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.200 
then I find the most pixels I times that
by<00:01:03.359> like<00:01:03.920> 0.7<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> top<00:01:05.489> graph<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
by like 0.7 to get a top graph of the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
by like 0.7 to get a top graph of the
most<00:01:07.080> amount<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.619> pixels<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.400> for<00:01:08.729> instance

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
most amount of pixels so for instance

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.010 
most amount of pixels so for instance
instead<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.450> just<00:01:09.600> saying

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
instead of just saying

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
instead of just saying
grab<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.439> top<00:01:10.650> pixel<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.369> grabbed<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.240> topmost

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
grab the top pixel I grabbed the topmost

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.399 
grab the top pixel I grabbed the topmost
pixels<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.830> 7<00:01:14.400> or<00:01:14.670> 70%<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.530> top<00:01:16.740> pixel<00:01:17.250> I

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
pixels up to 7 or 70% of the top pixel I

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.200 
pixels up to 7 or 70% of the top pixel I
also<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.299> to<00:01:21.299> filter<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.259> bad

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
also have in here to filter out bad

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
also have in here to filter out bad
colors<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.659> say<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.799> is

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
colors so say you can see that this is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.070 
colors so say you can see that this is
jumping<00:01:26.340> around<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.549> little<00:01:26.700> bit<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.659> jumps

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
jumping around a little bit but jumps

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
jumping around a little bit but jumps
around<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.350> lot<00:01:28.530> more<00:01:28.740> say<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> move<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:29.820> fast

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
around a lot more say I move this fast

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
around a lot more say I move this fast
you<00:01:30.299> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> triangle<00:01:31.340> starts<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> get

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
you can see the triangle starts to get

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.520 
you can see the triangle starts to get
left<00:01:32.759> behind<00:01:32.900> someplace<00:01:33.900> as<00:01:34.110> good<00:01:34.290> as<00:01:34.380> are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
left behind someplace as good as are

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.620 
left behind someplace as good as are
losing<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.970> colors<00:01:36.299> while<00:01:36.540> I've

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
losing some of the colors while I've

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.870 
losing some of the colors while I've
made<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.020> code<00:01:37.259> for<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.400> reptile

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
made it code for that but this reptile

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.859 
made it code for that but this reptile
will<00:01:39.180> stay<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.420> relative<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> most<00:01:41.869> if

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
will stay a relative to the most if

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.530 
will stay a relative to the most if
possible<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> most<00:01:44.159> amount<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.610> pixels<00:01:45.090> if

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
possible to the most amount of pixels if

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
possible to the most amount of pixels if
I<00:01:45.750> lose<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.020> color<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> immediately<00:01:46.950> jumps<00:01:47.280> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
I lose one color it immediately jumps to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.149 
I lose one color it immediately jumps to
the<00:01:48.060> average<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.689> other<00:01:48.720> two<00:01:49.170> if<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.009> lose

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
the average of the other two if I lose

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.859 
the average of the other two if I lose
two<00:01:50.460> colors<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:51.060> jumps<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.659> best<00:01:52.110> one<00:01:52.380> so

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
two colors it jumps to the best one so

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.350 
two colors it jumps to the best one so
now<00:01:54.869> I've<00:01:55.079> also<00:01:55.259> created<00:01:56.119> acceleration<00:01:57.119> for

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
now I've also created acceleration for

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.520 
now I've also created acceleration for
the<00:01:57.420> mouse<00:01:57.570> control<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.140> let<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.290> turn<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the mouse control so let me turn the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.080 
the mouse control so let me turn the
mouse<00:01:58.619> control<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.219> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:01.670> even<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
mouse control on you can see even if it

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.819 
mouse control on you can see even if it
starts<00:02:03.299> jumping<00:02:03.750> around<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.320> still<00:02:04.439> have<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
starts jumping around I still have a

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.089 
starts jumping around I still have a
good<00:02:05.009> flowing<00:02:05.520> amount<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.240> mouse<00:02:06.630> control<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
good flowing amount of mouse control for

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.029 
good flowing amount of mouse control for
acceleration<00:02:09.410> so<00:02:10.410> I've<00:02:10.560> added<00:02:10.830> an

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
acceleration so I've added an

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.990 
acceleration so I've added an
acceleration<00:02:11.849> there<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.360> well

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
acceleration there as well

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.890 
acceleration there as well
the<00:02:13.930> regular<00:02:14.410> Mouse<00:02:15.400> movement<00:02:15.970> so<00:02:16.690> it's<00:02:16.810> not

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
the regular Mouse movement so it's not

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.160 
the regular Mouse movement so it's not
just<00:02:16.960> directly<00:02:17.530> it's<00:02:17.980> now<00:02:18.250> accelerated<00:02:19.170> sweet

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
just directly it's now accelerated sweet

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.950 
just directly it's now accelerated sweet
there<00:02:20.680> you<00:02:20.770> go
