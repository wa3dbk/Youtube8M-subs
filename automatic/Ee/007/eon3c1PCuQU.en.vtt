one of these pieces to maximize velocity
let's<00:00:12.450> get<00:00:12.630> started<00:00:17.750> okay<00:00:18.750> guys<00:00:18.960> today<00:00:19.109> we're

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
let's get started okay guys today we're

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.560 
let's get started okay guys today we're
gonna<00:00:19.380> go<00:00:19.619> over<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.920> exact<00:00:20.400> sequencing<00:00:21.390> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
gonna go over the exact sequencing and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.970 
gonna go over the exact sequencing and
what<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.810> want<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> pitch<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
what we want to do in the pitch from the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.769 
what we want to do in the pitch from the
ground<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.609> we're<00:00:23.760> gonna<00:00:23.850> learn<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.300> we<00:00:24.359> can

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
ground up we're gonna learn how we can

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.500 
ground up we're gonna learn how we can
leverage<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.740> ground<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.220> power<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:27.300> that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
leverage the ground for power what that

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.540 
leverage the ground for power what that
means<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> actually<00:00:28.560> works<00:00:29.039> from<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
means and how it actually works from the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.099 
means and how it actually works from the
ground<00:00:29.820> through<00:00:30.090> your<00:00:30.300> leg<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.929> hips

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
ground through your leg into the hips

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.569 
ground through your leg into the hips
into<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> shoulders<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.040> through<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.399> ball

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
into the shoulders out through the ball

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
into the shoulders out through the ball
now<00:00:33.300> guys<00:00:33.450> we're<00:00:33.630> gonna<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:33.930> over<00:00:34.020> real<00:00:34.320> quick

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
now guys we're gonna go over real quick

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
now guys we're gonna go over real quick
the<00:00:34.770> most<00:00:34.980> important<00:00:35.610> part<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> sequence

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
the most important part of the sequence

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
the most important part of the sequence
in<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.870> pitch<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.500> that's<00:00:37.559> gonna<00:00:37.739> be<00:00:38.010> our

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
in the pitch and that's gonna be our

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.310 
in the pitch and that's gonna be our
lead<00:00:38.760> foot<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.600> gonna<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.870> two<00:00:40.079> things

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
lead foot there's gonna be two things

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049 
lead foot there's gonna be two things
that<00:00:40.590> happen<00:00:41.010> with<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.430> lead<00:00:41.610> foot<00:00:41.879> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
that happen with this lead foot the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.790 
that happen with this lead foot the
first<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:42.570> probably<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.140> most<00:00:43.290> important

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
first look probably the most important

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.650 
first look probably the most important
thing<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> leverage

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thing is that it's going to leverage

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.799 
thing is that it's going to leverage
into<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.170> ground<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:47.250> power<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.629> going

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
into the ground for power and it's going

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
into the ground for power and it's going
to<00:00:48.960> aid<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.410> opening<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> hips<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.850> are

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to aid in opening up the hips which are

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
to aid in opening up the hips which are
both<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.420> crucial<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.199> leveraging<00:00:52.920> the

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
both very crucial for leveraging the

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.880 
both very crucial for leveraging the
ground<00:00:53.309> for<00:00:53.579> power<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.530> unwinding<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> body

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
ground for power and unwinding the body

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.529 
ground for power and unwinding the body
in<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.340> sequence<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.390> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
in the right sequence so that we can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.779 
in the right sequence so that we can
release<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> ball<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:58.469> maximum<00:00:59.160> velocity

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
release the ball with maximum velocity

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.310 
release the ball with maximum velocity
now<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.480> first<00:01:00.809> thing<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.079> need<00:01:01.230> to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
now the first thing we need to

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.779 
now the first thing we need to
understand<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:01.949> what<00:01:02.160> our<00:01:02.190> strike<00:01:02.579> foot

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
understand about what our strike foot

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.520 
understand about what our strike foot
does<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
does is that it's going to be the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.289 
does is that it's going to be the
momentum<00:01:04.830> stopper<00:01:05.460> we're<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.119> all

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
momentum stopper we're going to have all

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.109 
momentum stopper we're going to have all
of<00:01:06.420> our<00:01:06.510> momentum<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.170> forward<00:01:07.590> very

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
of our momentum going forward very

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.700 
of our momentum going forward very
aggressively<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.990> when<00:01:10.110> we<00:01:10.229> plant<00:01:10.500> that

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
aggressively and then when we plant that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.740 
aggressively and then when we plant that
front<00:01:11.010> foot<00:01:11.250> that's<00:01:11.549> where<00:01:11.909> all<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.330> energy

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
front foot that's where all the energy

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.020 
front foot that's where all the energy
starts<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:14.040> front<00:01:14.340> foot<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.640> gonna<00:01:14.790> come

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
starts so this front foot is gonna come

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
starts so this front foot is gonna come
forward<00:01:15.240> it's<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.540> plant<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.290> gonna<00:01:16.380> stop

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
forward it's gonna plant it's gonna stop

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.770 
forward it's gonna plant it's gonna stop
our<00:01:16.950> momentum<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.850> we<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.060> now<00:01:18.210> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.570> be

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
our momentum and we are now going to be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.630 
our momentum and we are now going to be
transferring<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.799> energy<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
transferring all that energy from the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.030 
transferring all that energy from the
ground<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:21.330> through<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> hips<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.290> into<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
ground up through the hips out into the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.530 
ground up through the hips out into the
ball<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.700> gonna<00:01:23.790> be<00:01:23.939> very<00:01:24.119> similar<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
ball this is gonna be very similar to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.780 
ball this is gonna be very similar to
what<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.840> pole<00:01:25.049> vaulter<00:01:25.439> does<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.860> pole<00:01:26.369> vaulter

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
what a pole vaulter does a pole vaulter

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.910 
what a pole vaulter does a pole vaulter
runs<00:01:27.090> at<00:01:27.270> full<00:01:27.299> speed<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.829> the

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
runs at full speed just the same as the

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.530 
runs at full speed just the same as the
way<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.100> get<00:01:29.400> our<00:01:29.490> momentum<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:30.119> towards

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
way we get our momentum going towards

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.660 
way we get our momentum going towards
the<00:01:30.659> plate<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.710> he<00:01:31.860> plans<00:01:32.250> he's<00:01:32.460> going

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the plate and then he plans he's going

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.789 
the plate and then he plans he's going
to<00:01:32.759> plant<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.270> front<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.750> pole<00:01:34.049> down

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
to plant the front of this pole down

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.219 
to plant the front of this pole down
into<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> ground<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.909> leverage<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> ground

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
into the ground and leverage the ground

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.679 
into the ground and leverage the ground
for<00:01:37.470> power<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.490> all<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.970> momentum<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
for power and now all that momentum that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
for power and now all that momentum that
he's<00:01:39.869> had<00:01:40.170> he's<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.770> off<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.250> ground

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
he's had he's actually off of the ground

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.429 
he's had he's actually off of the ground
now<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.479> he's<00:01:42.750> off<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> ground

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
now we can see he's off of the ground

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.670 
now we can see he's off of the ground
and<00:01:43.710> all<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.670> momentum<00:01:45.420> went<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.290> into

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
and all that momentum went in down into

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.469 
and all that momentum went in down into
the<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.189> bottom<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.729> pole<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.270> now

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the the bottom of this pole and is now

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.569 
the the bottom of this pole and is now
shooting<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.229> through<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> pole<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.430> can

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
shooting up through the pole and we can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.910 
shooting up through the pole and we can
visibly<00:01:50.970> see<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.509> bend<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.200> pole<00:01:52.560> that's

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
visibly see the bend in the pole that's

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
visibly see the bend in the pole that's
all<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.490> momentum<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.210> all<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.509> power<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
all the momentum and all the power that

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.389 
all the momentum and all the power that
he's<00:01:55.170> leveraged<00:01:55.560> from<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> ground<00:01:56.040> going

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
he's leveraged from the ground going

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280 
he's leveraged from the ground going
through<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.729> pole<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.689> is<00:01:57.930> going<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
through the pole and this is going to

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.399 
through the pole and this is going to
slingshot<00:01:58.770> his<00:01:59.369> body<00:01:59.640> upwards<00:02:00.390> over<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> pole

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
slingshot his body upwards over the pole

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.289 
slingshot his body upwards over the pole
and<00:02:01.649> release<00:02:01.890> him<00:02:02.130> into<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.490> sky<00:02:02.700> now<00:02:02.969> now<00:02:03.210> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
and release him into the sky now now the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.819 
and release him into the sky now now the
only<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.630> he'd<00:02:03.840> be<00:02:03.930> able<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.290> achieve<00:02:04.649> this

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
only way he'd be able to achieve this

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.039 
only way he'd be able to achieve this
maximum<00:02:05.399> height<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.420> properly

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
maximum height is if he properly

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.869 
maximum height is if he properly
leveraged<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.530> ground<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:08.220> power<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.759> he

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
leveraged the ground for power and he

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.089 
leveraged the ground for power and he
sequence<00:02:09.629> up<00:02:09.869> through<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> pole<00:02:10.500> correctly

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
sequence up through the pole correctly

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.770 
sequence up through the pole correctly
and<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.400> is<00:02:11.580> very<00:02:11.849> similar<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.569> we're

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and this is very similar to what we're

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.350 
and this is very similar to what we're
we're<00:02:13.260> pitching<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.280> when<00:02:14.490> our<00:02:14.610> front<00:02:15.030> foot

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
we're pitching so when our front foot

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.690 
we're pitching so when our front foot
plants<00:02:15.960> that's<00:02:16.350> when<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.800> throw<00:02:17.070> begins<00:02:17.490> to

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
plants that's when the throw begins to

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820 
plants that's when the throw begins to
happen<00:02:18.120> when<00:02:18.570> that<00:02:18.600> lands<00:02:19.140> that's<00:02:19.470> when<00:02:19.680> all

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
happen when that lands that's when all

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.680 
happen when that lands that's when all
of<00:02:19.860> our<00:02:20.070> momentum<00:02:20.790> stops<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.360> we<00:02:21.420> can<00:02:21.570> now

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
of our momentum stops and we can now

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.930 
of our momentum stops and we can now
slingshot<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.530> body<00:02:22.740> forward<00:02:23.430> letting<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
slingshot the body forward letting the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.090 
slingshot the body forward letting the
arm<00:02:24.180> drag<00:02:24.810> behind<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.290> upper<00:02:25.530> body<00:02:25.740> and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
arm drag behind the upper body and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.190 
arm drag behind the upper body and
release<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> whip<00:02:27.030> action<00:02:27.270> into<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> flat

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
release with a whip action into a flat

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.170 
release with a whip action into a flat
back<00:02:28.230> follow-through<00:02:29.160> now<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.760> second<00:02:30.150> thing

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
back follow-through now the second thing

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
back follow-through now the second thing
we<00:02:30.390> need<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.540> understand<00:02:30.930> about<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.230> stripe

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
we need to understand about the stripe

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.530 
we need to understand about the stripe
foot<00:02:31.830> is<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.280> when<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.610> stride<00:02:32.850> foot<00:02:33.030> opens

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
foot is that when this stride foot opens

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.530 
foot is that when this stride foot opens
it<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:34.290> now<00:02:34.470> initiating<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.910> opening<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
it is now initiating the opening and

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.810 
it is now initiating the opening and
uncoiling<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> entire<00:02:37.860> body<00:02:38.250> if<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.700> take

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
uncoiling of the entire body if we take

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.280 
uncoiling of the entire body if we take
a<00:02:38.880> quick<00:02:39.090> look<00:02:39.360> from<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> side<00:02:39.990> we're<00:02:40.230> gonna

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
a quick look from the side we're gonna

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.140 
a quick look from the side we're gonna
see<00:02:40.590> that<00:02:40.620> when<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.130> foot<00:02:41.400> lands<00:02:41.880> it's<00:02:42.030> now

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
see that when this foot lands it's now

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.880 
see that when this foot lands it's now
open<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:42.990> see<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.350> hips<00:02:43.560> are<00:02:43.770> now

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
oldest is lead foot is closed off and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.440 
oldest is lead foot is closed off and
now<00:03:08.280> it's<00:03:08.310> going<00:03:08.550> to<00:03:08.580> open<00:03:08.760> up<00:03:09.030> we<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.300> that

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
now it's going to open up we see that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.210 
now it's going to open up we see that
his<00:03:09.570> toes<00:03:09.870> are<00:03:10.110> pointing<00:03:10.500> down<00:03:10.530> towards<00:03:10.980> the

his toes are pointing down towards the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.920 
his toes are pointing down towards the
catcher<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.940> now<00:03:12.060> we<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.360> see<00:03:12.480> his<00:03:12.600> hips<00:03:12.810> are

beginning<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.410> slightly<00:03:13.709> open<00:03:13.980> but<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.370> can

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
beginning to slightly open but we can

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.759 
beginning to slightly open but we can
see<00:03:14.610> his<00:03:14.760> shoulders<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.480> still<00:03:16.140> closed<00:03:16.470> off

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.800 
see his shoulders are still closed off
and<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> hips<00:03:17.700> are<00:03:17.910> coming<00:03:18.360> the<00:03:18.450> hips<00:03:18.660> are

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
and now the hips are coming the hips are

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.690 
and now the hips are coming the hips are
going<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.019> pull<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.440> shoulders<00:03:19.890> around<00:03:20.070> we

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
going to pull the shoulders around we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.009 
going to pull the shoulders around we
can<00:03:20.850> now<00:03:20.970> see<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.420> arm<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.780> lagging

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
can now see that the arm is lagging

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.650 
can now see that the arm is lagging
nicely<00:03:22.620> behind<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.640> shoulders<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.420> as<00:03:24.630> a

nicely behind the shoulders and as a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.840 
nicely behind the shoulders and as a
Rallis<00:03:25.110> his<00:03:25.290> chest<00:03:25.620> fires<00:03:25.920> down<00:03:26.280> towards<00:03:26.700> his

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
Rallis his chest fires down towards his

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.120 
Rallis his chest fires down towards his
foot<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.510> all<00:03:27.660> now<00:03:27.989> released<00:03:28.410> out<00:03:28.620> through

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
foot it is all now released out through

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.190 
foot it is all now released out through
the<00:03:29.280> arm<00:03:29.519> through<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.239> hand<00:03:30.540> into<00:03:30.870> the<00:03:30.900> ball

the arm through the hand into the ball

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.860 
the arm through the hand into the ball
creating<00:03:31.890> maximum<00:03:32.100> velocity<00:03:32.880> by<00:03:33.120> using<00:03:33.360> every

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
creating maximum velocity by using every

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.990 
creating maximum velocity by using every
single<00:03:34.260> part<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> body<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.220> taking<00:03:35.910> the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
sequence correctly if we look from broad

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.110 
sequence correctly if we look from broad
us<00:03:43.590> from<00:03:43.860> behind<00:03:44.010> big<00:03:44.610> thing<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:44.880> want<00:03:44.910> you<00:03:45.090> to

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
pay attention to is where his arm is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.280 
pay attention to is where his arm is
when<00:03:47.459> his<00:03:47.579> foot<00:03:47.820> lands<00:03:48.239> we<00:03:48.390> can<00:03:48.540> see<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.989> his

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
when his foot lands we can see that his

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.560 
when his foot lands we can see that his
initial<00:03:49.590> stride<00:03:50.400> foot<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.850> planted<00:03:51.329> right

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
here and we can see that his arm is

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.330 
here and we can see that his arm is
still<00:03:53.970> way<00:03:54.570> behind<00:03:54.810> this<00:03:55.200> body<00:03:55.440> guys<00:03:56.010> if<00:03:56.220> we

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
still way behind this body guys if we

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.830 
still way behind this body guys if we
can<00:03:56.489> learn<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.299> get<00:03:57.510> into<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.720> right

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
can learn how to get into the right

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.990 
can learn how to get into the right
positions<00:03:58.410> and<00:03:58.560> make<00:03:58.680> sure<00:03:58.890> that<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.370> are<00:03:59.549> in<00:03:59.850> a

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
positions and make sure that we are in a

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.090 
positions and make sure that we are in a
loaded<00:04:00.480> position<00:04:01.019> when<00:04:01.260> our<00:04:01.410> foot<00:04:01.680> lands

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
loaded position when our foot lands

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.560 
loaded position when our foot lands
where<00:04:02.579> it's<00:04:02.760> going<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.120> make<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.420> whole

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
where it's going to make the whole

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.229 
where it's going to make the whole
sequence<00:04:03.959> much<00:04:04.290> easier<00:04:04.799> to<00:04:04.950> execute<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
sequence much easier to execute so a

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.940 
sequence much easier to execute so a
great<00:04:06.600> drill<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.959> can<00:04:07.110> do<00:04:07.200> at<00:04:07.350> home<00:04:07.380> is<00:04:07.799> go

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
great drill you can do at home is go

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.039 
great drill you can do at home is go
ahead<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.220> get<00:04:08.579> into<00:04:08.700> this<00:04:08.880> position<00:04:09.150> where

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
ahead and get into this position where

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.930 
ahead and get into this position where
we<00:04:10.140> get<00:04:10.290> our<00:04:10.530> stride<00:04:10.860> foot<00:04:11.100> landed<00:04:11.579> go<00:04:11.760> ahead

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
we get our stride foot landed go ahead

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.490 
we get our stride foot landed go ahead
and<00:04:12.060> open<00:04:12.180> it<00:04:12.450> up<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:12.840> point<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.140> toe<00:04:13.320> down

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
and open it up and point the toe down

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.170 
and open it up and point the toe down
towards<00:04:13.860> the<00:04:13.980> catcher<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.760> go<00:04:14.910> ahead<00:04:15.060> and

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
towards the catcher and go ahead and

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.240 
towards the catcher and go ahead and
just<00:04:15.269> get<00:04:15.420> that<00:04:15.630> arm<00:04:15.840> back<00:04:16.440> behind<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:17.040> body

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
just get that arm back behind the body

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.849 
just get that arm back behind the body
and<00:04:17.669> make<00:04:18.150> some<00:04:18.359> pitches<00:04:18.750> from<00:04:18.959> there<00:04:19.169> and<00:04:19.500> in

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
and make some pitches from there and in

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.740 
and make some pitches from there and in
thinking<00:04:20.250> about<00:04:20.549> opening<00:04:21.000> up<00:04:21.120> the<00:04:21.299> hips<00:04:21.539> and

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
thinking about opening up the hips and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.089 
thinking about opening up the hips and
letting<00:04:22.020> the<00:04:22.080> hips<00:04:22.260> bring<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.710> shoulders

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
letting the hips bring the shoulders

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.890 
letting the hips bring the shoulders
around<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.849> letting<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.240> shoulders<00:04:24.599> bring

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
around and letting the shoulders bring

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.310 
around and letting the shoulders bring
the<00:04:25.020> arm

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
the arm

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.140 
the arm
around<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.920> start<00:04:26.370> getting<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.640> feeling<00:04:26.850> for

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
around and start getting a feeling for

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.720 
around and start getting a feeling for
sequencing<00:04:27.840> from<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.740> bottom<00:04:29.130> up<00:04:29.310> from<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
sequencing from the bottom up from the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.790 
sequencing from the bottom up from the
from<00:04:30.150> your<00:04:30.270> foot<00:04:30.540> to<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> hips<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.680> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
from your foot to the hips to the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.620 
from your foot to the hips to the
shoulders<00:04:32.220> and<00:04:32.460> then<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.970> arms<00:04:33.270> instead

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
shoulders and then to the arms instead

what I call the spin-out line and that's

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.510 
what I call the spin-out line and that's
gonna<00:05:18.960> be<00:05:19.170> about<00:05:19.290> an<00:05:19.530> inch<00:05:19.680> outside<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.400> your

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
spin-out line is where we really start

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240 
spin-out line is where we really start
getting<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:33.900> tendency<00:05:34.320> to<00:05:34.440> spin<00:05:34.740> out<00:05:34.890> and<00:05:34.920> lose

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250

getting a tendency to spin out and lose
that<00:05:35.400> velocity<00:05:36.030> now<00:05:36.660> what<00:05:37.050> we're<00:05:37.170> going<00:05:37.290> to
