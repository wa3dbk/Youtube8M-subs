wedges they're easier to use I prefer to

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.039 
wedges they're easier to use I prefer to
start<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> top<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.939> work<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:22.020> down

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
start at the top and work my way down

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.890 
start at the top and work my way down
and<00:01:22.850> an<00:01:23.850> important<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.420> remember<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and an important thing to remember is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.590 
and an important thing to remember is
that<00:01:25.290> coverage<00:01:26.040> first<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.240> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.450> go

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
that coverage first and then you can go

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.929 
that coverage first and then you can go

because until it's completely sealed you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.169 
because until it's completely sealed you
might<00:02:05.229> smear<00:02:05.500> it<00:02:08.789> once<00:02:09.789> you've<00:02:09.910> gotten<00:02:10.090> the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
awkward clumps now for this tutorial I'm

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.420 
awkward clumps now for this tutorial I'm
only<00:02:16.690> going<00:02:16.989> down<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.350> my<00:02:17.470> neckline<00:02:17.830> but

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
only going down to my neckline but

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.949 
only going down to my neckline but
depending<00:02:19.060> on<00:02:19.150> what<00:02:19.270> kind<00:02:19.360> of<00:02:19.450> dress<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:19.690> wear

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
depending on what kind of dress you wear

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.360 
depending on what kind of dress you wear
for<00:02:20.110> Ice<00:02:20.230> Queen<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.709> might<00:02:20.890> need<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.100> go<00:02:21.190> down

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
for Ice Queen you might need to go down

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.760 
for Ice Queen you might need to go down
further<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.930> recommend<00:02:22.930> for<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.080> to<00:02:23.350> seal<00:02:23.590> in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
further I recommend for that to seal in

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.800 
further I recommend for that to seal in
parts<00:02:24.100> so<00:02:24.459> start<00:02:24.790> with<00:02:24.850> your<00:02:25.000> face<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.480> seal

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
parts so start with your face and seal

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
parts so start with your face and seal
that<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.260> then<00:02:26.440> continue<00:02:26.590> downward<00:02:27.250> because

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
that and then continue downward because

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.800 
that and then continue downward because
it's<00:02:27.760> sometimes<00:02:27.910> hard<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.360> keep<00:02:28.540> track<00:02:28.780> of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
it's sometimes hard to keep track of

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.120 
it's sometimes hard to keep track of
your<00:02:28.989> makeup<00:02:29.320> while<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:29.680> on<00:02:29.800> your<00:02:29.950> face

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
