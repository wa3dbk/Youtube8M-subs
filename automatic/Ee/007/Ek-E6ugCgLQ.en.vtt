the other properties yeah open jdk java
7<00:00:32.399> run<00:00:32.700> time<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.630> install<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.440> then<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
7 run time you install that and then you

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.130 
7 run time you install that and then you
install<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.489> updates<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.719> basically

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
install the updates and you basically

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
install the updates and you basically
should<00:00:37.559> be<00:00:37.680> able<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.920> run<00:00:38.070> Minecraft<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.879> then

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
should be able to run Minecraft and then

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.900 
should be able to run Minecraft and then
basically<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.469> put<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.460> properties

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
basically I just put in the properties

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
basically I just put in the properties
and<00:00:43.370> you<00:00:44.370> have<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> change<00:00:44.820> permissions<00:00:45.149> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and you have to change permissions you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
and you have to change permissions you
have<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> change<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.610> be<00:00:47.610> able<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:49.129> where<00:00:50.129> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
have to change it to be able to where is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.930 
have to change it to be able to where is
it<00:00:50.449> executes<00:00:51.449> allow<00:00:51.719> executing<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> program

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
it executes allow executing as a program

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.920 
it executes allow executing as a program
so<00:00:54.320> naturally<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:56.239> then<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.570> got<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> change

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so naturally it then you got to change

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.139 
so naturally it then you got to change
that<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.859> set<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.160> where<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.579> opens<00:00:59.760> with

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that and then set it where it opens with

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.590 
that and then set it where it opens with
the<00:01:01.109> java<00:01:02.010> runtime<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.670> that's<00:01:03.149> basically<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
the java runtime and that's basically it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.509 
the java runtime and that's basically it
i'm<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.680> show<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.890> how<00:01:04.979> i<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.400> it
