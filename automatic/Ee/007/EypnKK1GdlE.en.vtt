watch<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:17.340> has<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.080> benefit<00:00:19.080> of<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
watch which has the benefit of a

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.040 
watch which has the benefit of a
built-in<00:00:23.029> heart<00:00:24.029> rate<00:00:24.119> sensor<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> back

built-in heart rate sensor on the back

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.550 
built-in heart rate sensor on the back
so<00:00:26.010> heart<00:00:26.279> rate<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.609> taken<00:00:27.029> off<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.630> wrist<00:00:27.840> as

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
so heart rate is taken off the wrist as

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.940 
so heart rate is taken off the wrist as
opposed<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> viral<00:00:29.429> chest<00:00:29.699> strap<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:33.149> SF<00:00:33.420> 810

not<00:01:17.130> had<00:01:17.310> any<00:01:17.369> feedback<00:01:17.880> yet<00:01:18.270> from<00:01:18.509> Epson<00:01:19.500> but

not had any feedback yet from Epson but
I<00:01:19.680> don't<00:01:19.890> believe<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.280> does<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> it's<00:01:21.720> just

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
I don't believe it does so it's just

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.690 
I don't believe it does so it's just
kept<00:01:23.130> internally<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.450> use<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> watch<00:01:25.700> so
