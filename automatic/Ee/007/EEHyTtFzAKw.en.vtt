00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
electronic throttle on it but you know

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.850 
electronic throttle on it but you know
when<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> put<00:00:33.480> your<00:00:33.570> foot<00:00:33.720> down<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.260> it

accelerates the way you don't think much
about<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.510> day<00:00:36.750> right<00:00:37.170> but<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> computer

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
about a day right but it's a computer

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
from the throttle position sensor which

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.979 
from the throttle position sensor which
is<00:00:46.800> now<00:00:47.040> mounted<00:00:47.550> on<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> throttle<00:00:48.210> pedal<00:00:48.359> you

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
is now mounted on the throttle pedal you

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.630 
is now mounted on the throttle pedal you
step<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.739> well<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:49.949> hard<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.250> fast<00:00:50.489> as

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
step down on it well as hard as fast as

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.400 
step down on it well as hard as fast as
you<00:00:50.760> push<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.750> doesn't<00:00:51.929> matter<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
you push it it doesn't matter the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.079 
you push it it doesn't matter the
computer<00:00:52.829> still<00:00:53.070> does<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.429> it<00:00:53.519> wants<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.910> do

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
computer still does what it wants to do

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:56.419 
computer still does what it wants to do
and<00:00:54.420> here's<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.350> great<00:00:55.500> way<00:00:55.679> to<00:00:55.710> show<00:00:56.010> how<00:00:56.160> slow

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
and here's a great way to show how slow

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:58.340 
and here's a great way to show how slow
that<00:00:56.609> is<00:00:56.820> exactly<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.780> normal<00:00:58.230> operation

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that is exactly this is normal operation

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.739 
that is exactly this is normal operation
right<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:58.980> I<00:00:59.429> push<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> down<00:01:00.179> like<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
right here I push it down like that you

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:02.590 
right here I push it down like that you
can<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:00.989> how<00:01:01.079> long<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.499> takes<00:01:01.769> for<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
can see how long it takes for it to

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.570 
can see how long it takes for it to
accelerate<00:01:03.600> alright<00:01:04.410> well<00:01:04.949> we<00:01:05.160> found<00:01:05.400> a

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
accelerate alright well we found a

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.360 
accelerate alright well we found a
device<00:01:05.790> here<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.840> can<00:01:07.050> change<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.740> all<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
device here that can change that all the

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.920 
device here that can change that all the
way<00:01:08.520> around<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.390> from<00:01:09.570> Sprint

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
way around and that's from Sprint

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.990 
way around and that's from Sprint
Booster<00:01:10.310> absolutely<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.550> the<00:01:11.760> Sprint

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
Booster absolutely and the Sprint

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
series with the harness coming from the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
series with the harness coming from the
computer<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.460> throttle<00:01:17.909> position<00:01:17.970> sensor

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
hey stage one is still gonna be a

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
hey stage one is still gonna be a
progressive<00:02:04.439> opening<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.100> like<00:02:05.640> that<00:02:05.909> one

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
progressive opening I like that one

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.969 
progressive opening I like that one
that's<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.810> normal<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.380> exactly

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that's just your normal right exactly

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.230 
that's just your normal right exactly
that's<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.340> factory<00:02:08.759> it's<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.940> progressive

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:09.240 
that's the factory it's a progressive

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.969 
that's the factory it's a progressive
opening<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.780> opens<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.320> they<00:02:10.500> programmed

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
opening it opens at how they programmed

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.590 
opening it opens at how they programmed
it<00:02:11.100> look<00:02:11.250> how<00:02:11.430> long<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.880> takes<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.210> do<00:02:12.420> that

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
it look how long it takes to do that

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.300 
it look how long it takes to do that
when<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> slammed<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> throttle<00:02:13.710> down<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
when I slammed the throttle down and

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.190 
when I slammed the throttle down and
then<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.000> switch<00:02:15.240> it<00:02:15.270> over<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> stage<00:02:16.020> one

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
then we switch it over to the stage one

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.290 
then we switch it over to the stage one
right<00:02:16.440> here<00:02:16.740> okay<00:02:17.520> which<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> still

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
right here okay which is still

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.850 
right here okay which is still
progressive<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:18.990> but<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> lot<00:02:19.620> quicker

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
progressive right but it's a lot quicker

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.350 
progressive right but it's a lot quicker
than<00:02:20.190> what<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.430> factory<00:02:20.790> provides<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.240> with

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
than what the factory provides you with

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.290 
than what the factory provides you with
yeah<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.200> sure<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.070> then<00:02:23.520> stage<00:02:23.910> two<00:02:23.940> is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
yeah it sure is and then stage two is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
yeah it sure is and then stage two is
where<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> fun<00:02:24.840> happens<00:02:25.050> oh<00:02:25.490> look<00:02:26.490> at<00:02:26.580> that

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
where the fun happens oh look at that

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.500 
where the fun happens oh look at that
that's<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.270> linear<00:02:27.450> opening<00:02:27.990> just

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
that's a linear opening just

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.059 
that's a linear opening just
like<00:02:28.659> your<00:02:28.930> cable<00:02:29.230> throttle<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.769> just<00:02:29.950> like

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
like your cable throttle so just like

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.170 
like your cable throttle so just like
the<00:02:30.159> old<00:02:30.310> cars<00:02:30.519> when<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.790> push<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.030> pedal

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the old cars when you push the pedal

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.000 
the old cars when you push the pedal
down<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.629> throttle<00:02:31.989> body<00:02:32.049> opens<00:02:32.560> anyway<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
down the throttle body opens anyway you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
down the throttle body opens anyway you
go<00:02:33.189> down<00:02:33.459> something's<00:02:33.939> going<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.180> happen

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
go down something's going to happen

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.539 
go down something's going to happen
that's<00:02:34.750> for<00:02:34.959> sure<00:02:35.110> in<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.379> I<00:02:35.590> had<00:02:36.220> no<00:02:36.400> idea

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
that's for sure in it I had no idea

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.069 
that's for sure in it I had no idea
there<00:02:36.909> was<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.120> much<00:02:37.299> delay<00:02:37.629> because<00:02:37.959> you

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
there was that much delay because you

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.140 
there was that much delay because you
get<00:02:38.230> used<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.829> you<00:02:39.010> know<00:02:39.159> when<00:02:39.790> you<00:02:39.879> start

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
get used to it you know when you start

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.699 
get used to it you know when you start
out<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.540> no<00:02:40.810> different<00:02:41.200> where<00:02:41.319> you<00:02:41.379> get<00:02:41.530> used

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
out is no different where you get used

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.770 
out is no different where you get used
to<00:02:41.829> but<00:02:41.980> boy<00:02:42.129> you<00:02:42.189> see<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.970> can<00:02:43.360> see<00:02:43.599> how

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
to but boy you see that I can see how

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.479 
to but boy you see that I can see how
that<00:02:43.989> can<00:02:44.140> make<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> big<00:02:44.560> difference<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
that can make a big difference it is a

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:46.830 
that can make a big difference it is a
whole<00:02:45.700> different<00:02:46.000> car<00:02:46.150> after<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.450> install<00:02:46.720> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
whole different car after you install it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.170 
whole different car after you install it
so<00:02:47.260> all<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:47.860> have<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.040> do<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.370> just<00:02:48.549> plug<00:02:48.849> it<00:02:49.030> in

so all you have to do is just plug it in

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.180 
so all you have to do is just plug it in
it's<00:02:50.019> a<00:02:50.110> plug<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.440> play<00:02:50.500> it's<00:02:50.799> a<00:02:50.860> simple

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
it's a plug and play it's a simple

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.399 
it's a plug and play it's a simple
install<00:02:51.459> most<00:02:52.060> vehicles<00:02:52.510> it's<00:02:52.750> about<00:02:52.900> five<00:02:53.200> to
