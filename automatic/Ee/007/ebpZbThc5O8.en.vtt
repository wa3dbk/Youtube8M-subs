00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
in the charge mode so we'll turn that

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.530 
in the charge mode so we'll turn that
off<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.920> minute<00:01:55.950> now<00:01:56.329> let's<00:01:57.329> talk<00:01:57.479> about

off for a minute now let's talk about

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.480 
off for a minute now let's talk about
how<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:57.960> actually<00:01:58.409> work<00:01:58.829> this<00:01:58.979> insert<00:01:59.340> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
how you actually work this insert it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.789 
how you actually work this insert it
what<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> like<00:01:59.850> what<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.649> put

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
what I like what I don't like so to put

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.389 
what I like what I don't like so to put
the<00:02:01.920> ipad<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.430> they<00:02:02.939> strongly<00:02:03.329> suggest<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
the ipad in they strongly suggest that

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.419 
the ipad in they strongly suggest that
you<00:02:05.399> put<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.030> volume<00:02:06.479> buttons<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.439> your

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
you put the volume buttons and your

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.430 
you put the volume buttons and your
rocker<00:02:08.610> switch<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.179> up<00:02:09.330> part<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.410> that

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
rocker switch in the up part so that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.900 
rocker switch in the up part so that
allows<00:02:10.800> your<00:02:11.039> camera<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.430> be<00:02:11.550> at<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> highest

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
allows your camera to be at the highest

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190 
allows your camera to be at the highest
parts<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.599> camera<00:02:12.930> work

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
parts for you camera work

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.839 
parts for you camera work
not<00:02:13.379> your<00:02:13.950> camera's<00:02:14.280> at<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.489> bottom<00:02:14.819> so

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
not your camera's at the bottom so

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.920 
not your camera's at the bottom so
that's<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.120> good<00:02:15.270> little<00:02:15.360> tip<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.720> they<00:02:15.810> have

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that's a good little tip that they have

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's a good little tip that they have
in<00:02:16.110> there<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:16.950> actually<00:02:17.160> slips<00:02:18.150> into

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
in there and it just actually slips into

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.430 
in there and it just actually slips into
place<00:02:18.599> now<00:02:18.780> here's<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.170> things<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.379> don't

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
place now here's one of things I don't

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.670 
place now here's one of things I don't
like<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.849> do<00:02:21.390> like<00:02:21.569> together<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.080> slips<00:02:22.470> in

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like and I do like together it slips in

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.530 
like and I do like together it slips in
so<00:02:23.310> as<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.940> angle<00:02:24.180> you<00:02:24.300> get<00:02:24.420> this

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
so as you can see the angle you get this

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.390 
so as you can see the angle you get this
is<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> default<00:02:24.930> angle<00:02:25.470> what<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.650> locks<00:02:25.890> you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
is the default angle what it locks you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.100 
is the default angle what it locks you
can<00:02:26.519> always<00:02:26.700> tilt<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.180> more<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.569> almost<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:28.050> a

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
can always tilt it more you almost get a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.070 
can always tilt it more you almost get a
full<00:02:28.880> 180<00:02:29.880> when<00:02:30.330> you're<00:02:30.450> putting<00:02:30.599> it<00:02:30.690> down<00:02:30.840> but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
full 180 when you're putting it down but

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.210 
full 180 when you're putting it down but
you<00:02:31.170> can<00:02:31.290> see<00:02:31.410> there's<00:02:31.590> always<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.860> little<00:02:32.099> bit

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
you can see there's always a little bit

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.009 
you can see there's always a little bit
of<00:02:32.250> an<00:02:32.400> edge<00:02:32.519> underneath<00:02:32.910> it's<00:02:33.209> there<00:02:33.450> when

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
of an edge underneath it's there when

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.240 
of an edge underneath it's there when
you<00:02:34.110> close<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.650> other<00:02:34.739> reason<00:02:35.010> they<00:02:35.099> tell

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
you close it the other reason they tell

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.440 
you close it the other reason they tell
you<00:02:35.310> put<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.519> volume<00:02:35.670> buttons<00:02:36.060> up<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.330> when

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
you put the volume buttons up is when

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.970 
you put the volume buttons up is when
you<00:02:36.510> close<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.750> it<00:02:37.019> does<00:02:37.200> have<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.500> magnetic

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
you close it it does have the magnetic

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.530 
you close it it does have the magnetic
on<00:02:38.130> and<00:02:38.310> off<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.760> also<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.330> feature

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
on and off so you also have that feature

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.050 
on and off so you also have that feature
built<00:02:39.870> in<00:02:39.989> which<00:02:40.140> is<00:02:40.260> really<00:02:40.470> nice<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.060> you'll

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
built in which is really nice if you'll

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.210 
built in which is really nice if you'll
notice<00:02:42.269> because<00:02:42.569> there's<00:02:43.019> no<00:02:43.200> frame<00:02:43.620> set<00:02:44.010> on

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
notice because there's no frame set on

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.360 
notice because there's no frame set on
the<00:02:44.790> edges<00:02:45.180> of<00:02:45.330> your<00:02:45.360> iPad<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.560> get<00:02:46.799> you've

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
got a center it yourself now here's one

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.539 
got a center it yourself now here's one
of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.260> things<00:02:49.410> they<00:02:49.530> say<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.890> FAQ<00:02:50.519> and

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
of the things they say in the FAQ and

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.309 
of the things they say in the FAQ and
one<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:50.970> problems<00:02:51.360> one<00:02:52.079> of<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.170> only

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
one of the problems one of the only

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.690 
one of the problems one of the only
problems<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> had<00:02:52.769> with<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:52.980> case<00:02:53.190> be<00:02:53.430> honest

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
problems I had with the case be honest

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
problems I had with the case be honest
with<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:54.690> uses<00:02:54.810> friction<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
with you is that it uses friction to

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.400 
with you is that it uses friction to
hold<00:02:55.829> your<00:02:56.010> iPad<00:02:56.400> into<00:02:56.700> place<00:02:57.269> most<00:02:58.230> other

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
cases have some sort of edging around

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.880 
cases have some sort of edging around
them<00:03:00.420> so<00:03:00.599> when<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.989> hold<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.319> upside<00:03:01.440> down<00:03:01.650> or

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
them so when you hold it upside down or

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.530 
them so when you hold it upside down or

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
you shake it or whatever it's not going

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.759 
you shake it or whatever it's not going
to<00:03:03.630> slide<00:03:03.840> out<00:03:04.019> this<00:03:04.230> one<00:03:04.380> they<00:03:04.470> tell<00:03:04.680> you

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
to slide out this one they tell you

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.559 
to slide out this one they tell you
specifically<00:03:05.310> then<00:03:05.970> not<00:03:06.209> do<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.540> because

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
specifically then not do it because

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.620 
specifically then not do it because
friction<00:03:07.380> is<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:08.040> holds<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.340> in<00:03:08.459> place<00:03:08.519> so<00:03:09.329> i

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
friction is what holds it in place so i

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.850 
friction is what holds it in place so i
know<00:03:09.780> i'm<00:03:09.959> doing<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.260> shaking<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.650> little<00:03:10.739> bit

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
know i'm doing a shaking a little bit

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.280 
know i'm doing a shaking a little bit
you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.190> already<00:03:11.340> see<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:11.849> separating<00:03:12.599> from

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
you can already see it's separating from

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.110 
you can already see it's separating from
the<00:03:13.470> top<00:03:13.650> edge<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.280> just<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.610> simple<00:03:14.910> push<00:03:15.090> of

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the top edge and just a simple push of

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.479 
the top edge and just a simple push of
the<00:03:15.269> thumb<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:16.290> can<00:03:16.470> come<00:03:16.650> out<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:17.280> keep<00:03:17.459> that

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the thumb it can come out so keep that

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.830 
the thumb it can come out so keep that
in<00:03:17.639> mind<00:03:17.850> if<00:03:17.940> you're<00:03:18.090> transporting<00:03:18.630> using

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
in mind if you're transporting using

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.059 
in mind if you're transporting using
this<00:03:18.930> one<00:03:19.139> you'll<00:03:19.380> always<00:03:19.620> want<00:03:19.709> to<00:03:19.799> keep<00:03:19.950> it

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
this one you'll always want to keep it

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.920 
this one you'll always want to keep it
so<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> clips<00:03:20.519> are<00:03:20.670> down<00:03:20.880> so<00:03:21.420> you<00:03:21.480> hold<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.870> in

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
so the clips are down so you hold it in

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.509 
so the clips are down so you hold it in
place<00:03:22.079> otherwise<00:03:22.620> what<00:03:22.859> you<00:03:22.980> could<00:03:23.130> get<00:03:23.280> is

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
place otherwise what you could get is

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.330 
place otherwise what you could get is
it's<00:03:24.150> sliding<00:03:24.420> out<00:03:24.690> of<00:03:24.959> these<00:03:25.139> little<00:03:25.470> static

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
it's sliding out of these little static

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.559 
it's sliding out of these little static
they<00:03:26.459> use<00:03:26.609> friction<00:03:26.880> to<00:03:27.120> hold<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.450> place

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
they use friction to hold it in place

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.030 
they use friction to hold it in place
instead<00:03:27.840> of<00:03:27.959> an<00:03:28.079> actual<00:03:28.260> clamp<00:03:28.769> around<00:03:28.889> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
instead of an actual clamp around the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.120 
instead of an actual clamp around the
sides<00:03:29.310> I<00:03:29.549> really<00:03:30.299> wish<00:03:30.450> they<00:03:30.630> had<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.840> way<00:03:31.130> that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
sides I really wish they had a way that

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.559 
sides I really wish they had a way that
they<00:03:32.250> could<00:03:32.310> put<00:03:32.549> a<00:03:32.579> clamp<00:03:32.850> around<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.269> sides

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
they could put a clamp around the sides

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.479 
they could put a clamp around the sides
I<00:03:33.810> don't<00:03:33.959> know<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.079> trim<00:03:34.470> piece<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:35.160> use<00:03:35.310> the

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
I don't know a trim piece they use the

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.030 
I don't know a trim piece they use the
same<00:03:35.569> tooling<00:03:36.569> as<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.900> iPad<00:03:37.319> themselves<00:03:37.920> so

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
same tooling as the iPad themselves so

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.559 
same tooling as the iPad themselves so
it<00:03:38.130> looks<00:03:38.340> really<00:03:38.579> nice<00:03:38.819> it<00:03:39.120> does<00:03:39.269> look<00:03:39.450> really

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
it looks really nice it does look really

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.660 
it looks really nice it does look really
slick<00:03:39.870> we'll<00:03:39.989> look<00:03:40.109> at<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.670> polycarbonate

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
slick we'll look at the polycarbonate

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.009 
slick we'll look at the polycarbonate
one<00:03:41.850> as<00:03:41.970> well<00:03:42.090> in<00:03:42.209> just<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.420> minute<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:42.690> it

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
one as well in just a minute but it

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.289 
one as well in just a minute but it
looks<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.410> nice<00:03:43.620> easy<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.790> pair<00:03:44.970> easy<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
looks really nice easy to pair easy to

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.970 
looks really nice easy to pair easy to
sync<00:03:45.569> one<00:03:45.989> of<00:03:46.079> the<00:03:46.139> key<00:03:46.290> things<00:03:46.530> they<00:03:46.650> sell<00:03:46.859> you

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
sync one of the key things they sell you

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.580 
sync one of the key things they sell you
on<00:03:47.160> is<00:03:47.190> not<00:03:47.430> just<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:48.030> cool<00:03:48.450> keyboard<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
on is not just the cool keyboard the

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.990 
on is not just the cool keyboard the
keyboard<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.950> a<00:03:49.980> full<00:03:50.160> qwerty<00:03:50.370> keyboard<00:03:50.850> it

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
keyboard is a full qwerty keyboard it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.390 
keyboard is a full qwerty keyboard it
works<00:03:51.239> really<00:03:51.569> well<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:52.410> did<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.040> sinking

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
works really well we did the sinking

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.180 
works really well we did the sinking
procedure<00:03:53.790> which<00:03:54.000> was<00:03:54.150> simple<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:55.190> from

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
procedure which was simple and from

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.470 
procedure which was simple and from
there<00:03:56.400> we<00:03:56.549> typed<00:03:56.790> away<00:03:57.030> didn't<00:03:57.269> have<00:03:57.359> any

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
there we typed away didn't have any

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.000 
there we typed away didn't have any
problems<00:03:57.569> the<00:03:58.139> next<00:03:58.440> step<00:03:58.560> you<00:03:58.680> do<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.920> you

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
problems the next step you do is you

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.069 
problems the next step you do is you
actually<00:03:59.190> sink<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.060> Bluetooth<00:04:00.510> speakers

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
actually sink the Bluetooth speakers

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.089 
actually sink the Bluetooth speakers
what<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:01.349> allows<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.769> is<00:04:01.889> play<00:04:02.069> the

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
what that allows you to do is play the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.309 
what that allows you to do is play the
sound<00:04:02.519> out<00:04:03.150> from<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.599> ipad<00:04:03.870> verse<00:04:04.109> the

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
sound out from the ipad verse the

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.339 
sound out from the ipad verse the
speakers<00:04:04.709> are<00:04:05.250> they<00:04:05.579> top<00:04:05.849> quality<00:04:06.420> bluetooth

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
speakers are they top quality bluetooth

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:09.319 
speakers are they top quality bluetooth
quality<00:04:08.010> ones<00:04:08.579> that<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.849> see<00:04:09.060> that<00:04:09.239> are

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
quality ones that you see that are

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.849 
quality ones that you see that are
standalone<00:04:09.750> from<00:04:10.079> the<00:04:10.169> jaw<00:04:10.380> bones<00:04:10.650> and<00:04:10.799> the

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
standalone from the jaw bones and the

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.580 
standalone from the jaw bones and the
others<00:04:11.069> no<00:04:11.819> honestly<00:04:12.780> they're<00:04:12.959> not<00:04:13.109> are<00:04:13.440> they

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
others no honestly they're not are they

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.620 
others no honestly they're not are they
good<00:04:13.859> enough<00:04:13.889> yes<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:15.180> if<00:04:15.329> you're<00:04:15.450> really

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
good enough yes so if you're really

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.300 
good enough yes so if you're really
looking<00:04:15.720> for<00:04:16.019> true<00:04:16.229> crystal<00:04:16.620> clear<00:04:16.829> use<00:04:17.160> your

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
looking for true crystal clear use your

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.710 
looking for true crystal clear use your
headphones<00:04:17.459> use<00:04:17.970> something<00:04:18.299> else<00:04:18.389> on<00:04:18.630> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
headphones use something else on the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.390 
headphones use something else on the
outside<00:04:19.019> but<00:04:19.169> for<00:04:19.410> them<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.769> have<00:04:20.130> just<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
outside but for them to have just a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.190 
outside but for them to have just a
general<00:04:20.729> speaker<00:04:21.000> set<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.299> here<00:04:21.510> works<00:04:22.019> really

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
general speaker set in here works really

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.600 
general speaker set in here works really
well<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.680> bet<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.099> that's<00:04:23.250> where<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.430> lot<00:04:23.490> of

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
well and I bet you that's where a lot of

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.040 
well and I bet you that's where a lot of
the<00:04:23.700> weight<00:04:23.940> is<00:04:24.090> also<00:04:24.390> coming<00:04:24.570> from<00:04:24.840> is

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
the weight is also coming from is

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.870 
the weight is also coming from is
building<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.919> speakers

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
building in the speakers

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.280 
building in the speakers

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the same toggle or bar because I could

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.290 
the same toggle or bar because I could
find<00:04:52.830> myself<00:04:53.040> pushing<00:04:53.580> on<00:04:53.700> one<00:04:53.880> end<00:04:54.150> to<00:04:54.210> the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
find myself pushing on one end to the

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.910 
find myself pushing on one end to the
iPad<00:04:54.780> than<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.080> other<00:04:55.260> when<00:04:55.440> I'm<00:04:55.530> opening<00:04:55.830> it

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920 
iPad than the other when I'm opening it

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.440 
iPad than the other when I'm opening it
not<00:04:56.100> just<00:04:56.130> always<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.610> middle<00:04:56.880> if<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.150> do<00:04:57.330> in

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
not just always the middle if you do in

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.700 
not just always the middle if you do in
the<00:04:57.510> middle<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:57.930> puts<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.350> same<00:04:58.530> amount<00:04:58.680> of

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
the middle it puts the same amount of

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.020 
the middle it puts the same amount of
pressure<00:04:58.920> on<00:04:59.070> both<00:04:59.310> of<00:04:59.340> them<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.640> open<00:04:59.790> them<00:04:59.940> up

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
pressure on both of them to open them up

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.940 
pressure on both of them to open them up
but<00:05:00.450> if<00:05:00.540> you<00:05:00.630> push<00:05:00.840> on<00:05:00.990> an<00:05:01.110> end<00:05:01.350> what<00:05:01.830> you're

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
but if you push on an end what you're

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.770 
but if you push on an end what you're
going<00:05:02.070> to<00:05:02.130> get<00:05:02.310> is<00:05:02.580> the<00:05:02.640> ability<00:05:03.060> for<00:05:03.330> not<00:05:03.630> the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
going to get is the ability for not the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.820 
going to get is the ability for not the
whole<00:05:03.900> thing<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.170> open<00:05:04.440> because<00:05:04.530> there's<00:05:04.740> no

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
whole thing to open because there's no

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.740 
whole thing to open because there's no
containing<00:05:05.370> like<00:05:05.670> solid<00:05:06.090> bar<00:05:06.270> that<00:05:06.450> connects

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
containing like solid bar that connects

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.960 
containing like solid bar that connects
them<00:05:06.900> it's<00:05:07.290> just<00:05:07.530> not<00:05:07.590> one<00:05:07.890> piece<00:05:08.190> to<00:05:08.730> make<00:05:08.850> it

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
them it's just not one piece to make it

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.880 
them it's just not one piece to make it
simple<00:05:09.330> both<00:05:09.720> these<00:05:09.870> clips<00:05:10.170> as<00:05:10.320> you<00:05:10.410> see<00:05:10.590> act

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
simple both these clips as you see act

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.220 
simple both these clips as you see act
independent<00:05:11.760> of<00:05:11.850> each<00:05:11.910> other<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.330> they<00:05:13.080> can

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
independent of each other so they can

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:14.570 
independent of each other so they can
fold<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.590> open<00:05:13.770> and<00:05:13.860> close<00:05:13.980> when<00:05:14.130> you<00:05:14.160> want<00:05:14.370> to

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
fold and open and close when you want to

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.940 
fold and open and close when you want to
so<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.180> polycarbonate<00:05:15.780> one<00:05:15.930> looks<00:05:16.470> identical

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
so the polycarbonate one looks identical

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.610 
so the polycarbonate one looks identical
same<00:05:17.430> features<00:05:17.790> same<00:05:18.030> functions<00:05:18.870> the<00:05:19.470> only

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
same features same functions the only

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.370 
same features same functions the only
difference<00:05:19.800> is<00:05:20.100> instead<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.670> nice<00:05:20.820> shiny

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
difference is instead of the nice shiny

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.960 
difference is instead of the nice shiny
silver<00:05:22.380> what<00:05:22.530> you're<00:05:22.650> going<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:22.830> get<00:05:22.950> the<00:05:23.760> same

that you do doesn't really matter but

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.310 
that you do doesn't really matter but
fits<00:05:38.640> the<00:05:38.760> same<00:05:38.970> way<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.600> slides<00:05:39.810> into<00:05:40.170> place

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
fits the same way it slides into place

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.100 
fits the same way it slides into place
it's<00:05:40.890> a<00:05:41.040> friction<00:05:41.430> slide<00:05:41.960> it'll<00:05:42.960> have<00:05:43.080> the

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
it's a friction slide it'll have the

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.780 
it's a friction slide it'll have the
magnetic<00:05:43.650> on<00:05:43.770> and<00:05:43.950> off<00:05:44.040> it<00:05:44.070> does<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.610> same

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
magnetic on and off it does the same

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.730 
magnetic on and off it does the same
features<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.510> did<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.750> same<00:05:45.780> sinking<00:05:46.260> it<00:05:46.590> had

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
features it did the same sinking it had

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.650 
features it did the same sinking it had
the<00:05:46.860> same<00:05:47.040> sound<00:05:47.370> pretty<00:05:48.240> much<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.540> same

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
the same sound pretty much the same

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.800 
the same sound pretty much the same
difference<00:05:49.110> so<00:05:49.590> overall<00:05:50.370> what<00:05:50.520> do<00:05:50.610> we<00:05:50.700> think

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
difference so overall what do we think

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.580 
difference so overall what do we think
pretty<00:05:51.810> good<00:05:51.990> keyboard<00:05:52.370> great<00:05:53.370> speaker<00:05:53.790> sound
