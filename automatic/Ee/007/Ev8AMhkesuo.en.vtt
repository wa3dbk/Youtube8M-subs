who told us in our last story about

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.719 
who told us in our last story about
ideas<00:01:30.869> for<00:01:30.960> modifying<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.799> weather<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.340> he

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
ideas for modifying the weather that he

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.670 
ideas for modifying the weather that he
says<00:01:33.000> aren't<00:01:33.299> happening<00:01:33.479> now<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.470> will

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
says aren't happening now but will

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
says aren't happening now but will
probably<00:01:34.860> happen<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.210> road<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:37.170> can

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
probably happen down the road you can

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.460 
probably happen down the road you can
use<00:01:37.500> barium<00:01:38.340> oxide<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.090> example<00:01:39.570> which<00:01:40.200> makes

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
use barium oxide for example which makes

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
use barium oxide for example which makes
big<00:01:41.070> fluffy<00:01:41.430> clouds<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.150> could<00:01:42.299> use<00:01:42.570> tiny

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
big fluffy clouds but you could use tiny

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
big fluffy clouds but you could use tiny
little<00:01:43.079> bits<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.380> aluminum<00:01:43.860> which<00:01:44.100> is<00:01:44.130> benign

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
little bits of aluminum which is benign

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.310 
little bits of aluminum which is benign
in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> environment<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.689> essentially
