00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
the attack so anyways first thing he

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.130 
the attack so anyways first thing he
does<00:01:06.440> is<00:01:06.500> he<00:01:06.680> drops<00:01:06.920> a<00:01:07.010> couple<00:01:07.250> loons<00:01:07.430> this<00:01:07.700> way

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
does is he drops a couple loons this way

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.600 
does is he drops a couple loons this way
secondary<00:01:09.140> attack<00:01:09.229> this<00:01:09.560> way<00:01:09.800> that<00:01:10.100> clears<00:01:10.430> up

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
secondary attack this way that clears up

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.760 
secondary attack this way that clears up
this<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.300> because<00:01:12.020> he's<00:01:12.110> tachy<00:01:12.350> from<00:01:12.590> this

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
this this because he's tachy from this

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.800 
this this because he's tachy from this
direction<00:01:12.920> keeps<00:01:13.909> them<00:01:14.000> having<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.329> travel<00:01:14.509> so

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
direction keeps them having to travel so

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.340 
direction keeps them having to travel so
far<00:01:15.170> down<00:01:15.380> so<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.950> focus<00:01:16.219> more<00:01:16.640> on<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
far down so the focus more on the

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.200 
far down so the focus more on the
defensive<00:01:18.350> here<00:01:18.680> so<00:01:18.950> let's<00:01:19.250> let's<00:01:19.820> fire<00:01:20.060> that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210
