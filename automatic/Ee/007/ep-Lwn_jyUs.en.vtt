00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.200 
also very cool about this system is that

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.800 
also very cool about this system is that
a<00:00:26.710> part<00:00:26.919> of<00:00:27.070> this<00:00:27.279> string<00:00:27.880> right<00:00:27.939> here<00:00:28.180> the

only thing above the ground are the
rails<00:00:30.759> so<00:00:31.270> there<00:00:31.660> is<00:00:31.689> no<00:00:31.900> redstone<00:00:32.349> there's<00:00:32.619> no

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
rails so there is no redstone there's no

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.680 
rails so there is no redstone there's no
blocks<00:00:33.040> or<00:00:33.250> anything<00:00:33.670> like<00:00:33.700> that<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:34.510> can

even have it in the middle room and it

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.170 
even have it in the middle room and it
works<00:00:37.660> just<00:00:37.750> fine<00:00:38.020> so<00:00:38.680> that's<00:00:39.070> very<00:00:39.130> cool<00:00:39.489> and

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
works just fine so that's very cool and

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.720 
works just fine so that's very cool and
what's<00:00:40.870> also<00:00:41.050> very<00:00:41.290> cool<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.190> restaurant

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
what's also very cool is the restaurant

because<00:00:42.850> as<00:00:43.359> you<00:00:43.660> can<00:00:43.719> see<00:00:43.809> it's<00:00:44.140> very<00:00:44.199> simple

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
because as you can see it's very simple

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.860 
because as you can see it's very simple
it's<00:00:45.309> so<00:00:45.430> simple<00:00:45.670> that<00:00:45.820> when<00:00:46.239> I<00:00:46.269> made<00:00:46.539> it<00:00:46.719> I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
it's so simple that when I made it I

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.439 
it's so simple that when I made it I
went<00:00:47.530> on<00:00:47.679> youtube<00:00:48.070> search<00:00:48.609> if<00:00:48.850> anyone<00:00:49.269> had

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
went on youtube search if anyone had

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.990 
went on youtube search if anyone had
made<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:49.780> before<00:00:49.929> because<00:00:50.679> the<00:00:50.920> system<00:00:51.609> even

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
made it before because the system even

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.349 
made it before because the system even
works<00:00:52.239> on<00:00:52.480> 1.3<00:00:53.170> but<00:00:54.129> for<00:00:54.609> some<00:00:54.760> reason<00:00:55.120> no<00:00:55.239> one

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
works on 1.3 but for some reason no one

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.459 
works on 1.3 but for some reason no one
has<00:00:55.570> made<00:00:55.780> it<00:00:55.960> yet<00:00:56.170> and<00:00:56.859> yeah<00:00:57.690> now<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:59.260> way<00:00:59.410> it

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
has made it yet and yeah now the way it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.369 
has made it yet and yeah now the way it
works<00:00:59.769> is<00:01:00.010> very<00:01:00.100> simple<00:01:00.309> it<00:01:00.879> uses<00:01:01.269> two<00:01:01.690> buds<00:01:01.960> so

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
works is very simple it uses two buds so

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.439 
works is very simple it uses two buds so
the<00:01:02.739> first<00:01:02.949> one<00:01:03.100> being<00:01:03.339> disbarred<00:01:03.850> way<00:01:04.150> right

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the first one being disbarred way right

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.900 
the first one being disbarred way right

Minecraft station on the minecart track

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.680 
Minecraft station on the minecart track
and<00:01:32.740> then<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.460> going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.730> reset<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.150> system<00:01:34.300> so

and then is going to reset the system so

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.590 
and then is going to reset the system so
the<00:01:34.930> producer<00:01:35.680> document<00:01:36.130> now<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.760> system<00:01:37.360> has

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
the producer document now the system has

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.750 
the producer document now the system has
one<00:01:37.810> big<00:01:38.050> flow<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.560> if<00:01:39.100> you<00:01:39.250> don't<00:01:39.460> leave<00:01:39.580> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
one big flow that if you don't leave the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.430 
one big flow that if you don't leave the
mine<00:01:39.910> cart<00:01:40.120> when<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.420> are<00:01:40.690> right<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.080> station

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
mine cart when you are right the station

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.610 
mine cart when you are right the station
this<00:01:41.770> is<00:01:41.920> going<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.190> happen<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.870> I<00:01:43.870> didn't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
this is going to happen and I didn't

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.550 
this is going to happen and I didn't
like<00:01:44.800> that<00:01:45.010> at<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.420> what<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.810> what<00:01:47.380> I've

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
like that at all so what I what I've

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.770 
like that at all so what I what I've
done<00:01:47.800> is<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.220> replace<00:01:48.940> these<00:01:49.120> two<00:01:49.360> rails

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
done is just replace these two rails

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.860 
done is just replace these two rails
right<00:01:49.990> here<00:01:50.200> we<00:01:50.620> detector<00:01:51.160> rails<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.870> then

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
right here we detector rails and then

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.250 
right here we detector rails and then
I'm<00:01:53.310> when<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.430> renew<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.630> part<00:01:55.840> up<00:01:55.960> from<00:01:56.140> the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
I'm when you renew the part up from the

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.570 
I'm when you renew the part up from the
station<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.650> going<00:01:56.830> to<00:01:56.950> be<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.190> same<00:01:57.340> thing

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
station is going to be the same thing

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.940 
station is going to be the same thing
but<00:01:58.030> when<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.540> arrive<00:01:58.870> at<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.080> station<00:01:59.140> it's

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
but when you arrive at the station it's

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.370 
but when you arrive at the station it's
going<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.550> open<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.300> hole<00:02:01.480> for<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.810> it's

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
going to open the hole for you it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.930 
going to open the hole for you it's
going<00:02:02.590> to<00:02:02.740> start<00:02:02.980> the<00:02:03.070> minecart<00:02:03.460> make<00:02:03.730> you

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
going to start the minecart make you

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.090 
going to start the minecart make you
live<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.330> Minecraft<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:04.960> then<00:02:05.590> reset

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
live the Minecraft and then reset

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.940 
live the Minecraft and then reset
everything<00:02:06.460> which<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.090> pretty<00:02:07.300> cool<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:08.530> then

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
everything which is pretty cool so then

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.589 
everything which is pretty cool so then
you<00:02:09.099> can<00:02:09.250> just<00:02:09.489> use<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.789> minecart<00:02:10.119> station<00:02:10.450> is

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
you can just use the minecart station is

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.360 
you can just use the minecart station is
going<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.959> reset<00:02:11.319> everything<00:02:11.440> as<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.950> say<00:02:12.160> and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
going to reset everything as I say and

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.160 
going to reset everything as I say and
you<00:02:13.269> know<00:02:13.660> let's<00:02:14.349> just<00:02:14.410> go<00:02:14.650> with<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.830> red<00:02:15.010> song

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you know let's just go with the red song

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.470 
you know let's just go with the red song
now<00:02:17.170> let's<00:02:17.680> concede<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.310> redstone<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.880> just<00:02:19.330> a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
now let's concede the redstone is just a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.480 
now let's concede the redstone is just a
little<00:02:19.720> bit<00:02:19.840> more<00:02:20.050> complicated<00:02:20.380> than<00:02:20.950> the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
little bit more complicated than the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.740 
little bit more complicated than the
first<00:02:21.730> design

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
first design

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.980 
first design
celebrate<00:02:23.200> not<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:23.590> much<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.990> English's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
celebrate not so much but English's

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.050 
celebrate not so much but English's
that's<00:02:26.680> just<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.010> show<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.370> working<00:02:27.850> because

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that's just so show it working because

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.310 
that's just so show it working because
it's<00:02:28.690> rigo<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:31.270> as<00:02:31.600> you<00:02:31.690> can<00:02:31.750> see<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.110> way<00:02:32.260> it

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
it's rigo so as you can see the way it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.490 
it's rigo so as you can see the way it
works<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:34.180> minecart<00:02:34.690> arrives<00:02:35.140> at<00:02:35.350> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
works is when a minecart arrives at the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.290 
works is when a minecart arrives at the
station<00:02:35.860> it's<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.550> open<00:02:36.730> this<00:02:36.910> whole

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
station it's going to open this whole

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.260 
station it's going to open this whole
the<00:02:37.810> slot<00:02:38.230> right<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:38.590> so<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.700> minecart<00:02:40.090> can

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
the slot right here so the minecart can

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.470 
the slot right here so the minecart can
fall<00:02:40.600> over<00:02:40.930> here<00:02:41.140> into<00:02:41.650> an<00:02:42.160> activator<00:02:43.150> rail

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
fall over here into an activator rail

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.140 
fall over here into an activator rail
and<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:44.680> activator<00:02:45.100> rail<00:02:45.400> will<00:02:45.640> be<00:02:45.850> part

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
and this activator rail will be part

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.460 
and this activator rail will be part
enough<00:02:46.540> for<00:02:47.500> long<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.910> long<00:02:48.970> enough<00:02:49.480> so<00:02:49.810> the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
enough for long for long enough so the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.500 
enough for long for long enough so the
player<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.160> be<00:02:51.220> ejected<00:02:51.820> from<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.120> mine<00:02:52.270> cart

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
player can be ejected from the mine cart

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.710 
player can be ejected from the mine cart
in<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.870> floor<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:54.250> then<00:02:55.060> it's<00:02:55.390> going<00:02:55.600> to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
in the floor and then it's going to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
in the floor and then it's going to
reset<00:02:56.380> the<00:02:56.500> system<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.100> it's<00:02:57.280> going<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:57.580> make

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
reset the system so it's going to make

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.510 
reset the system so it's going to make
everything<00:02:58.060> flush<00:02:58.390> again<00:02:58.660> now<00:02:59.470> when<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.250> is

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
everything flush again now when it is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.090 
everything flush again now when it is
doing<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.120> is<00:03:01.330> also<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.900> this<00:03:02.860> paste

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
doing that is also going to this paste

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.800 
doing that is also going to this paste
on<00:03:03.190> right<00:03:03.370> ear<00:03:03.580> is<00:03:03.790> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.120> push<00:03:04.300> a<00:03:04.330> minecart

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
on right ear is going to push a minecart

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.500 
on right ear is going to push a minecart
they<00:03:05.260> previous<00:03:05.650> one<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.220> they<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:07.180> one<00:03:07.360> that

was<00:03:07.750> previously<00:03:08.170> here<00:03:08.920> into<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:10.060> cactus<00:03:10.330> and

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
was previously here into this cactus and

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.840 
was previously here into this cactus and
it's<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.380> to<00:03:11.530> go<00:03:11.650> through<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.310> man<00:03:12.580> card

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
it's going to go through this man card

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.660 
it's going to go through this man card
Hoppus<00:03:13.300> into<00:03:14.050> a<00:03:14.080> night<00:03:14.530> elevator<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.370> you<00:03:15.520> can

Hoppus into a night elevator and you can

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.820 
Hoppus into a night elevator and you can
use<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.850> to<00:03:16.209> heaven<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:16.570> over<00:03:17.140> here<00:03:17.350> which

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
use it to heaven just over here which

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.670 
use it to heaven just over here which
are<00:03:18.040> mine<00:03:18.430> carts<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.989> sort<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.380> kills

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
are mine carts now that sort of kills

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.550 
are mine carts now that sort of kills
the<00:03:20.890> purpose<00:03:21.459> of<00:03:21.610> being<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.870> the

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
the purpose of being so and the

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.100 
the purpose of being so and the
distinction<00:03:24.489> being<00:03:24.730> seamless<00:03:25.150> so<00:03:25.690> if<00:03:25.989> you

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
distinction being seamless so if you

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.770 
distinction being seamless so if you
want<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.380> can<00:03:26.530> just<00:03:26.590> make<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.330> big<00:03:28.330> d<00:03:28.450> hoppers

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
want you can just make the big d hoppers

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.960 
want you can just make the big d hoppers
going<00:03:29.110> at<00:03:29.320> another<00:03:29.650> direction<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.430> move

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
going at another direction and move

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.420 
going at another direction and move
these<00:03:31.150> chests<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.110> another<00:03:32.470> direction<00:03:32.799> at

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
these chests to another direction at

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.120 
these chests to another direction at
another<00:03:33.790> location<00:03:34.150> sorry<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.900> it<00:03:35.860> would<00:03:35.980> be

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
another location sorry and it would be

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.990 
another location sorry and it would be
just<00:03:36.310> fine<00:03:36.450> but<00:03:37.450> yeah<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.260> i<00:03:38.950> don't<00:03:39.580> think<00:03:39.670> i'm

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
just fine but yeah and i don't think i'm

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.759 
just fine but yeah and i don't think i'm
going<00:03:40.150> to<00:03:40.360> be<00:03:40.510> doing<00:03:40.900> a<00:03:41.110> tutorial<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.530> this

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
going to be doing a tutorial for this

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.440 
going to be doing a tutorial for this
design<00:03:42.310> because<00:03:42.340> it's<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.090> little<00:03:43.360> bit

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
design because it's a little bit

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.020 
design because it's a little bit
complicated<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.650> it<00:03:45.160> has<00:03:45.370> some<00:03:45.610> very<00:03:45.850> very

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
complicated but it has some very very

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.870 
complicated but it has some very very
nice<00:03:46.330> systems<00:03:46.900> and<00:03:47.140> i<00:03:47.860> use<00:03:48.250> some<00:03:48.459> very<00:03:48.730> nice
