00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.640 
there's one two three four five six
seven<00:04:35.660> eight<00:04:36.050> all<00:04:37.420> down<00:04:38.420> the<00:04:38.600> sides<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.440> then

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
seven eight all down the sides and then

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.290 
seven eight all down the sides and then
there's<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.160> toe<00:04:40.430> spike<00:04:40.820> uh<00:04:41.290> I<00:04:43.120> don't<00:04:44.120> know

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:44.300 
there's the toe spike uh I don't know

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.710 
there's the toe spike uh I don't know
what<00:04:44.840> it<00:04:44.960> does<00:04:45.820> specifically<00:04:46.820> but<00:04:47.510> it's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
what it does specifically but it's

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.950 
what it does specifically but it's
pretty<00:04:48.020> cool<00:04:48.260> um<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:49.070> use<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.790> pretty<00:04:50.480> sure<00:04:50.750> I

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
pretty cool um I use it pretty sure I

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.690 
pretty cool um I use it pretty sure I
don't<00:04:51.260> use<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.650> because<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:52.010> can't<00:04:52.040> like<00:04:52.490> take

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
don't use it because you can't like take

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.970 
don't use it because you can't like take

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
it off or use it for anything but I use

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.020 
it off or use it for anything but I use
them<00:04:56.320> it<00:04:57.320> works<00:04:57.590> really<00:04:57.740> well<00:04:57.980> you<00:04:58.400> can<00:04:58.910> get

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.470 
them it works really well you can get
nice<00:04:59.210> up<00:04:59.920> that<00:05:00.920> says<00:05:01.160> it's<00:05:01.400> get<00:05:01.850> fast<00:05:02.150> you're

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
nice up that says it's get fast you're

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.410 
nice up that says it's get fast you're
supposed<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.780> get<00:05:02.930> faster<00:05:03.320> with<00:05:03.440> these<00:05:03.680> but<00:05:04.550> um

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420 
supposed to get faster with these but um

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.220 
supposed to get faster with these but um
I<00:05:06.190> like<00:05:07.190> that<00:05:07.430> because<00:05:07.820> it's<00:05:08.390> you're<00:05:08.780> able<00:05:09.080> to

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.580 
dig in and like when you plant you're
going<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.550> plant<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.270> then<00:05:14.480> push<00:05:14.810> off<00:05:15.080> with

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
going to plant and then push off with

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.980 
going to plant and then push off with
using<00:05:16.040> that<00:05:16.190> some<00:05:16.970> some<00:05:17.330> please<00:05:17.540> don't<00:05:17.810> have

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
and then geez my bad on the inside here

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.200 
and then geez my bad on the inside here
there's<00:05:28.960> four<00:05:29.960> more<00:05:30.200> spikes<00:05:30.650> on<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.790> nike

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
there's four more spikes on the nike

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.520 
there's four more spikes on the nike
propulsion<00:05:33.190> system<00:05:34.190> that<00:05:34.700> runs<00:05:34.940> on<00:05:35.350> more<00:05:36.350> than

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
propulsion system that runs on more than

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.100 
propulsion system that runs on more than
half<00:05:36.740> way<00:05:37.070> way<00:05:37.400> more<00:05:37.430> than<00:05:37.790> half<00:05:37.910> way<00:05:38.150> all<00:05:38.780> the

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
half way way more than half way all the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.160 
half way way more than half way all the
way<00:05:39.140> down<00:05:39.410> that's<00:05:39.680> a<00:05:39.770> carbon<00:05:40.990> something<00:05:41.990> I

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
way down that's a carbon something I

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.240 
way down that's a carbon something I
don't<00:05:42.980> know<00:05:44.230> specifically<00:05:45.230> it's<00:05:45.470> very<00:05:45.710> stiff

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
don't know specifically it's very stiff

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.670 
don't know specifically it's very stiff
even<00:05:46.700> after<00:05:46.910> all<00:05:47.360> this<00:05:47.720> use<00:05:48.020> I've<00:05:48.230> put<00:05:48.530> into

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
even after all this use I've put into

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:54.190 
even after all this use I've put into
these<00:05:48.920> are<00:05:50.170> so<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:52.520> works<00:05:52.850> I<00:05:53.270> guess<00:05:53.510> if<00:05:53.960> it's

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200 
these are so it works I guess if it's

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.870 
these are so it works I guess if it's
supposed<00:05:54.560> to<00:05:54.710> say<00:05:54.890> stiff<00:05:55.280> I<00:05:55.490> don't<00:05:55.670> really

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
supposed to say stiff I don't really

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.350 
supposed to say stiff I don't really
know<00:05:56.210> um<00:05:59.950> what<00:06:00.950> else

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 
know um what else

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.110 
know um what else
I<00:06:04.719> mean<00:06:05.719> I<00:06:06.110> know<00:06:06.650> not<00:06:07.430> a<00:06:07.460> lot<00:06:07.520> of<00:06:07.669> cleats<00:06:07.939> can

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
I mean I know not a lot of cleats can

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.959 
I mean I know not a lot of cleats can
get<00:06:08.300> custom<00:06:08.840> but<00:06:09.050> I<00:06:09.080> know<00:06:09.199> you<00:06:09.349> can<00:06:09.860> with<00:06:10.430> the

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
get custom but I know you can with the

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.490 
get custom but I know you can with the
nike<00:06:11.629> vapor<00:06:11.810> carbon<00:06:12.199> but<00:06:13.180> I<00:06:14.319> think<00:06:15.319> these<00:06:15.439> are

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
nike vapor carbon but I think these are

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.010 
nike vapor carbon but I think these are
like<00:06:15.800> 90<00:06:16.129> bucks<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.729> know<00:06:16.759> a<00:06:17.150> little<00:06:17.750> up<00:06:17.990> there

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
like 90 bucks you know a little up there

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.959 
like 90 bucks you know a little up there
for<00:06:18.409> cleats<00:06:18.680> kind<00:06:19.490> of<00:06:19.729> uh<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:21.370> really<00:06:22.370> like

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
for cleats kind of uh I really like

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.869 
for cleats kind of uh I really like
these<00:06:23.180> guys<00:06:23.509> I'm<00:06:24.110> sorry<00:06:24.379> I'm<00:06:24.710> I'm<00:06:25.129> I<00:06:25.520> don't
