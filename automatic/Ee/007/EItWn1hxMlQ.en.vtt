00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.509
 middle of corrals 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.000
 you must first prepare the material 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.090
 necessary for the construction of 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.030
 structure to catch the fish 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.759
 after placing the objects in the boat 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.640
 we started the trip to the place where 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.640
 happens fishing was necessary 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.590
 two nautical miles up to 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.930

 corrals are dozens of them made by 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.030
 groups of fishermen scattered 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.950
 several stretches of the ocean 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.900
 after going through some of them 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.910
 we arrive at the place where a 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.310
 work will you do now 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.200
 convincing the first step is shaving 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.360
 we can find for coping is the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.290
 time to get into the water and start 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 job 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.350
 the depth here reaches a meter and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.110
 medium 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.810
 the corral assembly is completely 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.270
 the marking of the place where the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.200
 be constructed the structure is made of 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.050
 immediate 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.180
 then the cuttings are placed and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.580
 tied to nets 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.220
 A few minutes without breathing are 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.820
 necessary to ensure good with 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.400
 raul 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.150
 after a few hours the structure is 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.220
 ready 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.290
 then you're all set now all 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.700
 assembled structure what is done 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.910
 How does it work? 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.580
 We wait for the tide to go down and the 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.489
 reputation the network has a good team right 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.100
 fish on the low bank sina and raise it 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.350
 must prove that the fish are not the 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.500
 only to fall into the trap 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.170
 this turtle was easily captured 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.330
 but the fishermen to respect the 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.209
 animal and release it 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.170
 minutes later the aia is also 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.350
 rolled up 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.780
 but soon it is put aside and guaxa is 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.100
 displayed as a trophy in the hands of this 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.890
 fisherman 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.080
 however the raul invaders are 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.870
 easily forgotten 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.300
 The goal here is the fish that the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.860
 few get stuck in the nets 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.860
 seduced by the brand 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.880
 after four hours of work the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.830
 fishermen will bring the result into 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.070
 fishing for the city 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.080
 there the fish will be marketed 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.200
 the value obtained from the sale of fish 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.110
 can reach one thousand reais per week in 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.500
 periods considered favorable for 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.500
 fishing
