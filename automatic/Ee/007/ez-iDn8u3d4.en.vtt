okay well this seems like a no-brainer
but<00:00:03.389> you<00:00:03.899> should<00:00:04.470> know<00:00:04.920> how<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.160> do<00:00:05.400> it<00:00:05.580> if

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
but you should know how to do it if

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.089 
but you should know how to do it if
you're<00:00:06.509> gonna<00:00:06.660> run<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> studio<00:00:07.470> if<00:00:07.950> you're

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
gonna be a musician you need to know how

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.690 
gonna be a musician you need to know how
to<00:00:10.349> wrap<00:00:10.590> cables<00:00:11.269> so<00:00:12.269> on<00:00:13.080> on<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> floor<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.610> a

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700

pile first take the female and that's

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250 
pile first take the female and that's
the<00:00:19.859> end<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.400> holes<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:20.939> if<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.840> an

the end with the holes in it if it's an

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.439 
the end with the holes in it if it's an

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
XLR cable it's an instrument cable it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.140 
XLR cable it's an instrument cable it
doesn't<00:00:24.750> matter<00:00:25.250> place<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.580> your<00:00:26.789> left

doesn't matter place it in your left
hand<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.039> suppose<00:00:29.039> your<00:00:29.460> right<00:00:29.699> hand<00:00:29.910> if

hand or I suppose your right hand if

hand or I suppose your right hand if
you're<00:00:30.390> one<00:00:31.349> of<00:00:31.470> those<00:00:31.560> folk<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:33.140> make<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.410> 8<00:00:34.980> or

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
you're one of those folk and make a 8 or

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
you're one of those folk and make a 8 or
10<00:00:35.520> inch<00:00:35.760> loop<00:00:36.030> if<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> long<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.380> long

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
10 inch loop if it's a long really long

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
10 inch loop if it's a long really long
cable<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.190> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> loop<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.180> little

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
cable you want to make the loop a little

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.260 
cable you want to make the loop a little
bit<00:00:39.510> bigger<00:00:39.750> but<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.710> average<00:00:40.860> cable<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.090> can

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
bit bigger but the average cable it can

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
bit bigger but the average cable it can
be<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.809> big<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.379> then<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.340> start

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
be about this big and then you start

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.690 
be about this big and then you start
feeding<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.480> cable<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.280> twisting<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.460> your

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
feeding the cable and twisting with your

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.450 
feeding the cable and twisting with your
other<00:00:47.850> hand<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> does<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.980> allows

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
other hand and what this does is allows

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.500 
other hand and what this does is allows
the<00:00:52.039> loop<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.250> go<00:00:53.370> nicely<00:00:53.969> into<00:00:54.239> your<00:00:54.270> other

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
the loop to go nicely into your other

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.950 
the loop to go nicely into your other
hand<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.160> twist<00:00:56.430> left<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> then

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
hand and if you twist left and you then

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
hand and if you twist left and you then
you<00:00:58.109> twist<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> right<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> then<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.399> twist

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
you twist the right and then you twist

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.869 
you twist the right and then you twist
to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.030> left<00:01:00.270> when<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:00.989> undo<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> cable<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
to the left when you undo the cable the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.899 
to the left when you undo the cable the
twisting<00:01:03.390> cancels<00:01:03.899> itself<00:01:04.080> out<00:01:04.530> I<00:01:05.010> like<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
twisting cancels itself out I like that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.960 
twisting cancels itself out I like that
trick<00:01:06.740> some<00:01:07.740> people<00:01:08.040> don't<00:01:08.280> like<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
trick some people don't like to do that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.750 
trick some people don't like to do that
but<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.479> like<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.170> twist<00:01:10.409> left<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.220> twist<00:01:11.520> right

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
but I like to twist left and twist right

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.410 
but I like to twist left and twist right
and<00:01:12.119> then<00:01:12.750> twist<00:01:13.080> left<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:14.000> you're<00:01:15.000> left<00:01:15.180> with

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and then twist left and you're left with

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.249 
and then twist left and you're left with
a<00:01:15.450> little<00:01:15.750> bit<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.110> end<00:01:17.900> some<00:01:18.900> people

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
a little bit at the end some people

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.530 
a little bit at the end some people
would<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:20.100> cable<00:01:20.759> ties<00:01:21.090> little

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
would like to have cable ties little

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
would like to have cable ties little
pieces<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.869> string<00:01:22.229> or<00:01:22.500> velcro<00:01:22.890> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.280> end

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
pieces of string or velcro on the end

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.730 
pieces of string or velcro on the end
and<00:01:23.670> they<00:01:23.790> can<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.180> wrap<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.470> this

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
and they can just wrap it up like this

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.429 
and they can just wrap it up like this
and<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.090> don't<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.259> can

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and if you don't have that what you can

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.560 
and if you don't have that what you can
do<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:29.270> go<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.810> hole<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.880> then<00:01:32.880> leave

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
do is go through the hole and then leave

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
do is go through the hole and then leave
a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.869> loop<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.500> pull<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> connector

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
a little loop and pull the connector

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
a little loop and pull the connector
through<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.180> loop<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.630> make<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.530> knot

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
through the loop and make a little knot

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.539 
through the loop and make a little knot
and<00:01:39.049> you<00:01:40.049> don't<00:01:40.200> pull<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.590> knot<00:01:40.740> super<00:01:41.310> hard

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and you don't pull the knot super hard

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.340 
and you don't pull the knot super hard
but<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.119> hard<00:01:42.329> enough<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.750> hold<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.140> cable

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
but just hard enough to hold the cable

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.100 
but just hard enough to hold the cable
when<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.939> rolling<00:01:44.939> around<00:01:45.210> inside<00:01:45.540> your<00:01:45.869> bag

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
when it's rolling around inside your bag

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.660 
when it's rolling around inside your bag
or<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.920> hook<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> on<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.430> wall<00:01:47.640> or

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
or you can hook it on the wall or

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.749 
or you can hook it on the wall or
whatever<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.530> good<00:01:49.799> enough<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.399> hold

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
whatever it's just good enough to hold

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.109 
whatever it's just good enough to hold
it<00:01:50.939> together<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.640> years<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
it together and in all my years of

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.420 
it together and in all my years of
recording<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.979> seen

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
recording you have I have not seen

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.630 
recording you have I have not seen
cables<00:01:56.969> fail<00:01:57.680> from<00:01:58.680> using<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> method

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
cables fail from using this method

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.550 
cables fail from using this method
usually<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.360> fail<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.930> fail<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.409> at

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
usually if they fail they fail right at
