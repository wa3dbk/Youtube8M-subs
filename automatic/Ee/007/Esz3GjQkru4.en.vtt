00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.490
 interview to whom the doctor dispatch 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.049
 for it really was a privilege and what 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.179
 I really say a privilege because I do not 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.419
 I could lose neither a little nor a 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.790
 word because everything was interesting this 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.970
 occurred within the framework of the 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.360

 he turned to holistic medicine 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.840
 integrative medicine to medicine that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.840
 speaks of a body and a mind like the 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.890
 power of the mind over the body and 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.180
 From there, we talk about how 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.810

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.240

 in taking good medication we're going to 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.550

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.570

 facts of the negative regulation of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.230
 well the interesting thing is that once 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.630
 You can control sugar cholesterol 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.950
 in blood do exercises do diets 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.810
 but what can not be controlled 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.550
 really are the thoughts the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.710
 negative emotions and those are more 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.780
 harmful that maybe 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.690
 to be fatter or to be with a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.120
 little bit of high cholesterol there are many 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.710
 factors that we can 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.230
 control them but these thoughts 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.180
 these negative emotions are 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.830
 uncontrollable and already only the fact 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:21.270
 of wanting to control is a thought and 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:23.510
 then we go to the second and third 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.510
