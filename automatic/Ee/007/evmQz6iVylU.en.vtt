00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.960
 hello welcome on geek sounds like 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.030
 for unpacking the first blackberry 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.600
 10 the z10 that has just been 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.980
 announced today around the world 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.080
 we have here the box that makes a box 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.000
 quite awesome compared to what we 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.160
 knows in the market when we remove 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.020
 the overpack therefore sends the model 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.539
 marked wholesale on this box very very 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.359
 sober and then when we open so we 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.980
 discover the phone we see it's 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.140
 a fairly conventional design for a 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.360
 fully tactile phone very very 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.340
 hungry we notice there are just the keys 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.620
 volume then the unlock keys 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.809
 above but we will come back to it later 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.149
 in a comfort test ensures on ixen 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.890
 as inside the box 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.750
 it must be said that it is a box 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.059
 we had today when 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.610
 the announced of this raid 10 so this is 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.379
 not necessarily the box that will be 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.200
 marketed in all markets at 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.890
 inside the box we find so 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.080
 a cover for the phone on 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:09.850
 also finds micro one 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.509
 headset the usb connection 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 the micro usb cable a cloth for 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:20.619
 clean the phone and finally the 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:25.179
 1800 milliamp battery obviously 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.830
 we have all the guides for better 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.810
 understand to better understand the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.340
 phone before starting the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.740
 phone we will quickly look at 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.890
 the back we see the camera and the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.020
 flash a slot for the SD card 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.509
 the location for the asim and 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.789
 the location for for the battery the 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:53.110
 homeland so she does 1800 millan loses 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:55.080
 so we close the phone we go 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.459
 watch quickly during lighting 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.800
 on the side so the volume keys 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.599
 on top the blocking key of the 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.580
 phone 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:07.569
 the location for the headphone jack for 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.899
 the headphones on the side so a microphone hdmi 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:13.360
 and micro usb and below so the top 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.510
 external speaker that just sit there in 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.670
 facade so we see it here 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.920
 the location for the diode 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.709
 his blackberry audio lips a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.670
 location for the front camera the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.950
 brightness sensor 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.560
 the speaker when we go from 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.670
 calls and in their not here but just 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.670
 under the screen the microphone 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.170
 the first start is relatively 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.450
 fast we see it much faster 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.959
 than what we have known in the past with 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.300
 blackberry 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.470
 there is a gauge around the logo that we 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.209
 lets see the progress of 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.519
 installing the operating system 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.940
 obviously my card and at rogers so 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.090
 quickly send the animation of the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:10.410
 the operator chose his language his 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:12.590
 men those who have already started a 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.099
 playbook actually will be pretty familiar 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.019
 with with this start there because we have 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.670
 just the need to put his finger on 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.160
 the left to go from one screen to 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:30.079
 the other one we will quickly pass on 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:33.840
 the faulty ear detects the contract 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.379
 France we connect to his blackberry 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.379
 said 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.860
 so we connect to his blackberry a 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.739
 says we can enable the location and 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.330
 diagnostics of the phone 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.239
 phone will then look for the setting 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:58.900
 up to date if there is a new version of 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:04:03.209
 the bone and so we can move on to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.209
 configuration according to its network 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.470
 the configuration completed for the 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.170
 new network hop we pass a new 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.720
 screen that will allow us to actually 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.370
 see the different movements that are 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.810
 related to phones this is a tutorial 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.810
 that we can not pass 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.760
 so it helps to become familiar with 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.130
 all the part gestures that is 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.479
 new on blackberry 10 which 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.039
 will also remember some things when 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.120
 even to those who have a common playbook 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.479
 so he actually explains to us the whole 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.570
 edge and sensory which allow this 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.090
 which brings back news 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.270
 phone features 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.490
 compensation to the left we will discover 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.190
 that for an application the edge 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:55.330
 top of the screen will display 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:58.919
 more options like here for example 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 make an emergency call 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.250
 he then explains to us that for 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.130
 leave a good app it takes 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:12.690
 touch the application the bottom edge 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.690
 and slide your finger up 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.500
 now just realize the last 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:44.050
 movement and hop one arrives on his screen 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.620
 welcome that allows us to see 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.960
 on the blackberry hub side that is 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.039
 where we are going to centralize all 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.840
 this information for that it takes 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:57.370
 add accounts and on the right 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.509
 in fact we see all the applications 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.270
 installed so in this case for 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:03.490
 rodgers there are already some facilities 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.889
 installed applications but otherwise we 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:08.320
 find facebook twitter linkedin on 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:12.250
 voice control the weather a manager 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.680
 youtube files from acrobat games 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.880
 reader 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:23.110
 so all that we can configure here 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.570
 his blackberry hub by choosing to 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.949
 add accounts 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:29.470
 we will quickly see that we can 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.349
 also use this gestures there to see 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.479
 a little list of 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.780
 notifications so that was the 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:40.960
 first and launch the phone one in 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.460
 will do more videos on the test of 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.930
 phone on apps 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.130
 specific so we'll be back soon 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.130
