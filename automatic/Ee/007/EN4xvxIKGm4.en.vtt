in the day if you guys send a comment or
something<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:31.320> usually<00:01:31.470> read<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.979> and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
something I can usually read it and

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.399 
something I can usually read it and
respond<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.520> almost<00:01:33.000> immediately

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
respond to it almost immediately

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.840 
respond to it almost immediately
sometimes<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.770> take<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:35.070> longer<00:01:35.280> but

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
sometimes it can take me longer but

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.340 
sometimes it can take me longer but
that's<00:01:36.030> also<00:01:36.270> because<00:01:36.420> sometimes<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.140> wake<00:01:37.290> up

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
that's also because sometimes I wake up

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
that's also because sometimes I wake up
and<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.700> have<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.299> know<00:01:39.390> several<00:01:39.960> hundred

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
and I have you know several hundred

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.069 
and I have you know several hundred
comments<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.220> something<00:01:41.610> so<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.390> can't<00:01:42.930> always

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
comments or something so I can't always

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.810 
comments or something so I can't always
get<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.380> them<00:01:43.500> immediately<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.250> sometimes<00:01:44.640> I

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
get to them immediately but sometimes I

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.219 
get to them immediately but sometimes I
can<00:01:45.000> respond<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
can respond just like that and the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.870 
can respond just like that and the
reason<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.560> do<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:47.670> actually

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
reason I do that is because I'm actually

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.730 
reason I do that is because I'm actually
watching<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.540> come<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.439> have<00:01:49.619> to

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
watching it come in you also have to

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
watching it come in you also have to
excuse<00:01:50.100> my<00:01:50.220> voice<00:01:50.399> being<00:01:50.640> really<00:01:50.939> low<00:01:51.149> I

meth<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> night<00:03:29.160> today<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.030> it<00:03:30.600> looks<00:03:30.840> like

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
meth a night today and it looks like

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.920 
meth a night today and it looks like
instead<00:03:31.709> of<00:03:31.890> doing<00:03:32.280> two<00:03:32.670> like<00:03:33.450> twelve<00:03:33.810> or

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
instead of doing two like twelve or

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.120 
instead of doing two like twelve or
fifteen<00:03:33.989> minute<00:03:34.470> episodes<00:03:34.800> we're<00:03:34.980> probably

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
fifteen minute episodes we're probably

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.560 
fifteen minute episodes we're probably
just<00:03:35.310> gonna<00:03:35.550> do<00:03:35.700> another<00:03:35.940> thirty<00:03:36.269> minute

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
just gonna do another thirty minute

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.750 
just gonna do another thirty minute
episode<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.680> doesn't<00:03:37.950> lend<00:03:38.100> itself<00:03:38.430> well<00:03:38.550> to

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
episode it doesn't lend itself well to

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.930 
episode it doesn't lend itself well to
doing<00:03:39.590> two<00:03:40.590> episodes<00:03:40.980> because<00:03:41.190> revenge<00:03:41.790> may

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
doing two episodes because revenge may

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.729 
doing two episodes because revenge may
the<00:03:42.030> night<00:03:42.180> is<00:03:42.300> timed<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.050> we<00:03:43.320> don't<00:03:43.500> want<00:03:43.650> to

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
the night is timed and we don't want to

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.560 
the night is timed and we don't want to
run<00:03:43.830> out<00:03:43.920> of<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.070> time<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.700> we're<00:03:45.420> probably

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
run out of the time so we're probably

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.050 
run out of the time so we're probably
just<00:03:45.900> going<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.560> do<00:03:46.709> one<00:03:47.010> long<00:03:47.250> episode<00:03:47.850> for

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
just going to do one long episode for

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.520 
just going to do one long episode for
that<00:03:51.739> triple<00:03:52.739> cheese<00:03:52.980> action<00:03:54.350> after<00:03:55.350> dinner

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
that triple cheese action after dinner

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.620 
that triple cheese action after dinner
we<00:03:55.709> recorded<00:03:56.220> yet<00:03:56.489> another<00:03:56.850> episode<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.269> kirby

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
we recorded yet another episode of kirby

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.509 
we recorded yet another episode of kirby
superstar<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.200> have<00:03:58.230> recorded<00:03:58.709> six<00:03:59.040> episodes

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
superstar we have recorded six episodes

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.460 
superstar we have recorded six episodes
and<00:03:59.910> we<00:04:00.000> finished<00:04:00.390> revenge<00:04:00.750> meta<00:04:01.050> night<00:04:01.230> in

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
and we finished revenge meta night in

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.800 
and we finished revenge meta night in
one<00:04:02.100> episode<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:03.000> I<00:04:03.209> was<00:04:03.360> pretty<00:04:03.480> happy<00:04:03.720> about

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
one episode so I was pretty happy about

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.330 
one episode so I was pretty happy about
that<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.230> did<00:04:04.350> it<00:04:04.470> in<00:04:04.560> under<00:04:04.709> thirty<00:04:05.010> minutes

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
that we did it in under thirty minutes

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.740 
that we did it in under thirty minutes
which<00:04:05.459> was<00:04:05.610> good<00:04:05.700> I<00:04:05.760> think<00:04:05.910> it<00:04:06.060> took<00:04:06.120> about<00:04:06.180> 28

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
which was good I think it took about 28

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.289 
which was good I think it took about 28
so<00:04:07.380> it's<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.680> long<00:04:07.860> episode<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.970> know<00:04:09.090> it

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
so it's a long episode but you know it

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.670 
so it's a long episode but you know it
just<00:04:09.420> felt<00:04:09.600> kind<00:04:09.720> of<00:04:09.870> weird<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.260> split<00:04:10.470> that<00:04:10.620> up

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
just felt kind of weird to split that up

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.190 
just felt kind of weird to split that up
so<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.400> done<00:04:11.580> and<00:04:11.850> now<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.330> have<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:12.900> move<00:04:13.019> on

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
so it is done and now we have to move on

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.140 
so it is done and now we have to move on
to<00:04:13.350> Milky<00:04:13.620> Way<00:04:13.739> wishes<00:04:14.100> I'm<00:04:14.459> not<00:04:14.880> really<00:04:14.970> sure

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
how long it's gonna take I'm suspecting

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.070 
how long it's gonna take I'm suspecting
it's<00:04:17.459> gonna<00:04:17.609> take<00:04:17.910> three<00:04:18.299> episodes<00:04:18.750> but

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
it's gonna take three episodes but

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.479 
it's gonna take three episodes but
they'll<00:04:19.380> know<00:04:19.650> maybe<00:04:19.890> we<00:04:19.950> could<00:04:20.100> crank<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.430> out

they'll know maybe we could crank it out

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.370 
they'll know maybe we could crank it out
in<00:04:20.640> two

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
in two

Kong Country and in my opinion this

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.720 
Kong Country and in my opinion this

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
feels a lot like Donkey Kong Country

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:42.160 
feels a lot like Donkey Kong Country

portal and then after portal we have to
move<00:04:49.040> on<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.370> some<00:04:49.970> other<00:04:50.210> co-op<00:04:50.870> game<00:04:51.410> there's

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
move on to some other co-op game there's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.400 
move on to some other co-op game there's
a<00:04:51.740> lot<00:04:51.950> on<00:04:52.190> the<00:04:52.460> list<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:52.910> do<00:04:53.120> I'm<00:04:54.110> not<00:04:54.170> really

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
a lot on the list to do I'm not really

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.290 
a lot on the list to do I'm not really
sure<00:04:54.620> what<00:04:54.860> we're<00:04:55.010> going<00:04:55.280> to<00:04:55.490> jump<00:04:55.850> into<00:04:56.000> I

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
sure what we're going to jump into I

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.940 
sure what we're going to jump into I
guess<00:04:56.540> it'll<00:04:56.810> really<00:04:57.110> be<00:04:57.440> dependent<00:04:57.920> upon

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
guess it'll really be dependent upon

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:58.990 
guess it'll really be dependent upon
what<00:04:58.340> we<00:04:58.430> feel<00:04:58.580> like

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
what we feel like

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.070

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
anyway that's actually going to be it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.630
