00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 the channel is to see and follow the delivery of 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.490
 educational tablets you more this 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
 new tool for network teacher 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 federal district public 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.560
 I have here my pleasure 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.990
 talk a little bit now with the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.019
 professor pedro demo who is a defender 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.910
 tool that has made a long and 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.219
 nice story in nbb and will tell 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.230
 people a little bit now because you 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.600
 is a defender of a tool like this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.420
 in teacher 's classroom handbook 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 and look first has an argument of fact 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.460
 consummate is that the internet computer 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.590
 invaded our lives completely 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 children, I do not need to do anything else 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.570
 today in the world without internet computer 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 so soon the school that can not stay 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.680
 out now has to be in this move 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.899
 We are in great need of the 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.300
 participation of the teacher's teacher 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.160
 which also the tool being ambiguous 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.110
 like all things on the internet in the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.210
 computer needs care 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.970
 there are risks as well and there are 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 opportunities in my greater defense is 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.000
 because what we call the web 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.229
 2.0 focused on content generation 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.689
 promotes very own authorship and today 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.000
 day learning is placed very 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.060
 along with good learning authorship 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 makes the student author and we need in 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.729
 around an author teacher so that 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.790
 the author student and the entire tool 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.060
 serves first of all to foster this 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.460
 idea write text make text text 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.640
 multimodal not make the printed but 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.470
 there with audio with video animation and photo 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.460
 that's what I get a lot more text 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.500
 enriched 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.200
 but the basics is that we have this 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.219
 tool is for the class is to exhibit 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.780
 not to reproduce is to exercise the 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.549
 student's authorship 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.240
 we realize that nowadays by 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.399
 example, this generation is mainly 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.170
 adolescents who were born in the 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.450
 The whole process has a very 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.790
 of this tool tool 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.959
 only for pedagogical purposes already dominates 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.569
 the tool 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.550
 but the teacher who will now pick up 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.260
 this tool to use it from this 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 generation that no longer has as much 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.810
 so how are you going to establish this 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.880
 dialogue between these two generations and looks 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.380
 What we have to learn in this 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.840
 All the history that we missed too. 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.330
 enough is that the first inclusion 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.459
 digital and teacher 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.370
 the teacher needs to learn to learn 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.390
 the computer internet because it never was 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.430
 a deal from him 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.900
 we always learn differently 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.930
 even because we can learn 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.640
 Well, that's fine, but how? 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.440
 invaded everything so we also have to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.209
 bring this to learning 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.329
 so it is very important that the teacher 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.360
 receive long courses but four 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:01.209
 hybrid months already mixing face-to-face 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.060
 or virtual for doing texts 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.099
 multimodal carat can 3d 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.599
 bring this into the classroom 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.610
 then it will not rival the 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.410
 boys - are always ahead of us and 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.859
 This is not the case but it will power 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.630
 guide to be able to evaluate and 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:19.209
 this be together with the boys 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.470
 that is, that the students also begin to 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.350
 teachers are 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.060
 evolving in this process and it is there 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.370
 future then means next in the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.680
 It's true, we will have teachers and 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.200
 students with this tool and there 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.970
 how can these tools ultimately 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.700
 work together for this education 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.560
 of the future well look we can then 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.180
 profound change in pedagogy in the 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.340
 followed by not just being 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.980
 reviewing resume transmitting things 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.250
 of others but moving the school in 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.220
 the development of pupils in a 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.410
 digital platform in these elaborations 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.480
 your main evaluation base 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.819
 they can be asked digitally 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.730
 because the whole platform allows this and 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.010
 the teacher then participates in a standing 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.870
 equality within this claim that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.870
 transform this tool that can be 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.750
 used for n things that are used to 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.579
 strictly pedagogical purposes to leave and 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.290
 caring for the teacher who has no way 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.269
 can mark this simply not 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.850
 the students need some care 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.769
 is not just to close 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.169
 so this school then we are 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.479
 idealizing it would be precisely the school 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.210
 who will try to bring the side let's say 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.310
 unite the playful with the pedagogical 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.740
 why we realize that 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 school they sometimes frighten student 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.570
 insofar as it is associated with that 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.300
 process of cognitive suffering there 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.280
 day to day and the tool can then be 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.110
 that it will bring a more 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.030
 nice so that the student has 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.740
 more pleasure and the teacher has more 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.990
 pleasure to be in the school environment 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.150
 today you can expect that the tools 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.870
 can be more playful next 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.759
 edition 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.699
 we have a good history of video games 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:59.229
 good that music considers as the 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:00.910
 better learning environments than 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:02.860
 we have today it is very difficult to 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.840
 school has another tradition. 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.000
 but we can expect something 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.800
 in this sense now the principal also 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.330
 it 's not to be imagining that we're going 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.789
 make things easier 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.190
 shorten things such as the 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:16.810
 140 touch twitter text is very 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.789
 small and can not settle for it 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.580
 the school has to make long texts 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.380
 do longer readings to know 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.110
 search the internet and not only 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.750
 plagiarize and all this depends on 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.370
 first place of a good formation 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.750
 teacher I do not have to take care first 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.789
 a lot of the teacher 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.169
 The great challenge is not even the student who 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.090
 he ran out 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.800
 The big challenge is that we are staying 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.840
 a little behind we are from another 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.479
 I have difficulty dealing with 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.539
 these contraptions then we have to 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.550
 putting ourselves at their height is not much 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.409
 Thank you for the interview and we're going to cheer. 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.580
 so that in fact this tool comes 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.780
 contribute a lot to education 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.349
 Brazilian 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.349
 thank you teacher
