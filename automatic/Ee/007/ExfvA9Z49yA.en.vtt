hey guys so today we have an awesome
concept<00:00:02.460> here<00:00:02.939> our<00:00:03.179> galaxy<00:00:03.810> note<00:00:04.020> 4<00:00:04.490> and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
concept here our galaxy note 4 and

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.880 
concept here our galaxy note 4 and
next-generation<00:00:06.240> galaxy<00:00:06.960> note<00:00:07.109> device<00:00:07.470> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
next-generation galaxy note device and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.220 
next-generation galaxy note device and
this<00:00:08.340> is<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.490> pretty<00:00:08.700> cool<00:00:09.090> concept<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:09.990> from

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
this is a pretty cool concept here from

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.730 
this is a pretty cool concept here from
evil<00:00:10.769> morich<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.259> i'm<00:00:13.259> not<00:00:13.380> sure<00:00:13.440> if<00:00:13.620> i'm

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
evil morich and i'm not sure if i'm

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.670 
evil morich and i'm not sure if i'm
pronouncing<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.340> correct<00:00:14.670> but<00:00:14.849> hey<00:00:15.230> so<00:00:16.230> this

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
pronouncing that correct but hey so this

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
pronouncing that correct but hey so this
is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> very<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.460> cool<00:00:17.699> concept<00:00:18.180> because<00:00:18.480> it

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
is a very very cool concept because it

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.960 
is a very very cool concept because it
actually<00:00:19.020> looks<00:00:19.470> pretty<00:00:19.800> real<00:00:20.279> like

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
actually looks pretty real like

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
actually looks pretty real like
realistic<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:22.050> what<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.949> actually<00:00:23.160> would<00:00:23.550> be

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
realistic to what we actually would be

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.779 
realistic to what we actually would be
able<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.570> because<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.769> feature<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.550> a

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
able to see because this feature is a

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.300 
able to see because this feature is a
lot<00:00:26.970> of<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.150> same<00:00:27.390> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.990> design<00:00:28.680> aspects

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
lot of the same kind of design aspects

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.299 
lot of the same kind of design aspects
that<00:00:29.460> we<00:00:29.910> can<00:00:30.150> see<00:00:30.510> in<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.320> galaxy's<00:00:31.740> 5<00:00:31.980> which

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
that we can see in the galaxy's 5 which

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880 
that we can see in the galaxy's 5 which
is<00:00:32.340> first<00:00:32.759> off<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.210> water<00:00:33.510> resistant<00:00:34.380> design

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
is first off a water resistant design

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.610 
is first off a water resistant design
and<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> dust<00:00:35.640> resistant<00:00:36.180> design<00:00:36.590> with<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
and a dust resistant design with a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.100 
and a dust resistant design with a
little<00:00:37.950> bit<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.460> good<00:00:38.820> thing<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.809> need

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
little bit of is good thing and you need

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.560 
little bit of is good thing and you need
to<00:00:40.230> remove<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.680> charge<00:00:41.010> your<00:00:41.129> device<00:00:41.450> as<00:00:42.450> you

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
to remove to charge your device as you

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.529 
to remove to charge your device as you
can<00:00:42.629> see<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.500> bottom<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.309> flap<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
can see at the bottom like a flap and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.270 
can see at the bottom like a flap and
then<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> also<00:00:46.500> speak<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.160> on

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
then you can see you also speak it on

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.610 
then you can see you also speak it on
the<00:00:47.430> left<00:00:47.550> side<00:00:47.910> at<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.690> bottom<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.230> the

can<00:00:51.629> also<00:00:51.750> see<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.230> S<00:00:52.410> Pen<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> also<00:00:53.610> see

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
can also see the S Pen you can also see

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.299 
can also see the S Pen you can also see
any<00:00:53.969> features<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.309> durable

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
any features and kind of more durable

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
any features and kind of more durable
back<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.910> they're<00:00:57.149> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> like<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> same

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
back that they're kind of like the same

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.700 
back that they're kind of like the same
as<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> galaxy<00:00:58.500> s5s<00:00:58.890> back<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> has<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> heart

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
as the galaxy s5s back it has a heart

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
as the galaxy s5s back it has a heart
rate<00:01:01.920> sensor<00:01:02.390> but<00:01:03.390> some<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> more<00:01:03.809> cool

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
rate sensor but some of the more cool

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.399 
rate sensor but some of the more cool
things<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:06.030> whole<00:01:06.330> kind<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
things is that the this whole kind of it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
things is that the this whole kind of it
has<00:01:07.590> like<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.830> metal<00:01:08.340> design<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.900> looks<00:01:10.049> pretty

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
has like a metal design it looks pretty

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
has like a metal design it looks pretty
thick<00:01:10.500> eight<00:01:11.010> point<00:01:11.220> three<00:01:11.280> millimeters<00:01:12.030> it

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
thick eight point three millimeters it

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.289 
thick eight point three millimeters it
has<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> quad<00:01:13.380> HD<00:01:13.799> display<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:15.030> curves

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
has a quad HD display with some curves

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.940 
has a quad HD display with some curves
their<00:01:15.540> own<00:01:15.689> besides<00:01:16.080> how<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.530> seven<00:01:16.799> inch

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
their own besides how about seven inch

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.670 
their own besides how about seven inch
still<00:01:17.280> but<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> little<00:01:18.540> bit<00:01:18.659> smaller<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.439> this

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
still but a little bit smaller in this

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.130 
still but a little bit smaller in this
little<00:01:19.950> concept<00:01:20.540> compared<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.930> we

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
little concept compared to what we

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.960 
little concept compared to what we
actually<00:01:22.470> might<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.729> looks<00:01:23.909> very

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
actually might see but it looks very

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.859 
actually might see but it looks very
very<00:01:24.689> cool<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.979> looks<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.400> premium<00:01:27.240> actually

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
very cool it looks very premium actually

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530 
very cool it looks very premium actually
I<00:01:27.900> think<00:01:27.990> when<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.880> when<00:01:29.880> they<00:01:30.060> have<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
I think when they when they have like a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.719 
I think when they when they have like a
curved<00:01:31.020> design<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> sides<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.610> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
curved design on on the sides of the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.390 
curved design on on the sides of the
phone<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.210> especially<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:34.950> metal

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
phone but especially that kind of metal

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
phone but especially that kind of metal
material<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.299> waterproof<00:01:36.840> we're<00:01:37.170> into

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
material and a waterproof we're into

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770 
material and a waterproof we're into
that<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.159> would<00:01:38.310> actually<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:39.150> something

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that that would actually put something

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.210 
that that would actually put something
to<00:01:40.579> feel<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:42.270> something<00:01:42.780> very<00:01:43.140> premium<00:01:43.680> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
to feel like something very premium and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.219 
to feel like something very premium and
exclusive<00:01:44.909> it<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.479> actually<00:01:45.600> make<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
exclusive it would actually make the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.770 
exclusive it would actually make the
Galaxy<00:01:46.710> Note<00:01:46.740> devices<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.820> galaxy<00:01:48.180> s<00:01:48.270> devices

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
Galaxy Note devices and galaxy s devices

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.710 
Galaxy Note devices and galaxy s devices
right<00:01:48.930> now<00:01:49.140> feel<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> joke<00:01:50.399> because<00:01:51.390> this

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
right now feel like a joke because this

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
right now feel like a joke because this
is<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.140> some<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.530> stuff<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
is really some good stuff here and you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.370 
is really some good stuff here and you
can<00:01:53.820> also<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.509> compared<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.350> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
galaxy note 3 and you can see is how

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.120 
galaxy note 3 and you can see is how
much<00:01:58.140> cold<00:01:58.530> shines<00:01:59.040> on<00:02:00.000> sides<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:01.409> not<00:02:01.860> as

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
much cold shines on sides it's not as

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.999 
much cold shines on sides it's not as
high<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.649> smaller<00:02:04.649> there

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
high it's a little bit smaller there

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.480 
high it's a little bit smaller there
which<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> very<00:02:06.630> very<00:02:06.960> cool<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:08.250> I

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
which is a very very cool and if I

7inch and around five five and six inch
that<00:02:12.600> could<00:02:12.720> actually<00:02:12.810> be<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> optimal<00:02:13.620> maybe

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that could actually be the optimal maybe

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.670 
that could actually be the optimal maybe
size<00:02:14.190> for<00:02:14.490> phones<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:17.390> it's<00:02:18.390> prettier<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.350> can

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
size for phones and it's prettier I can

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
size for phones and it's prettier I can
never<00:02:19.830> see<00:02:20.070> how<00:02:20.190> they<00:02:20.340> can<00:02:20.550> improve<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.300> even

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
never see how they can improve this even

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.960 
never see how they can improve this even
more<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.780> future<00:02:21.990> with<00:02:22.980> even<00:02:23.460> more<00:02:23.610> like<00:02:23.850> an

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
more in future with even more like an

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.830 
more in future with even more like an
edge<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.120> edge<00:02:24.420> design<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:26.180> then<00:02:27.180> it<00:02:27.570> also

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
edge to edge design and then it also

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.720 
edge to edge design and then it also
features<00:02:28.260> like<00:02:28.500> probably<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:29.040> fingerprint

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
features like probably the fingerprint

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.080 
features like probably the fingerprint
scanner<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.450> home<00:02:30.600> button<00:02:30.630> same<00:02:31.200> as<00:02:31.350> yeah

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
scanner and the home button same as yeah

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.500 
scanner and the home button same as yeah
as<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.470> galaxy<00:02:34.920> s5<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.250> doing<00:02:35.610> so<00:02:36.030> that

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
as the the galaxy s5 is doing so that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.260 
as the the galaxy s5 is doing so that
definitely<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:37.380> pretty<00:02:37.860> nice<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:39.090> do<00:02:39.210> you

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
definitely is pretty nice so what do you

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.720 
definitely is pretty nice so what do you
think<00:02:39.480> about<00:02:39.540> this<00:02:39.690> concept<00:02:40.640> hopefully<00:02:41.640> all

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
think about this concept hopefully all

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.030 
think about this concept hopefully all
the<00:02:41.940> speaker<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.570> way<00:02:42.900> louder<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.620> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
the speaker is way louder and the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.800 
the speaker is way louder and the
current<00:02:44.430> versions<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.120> house<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.450> super

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
current versions the house I super

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.140 
current versions the house I super
amoled<00:02:46.230> display<00:02:46.650> in<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.800> flow<00:02:47.070> concept<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
amoled display in the flow concept I

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.810 
amoled display in the flow concept I
think<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.020> one<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.380> most<00:02:49.890> epic<00:02:50.190> concepts

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
think it's one of the most epic concepts

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.570 
think it's one of the most epic concepts
for<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.420> galaxy<00:02:52.110> knows<00:02:52.260> for<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:52.800> have<00:02:53.400> ever

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
for a galaxy knows for that I have ever

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.300 
for a galaxy knows for that I have ever
seen<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.900> it's<00:02:55.140> pretty<00:02:55.260> cool<00:02:55.530> if<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.950> can<00:02:56.130> see

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
seen so it's pretty cool if I can see

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.940 
seen so it's pretty cool if I can see
like<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.490> galaxy<00:02:56.940> note<00:02:57.120> 4<00:02:57.420> T<00:02:57.720> its<00:02:58.260> kind<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.500> IFA

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
like a galaxy note 4 T its kind of IFA

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.230 
like a galaxy note 4 T its kind of IFA
