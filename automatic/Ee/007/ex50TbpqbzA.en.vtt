into the meat of the show the gist was

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.759 
into the meat of the show the gist was
that<00:00:24.000> there's<00:00:24.210> this<00:00:24.390> war<00:00:24.720> between<00:00:25.140> humans<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
that there's this war between humans and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830 
that there's this war between humans and
demons<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.460> let's<00:00:26.939> just<00:00:27.000> say<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.240> humanity

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
demons and let's just say that humanity

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.779 
demons and let's just say that humanity
wasn't<00:00:28.170> doing<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.410> well<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.490> until

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
wasn't doing very well that was until

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
wasn't doing very well that was until
you<00:00:30.179> had<00:00:30.390> these<00:00:30.599> heroes<00:00:30.990> come<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.650> they

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
you had these heroes come in and they

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.319 
you had these heroes come in and they
pretty<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.610> turned<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.090> tide<00:00:33.300> on

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
pretty much turned the tide on

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.360 
pretty much turned the tide on
everything<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.829> introduced<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.309> our

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
everything and we get introduced to our

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.150 
everything and we get introduced to our
main<00:00:35.579> characters<00:00:36.059> Satan<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.840> LCL<00:00:37.559> or<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> think

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
main characters Satan and LCL or I think

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.590

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
get interested when it sets up its world

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.680 
get interested when it sets up its world
its<00:02:57.810> characters<00:02:58.290> etc<00:02:58.680> etc<00:02:59.010> etc<00:02:59.250> but<00:03:00.150> then<00:03:00.329> just

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
its characters etc etc etc but then just

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.569 
its characters etc etc etc but then just
gets<00:03:01.019> old<00:03:01.170> after<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.560> while<00:03:01.709> or<00:03:02.010> just

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
gets old after a while or just

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:04.309 
gets old after a while or just
completely<00:03:02.940> throws<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.510> lot<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.840> things<00:03:04.140> out

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
completely throws a lot of things out

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.140 
completely throws a lot of things out
the<00:03:04.590> window<00:03:04.890> so<00:03:05.310> I'm<00:03:05.430> expecting<00:03:05.670> this<00:03:06.000> to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
the window so I'm expecting this to

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.789 
the window so I'm expecting this to
happen<00:03:06.180> but<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.989> same<00:03:07.140> time<00:03:07.319> I<00:03:07.379> hope<00:03:07.650> it

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
happen but at the same time I hope it

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:08.960 
happen but at the same time I hope it
doesn't<00:03:08.129> because<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.430> has<00:03:08.579> the<00:03:08.700> potential

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
doesn't because this has the potential

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.750 
doesn't because this has the potential
of<00:03:09.209> being<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.780> very<00:03:10.019> fun<00:03:10.290> anime<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.190> all<00:03:11.519> in<00:03:11.670> all

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
of being a very fun anime so all in all
