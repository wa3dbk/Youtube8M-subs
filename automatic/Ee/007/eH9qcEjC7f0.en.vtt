00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
like 23 years old so I already found my

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.450 
like 23 years old so I already found my
passion<00:02:00.150> at<00:02:01.150> a<00:02:01.210> very<00:02:01.420> early<00:02:01.600> stage<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.680> when<00:02:03.430> I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
passion at a very early stage and when I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.880 
passion at a very early stage and when I
