 at 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.789
 and 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.010
 because the outside exchanges of 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.980
 Algeria without contradiction 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.629
 recording a decrease of 11 % in 2013 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.690
 because exports have increased 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.750
 of 7% it has become more than necessary 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.800
 that the country to orient itself goes the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.420
 diversification of its economy into 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.579
 export 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.260
 hydrocarbons the safex has housed 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.420
 today the launch of a twinning 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.909
 which will be set up by a consortium 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.219
 consisting of the ubifrance of the 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.940
 economic development cooperation 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.949
 Austrian 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.899
 the purpose of this twinning is to 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.600
 strengthen the skills of managers 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.159
 algex in the fields of trade 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.170
 external trade policy and 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.270
 in the accompaniment of companies 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.909
 exporting twinning project 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.220
 currently being implemented has for 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
 goal just the less than two draws 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.420
 to ex means and tools him 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.890
 to respond quickly and 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.409
 effective way to this request 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.450
 we hope by the end of this 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.209
 project see the national agency of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.619
 foreign trade promotion algex 

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:35.780
 equipped with all technical means 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.369
 and methodological that would allow him 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.830
 to rise to the level of organisms 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.479
 similar at the regional level that this 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.670
 in terms of quality of services 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.679
 provided to companies or in their 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.869
 international accompaniment on 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.869
 government under instruction of the chief of 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.619
 the state and then the decision yesterday from 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.420
 decriminalize the act of management 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.250
 a courageous decision that can only 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.019
 builds trust and boost 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.179
 the economy 

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:03.830
 it is true that we are lagging behind 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.229
 I'm sure we revisions to fill 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.569
 on the tag Algeria today ahead 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.040
 we have the means to become through 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:15.319
 a competitive and diverse economy 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.840
 an emerging country even the feminine is 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.269
 made but yesterday again 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.280
 decriminalize the act of management is a 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.140
 most encouraging decision for the 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 economic engine financed by the union 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.500
 European level in support of the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.989
 implementation of the Association Agreement 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.540
 the twinning will be implemented by a 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.380
 consortium made up of France and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.410
 Austria for us there 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.200
 remains the leading exporting country 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:44.060
 the Maghreb trade relations 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.870
 between the two countries are well developed 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.750
 our preparation 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.720
 here for sim not the launch of the game 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.430
 the coward we do today 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.470
 with our Algerian partners and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.870
 European 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.410
 this hair not loose on a very matter 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.070
 important that calculates the 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.510
 export diversification 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:08.130
 Algerians legrand necessarily 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.300
 operational abilities of luck 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.100
 alex will contribute to this goal 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.920
 this twinning comes as a result of a 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.440
 bilateral cooperation and 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.320
 fruitful between miss france and algex le 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.840
 project that we are launching today 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.520
 allows thanks to the European Union and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.530
 thanks to the European instrument of 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.960
 twinning to strengthen this 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.420
 collaboration give him another 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.240
 dimension and put it in a frame 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.070
 broader multilateral 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.380
 thanks to which algex will benefit during 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.110
 24 months in addition to the appraised 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.600
 of unanimously recognized salt ubifrance 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.700
 from his Austrian counterpart 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.370
 austria and the Walloon agency 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.690
 promotion of exploitation with this 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.730
 of this meeting the different 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.290
 stakeholders in implementation of 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.330
 the association agreement with the union 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.130
 European opening of new 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.500
 markets in the great Arab zone of 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.180
 free exchange and negotiations for 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.040
 the accession of Algeria to the organization 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
 world trade 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.600
 this program that has become part of the program 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.490
 flagship of cooperation between the union 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.459
 European Union and Algeria is already in its 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.739
 third phase of implementation 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.970
 it has allowed us so far 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.489
 successfully launch twenty or so 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.680
 twinning in Algeria in the fields 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:26.110
 as diverse 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.450
 this confirms the growing interest of the 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.470
 share of the public administration 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.400
 Algerian for this tool at a time 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.830
 flexible is close to the field 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.200
 the partners of this twinning have all 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.390
 advocated for the accompaniment of 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.400
 Algerian exporting companies 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.550
 we have the advantage of having a market 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.870
 that's a bit of our strength 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.060
 unlike our neighbors whether it's 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:52.720
 Tunisians or Moroccans or whatever it is 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.750
 that we also have a consumer 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.400
 require so I think these deaths of 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.070
 strengths for us it's points 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.300
 who can only give us a little 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.400
 of strength and give us a little bit of 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.510
 booster and boosted to improve the 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.120
 quality we have mechanisms 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:08.650
 putting on the stage got established but 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.110
 is that the first is slowness a 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.910
 little bit of that as an operator 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.440
 suffers what the operators suffer 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.390
 the slowness for example such as for 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.480
 transport reimbursements for 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:21.790
 that a little support to the export for 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.250
 exhibitions at the exhibition 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.110
 international so while elsewhere 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:28.690
 it is done that is practice so I think 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.610
 that if we get to a little bit to enjoy 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.720
 experiences from big countries such as 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.130
 I announced the numbers just now 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.020
 that even if France is the sixth 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.250
 global exporter 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.870
 austria is still the pound to 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.700
 export 135 billion dollars 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.200
 so I think that today we we 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:44.710
 a billion and a half of dral is when 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.120
 even to mean for a country such as 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.540
 the dgi still if the largest country 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.669
 africa 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.620
 so I think borrowers are 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.820
 there and are ready it only takes them 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.320
 support assist 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.610
 guide them gave it a little 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.230
 training try to communicate 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.760
 together 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:00.590
 optimization by stakeholders 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.930
 in the new ambassador of austria 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.180
 was quickly defeated by the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.430
 President of the National Association of 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.870
 Algerian exporters European 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.220
 protects its market in particular 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.730
 agricultural products and had consumed 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:15.350
 so the European Union is defending itself by 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.250
 example we can not export 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.600
 so meats drifts and 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.890
 charcuterie violence can not 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.260
 export mine can not 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.880
 export the milk the derivatives so and at 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.290
 high for me I have everything because 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.520
 the European Union demands that we put 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.590
 place a monitoring plan for 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.240
 residues north since the implementation of 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.460
 the association agreement since 2005 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.930
 nothing has been done it's been nine years nothing 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.210
 was not done to overcome this obstacle 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.310
 for the European Union to defend itself against 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.980
 Slots agriculture agribusiness 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.060
 by additional rights 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.920
 so they told you not rights to 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.390
 customs but put aside rights I 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.580
 for example, the case of sugar where 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.050
 there is 120% black rights right 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.780
 additional which is excessive 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.370
 we do not have a superior right 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.440
 at 30% 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.270
 remember that this twinning was intended 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.980
 at first eastern country 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.740
 especially those who were candidates 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.900
 for the cession of the european union 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.180
 before being expanded to others in 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:12.040
 algeria the duration of this important 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.040
 twinning and 18 months 

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:29.670
