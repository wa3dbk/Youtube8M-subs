00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 First type in the Reichert plates on the paper 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.430
 For example, write the number Homann on the sheet and say so 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.830

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.240
 Here we go 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.190
 right in the road 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.190
 Next to the number 1, write the number 2 and say 2 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.120
 then selectively write the number 2 and say she said Immelt 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.750
 so that's how 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 gives percent 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.260
