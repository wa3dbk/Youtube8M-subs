00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
something new for the judges to maybe

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.230 
something new for the judges to maybe
give<00:00:18.930> him<00:00:19.020> a<00:00:19.050> few<00:00:19.230> extra<00:00:19.350> points<00:00:19.970> well<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.000> think

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
give him a few extra points well I think

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.939 
give him a few extra points well I think
at<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.750> point<00:00:21.869> what<00:00:22.260> will<00:00:22.350> see<00:00:22.529> from<00:00:22.710> Bobby

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
at this point what will see from Bobby

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.740 
at this point what will see from Bobby
is<00:00:23.220> probably<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.910> similar<00:00:24.269> run<00:00:24.600> if

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
is probably a really similar run if

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.929 
is probably a really similar run if
anything<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.830> he<00:00:26.099> might<00:00:26.340> maybe

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
anything I think that he might maybe

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.900 
anything I think that he might maybe
just<00:00:27.720> try<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.830> lock<00:00:29.070> down<00:00:29.429> his<00:00:29.640> rail

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

different<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.479> was<00:01:51.600> adding<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:51.990> 180<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.649> the

different he was adding the 180 on the
end<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.070> he<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.790> got<00:01:54.299> pretty<00:01:55.020> heavy<00:01:55.229> into

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

end so he really got pretty heavy into
the<00:01:55.710> spin<00:01:56.040> right<00:01:56.399> off<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.880> get-go<00:01:57.180> having<00:01:58.020> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
the spin right off the get-go having to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.740 
the spin right off the get-go having to
fight<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.710> around<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.250> flip<00:01:59.700> in<00:01:59.969> that

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fight that around the flip in that

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.080 
fight that around the flip in that
aspect<00:02:01.170> maybe<00:02:01.710> over-rotated<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.670> little<00:02:02.939> bit

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
aspect maybe over-rotated a little bit

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
aspect maybe over-rotated a little bit
it's<00:02:03.240> always<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> flip<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.780> spin<00:02:04.140> combination

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it's always a flip and spin combination

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.459 
it's always a flip and spin combination
that<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.250> see<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.850> flip<00:02:06.060> aspect<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.990> kind<00:02:07.409> of

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
that you see the flip aspect was kind of

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.520 
that you see the flip aspect was kind of
a<00:02:07.649> little<00:02:08.160> bit<00:02:08.670> heavy<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.539> him<00:02:09.929> there<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.379> the
