00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.930
 because this course basically consists of 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.030
 provide students with knowledge 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.090
 Practical theorists on the application 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.670
 of light in the realization of the 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.829
 Video photography 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.660
 It consists of two very differentiated blocks 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.750
 practical theoretical four hours each 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:49.659
 one where we first learn to 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.589
 know the type of light the effects that 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.699
 produce the contrasts the volumes and 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.269
 control it to take pictures 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.269
 creative 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.909
 the second block we introduce 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.680
 basically in the flash light thanks 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 to health control we can give 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.580
 expressiveness emotivity and sensations 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.470
 a photograph that until now 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.470
 we could do without health control 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.930
 when buying it is when I found out that 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.640
 by buying me that camera model in 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.640
 concrete because he had a free course 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 in which for so much free time what 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 I'm dedicating to photography say 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.630
 I try hard to see what others do and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.520
 share experiences good very 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.409
 grateful 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.179
 but I'm having a great time 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.679
 I recommend it to all an experience that 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.679
 it is very nice a pleasant surprise 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.880
 and I think the interesting thing is also with 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.590
 what you share the relationships that you 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.820
 they have already given us the means the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.400
 people that we have worked the plastic 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.400
 together 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.470
 I have this problem because what 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.500
 you solve and this relationship I think that 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.450
 enriches a lot in addition to the place 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.060
 environment that has been a past power 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.060
 be in this terrace that we have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.989
 with both the camera and I have a 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.819
 printer here is not me who does the 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.160
 process the control is my result what 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.690
 which enjoyed from beginning to end even 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.980
 with my mistakes of the 'shirts so 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.980
 what is photography
