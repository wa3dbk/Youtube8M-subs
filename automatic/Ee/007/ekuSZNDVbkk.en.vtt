Shanghai but all the other roofs now I

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.420 
Shanghai but all the other roofs now I
know<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.700> range<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:02.070> other<00:02:02.219> cool

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
know the range to and the other cool
thing<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.700> I'm<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.420> sure<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.899> know<00:02:04.020> this

thing is I'm not sure if you know this

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
thing is I'm not sure if you know this
this<00:02:04.469> little<00:02:05.460> device<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:06.210> acts<00:02:06.659> as<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.439> infrared

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
this little device it acts as a infrared

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.650 
this little device it acts as a infrared
IR<00:02:09.060> scope<00:02:09.390> so

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
IR scope so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.480 
IR scope so
you<00:02:10.720> know<00:02:10.840> what<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.560> instantly<00:02:12.100> tells<00:02:12.370> you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
you know what it instantly tells you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.320 
you know what it instantly tells you
where<00:02:12.610> someone's<00:02:12.910> that<00:02:13.000> you<00:02:13.090> really<00:02:13.270> don't

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
where someone's that you really don't

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.780 
where someone's that you really don't
even<00:02:13.450> have<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.780> put<00:02:13.930> any<00:02:14.110> effort<00:02:14.350> into<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:15.040> it's

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
even have to put any effort into it it's

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.020 
even have to put any effort into it it's
literally<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.930> easy<00:02:17.260> so<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.640> range<00:02:18.820> earlier

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
literally that easy so the range earlier

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.090 
literally that easy so the range earlier
was<00:02:19.360> just<00:02:19.630> under<00:02:19.840> 300<00:02:20.050> meters<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:20.890> what<00:02:21.010> you're

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
was just under 300 meters so what you're

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:22.080

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
ahead and adjust my scope to 14 x and

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.450 
ahead and adjust my scope to 14 x and
i'm<00:02:26.110> also<00:02:26.260> going<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.560> adjust<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.890> meter<00:02:27.160> on<00:02:27.310> my

gun<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:29.160> 300<00:02:30.160> meters<00:02:30.580> now<00:02:31.360> what<00:02:31.810> I<00:02:31.840> fell<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
gun to 300 meters now what I fell to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.160 
gun to 300 meters now what I fell to
realize<00:02:32.290> was<00:02:32.860> one<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:34.360> bullet<00:02:34.720> time<00:02:34.900> right

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
realize was one the bullet time right

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.620 
realize was one the bullet time right
now<00:02:35.200> like<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.770> takes<00:02:36.040> time<00:02:36.880> literally<00:02:37.360> from

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630
