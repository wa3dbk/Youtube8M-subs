00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
off with the animation system which I've

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.019 
off with the animation system which I've
been<00:00:16.470> redoing<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.279> week<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.699> preparation

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029

for the big upcoming combat system

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.730 
for the big upcoming combat system
update<00:00:20.930> unfortunately<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:21.960> haven't<00:00:22.410> changed

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740

any<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.340> actual<00:00:23.609> animations<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.840> they're

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
any of the actual animations so they're

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.859 
any of the actual animations so they're
still<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.590> bad<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.189> ever<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.269> now<00:00:27.599> have<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
still as bad as ever but I do now have a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.689 
still as bad as ever but I do now have a
few<00:00:28.140> more<00:00:28.260> features<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.099> animation

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
few more features in the animation

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.630 
few more features in the animation
system<00:00:30.470> firstly<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.740> old<00:00:32.070> system<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
system firstly in the old system the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
system firstly in the old system the
player<00:00:32.850> could<00:00:33.000> only<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.420> one<00:00:33.660> animation<00:00:34.140> at

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
player could only do one animation at

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.940 
player could only do one animation at
once

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
once

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.310 
once
so<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.700> could<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.210> running<00:00:36.570> animation<00:00:36.780> or

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
so it could do with running animation or

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
so it could do with running animation or
it<00:00:37.680> could<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:38.010> an<00:00:38.219> attack<00:00:38.550> animation<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.540> it

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it could do an attack animation but it

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.799 
it could do an attack animation but it
couldn't<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.170> both<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.739> once<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.450> week<00:00:42.629> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
couldn't do both at once so this week I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.450 
couldn't do both at once so this week I
changed<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.500> system<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.250> are<00:00:44.370> now

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
changed the system so that there are now

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.389 
changed the system so that there are now
two<00:00:44.489> different<00:00:45.059> types<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.840> animations

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
two different types of animations

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.889 
two different types of animations
movement<00:00:47.399> animations<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.180> running<00:00:48.629> walking

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
movement animations like running walking

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.040 
movement animations like running walking
jumping<00:00:49.530> turning<00:00:50.219> etc<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> also<00:00:51.510> action

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
jumping turning etc and also action

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.600 
jumping turning etc and also action
animations<00:00:52.710> which<00:00:52.980> are<00:00:53.250> basically

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
animations which are basically

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.420 
animations which are basically
everything<00:00:54.239> else<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:55.379> any<00:00:55.710> time<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.280> player

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
everything else at any time the player

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.610 
everything else at any time the player
can<00:00:56.789> now<00:00:56.910> carry<00:00:57.149> out<00:00:57.360> one<00:00:57.629> movement<00:00:57.960> animation

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
can now carry out one movement animation

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.580 
can now carry out one movement animation
and<00:00:58.770> also<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.730> action<00:01:00.300> animation<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:01.559> can

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
and also one action animation you can

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.260 
and also one action animation you can
still<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> movement<00:01:02.460> animations<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.120> their

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
still do movement animations on their

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.910 
still do movement animations on their
own<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> still<00:01:04.409> do<00:01:04.559> action

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
own and you can still do action

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
own and you can still do action
animations<00:01:05.400> on<00:01:05.580> their<00:01:05.970> own<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.900> also

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
animations on their own but you can also

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.710 
animations on their own but you can also
now<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.340> same<00:01:08.580> time<00:01:08.720> meaning

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
now do them at the same time meaning

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.320 
now do them at the same time meaning
that<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.080> player<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.560> move<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.100> attack<00:01:11.939> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
that the player can move and attack all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.920 
that the player can move and attack all
at<00:01:12.630> once<00:01:12.810> as<00:01:13.790> well<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.210> also<00:01:15.450> wanted<00:01:15.869> to

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
at once as well as that I also wanted to

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.810 
at once as well as that I also wanted to
add<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> feature<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> would<00:01:16.979> allow<00:01:17.220> any<00:01:17.520> bone

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
add a feature that would allow any bone

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.399 
add a feature that would allow any bone
in<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.090> model<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.689> an<00:01:18.840> extra<00:01:19.229> rotation

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
in the model to have an extra rotation

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.219 
in the model to have an extra rotation
added<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:21.270> I<00:01:21.299> could<00:01:21.450> program<00:01:22.020> any

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
added to it so that I could program any

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.289 
added to it so that I could program any
bone<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.680> face<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.159> any<00:01:23.490> direction<00:01:23.729> if

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
bone to face in any direction if

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.749 
bone to face in any direction if
necessary<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.009> I've<00:01:26.159> done<00:01:26.340> here

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
necessary and that's what I've done here

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.880 
necessary and that's what I've done here
allowing<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.630> control<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.380> top<00:01:28.560> half<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
allowing me to control the top half of

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
allowing me to control the top half of
the<00:01:29.040> players<00:01:29.250> body<00:01:29.549> with<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.030> mouse<00:01:30.270> no

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the players body with the mouse no

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.800 
the players body with the mouse no
matter<00:01:31.049> what<00:01:31.380> animation<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.220> doing<00:01:32.810> finally

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
matter what animation it's doing finally

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
matter what animation it's doing finally
I<00:01:33.960> also<00:01:34.110> realized<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:34.829> my<00:01:35.040> current<00:01:35.460> movement

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
I also realized that my current movement

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.120 
I also realized that my current movement
system<00:01:36.119> wouldn't<00:01:36.630> work<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:37.079> well<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.560> combat

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
system wouldn't work very well in combat

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.770 
system wouldn't work very well in combat
because<00:01:38.430> rotating<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> player<00:01:39.390> with<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
because rotating the player with the a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
because rotating the player with the a
and<00:01:40.170> D<00:01:40.229> keys<00:01:40.680> made<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> very<00:01:41.460> hard<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.939> aim

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and D keys made it very hard to aim

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.710 
and D keys made it very hard to aim
accurately<00:01:42.600> at<00:01:43.200> anything<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> programmed<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
accurately at anything so I programmed a

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.480 
accurately at anything so I programmed a
new<00:01:45.990> movement<00:01:46.290> system<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:46.920> now<00:01:47.070> uses<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
new movement system which now uses the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580

that I was just talking about comes into
use<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.549> allowed<00:02:05.820> me<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.240> rotate<00:02:06.420> the

use because it allowed me to rotate the
players<00:02:07.170> upper<00:02:07.560> body<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:08.250> always<00:02:08.550> face

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
players upper body to always face

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.479 
players upper body to always face
forward<00:02:09.300> despite<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> lower<00:02:10.440> body<00:02:10.709> facing<00:02:11.340> in

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
forward despite the lower body facing in

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.059 
forward despite the lower body facing in
a<00:02:11.610> different<00:02:12.000> direction<00:02:12.590> away<00:02:13.590> from<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
a different direction away from the

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.160 
a different direction away from the
animation<00:02:14.610> system<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.180> also<00:02:15.390> added<00:02:15.720> some<00:02:15.870> new

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
animation system I also added some new

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.589 
animation system I also added some new
features<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> world<00:02:17.129> editor<00:02:17.599> firstly

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
features to the world editor firstly

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.790 
features to the world editor firstly
you'll<00:02:18.810> see<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.140> I've<00:02:19.260> implemented

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
you'll see that I've implemented

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.160 
you'll see that I've implemented
different<00:02:20.430> categories<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.450> entities<00:02:21.900> tab

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
different categories in the entities tab

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.589 
different categories in the entities tab
making<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:22.980> much<00:02:23.190> easier<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.640> find<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.270> entity

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
making it much easier to find the entity

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:27.350 
making it much easier to find the entity
that<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.930> want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.319> place<00:02:26.000> secondly<00:02:27.000> I<00:02:27.150> also

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that you want to place secondly I also

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.510 
that you want to place secondly I also
made<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.810> possible<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.410> place<00:02:28.709> mobs<00:02:29.099> into

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
made it possible to now place mobs into

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.280 
made it possible to now place mobs into
the<00:02:29.610> world<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.660> would<00:02:30.780> place<00:02:30.989> any

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
the world just like you would place any

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.040 
the world just like you would place any
normal<00:02:31.769> entity<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.879> generates<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.480> text<00:02:33.870> file

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
normal entity this generates a text file

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.170 
normal entity this generates a text file
with<00:02:34.200> information<00:02:34.890> about<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.310> mobs<00:02:35.580> which<00:02:36.060> I

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
with information about the mobs which I

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.030 
with information about the mobs which I
can<00:02:36.330> then<00:02:36.480> give<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.900> server<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.560> read<00:02:37.769> and

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
can then give to the server to read and

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.100 
can then give to the server to read and
therefore<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.790> allows<00:02:38.910> the<00:02:39.269> server<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.780> spawn

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
therefore it allows the server to spawn

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.640 
therefore it allows the server to spawn
mobs<00:02:40.319> in<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.800> chosen<00:02:41.220> locations<00:02:41.940> as<00:02:42.560> well<00:02:43.560> as

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
mobs in the chosen locations as well as

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.800 
mobs in the chosen locations as well as
that<00:02:43.860> entities<00:02:44.430> now<00:02:44.640> have<00:02:44.940> a<00:02:45.150> Y<00:02:45.450> position

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
that entities now have a Y position

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.960 
that entities now have a Y position
slider<00:02:46.470> allowing<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.459> change<00:02:47.670> their

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
slider allowing you to change their

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.940 
slider allowing you to change their
height<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.480> world<00:02:48.690> there's<00:02:49.319> also<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> plane

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
height in the world there's also a plane

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.530 
height in the world there's also a plane
placement<00:02:50.670> option<00:02:50.970> which<00:02:51.120> allows<00:02:51.150> you<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
placement option which allows you to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.270 
placement option which allows you to
choose<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.930> height<00:02:52.230> for<00:02:52.440> all<00:02:52.590> entities<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.160> be

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
choose a height for all entities to be

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280 
choose a height for all entities to be
placed<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.790> instead<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.450> them<00:02:54.660> automatically

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
placed on instead of them automatically

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.280 
placed on instead of them automatically
being<00:02:55.620> placed<00:02:55.920> onto<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> terrain<00:02:56.640> and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
being placed onto the terrain and

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.140 
being placed onto the terrain and
finally<00:02:58.290> there's<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.830> randomized<00:02:59.459> rotation

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
finally there's a randomized rotation

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.610 
finally there's a randomized rotation
option<00:03:00.510> which<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.110> good<00:03:01.260> for<00:03:01.470> when<00:03:01.590> you're

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
option which is good for when you're

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.619 
option which is good for when you're
placing<00:03:01.950> plants<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.730> trees<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.450> don't

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
placing plants and trees and you don't

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.520 
placing plants and trees and you don't
want<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.900> have<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.200> manually<00:03:04.620> rotate<00:03:04.920> each<00:03:05.489> one

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
want to have to manually rotate each one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.470 
want to have to manually rotate each one

we just went past the one with the fire
we're<00:04:43.780> just<00:04:43.900> going<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.050> take<00:04:44.230> a<00:04:44.260> left<00:04:44.530> here

there which was also added in this week

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.650 
there which was also added in this week
and<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.950> think<00:04:51.160> if<00:04:51.280> we<00:04:51.430> follow<00:04:51.760> this<00:04:51.970> path<00:04:52.390> or

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
and I think if we follow this path or

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.060 
and I think if we follow this path or
you<00:04:52.750> up<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.110> top<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:53.500> should<00:04:53.800> lead<00:04:54.040> us

you up to the top it should lead us

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.850 
you up to the top it should lead us
straight<00:04:54.880> back<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.420> the<00:04:55.540> town<00:04:55.780> center<00:04:56.350> just<00:04:56.680> in
