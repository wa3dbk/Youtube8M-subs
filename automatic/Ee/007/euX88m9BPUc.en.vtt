power them this time I went straight to
Tesser<00:03:03.620> racks<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.359> so<00:03:05.359> I've<00:03:05.420> got<00:03:05.569> two<00:03:05.750> tests

Tesser racks and so I've got two tests

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:07.809 
Tesser racks and so I've got two tests
racks<00:03:06.290> at<00:03:06.439> home<00:03:06.590> base<00:03:06.769> and<00:03:07.040> one<00:03:07.310> on<00:03:07.639> each

quarry<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:11.170> I'm<00:03:12.170> doing<00:03:13.040> straight<00:03:13.760> EU<00:03:14.209> power

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
quarry and I'm doing straight EU power

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.929 
quarry and I'm doing straight EU power
right<00:03:14.870> now<00:03:14.900> from<00:03:15.769> lava<00:03:16.069> pumped<00:03:16.579> in<00:03:16.669> from<00:03:16.700> the

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:16.939 
right now from lava pumped in from the

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:20.979 
right now from lava pumped in from the
nether<00:03:18.430> that<00:03:19.430> also<00:03:19.849> got<00:03:20.060> set<00:03:20.299> up<00:03:20.329> to<00:03:20.510> table<00:03:20.689> wow

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
nether that also got set up to table wow

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.369 
nether that also got set up to table wow
we<00:03:21.049> got<00:03:21.430> really<00:03:22.430> far<00:03:22.639> tonight<00:03:22.819> come<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:23.930> legs

we got really far tonight come on legs
so<00:03:24.560> we<00:03:24.680> went<00:03:24.829> to<00:03:24.949> the<00:03:25.099> Nezzer<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.519> was<00:03:25.669> really

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
so we went to the Nezzer that was really

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.580 
so we went to the Nezzer that was really
early<00:03:25.939> on<00:03:26.209> to<00:03:26.510> get<00:03:26.599> in<00:03:26.719> the<00:03:26.810> power<00:03:26.989> so<00:03:27.319> we<00:03:27.349> set

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
early on to get in the power so we set

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.670 
early on to get in the power so we set
up<00:03:27.709> a<00:03:27.859> glass<00:03:28.400> tank<00:03:28.879> for<00:03:29.150> lava<00:03:29.560> installed<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
up a glass tank for lava installed the

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.309 
up a glass tank for lava installed the
pump<00:03:30.919> at<00:03:31.069> the<00:03:31.099> nether<00:03:31.930> there<00:03:32.930> we<00:03:33.019> go<00:03:33.139> we're

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
pump at the nether there we go we're

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.819 
pump at the nether there we go we're
probably<00:03:33.560> still<00:03:33.980> at<00:03:34.069> lagging<00:03:34.459> here<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:36.620> not

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
probably still at lagging here it's not

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.959 
probably still at lagging here it's not
really<00:03:37.159> going<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.639> slow<00:03:37.879> that's<00:03:38.120> lag<00:03:39.969> but

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:40.969 
really going that slow that's lag but

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:43.179 
really going that slow that's lag but
regardless<00:03:41.510> oh<00:03:42.049> you're<00:03:42.379> supposed<00:03:42.829> to<00:03:43.010> keep

regardless oh you're supposed to keep
playing<00:03:43.549> there<00:03:43.849> we<00:03:43.939> go<00:03:44.120> um<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:47.709> yeah<00:03:48.709> so<00:03:49.010> this

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:49.159 
playing there we go um so yeah so this

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.369 
playing there we go um so yeah so this
is<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.459> hollow<00:03:49.609> hill<00:03:49.909> that<00:03:50.150> we're<00:03:50.379> quarrying

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:51.379 
is the hollow hill that we're quarrying

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:53.409 
is the hollow hill that we're quarrying
out<00:03:51.620> getting<00:03:52.489> quite<00:03:52.729> far<00:03:53.000> getting<00:03:53.269> down<00:03:53.389> to

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
out getting quite far getting down to

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.699 
out getting quite far getting down to
the<00:03:53.569> good<00:03:53.689> stuff<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:54.079> comes<00:03:54.409> the<00:03:54.500> lag

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
the good stuff there comes the lag

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.229 
the good stuff there comes the lag
catching<00:03:54.949> up<00:03:55.250> boom<00:03:55.549> you<00:03:55.849> can<00:03:56.000> see<00:03:56.120> it's

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
catching up boom you can see it's

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.749 
catching up boom you can see it's
actually<00:03:56.569> going<00:03:56.720> quite<00:03:56.840> fast<00:03:57.639> collecting<00:03:58.639> a

00:03:58.749 --> 00:03:58.759 
actually going quite fast collecting a

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:02.830 
actually going quite fast collecting a
whole<00:03:59.150> lot<00:03:59.449> of<00:03:59.569> things<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:02.269> we<00:04:02.479> went<00:04:02.629> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
whole lot of things and so we went to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.369 
whole lot of things and so we went to
the<00:04:02.959> nether<00:04:03.169> we<00:04:03.879> set<00:04:04.879> down<00:04:04.909> the<00:04:05.090> pump<00:04:05.479> put<00:04:06.139> make

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
the nether we set down the pump put make

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.080 
the nether we set down the pump put make
chunk<00:04:06.709> loaders<00:04:07.159> junk<00:04:07.519> loaded<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:07.939> whole

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
chunk loaders junk loaded the whole

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.809 
chunk loaders junk loaded the whole
thing<00:04:08.359> and<00:04:08.889> piped<00:04:09.889> it<00:04:10.069> back<00:04:10.189> home<00:04:10.400> to<00:04:10.549> our<00:04:10.609> base

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
thing and piped it back home to our base

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.679 
thing and piped it back home to our base
and<00:04:11.120> then<00:04:12.069> we're<00:04:13.069> using<00:04:13.250> energy<00:04:13.939> bridges

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
and then we're using energy bridges

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.539 
and then we're using energy bridges
converter<00:04:15.139> things<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:15.889> brought<00:04:16.099> led<00:04:16.340> to

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
converter things and that brought led to

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.039 
converter things and that brought led to
some<00:04:16.729> interesting<00:04:17.150> times<00:04:17.299> because<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
some interesting times because the

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.629 
some interesting times because the
energy<00:04:18.229> converter<00:04:18.829> mod<00:04:19.039> actually<00:04:19.459> wasn't

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
energy converter mod actually wasn't

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.550 
energy converter mod actually wasn't
disabled<00:04:20.180> on<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> server<00:04:20.780> but<00:04:20.959> jevon<00:04:21.289> was<00:04:21.409> on

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
disabled on the server but jevon was on

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.189 
disabled on the server but jevon was on
the<00:04:21.650> ball<00:04:21.859> he<00:04:22.460> fixed<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.180> then<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.840> the

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 
the ball he fixed it and then it the

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.300 
the ball he fixed it and then it the
energy<00:04:24.710> bridge<00:04:24.889> works<00:04:25.250> so<00:04:25.430> we<00:04:25.580> are<00:04:25.729> converting

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
energy bridge works so we are converting

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.089 
energy bridge works so we are converting

we built the whole truckload of

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.520 
we built the whole truckload of

here<00:04:49.120> at<00:04:49.300> today<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:49.960> what<00:04:50.050> that's<00:04:51.010> doing<00:04:51.190> is

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
here at today and what that's doing is

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.030 
here at today and what that's doing is
it's<00:04:51.610> converting<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.300> EU<00:04:52.660> or<00:04:52.960> converting<00:04:53.950> the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
it's converting the EU or converting the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.740 
it's converting the EU or converting the
EU<00:04:54.280> into<00:04:54.550> MJ<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.150> then<00:04:55.270> sending<00:04:55.570> it<00:04:55.660> out

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
EU into MJ and then sending it out

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.820 
EU into MJ and then sending it out
through<00:04:55.930> the<00:04:56.020> test<00:04:56.230> tracks<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.620> that's<00:04:56.740> how

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
through the test tracks and that's how

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.280 
through the test tracks and that's how
we're<00:04:56.980> past<00:04:57.160> powering<00:04:57.760> the<00:04:58.210> quarry<00:04:58.480> we<00:04:59.110> made

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
we're past powering the quarry we made

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.450 
we're past powering the quarry we made
it<00:04:59.320> enough<00:04:59.620> so<00:04:59.770> they're<00:04:59.919> just<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.130> couple<00:05:00.160> of

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
it enough so they're just a couple of

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.950 
it enough so they're just a couple of
extra<00:05:00.850> so<00:05:01.030> tomorrow<00:05:01.389> I<00:05:01.480> can<00:05:01.660> start<00:05:01.840> building

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
extra so tomorrow I can start building

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.800 
extra so tomorrow I can start building
machinery<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.950> actually<00:05:03.490> have<00:05:03.669> power<00:05:04.030> to<00:05:04.360> use

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
machinery and actually have power to use

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.330 
machinery and actually have power to use
it<00:05:05.020> you<00:05:05.110> know<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.410> basics<00:05:05.770> furnace<00:05:06.190> and

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
it you know the basics furnace and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.400 
it you know the basics furnace and
whatever<00:05:06.669> and<00:05:06.880> we<00:05:07.510> can<00:05:07.690> started<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.139> apply<00:05:08.290> to

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
whatever and we can started to apply to

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.200 
whatever and we can started to apply to
logistics<00:05:08.979> because<00:05:09.220> those<00:05:09.520> quarries<00:05:09.940> are

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
logistics because those quarries are

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.420 
logistics because those quarries are
going<00:05:10.360> to<00:05:10.419> give<00:05:10.570> us<00:05:10.720> enough<00:05:11.020> ports<00:05:11.470> to

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
going to give us enough ports to

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.060 
going to give us enough ports to
actually<00:05:12.880> start<00:05:13.180> into<00:05:13.540> the<00:05:13.570> end<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.889> and

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.070 
actually start into the end of that and

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:20.190 
actually start into the end of that and
I<00:05:15.100> can't<00:05:15.370> wait<00:05:15.610> um<00:05:17.100> yeah<00:05:18.100> and<00:05:18.820> we<00:05:19.389> also<00:05:19.630> so<00:05:19.990> once

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
I can't wait um yeah and we also so once

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.150 
I can't wait um yeah and we also so once
that<00:05:20.290> got<00:05:20.680> done<00:05:20.919> and<00:05:21.130> we<00:05:21.220> built<00:05:21.430> Amethi<00:05:23.160> we

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
that got done and we built Amethi we

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.210 
that got done and we built Amethi we
built<00:05:25.000> this<00:05:25.240> MFR<00:05:26.050> harvester<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:26.830> i<00:05:26.889> had<00:05:27.010> heard

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
built this MFR harvester and i had heard

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.409 
built this MFR harvester and i had heard
from<00:05:27.250> someone<00:05:27.669> that<00:05:27.790> you<00:05:27.940> could<00:05:28.090> use<00:05:28.120> the

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
from someone that you could use the

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:29.810 
from someone that you could use the
sludge<00:05:28.690> from<00:05:28.900> this<00:05:29.139> to<00:05:29.260> make<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.470> clay

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 
sludge from this to make a clay

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.969 
sludge from this to make a clay
generator<00:05:30.820> turns<00:05:31.300> out<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:32.110> from<00:05:32.470> an

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
generator turns out that's from an

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.100 
generator turns out that's from an
additional<00:05:33.490> mod<00:05:33.790> that's<00:05:34.540> not<00:05:34.750> part<00:05:34.990> of<00:05:35.050> that

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
additional mod that's not part of that

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.840 
additional mod that's not part of that
DB<00:05:35.440> stuff<00:05:35.650> by<00:05:35.800> default<00:05:36.160> but<00:05:36.370> we<00:05:36.520> needed<00:05:36.789> a

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
DB stuff by default but we needed a

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.430 
DB stuff by default but we needed a
harvester<00:05:37.210> any<00:05:37.360> way<00:05:37.539> for<00:05:37.750> future<00:05:37.870> endeavors

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
harvester any way for future endeavors

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.980 
harvester any way for future endeavors
right<00:05:38.770> now<00:05:38.919> it's<00:05:39.160> an<00:05:39.280> automatic<00:05:39.990> sugarcane

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
right now it's an automatic sugarcane

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.540 
right now it's an automatic sugarcane
farm<00:05:41.320> is<00:05:41.560> just<00:05:41.590> going<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:41.919> dump<00:05:42.160> into<00:05:42.370> this

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
farm is just going to dump into this

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.180 
farm is just going to dump into this
chest<00:05:42.910> here<00:05:43.150> probably<00:05:43.990> full<00:05:44.500> by<00:05:44.710> morning<00:05:45.070> when

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
chest here probably full by morning when

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.050 
chest here probably full by morning when
we<00:05:45.280> come<00:05:45.430> back<00:05:45.580> and<00:05:46.620> yeah<00:05:47.620> we'll<00:05:48.370> put<00:05:48.760> it<00:05:48.910> to

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
we come back and yeah we'll put it to

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.810 
we come back and yeah we'll put it to
more<00:05:49.240> uses<00:05:49.690> later<00:05:49.960> and<00:05:50.320> I<00:05:51.130> think<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:51.789> about

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
more uses later and I think that about

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.360 
more uses later and I think that about
covers<00:05:52.150> it<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.229> think<00:05:53.590> that's<00:05:53.770> everything<00:05:53.919> that

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
covers it I think that's everything that

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.700 
covers it I think that's everything that
we<00:05:54.460> did<00:05:54.700> did<00:05:55.539> a<00:05:55.570> lot<00:05:55.720> of<00:05:55.750> caving<00:05:56.080> and<00:05:56.410> had<00:05:56.530> fun

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
we did did a lot of caving and had fun

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.250 
we did did a lot of caving and had fun
with<00:05:56.919> that<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:58.080> yeah<00:05:59.080> so<00:05:59.680> that's<00:06:00.250> that<00:06:00.640> and

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
with that and yeah so that's that and

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.810 
with that and yeah so that's that and
tonight<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:02.590> will<00:06:02.919> not<00:06:03.100> be<00:06:03.250> streaming<00:06:03.550> like
