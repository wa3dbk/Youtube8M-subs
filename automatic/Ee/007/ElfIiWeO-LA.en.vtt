00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.640
 here I bring you the tutorial of how 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.609
 can make the application of 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.470
 find my iphone this is so that of 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.929
 no way can you locate or 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:25.490
 track the device that you have 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:27.050
 found or anything I do not know myself 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.449
 only what I 'm going to do is 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.449
 show them how they can do infallible 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.000
 this application so let's go to the 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.940
 computer 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.370
 in the previous video I explained how 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:43.059
 they could operate this tool 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.309
 so they can locate your iphone and 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.010
 even send alerts and everything to the 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.770
 person who in some case is the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.970
 have stolen or anything now they 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.160
 I will teach how to do everything 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.960
 but I recommend you a lot 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.370
 check the first video so that 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 understand all the steps that we are going to 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.949
 do that although they are very simple good 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.530
 it is better to have the option first 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.649
 of how to make it work to be able to 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.390
 know how to do it that is infallible and 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.149
 can not track them in any way 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.390
 so I leave here the link so that 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:18.970
 check the first video and now if we go 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.590
 to our computer 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.330
 let's open here in the browser the 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.710
 icloud.com page here I have it 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.260
 already enter previously 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.020
 and what we are going to do is very simple 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.710
 let's find my iphone here we can 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.409
 see that our iphone is located 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.039
 one minute ago 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.530
 and the step we are going to take is very simple 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.830
 give is go to the settings of our 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.200
 iphone 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.980
 icloud we enter we are to 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.560
 option below and check what you're going to 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.510
 happen if I deactivate the option to 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.740
 find my iphone 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.740
 and deactivated it 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.090
 and I 'm going to give you the fresh 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.569
 and as you may notice, it tells us that 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.960
 find the iphone 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.270
 says it has been deactivated 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.580
 so with this option with this simple 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.670
 and simple step 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.420
 they will not be able to track and locate us 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.430
 nothing 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.660
 if I activate again here 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.680
 I'll allow 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.200
 and now we check in our computer 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.130
 again refresh and we can see that there 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.130
 appears again 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.720
 it's very simple it's very easy and really 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:51.350
 that with this option are going to be 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.690
 infallible to this option to search my 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.720
 iphone 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.330
 it is a unique step 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.220
 and well they have already given that they have 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.200
 found some device of these and 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.590
 do not want them to locate them they already know 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.420
 how to do 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.530
