oh also I finished up the the
understanding<00:01:43.979> artificial<00:01:44.430> intelligence<00:01:44.909> by

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
understanding artificial intelligence by

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.850 
understanding artificial intelligence by
scientific<00:01:45.450> american<00:01:46.020> I'm<00:01:46.200> really<00:01:46.649> into

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
scientific american I'm really into

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.760 
scientific american I'm really into
science<00:01:47.340> I'm<00:01:47.820> excites<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:49.500> was<00:01:49.619> really

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
science I'm excites and it was really

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.289 
science I'm excites and it was really
really<00:01:50.009> cool<00:01:50.189> i<00:01:50.250> find<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.670> interesting<00:01:50.729> that

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
really cool i find it interesting that

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
really cool i find it interesting that
there's<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.140> part<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.530> fuzzy<00:01:52.920> logic

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
there's this one part of a fuzzy logic

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
there's this one part of a fuzzy logic
and<00:01:53.780> fuzzy<00:01:54.780> logic<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.320> all<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.250> know

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
and fuzzy logic is all about you know

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
and fuzzy logic is all about you know
binary<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:57.509> basically<00:01:57.869> ones<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.259> zeros<00:01:58.560> on

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
binary is basically ones and zeros on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.160 
binary is basically ones and zeros on
and<00:01:58.979> off<00:01:59.070> fuzzy<00:01:59.880> logic<00:02:00.270> kind<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.659> makes<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.960> gray

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and off fuzzy logic kind of makes a gray

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.630 
and off fuzzy logic kind of makes a gray
area<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.649> between<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.159> i<00:02:02.219> find<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.549> ironic

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
area in between but i find it ironic

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.550 
area in between but i find it ironic
because<00:02:03.119> before<00:02:03.689> there<00:02:03.899> was<00:02:04.110> digital

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
because before there was digital

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
because before there was digital
everything<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> grey<00:02:05.850> area<00:02:05.880> though<00:02:06.360> the

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
everything was the grey area though the

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.720 
everything was the grey area though the
analog<00:02:06.840> was<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.200> agree

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
analog was all agree

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.790 
analog was all agree
yeah<00:02:07.820> I<00:02:08.090> hope<00:02:08.450> I<00:02:08.540> didn't<00:02:08.780> go<00:02:09.350> over<00:02:09.470> anybody's

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
yeah I hope I didn't go over anybody's

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.630 
yeah I hope I didn't go over anybody's
head<00:02:09.860> there<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.280> found<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:10.610> fascinating

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
head there but I found it fascinating

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.570 
head there but I found it fascinating

a lot of support from people because

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.340

to<00:02:30.410> read<00:02:30.740> what<00:02:31.010> other<00:02:31.160> people<00:02:31.430> are<00:02:31.490> watching

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
to read what other people are watching

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.460

and<00:02:32.060> everything<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.630> weird<00:02:32.840> environment

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
and everything it's a weird environment

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.690 
and everything it's a weird environment
I<00:02:33.530> think<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.800> biggest<00:02:33.950> challenge<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.550> just

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
I think the biggest challenge is just

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.250 
I think the biggest challenge is just
being<00:02:34.850> so<00:02:35.060> public<00:02:35.480> and<00:02:35.630> having<00:02:35.810> my<00:02:35.900> life<00:02:36.080> so

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260
