00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.509

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.250
 So 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.239
 what do you need you need one then 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.770
 found stick board and silicone 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.080

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:49.210
 fondant a tweezers roller and shaper 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.320
 of course a cake and it is on one 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.629
 turntable 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.699
 step 1 we start with the fondant i have 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.860
 here piece of that I already have one 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.510
 mountain color given 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 we're going to roll out all the way on the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.860
 non-stick is knead well 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 a little loose comes see a little warm 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:14.200
 is then you become more flexible and then 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.550
 we go with the silicone rudder go him 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.550
 completely out 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.770
 don't you be like me like that 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.720
 lunchtip then I let you out 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.399
 also very many alternatives you would too 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.660
 be able to scatter your entire attention 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.479
 with me china 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.220
 you can just buy it in oh and you too 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.830
 also have crystical 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.290
 that is an odor taste and color pink 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.330
 butter and that also ensures that you 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.330
 found or does not stick to the table 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.700
 well as you see we now have it all 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.620
 rolled out 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.270
 he is not so beautiful to do is mark 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.800
 not all because I will see you later 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.830
 not necessarily 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.750
 he is high enough I think it will go 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.380
 of course we first test how do 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.780
 you know that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.400
 I usually do with my hearing 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.540
 neighborhood newspapers 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.540
 the top 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:18.160
 you will need it so we have plenty of 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.780
 we just measured it 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.120
 so I'm going to show you how to get there 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.860
 how to do that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.760
 some people do it with their full of that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.470
 stick 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.390
 they pull him over so they put him 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.860
 finally about the cake i got 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.870
 there bit bad experience a bit 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.930
 I'm going to show you my method 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.430
 you grab one on the sides on one of 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.230
 on the sides 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.240
 i don't pull my little bit up too 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.580
 hard because otherwise it can crack 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:49.930
 put your hand under it and I will hear you then 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:52.860
 from one arm to another ar crazy te 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.130
 draw oh yes 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.660
 so and now you have the front edge of the plate 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.940
 off 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.830
 well the above your cake and then try 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.340
 little measured songs just see that 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.340
 you have enough 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:14.290
 lay it over that cake well now 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.900
 No, I think all women still 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.959
 be completed very beautiful it is 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.450
 most important thing is that you immediately get the 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.760
 removes the edges 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.260
 if you don't do that you can tear 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.650
 collar informant 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.480
 especially if you have a square cake 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:39.430
 It is important that you immediately get it 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:42.090
 Pits in all corners removes this 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.090
 beach 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.570
 jessie safe now we go the sides 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.160
 take away 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:53.920
 how do you pick up a woman or 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.000
 and you gently put it down that 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.000
 you do with a long time 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.930
 now the whole cake is covered but so 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.060
 chic and for nature many things 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.310
 fondant what we use for 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.590
 is probably a pizza dumplings that does 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.720
 everyone in the house and you actually put it 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.040
 as it were, down to the side as you 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.870
 a driver late is very easy 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.750
 because you can change your shape 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.850
 you can straighten your pizza brewer 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.980
 keep hot only drives the plate 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:37.180
 and pull over the floor mat again 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.020
 from and I heap up in a closed 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.460
 bucket or with and so they became pouch 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 no that remains very important otherwise 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.310
 your fondant out and in the bucket and then 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.470
 plaisier smoothly and you can do it especially the 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.080
 want to use cake go now the cake 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.280
 smooth out with their shaper 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.750
 I usually have a tool 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.450
 user two are you can also do it with 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.680
 one we start at the top of 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.300
 the pie 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.660
 you are really literally slippery 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.660
 ironing 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.440
 when you've done that, go to the 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.120
 sides 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.090
 handy if you have a turntable 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.660
 because that is how he just runs and can 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.930
 arm here in one place and you do that with 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.490
 the whole cake that goes a whole world 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.180
 to make 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.180
 smooth out 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.210
 this is the end result i made him so tight 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.530
 try as possible 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.750
 you manage not to wait at all 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.880
 no matter you can shower everywhere 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.770
 had them who are but just throw 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.990
 full of something in it nothing at all 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.830
