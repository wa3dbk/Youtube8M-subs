00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.230
 very good 78 are those positions that in 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.850
 we are already in a new video black light 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.560
 retribution eat the title I'll do 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.840
 a little analysis and at the same time 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.820
 I will give my opinion about said game 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.470
 first of all tell you that you are seeing 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.660
 a heading of domain and after the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.920
 confirmed low of the fund only by 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.990
 have said the name of the games already 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.279
 You should have a monkey track 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.440
 kind of game that is this is not 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.760
 basically a call of duty guys but 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.949
 horse riding style I want to say 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.809
 with this the dynamics of the game is more than 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.280
 call of duty because it is more dynamic than 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.840
 a kiel are the same is not as dynamic 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.920
 as a call of duty but yes more 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.510
 action that what is being the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.820
 multiplayer of killzone chad of all by 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.950
 example but at the same time is that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.930
 has killzone graphics that is 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.149
 has futuristic graphics like you see 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.680
 we have even a super radar that is not 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.140
 we have minimap but instead if you 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.510
 we give the r one is good let's say that a 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.219
 minimum so that it lets you see by the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.989
 walls and thus be able to locate your 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.000
 enemies the truth that's a point 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.470
 quite entertaining something innovative but 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.390
 well the fact is that that is not going to 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.100
 determine if a fun game or not what 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.899
 that really determines if a game of 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.020
 fun bonus is not basically the 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.640
 dynamic is something quite addictive for 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.400
 if the game is entertained just like that 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.990
 with new games but not to throw you 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.570
 some games and that is cool not the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.950
 case guys is that my opinion is that at 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 be a free to play that by the way is 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.860
 free for all members of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.770
 playstation or if you have a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.810
 playstation 4 I emphasize 4 is not for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.310
 playstation 3 then you can do with 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.380
 a black light retribution so 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.180
 are free to play the case is that 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.220
 Being a free to play has a lot 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.420
 many, many failures but 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.070
 you also have to say one thing is that 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.509
 it's in beta phase so it's still 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.190
 a test but the fact is that there is a 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.770
 lots of failures guys either is 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.390
 simply disgusting and I will say 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.910
 this word because it is super 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.350
 super super bad the connection that there is in 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.479
 this game and it's not me I'm not going to say 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.580
 I just like that a game that went wrong 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.039
 the connection I do not know that most of 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.500
 games are heavy of lagazós of 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.360
 connection pulls is that it is very 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.520
 very very ugly what they have done because it is 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.989
 I do not know how the hell there can be a 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.850
 so bad connection in a console 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.220
 new generation that is the connection is what 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.750
 worse can you give of lagazós and of 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.370
 pulls by very good connection that 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.700
 you have and I tell you I was playing port 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.560
 with 40 megawatts per cable and I was going we're going 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.050
 a super disgusting way you were with 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.980
 to play 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.290
 to monkeys and not the case is that it is a game 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 as I told you but it does not have 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.740
 too many failures and at the same time 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.360
 I think it 's basically a mixture of 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.310
 killzone with call of duty have not wanted 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.260
 catch the good thing about killzone the good thing about 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 call of duty that is, they caught a roll 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.810
 thus more futuristic of killzone and at the same time 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.490
 put the dynamics of call of duty not 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.500
 I think it's a good idea I do not think 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.290
 they have exploited it in depth I think they have not 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
 done I do not know I do not think I do not do not me 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.860
 he's totally convinced he 's funny 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.420
 for I'm telling you to take a little game 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.460
 I may bring a game from time to time 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.080
 when blacklight retribution but what 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.430
 best of all is that it's free is not a 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.800
 free to play to be free to play 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.750
 neither can you expect it to be the best 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.390
 seller of the year or anything like that 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.130
 but the fact is that I do not know something I know 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.660
 At least it's free I do not know what you say 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.280
 you oysters have made me pay 70 euros 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.470
 why then would you say 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.420
 oysters you shit nothing bragado antímano 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.520
 but being free for what to say is going 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.220
 alright guys I only give up to infinity and 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.930
