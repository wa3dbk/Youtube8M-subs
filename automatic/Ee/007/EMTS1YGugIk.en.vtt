 background she is very small 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.819
 so she did not have any criteria for 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.349
 selection is not at the rice so much 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.239

 nobody will turn numbers but 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.930
 the numbers have some importance

 leonard de vinci's cities the slot 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:30.470
 labial should be one third of 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.470
 the distance that separates the base from the

 chin nose distance from the eyes profile 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:39.350
 everywhere we find the famous number

 of gold we arrive it's received 118 which is 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.690
 so mans bruegel a perfect face 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.580
 its rare and much sought after in the 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.260
 advertising because you can not do anything about it 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.110
 do your eye instinctively to 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.390
 shoot he does not know why but we are 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.040
 attracted by something that is beautiful 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.750
 that does not spoil something and that's 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.190
 exactly what is amazing in the 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.510
 nature or in the architectured or in 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.270
 art is that sometimes you feel 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:04.780
 attracted by the things that we find 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.860
 beasts and we do not know why it's beautiful 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.990
 but the scientists who analyzed 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.510
 very often are able to explain 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.700
 that in such or such work the 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.700
 proportions correspond to 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.770
 divine proportions to the golden numbers 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.380
 and the divine beauty we never tire of 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.880
 so we will never get tired but I 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.740
 completely understand that plenty of 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.480
 brands want to have it during his 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.670
 back when he returns to grace 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.470
 what they say tired look at us 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.720
 also we have it we participate from 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.340
 this big gesture this big circus around 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.210
 kate moss so it's not I think not 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.150
 that it is a miscalculation 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.890
 but it can last only six months in 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.770
 here is one who felt the wind spin 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:45.640
