00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 hello to all those seen today I want you 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.340
 teach winter pruning that 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.710
 we perform in traditional vessels 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.630
 although the pruning of a glass is very 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.220
 conditioned by the density of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.570
 plantation and the conditions of each 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.850
 territory 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.510
 for example here we have a glass with a 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:31.769
 planting density of 2,000 plants 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 per hectare then depending on that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 the productive objectives we are going to 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 define the pruning load in this case the 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 pruning load for the objectives of the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.110
 video that we want to elaborate because it is a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.300
 pruning an average we have to talk about 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 always average the glasses because they are vines 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.879
 old and can not always be extrapolated 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 to each individual in which we left six 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 thumbs in three arms we have 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.059
 normally one arm two and three and in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.399
 each arm 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.910
 we left a pair of thumbs not 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.710
 then there are six thumbs per plant 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.120
 you see for example in this here has not been 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.160
 could by lass 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.590
 meat of the strain has been able to extract the 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.950
 the sixth thumb we had six thumbs 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.070
 for two yolks 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.140
 12 buds per vine not with a potential 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.700
 productive of 24 waters this never goes away 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.429
 to give because also the old mines 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.829
 there is a regulation of fertility very 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.520
 important but good that's the 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:31.250
 theoretical potential then we have to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.990
 know a little about the potential of the vineyard 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.760
 own the villa then how do you 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.490
 performs pruning in these vessels 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.980
 if I have if I have faith for you 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.750
 conformed to forgive that I'm not 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.810
 making shadow if I have the east for you 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.100
 conformed with its 33 arms then what 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.770
 What I do is leave two couples of these 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.450
 six pairs of thumbs then the year 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.610
 last I left 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 this thumb and this then one of the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.490
 two eliminated it 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.229
 eliminated you can 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.939
 it is not advisable to do it with these 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 hand scissors that you can not do 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.130
 enough strength but to record the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.620
 video come to us from here I would let 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.709
 some pairs of thumbs always 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.360
 cutting at the level of a little bit by 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.150
 under the yolk or splitting the yolk 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.160
 that I do not want to leave anymore and let be 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.620
 others 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.660
 in the next in the next arm 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.860
 I do the same 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.760
 short on biceps 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.760
 and short here 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.430
 and I already have the next couple of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.780
 thumbs and in this other arm as only 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.459
 I have a branch because the other 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.800
 it would be broken by the wind or whatever 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.050
 I will leave alone 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.380
 because it would be in this case left 5 I'm not going 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.480
 to be able to leave 6 would be the idea of 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.490
 next strain well the same in this 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.380
 case then it happens in these vineyards 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.240
 old because an arm has dried and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:02.020
 I only have two then then leave 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:07.100
 I'll leave alone 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.720
 only 4 in this case 44 thumbs or what 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.970
 could do is try to get out if 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.520
 there would have been some lateral branch 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.950
 try to build a new arm 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.800
 in this case it is not possible and I 'm not going 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.080
 to leave four pairs of thumbs here 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.170
 for that they are very similar and have 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.390
 problems that I know that the whole grape 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.510
 would be caked in any place then 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.770
 then we will leave alone in this 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:36.940
 case only four thumbs 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:40.210
 in the concept it is clear in the glass the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.569
 idea is power fork of power in each 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.060
 arm leave a couple of thumbs 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.239
 this was the one I wanted to teach about 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.540
 pruning in traditional vessels a 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.540
 greeting
