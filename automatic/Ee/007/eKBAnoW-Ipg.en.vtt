00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.740
 hello friends how are you or health ego 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.620
 energy and today we're going to talk about how 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.869
 we can lose weight thanks to consumption 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.450
 of won from the most lucid in different 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.420
 formats that offer the products of x 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.369
 n as it can be in coffee in chocolate in 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.930
 tablets et cetera etcetera but before 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.419
 begin let me tell you and this is 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.950
 important that we are going to focus on 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.250
 among all the properties three large 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.200
 more only in its nutritional value 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.780
 because if you are a person who does not 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.910
 you need to lose weight the consuming gained from 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.490
 more will not cause you to lose weight 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.310
 if on the contrary if you are overweight or 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.260
 you have obesity problems here if you 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.020
 is going to help the ganoderma have a 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.560
 healthy control of your weight 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.840
 said this turns out that when we want 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.120
 remove our extra pounds 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.730
 we resort to dieting these diets 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.790
 it is neither more nor less than consuming 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.670
 food in a more controlled way 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.890
 looking for a lower calorie intake 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.870
 what happens is that the industry of 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
 food that we currently have is not 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.119
 not nearly the same as we had a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.160
 years ago there was not much in depth 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.860
 this aspect but the reality is that the 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.110
 today's foods are neither so fresh nor 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.340
 as natural as doing for example 20 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.320
 years or 30 years because of this results from 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.190
 that in that reduction of calories is 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.710
 food intake looking to have 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.990
 consume less calories also happen 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.550
 that we have nutritional deficiencies 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:47.130
 because I insist because today's food 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:49.079
 has less nutritional value in general 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.460
 then in this case how can 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.289
 help us elcano derman to lose weight 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.470
 well point number 1 that the Gaul derma 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.689
 contributes 200 nutrients and more than 150 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.960
 antioxidants with which inside your 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.310
 food habits consume ganoderma te 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.420
 will help cover those shortcomings 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.369
 nutritional 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.319
 in second place and the best way to 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.530
 consume ganoderma in the face of loss 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.239
 of weight would consume it at least 15 or 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.670
 20 minutes before the main ones 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:20.650

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.720
 first more organ will help us 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.440
 prepare our body for the 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.840
 digestion of the next meal in addition 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.710

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.220
 anxiety to eat 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.880
 and how it satisfies you for the nutritional value 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.190

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.010
 then you are controlling the calories 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.010
 but without having nutritional deficiencies 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.200
