00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.409 

so<00:00:08.740> today<00:00:09.639> we're<00:00:09.849> going<00:00:09.940> to<00:00:10.030> look<00:00:10.089> at<00:00:10.240> some

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:10.419 
so today we're going to look at some

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.249 
so today we're going to look at some
milk<00:00:10.660> techniques<00:00:11.849> all<00:00:13.019> techniques<00:00:14.019> of

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:14.259 
milk techniques all techniques of

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.080 
milk techniques all techniques of
producing<00:00:14.740> milk<00:00:14.919> are<00:00:15.039> exactly<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.429> same<00:00:15.459> all

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
producing milk are exactly the same all

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.970 
producing milk are exactly the same all
the<00:00:16.630> differences<00:00:17.080> between<00:00:17.199> a<00:00:17.380> caption<00:00:17.769> a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
the differences between a caption a

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.310 
the differences between a caption a
latte<00:00:18.340> a<00:00:18.550> flat<00:00:18.760> white<00:00:18.910> for<00:00:19.119> example<00:00:19.150> is<00:00:19.750> the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
latte a flat white for example is the

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.689 
latte a flat white for example is the
amount<00:00:20.439> of<00:00:20.590> air<00:00:20.769> that<00:00:20.920> you<00:00:21.070> introduce<00:00:21.460> into

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
amount of air that you introduce into

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:23.279 
amount of air that you introduce into
the<00:00:21.730> milk<00:00:21.970> at<00:00:22.090> the<00:00:22.150> beginning<00:00:22.630> of<00:00:23.019> the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
the milk at the beginning of the

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.349 
the milk at the beginning of the
technique<00:00:23.650> ok<00:00:24.580> so<00:00:24.640> what<00:00:25.060> I'm<00:00:25.179> going<00:00:25.330> to

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
technique ok so what I'm going to

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.169 
technique ok so what I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:26.429> the<00:00:27.429> action<00:00:27.849> of<00:00:27.939> steaming

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:28.179 
demonstrate is the action of steaming

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:29.519 
demonstrate is the action of steaming
milk<00:00:28.419> and<00:00:28.660> what<00:00:28.810> I'm<00:00:28.900> using<00:00:28.929> here<00:00:29.199> is<00:00:29.439> an

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
milk and what I'm using here is an

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.679 
milk and what I'm using here is an
oversized<00:00:29.949> jug<00:00:30.220> of<00:00:30.339> some<00:00:30.490> water<00:00:30.699> so<00:00:31.449> you<00:00:31.509> can

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
oversized jug of some water so you can

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.660 
oversized jug of some water so you can
actually<00:00:31.810> see<00:00:32.200> what's<00:00:32.500> happening<00:00:32.980> with<00:00:33.489> the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:33.670 
actually see what's happening with the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.400 
actually see what's happening with the
steam<00:00:33.879> how<00:00:34.329> far<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:34.690> nozzle<00:00:34.930> is<00:00:35.020> below<00:00:35.260> the

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
steam how far the nozzle is below the

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.479 
steam how far the nozzle is below the
surface<00:00:37.620> purging<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.920> below<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.250> surface

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
surface purging just below the surface

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.639 
surface purging just below the surface
as<00:00:42.940> you<00:00:43.059> can<00:00:43.239> see<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:44.079> below<00:00:44.289> the<00:00:44.410> surface

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
as you can see just below the surface

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.939 
as you can see just below the surface
get<00:00:45.640> a<00:00:45.670> Tennessee<00:00:46.059> man<00:00:46.090> all<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.660> way<00:00:46.690> on<00:00:46.949> and

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
get a Tennessee man all the way on and

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:49.139 
get a Tennessee man all the way on and
we<00:00:48.039> get<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.250> spinning<00:00:48.430> now<00:00:48.640> you'll<00:00:48.789> see<00:00:49.000> yeah

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
we get it spinning now you'll see yeah

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.650 
we get it spinning now you'll see yeah
that's<00:00:49.300> like<00:00:50.430> sucking<00:00:51.430> airing<00:00:51.820> you<00:00:52.329> can<00:00:52.480> see

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
that's like sucking airing you can see

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.479 
that's like sucking airing you can see
the<00:00:52.780> Jets<00:00:53.079> have<00:00:53.289> seen<00:00:53.559> firing<00:00:53.980> through<00:00:54.370> the

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
the Jets have seen firing through the

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.410 
the Jets have seen firing through the
water<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:57.370> need<00:00:57.399> to<00:00:57.550> do<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.850> all<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.269> way<00:00:58.359> at

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
water we need to do that all the way at

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.189 
water we need to do that all the way at
the<00:00:58.539> beginning<00:00:58.710> nothing<00:00:59.710> at<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.039> ends<00:01:00.340> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
the beginning nothing at the ends and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.509 
the beginning nothing at the ends and
then<00:01:02.199> all<00:01:02.350> we're<00:01:02.530> doing<00:01:02.769> is<00:01:02.890> just<00:01:02.920> keeping

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519 
then all we're doing is just keeping

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.219 
then all we're doing is just keeping
this<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:04.119> nozzle<00:01:04.509> just<00:01:04.720> below<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:04.960> surface

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
this the nozzle just below the surface

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.710 
this the nozzle just below the surface
and<00:01:05.470> letting<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.860> milk<00:01:06.070> spin<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.600> it's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
and letting the milk spin and it's

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.539 
and letting the milk spin and it's
almost<00:01:07.930> as<00:01:08.110> close<00:01:08.320> as<00:01:08.650> you<00:01:08.770> can<00:01:08.979> get<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
almost as close as you can get to the

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.160 
almost as close as you can get to the
surface<00:01:09.970> without<00:01:10.090> letting<00:01:10.509> even<00:01:10.630> where<00:01:10.869> you

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
surface without letting even where you

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.609 
surface without letting even where you
means<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.439> better<00:01:11.680> milk<00:01:11.979> will<00:01:12.159> get<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:17.380> first

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
means the better milk will get so first

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:20.010 
means the better milk will get so first
things<00:01:17.770> first<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.850> always<00:01:19.270> filled<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.990> a

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
things first it's always filled to a

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.960 
things first it's always filled to a
third<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.650> jug<00:01:20.890> just<00:01:21.280> for<00:01:21.490> lotus<00:01:21.759> layers

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
third of the jug just for lotus layers

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.240 
third of the jug just for lotus layers
and<00:01:22.299> always<00:01:23.020> purge<00:01:23.290> your<00:01:23.470> steam<00:01:23.680> arm<00:01:23.860> first<00:01:26.250> we

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
and always purge your steam arm first we

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.280 
and always purge your steam arm first we
put<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.490> tip<00:01:27.670> just<00:01:28.299> below<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:28.659> surface<00:01:28.899> and

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
put the tip just below the surface and

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.740 
put the tip just below the surface and
we're<00:01:30.189> going<00:01:30.310> to<00:01:30.369> turn<00:01:30.520> the<00:01:30.610> steam<00:01:30.820> arm<00:01:31.000> on<00:01:31.149> all

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
we're going to turn the steam arm on all

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.700 
we're going to turn the steam arm on all
the<00:01:31.960> way<00:01:32.079> and<00:01:32.950> not<00:01:33.189> just<00:01:33.250> halfway

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.680 

we're<00:01:36.610> looking<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.850> do<00:01:37.030> three<00:01:37.270> things<00:01:37.450> at<00:01:37.570> the

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
we're looking to do three things at the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.500 
we're looking to do three things at the
same<00:01:37.840> time<00:01:37.900> I<00:01:38.440> dare<00:01:38.860> start<00:01:39.400> to<00:01:39.550> spin<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.090> start

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
same time I dare start to spin and start

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.860 
same time I dare start to spin and start
to<00:01:40.600> beat<00:01:41.940> as<00:01:42.940> soon<00:01:43.180> as<00:01:43.270> I've<00:01:43.390> got<00:01:43.420> enough<00:01:43.690> air

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:43.870 
to beat as soon as I've got enough air

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.140 
to beat as soon as I've got enough air
in<00:01:44.080> I'm<00:01:44.230> just<00:01:44.290> going<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.310> keep<00:01:45.400> that<00:01:45.460> tip<00:01:45.820> just

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
in I'm just going to keep that tip just

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.300 
in I'm just going to keep that tip just
below<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.570> surface<00:01:46.750> and<00:01:47.740> as<00:01:47.830> soon<00:01:48.070> as<00:01:48.100> it's

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
below the surface and as soon as it's

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.800 
below the surface and as soon as it's
too<00:01:48.460> hot<00:01:48.640> in<00:01:48.760> my<00:01:48.820> hand<00:01:49.060> because<00:01:49.480> anything

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
too hot in my hand because anything

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.140 
too hot in my hand because anything
other<00:01:50.050> than<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.350> will<00:01:50.500> scald<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:50.950> milk<00:01:51.150> turn

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
other than that will scald the milk turn

00:01:52.150 --> 00:02:01.230 
other than that will scald the milk turn
it<00:01:52.240> off<00:01:58.410> so<00:01:59.410> we<00:01:59.500> just<00:01:59.650> finished<00:01:59.920> our<00:02:00.010> milk<00:02:00.250> just

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
it off so we just finished our milk just

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.670 
it off so we just finished our milk just
too<00:02:01.390> hot<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.750> hold<00:02:01.900> which<00:02:02.110> is<00:02:02.230> perfect

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
too hot to hold which is perfect

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.140 
too hot to hold which is perfect
anything<00:02:03.100> hotter<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.520> going<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.760> scold<00:02:03.940> the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.150 
anything hotter is going to scold the

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.620 
anything hotter is going to scold the
milk<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.950> we<00:02:06.100> start<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.430> fold<00:02:06.610> and<00:02:06.910> it's<00:02:07.510> a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
milk and we start to fold and it's a

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.389
