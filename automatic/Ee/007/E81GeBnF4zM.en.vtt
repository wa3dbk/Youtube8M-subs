yeah<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.220> can<00:01:17.400> use<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.670> two<00:01:17.820> goal<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
yeah you can use the two goal and the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.600 
yeah you can use the two goal and the
two<00:01:18.450> golem<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:19.020> gives<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.920> option<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.460> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
two golem also gives you the option of a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.580 
two golem also gives you the option of a
lot<00:01:20.880> more<00:01:20.909> bartsch<00:01:21.450> basis<00:01:22.020> now<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.409> it

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
lot more bartsch basis now here is it

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.780 
lot more bartsch basis now here is it
quite<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.860> difficult<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.399> because<00:01:23.490> you've<00:01:23.700> got

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
quite a difficult one because you've got

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240 
quite a difficult one because you've got
to<00:01:23.970> deal<00:01:24.149> with<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.630> lot<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.200> splash<00:01:25.680> basically

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to deal with a lot of splash basically

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.429 
to deal with a lot of splash basically
six<00:01:26.549> splash<00:01:27.090> all<00:01:27.390> at<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.840> end<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.259> base

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
six splash all at this end of the base

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.810 
six splash all at this end of the base
that<00:01:28.950> we're<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.790> through

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
that we're going to have to go through

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.640 
that we're going to have to go through
the<00:01:30.180> reason<00:01:30.450> we're<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.600> from<00:01:30.930> this<00:01:31.110> end<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the reason we're going from this end is

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.320 
the reason we're going from this end is
because<00:01:32.040> we<00:01:32.159> know<00:01:32.370> that<00:01:32.580> there<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.760> no<00:01:33.030> big

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
because we know that there are no big

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.660 
because we know that there are no big
bombs<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.440> we<00:01:34.560> can<00:01:34.710> use<00:01:34.830> two<00:01:35.070> golems<00:01:35.370> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
bombs so we can use two golems to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.050 
bombs so we can use two golems to
distract<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.330> of<00:01:36.600> this<00:01:36.810> rubbish<00:01:37.200> flash

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
distract all of this rubbish flash

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.490 
distract all of this rubbish flash
meanwhile<00:01:39.060> we<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:39.450> break<00:01:39.690> in<00:01:39.930> with<00:01:40.080> our<00:01:40.229> King

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
meanwhile we can break in with our King

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.980 
meanwhile we can break in with our King
and<00:01:40.680> our<00:01:40.920> queen<00:01:41.220> they<00:01:41.760> will<00:01:41.940> be<00:01:41.970> unharmed<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and our queen they will be unharmed and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.510 
and our queen they will be unharmed and
we<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.710> other<00:01:43.920> two<00:01:44.070> mortars<00:01:44.400> now

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we can get to the other two mortars now

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.100 
we can get to the other two mortars now
you<00:01:44.580> might<00:01:44.850> wonder<00:01:44.880> why<00:01:45.270> I'm<00:01:45.420> sending<00:01:45.659> troops

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you might wonder why I'm sending troops

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.469 
you might wonder why I'm sending troops
while<00:01:46.799> there<00:01:47.130> are<00:01:47.159> still<00:01:47.310> mortars<00:01:48.090> firing

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
while there are still mortars firing

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.690 
while there are still mortars firing
well<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.650> I'm<00:01:49.770> trying<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.340> stop

suspect<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.070> might<00:03:33.220> do<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.489> for<00:03:33.910> maybe<00:03:34.090> ten

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
suspect it might do that for maybe ten

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.229 
suspect it might do that for maybe ten
seconds<00:03:35.620> until<00:03:35.800> it<00:03:36.220> gets<00:03:36.400> frazzled<00:03:36.670> to<00:03:37.030> death

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
seconds until it gets frazzled to death

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.470 
seconds until it gets frazzled to death
by<00:03:37.510> those<00:03:37.780> single<00:03:38.260> infernos<00:03:38.830> or<00:03:39.070> just<00:03:39.880> blasted
