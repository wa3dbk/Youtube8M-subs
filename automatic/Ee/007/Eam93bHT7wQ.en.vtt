Pickups it's called lazy eye and you

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
might notice it doesn't get hit with the

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.289 
might notice it doesn't get hit with the
little<00:01:52.530> cheater<00:01:52.770> code<00:01:53.070> what<00:01:53.670> did<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:54.060> then

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
little cheater code what did back then

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.670 
little cheater code what did back then
I'm<00:01:54.540> not<00:01:54.720> sure<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.049> affair<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.320> gonna<00:01:55.500> hit

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
I'm not sure if the affair is gonna hit

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.850 
I'm not sure if the affair is gonna hit
or<00:01:55.799> not<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> reason<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.680> is<00:01:58.829> because

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
or not but the reason is is because

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.499 
or not but the reason is is because
there's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.310> different<00:01:59.700> version<00:01:59.880> in<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
there's a different version in the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
there's a different version in the
studio<00:02:00.810> version<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.590> like<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> version

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
studio version it's like a version

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.090 
studio version it's like a version
before<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:02.969> got<00:02:03.090> popular<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.680> liked<00:02:04.920> it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
before they got popular and I liked it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.399 
before they got popular and I liked it
better<00:02:05.130> than<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> actual<00:02:06.420> studio<00:02:06.899> version

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
better than the actual studio version

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.100 
better than the actual studio version
and<00:02:07.619> allows<00:02:08.090> infatuated<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.629> song<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.080> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and allows infatuated the song and I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.400 
and allows infatuated the song and I
felt<00:02:10.349> like<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.739> good

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
felt like it was good

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.840 
felt like it was good

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
these helicopters because there was a

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.250 
these helicopters because there was a
