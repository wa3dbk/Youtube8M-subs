have this red text which I'm probably

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.899 
have this red text which I'm probably
going<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.329> change<00:03:44.480> that<00:03:44.569> red<00:03:45.370> will<00:03:46.370> change<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
going to change that red will change the

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.559 
going to change that red will change the
color<00:03:47.590> anyway<00:03:48.590> so<00:03:49.159> we<00:03:49.250> have<00:03:49.370> our<00:03:49.609> text<00:03:50.209> colored

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.830 
color anyway so we have our text colored
and<00:03:50.750> then<00:03:51.560> we<00:03:51.680> have<00:03:51.890> our<00:03:52.189> links<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.329> they

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
and then we have our links and they

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.110 
and then we have our links and they
don't<00:03:53.959> actually<00:03:54.140> go<00:03:54.379> anywhere<00:03:54.709> because<00:03:55.120> we

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
don't actually go anywhere because we

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.330 
don't actually go anywhere because we
should<00:03:56.269> put<00:03:56.420> them<00:03:56.540> as<00:03:56.659> a<00:03:56.689> pound<00:03:56.959> symbol<00:03:57.340> so

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
should put them as a pound symbol so

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.770 
should put them as a pound symbol so
it's<00:03:58.489> displaying<00:03:58.849> our<00:03:58.969> latest<00:03:59.269> users<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.719> you

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
it's displaying our latest users and you

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.690 
it's displaying our latest users and you
can<00:03:59.900> see<00:04:00.049> we've<00:04:00.230> got<00:04:00.260> this<00:04:00.530> 20<00:04:00.859> pixel<00:04:01.250> margin

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
can see we've got this 20 pixel margin

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.649 
can see we've got this 20 pixel margin
left<00:04:02.000> margin<00:04:02.480> for<00:04:03.019> our<00:04:03.409> bottom<00:04:03.920> class<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:05.239> so

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
left margin for our bottom class and so

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.360 
left margin for our bottom class and so
that's<00:04:05.780> kind<00:04:06.109> of<00:04:06.170> indenting<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.889> text<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:07.310> it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
that's kind of indenting the text so it

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.780 
that's kind of indenting the text so it
makes<00:04:07.519> it<00:04:07.639> look<00:04:07.819> a<00:04:07.909> little<00:04:08.060> bit<00:04:08.239> nicer<00:04:09.790> now

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
makes it look a little bit nicer now

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.740 
makes it look a little bit nicer now
what<00:04:10.939> I'm<00:04:11.000> going<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.150> do<00:04:11.299> is<00:04:11.450> I'm<00:04:11.569> going<00:04:11.689> to

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.290 
the information with it now haven't
decided<00:06:09.870> how<00:06:10.140> I'm<00:06:10.230> going<00:06:10.350> to<00:06:10.410> do<00:06:10.590> the<00:06:10.710> upload

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:11.300 
decided how I'm going to do the upload

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.680 
decided how I'm going to do the upload
whether<00:06:12.300> I<00:06:12.390> do<00:06:12.570> a<00:06:13.100> PHP<00:06:14.100> upload<00:06:14.790> which<00:06:15.450> I

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
whether I do a PHP upload which I

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.110 
whether I do a PHP upload which I
probably<00:06:16.050> won't<00:06:16.440> do<00:06:16.680> because<00:06:17.040> there's<00:06:18.030> a

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
probably won't do because there's a

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.520 
probably won't do because there's a
limit<00:06:18.450> on<00:06:18.570> that<00:06:18.780> and<00:06:19.110> I'll<00:06:19.230> explain<00:06:19.440> that

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
limit on that and I'll explain that

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.490 
limit on that and I'll explain that
later<00:06:19.820> or<00:06:20.820> I<00:06:20.880> might<00:06:21.180> do<00:06:21.300> javascript<00:06:21.780> jquery

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
later or I might do javascript jquery

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.030 
later or I might do javascript jquery
upload<00:06:22.919> or<00:06:23.130> maybe<00:06:23.940> flash<00:06:24.390> I<00:06:24.919> don't<00:06:25.919> know

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 
upload or maybe flash I don't know

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.500 
upload or maybe flash I don't know
though<00:06:26.220> it'll<00:06:26.550> probably<00:06:26.760> be<00:06:26.940> javascript

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
though it'll probably be javascript

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.540 
though it'll probably be javascript
jquery<00:06:27.900> which<00:06:28.350> i<00:06:28.530> probably<00:06:28.800> won't<00:06:29.130> code<00:06:29.370> that

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
jquery which i probably won't code that

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.970 
jquery which i probably won't code that
out<00:06:29.700> i'll<00:06:29.880> just<00:06:30.030> give<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:30.240> the<00:06:30.360> code<00:06:30.510> for<00:06:30.780> it

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
out i'll just give you the code for it

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.060 
out i'll just give you the code for it
