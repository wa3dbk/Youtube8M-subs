00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.590 
water from local agriculture which
causes<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.070> be<00:01:42.100> pretty<00:01:42.520> pretty<00:01:43.030> polluted<00:01:43.450> at

causes to be pretty pretty polluted at
this<00:01:43.750> point<00:01:45.150> this<00:01:46.150> combined<00:01:46.600> with<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:47.440> high

salinity delay causes it to be pretty

salinity delay causes it to be pretty
hostile<00:01:49.690> environment<00:01:50.140> for<00:01:50.170> fish<00:01:50.500> and<00:01:50.740> other

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
breeding birds that live there and

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.510 
breeding birds that live there and
humans<00:01:53.470> for<00:01:53.950> me<00:01:54.070> I<00:01:54.400> felt<00:01:55.439> uncomfortable<00:01:56.439> and<00:01:57.189> I

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
humans for me I felt uncomfortable and I

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.429 
humans for me I felt uncomfortable and I
think<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.060> because<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:59.229> was<00:01:59.409> a

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
think that this is because it was a

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.380 
think that this is because it was a
reminder<00:02:00.010> of<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.369> impermanence<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.240> all

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
reminder of the impermanence of all

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.990 
reminder of the impermanence of all
things<00:02:01.750> of<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.799> cycle<00:02:03.340> of<00:02:03.490> life<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.880> death

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
things of the cycle of life and death

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.639 
things of the cycle of life and death
and<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.830> was<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.400> an<00:02:06.939> example<00:02:07.720> of<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.440> death

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
and this was a an example of the death

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.820 
and this was a an example of the death
of<00:02:08.920> an<00:02:09.250> idea<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:10.630> idea<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.320> tourist

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
of an idea this idea of this tourist

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.970 
of an idea this idea of this tourist
destination<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> also<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:14.200> lake<00:02:14.350> itself<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
destination and also the lake itself is

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.250 
destination and also the lake itself is
in<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.250> cycle<00:02:15.519> of<00:02:15.760> death<00:02:15.989> so<00:02:16.989> that's<00:02:17.140> how<00:02:17.230> I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
in the cycle of death so that's how I

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.050 
in the cycle of death so that's how I
felt<00:02:17.650> how<00:02:18.040> did<00:02:18.190> how<00:02:18.400> did<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.670> make<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.000> feel

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
felt how did how did it make you feel

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.479 
felt how did how did it make you feel
pretty<00:02:20.019> uncomfortable<00:02:20.049> one<00:02:20.980> get<00:02:21.280> it<00:02:21.370> out<00:02:21.430> of

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
pretty uncomfortable one get it out of

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.310 
pretty uncomfortable one get it out of
there<00:02:21.579> pretty<00:02:21.730> quickly<00:02:22.019> we've<00:02:23.019> been<00:02:23.140> there<00:02:23.260> a

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
there pretty quickly we've been there a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.560 
there pretty quickly we've been there a
