00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
canvassing perspective from mechanics a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.819 
canvassing perspective from mechanics a
super<00:00:48.300> power<00:00:48.510> company<00:00:49.140> perspective<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> very

super power company perspective a very

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.369 
super power company perspective a very
large<00:00:50.070> company<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.210> still<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.690> its<00:00:51.930> people

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
large company but still it's its people

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.860 
large company but still it's its people
and<00:00:52.559> they're<00:00:53.399> developing<00:00:53.879> cars<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.539> larger

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
scale so we still think we can get that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
scale so we still think we can get that
kind<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> family<00:00:58.680> feeling<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.460> but<00:00:59.879> it's
