00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:08.940
 to make yogurt 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.969
 milk is needed ferments 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.309
 lactics here everything to yogurt nature that's 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.230
 only that it belongs to the family 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 fermented milks so the milks 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.730
 fermented does not come from the east dp and the 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.220
 Middle East 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.689
 a unique fabrication to make a 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.300
 yogurt that's pretty simple and 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.730
 complicated at once quite simple because 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.910
 that the ingredients do not seem to me very 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.930
 simple and complicated because he's going 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.680
 have to master the steps of the process 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.200
 Manufacturing 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.170
 if that makes the difference that yogurt 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.020
 whether or not one is getting the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.379
 milk that is done directly by a 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.539
 gaec milking parlor pipe 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.469
 naughty who produces us the milk we 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.239
 transforms and puts the dostie vat that 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.500
 is called a pasteurization pastry 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.969
 if steve that will allow us to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.880
 heat the milk to a temperature of 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.250
 pasteurization that's 90 degrees and the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.159
 then cool down to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.020
 fermentation that 42 degrees then the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.900
 lactic ferments that are needed in 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.939
 the yurts sealed the two farms 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.110
 which are streptococcus 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.570
 thermophilus 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.960
 and last bacillus bulgaricus for 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:29.140
 to allow optimal development of 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.820
 fermo sites after that yogurt is 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.860
 transferred directly to the machine 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.890
 conditioning that will allow us to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.260
 package the yogurt compote 125 g on 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.340
 has a pau shop that lets you do 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.380
 drop the pot whose album the tray 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.450
 advance as you go along so at each 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.510
 Once a pot falls the tray makes a 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:53.009
 not arrive at the dosing station 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:56.110
 we note the doses and the 2 225 years 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.470
 after that happens to a percu post 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.930
 the age or the pi backed up but on the on the 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.360
 co after it's a welding machine 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.890
 it is a resistant who south father 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.960
 kull on the plastic jar 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.119
 after that happens to the post of dice allowed 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.670
 to date yurts after a theory 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.930
 eject them allard a gift that ejects him 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.720
 cm in crates etc we led to the 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.480
 fermentation room in the room 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.030
 hot the maturation chamber for the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.160
 offers are kept at 42 degrees 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.310
 for at least four hours which 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.950
 allows two 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.470
 to raise yogurt after four 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.840
 hours of fermentation the yurts are 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.599
 cooled to storage temperature 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.599
 which two between 2 and 6 degrees 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.520
 if they can be kept for 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 a period of 21 days for all our 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.020
 fabrications it's always the same basis 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.430
 that is, lactic ferments 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.240
 which will be just for yogurt 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.270
 flavored with natural aroma and 10 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.060
 sugar and for the fruit yogurts have 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.600
 made of fruit bill layer one puts a 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.220
 Fruit preparation fruit base 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.480
 on which we put a base of yoghurt 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.480
 a natural yoghurt
