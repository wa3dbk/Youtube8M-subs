because<00:00:27.720> largely<00:00:28.050> expected<00:00:28.439> we<00:00:28.890> can<00:00:29.039> do

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
because largely expected we can do

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.330 
because largely expected we can do
better<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> field<00:00:31.740> conditions

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
better but I think the field conditions

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.110 
better but I think the field conditions
were<00:00:32.969> not<00:00:33.149> very<00:00:33.420> conducive<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.110> good<00:00:34.469> football

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
were not very conducive to good football

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.450 
were not very conducive to good football
but<00:00:36.120> Beauty<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.290> may<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.649> create<00:00:37.980> too<00:00:38.309> many

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
but Beauty as it may we create too many

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.360 
but Beauty as it may we create too many
opportunities<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.899> day<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:40.980> did

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
opportunities and on the day we just did

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.410 
opportunities and on the day we just did
not<00:00:41.489> take<00:00:41.730> our<00:00:41.879> chances

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
not take our chances

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.619 
not take our chances
field<00:00:42.570> conditions<00:00:43.079> angina<00:00:44.210> it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> lot

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
field conditions angina it was a lot

it<00:00:53.670> was<00:00:53.820> very<00:00:54.059> difficult<00:00:54.300> for<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.809> players<00:00:54.930> we

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it was very difficult for the players we

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
it was very difficult for the players we
never<00:00:56.010> even<00:00:56.219> had<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.699> rhythm<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> our<00:00:57.300> game

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

opportunities<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.970> unfortunately<00:01:05.970> we<00:01:06.150> did

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
opportunities and unfortunately we did

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.429

conditions and even though the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.920 
conditions and even though the
conditions<00:02:56.860> were<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.640> best<00:02:57.849> but<00:02:58.299> we<00:02:58.599> we

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
conditions were not the best but we we

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:00.240 
conditions were not the best but we we
should<00:02:59.110> have<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.319> should<00:02:59.349> have<00:02:59.590> won<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.069> game

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
should have we should have won the game

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.680 
should have we should have won the game
like<00:03:00.430> six<00:03:00.730> or<00:03:00.879> something<00:03:01.030> cause<00:03:01.329> we<00:03:01.480> means

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
like six or something cause we means

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.990 
like six or something cause we means
clear-cut<00:03:02.650> opportunities<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.489> then<00:03:03.640> those

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
clear-cut opportunities and then those

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.520 
clear-cut opportunities and then those
are<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.420> think<00:03:04.569> that's<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.989> game<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.410> really

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
are I think that's the game that really

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.280 
are I think that's the game that really

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
that the conditions are gonna be bad but

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.990 
that the conditions are gonna be bad but

important<00:05:23.140> as<00:05:23.230> well<00:05:23.380> not<00:05:23.560> only<00:05:23.830> for<00:05:23.980> us<00:05:24.120> for

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
important as well not only for us for

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.000 
important as well not only for us for
also<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.630> guys<00:05:25.780> that<00:05:25.960> play<00:05:26.170> at<00:05:26.590> Sundance
