00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.179
 hello together and welcome 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.349
 at the baskets tv tackle news we 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.030
 Want you some great rubber today 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.430
 fischer from the special program of 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
 imagine quantum and a rubber fish 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.200
 that makes a lot of attention 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.600
 this one here this is the petticoat off 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.160
 the special program it is made 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.410
 patch eggstait as the name implies 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.150
 for the educational angela that is 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.730
 for the vertical fishing throughout 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.380
 Water column on this method on this 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.370
 Of course, we will still be engineering 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.720
 go into detail 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.550
 you can with the patch 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.250
 Of course, as normal 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.110
 we know the reason vertical fishing and 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.120
 has co-developed significantly this 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.890
 pajic freddie hubbard from the quantum 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.730
 team and of course also had 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.730
 thoroughly tested 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.550
 nice pictures freddy is well known for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.070
 his great zander catches and it 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.860
 was significantly involved lately 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.750
 hold politics quite filigree 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.040
 worked rubber fish and there is 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.370
 naturally different in itself 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.370
 variants 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.500
 We also want you this rubber 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.420
 fischer again to heart that is 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.859
 the battle.net from the quantum specials 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.539
 Program that is already a bit longer 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.399
 currently the color palette is something 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.689
 been expanded and made of this rubber 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.390
 fresh we are still heavy 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.679
 Excited at the bar unfortunately 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.440
 lends itself here in this limp 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.420
 here, of course, has 20 centimeters long 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.730
 so that already has a decent size 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 but he has two very important advantages 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.610
 is not as unlikely weighty 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.260
 not so hard 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.530
 that means he stays the whole day 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.120
 fatigue-free he flies wonderfully 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.280
 under water as you can see here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.079
 and he has a wonderful rubber mix 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.920
 I think he is at the same time 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:32.360
 very very soft and also this 47 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.459
 he hisses that too 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.799
 decent little doll had none 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.319
 problems in the 20 he begs m 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.879
 this is certainly not the case 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.190
 which is regular but as you can see 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.569
 happens and we also have good hunters 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.769
 caught on this battle estimate 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.349
 So in our opinion a whole 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.810
 You should have a fantastic bait 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.489
 look at it and that's what we are 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.230
 with the next bait the salt in the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.239
 soup may not be missing that we know 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.310
 all and also salt on the bait can not 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.840
 hurt also known and come here 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.819
 both rubbers into play 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.370
 new in quantum special the program 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:07.000
 once the sollstedter and 1 x the should 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.000
 the pin 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.790
 both the culprit and the pin there 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.320
 it in six different colors like that 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
 can you on all conditions 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.550
 Perfect on every water 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.550
 haze and the light conditions 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.690
 binz got pin you get in the sizes 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.910
 10 and 15 centimeters the salt charter in 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.910
 8 and 12 cm longer 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.090
 just a few examples from the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.890
 large children's program from quantum 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.870
 specialist There are many more 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.400
 Just click on a storm 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.720
 bit and when he ans ans with the children 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.950
 water goes then we wish you 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.950
 of course many nice fish
