00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
 has therefore explained below the 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.849
 financial 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.849
 we sat down to do anything to 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.889
 people but it's a lot of talk and it's going to 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.080
 which has to be in the harvests of having 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.900
 every three months by the same 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.180
 people that happen in there are those 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:28.080
 conversations as it was in the high up was 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 some games is and we follow a story 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.890
 of two friends in the darkness 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.239
 we thought it was James was an element 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 to be with us in this writing and medium 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.300
 the culture and then we did color only 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.260
 faded bad in the cast w or be with 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.390
 My wife is expensive and then I do not think so. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.489
 Let's say the actors all 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
 but one of the things that I think is 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.920
 impressive still yesterday I saw this and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.829
 other plagues of the team the amount of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:03.930
 rodents who sat five galleries 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.479
 125 boy is average and cheating 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.520
 potter ronaldo and messi that malta 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.100
 constant even in the race and I think 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.700
 we got it from ourselves 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.770
 besides the effort of take 5 company of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 production was made by the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.090
 technique that is commendable because I think 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.180
 this way is really important to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.740
 realize that it's possible to be serious 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.960
 this is always the same 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.600
 talk is in eva braga admits 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.450

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.310
 we as the lack of citizenship of 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.670
 some actors with the 300 medalists and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.479
 Someone else I never hope to be 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.479
 there it was me 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.600
 there was the courage rtpi installed in 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.270
 Projects height position where the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.409
 price of more and more that's me I went 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.320
 buried 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.509

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:11.650
 Clear in the work israel is at my feet 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.410
 ufpe continue contributed to the service 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.270
 public 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.060
 I'm honestly sprinkling myself if this 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.860

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.900
 wait while my big ones have 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.360
 a good example that excuses my 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.780
 promotion we saw on Tobias Street being 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.430
 presented to mp seems much more 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.970
 what has to be a service 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.170
 public and I personally do not feel 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.330
 proud to speak with English 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.110
 champion in 1993 but that's right in
