00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.370
 welcome to the youtube channel 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:13.720
 today we will see how to refill the cartridges 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:18.760
 printers without having to remember them 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:21.880
 first of all we provide for going to 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.199
 remove the cartridge that interests us 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.510
 to reload in this case what 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.240
 I'm interested in it is that of color 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:34.390
 black 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:40.109
 so let's go get the cartridge 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:43.600
 here it is as you can see I already have 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:46.539
 carried out in this part and where 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:51.579
 inside the ink a hole with a 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:55.030
 small drill once taken 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.889
 our cartridge we are going to take 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.889
 the necessary ink 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:17.670
 I've already put this syringe in it 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 then I take a little more 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.270
 small and go it is simple to take 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.690
 the ink and I was going to insert into the 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.690
 my part 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.310
 here are just so 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.680
 I'm taking my right 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.979
 here is how I said the holes that 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.979
 previously I had done 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.590
 here we go 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:29.420
 gently inserting ink 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.870
 so 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:44.840
 once this is done we go to 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:48.800
 close it again , we go to insert 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.520
 again a cartridge inside the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.520
 our printer and that's it 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.520
 thank you
