00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.529 

people<00:00:14.590> often<00:00:14.830> ask<00:00:14.949> me<00:00:15.219> where<00:00:16.000> do<00:00:16.090> you<00:00:16.150> go<00:00:16.330> how

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
people often ask me where do you go how

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.939 
people often ask me where do you go how
do<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.720> know<00:00:16.869> where<00:00:17.050> to<00:00:17.170> look<00:00:17.289> for<00:00:17.470> fossils

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:17.949 
do you know where to look for fossils

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.090 
do you know where to look for fossils
and<00:00:18.160> that's<00:00:18.520> a<00:00:18.609> very<00:00:18.789> good<00:00:18.940> question

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
and that's a very good question

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.810 
and that's a very good question
paleontologists<00:00:21.100> do<00:00:21.190> a<00:00:21.220> lot<00:00:21.400> of<00:00:21.430> research

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
paleontologists do a lot of research

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.460 
paleontologists do a lot of research
before<00:00:22.090> we<00:00:22.300> actually<00:00:22.750> get<00:00:22.900> out<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.290> the<00:00:23.440> field

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
before we actually get out to the field

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.650 
before we actually get out to the field
you<00:00:23.980> need<00:00:24.130> to<00:00:24.280> know<00:00:24.430> what<00:00:24.640> kind<00:00:24.940> of<00:00:25.030> rocks<00:00:25.300> are

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
you need to know what kind of rocks are

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.690 
you need to know what kind of rocks are
are<00:00:26.140> they're<00:00:26.350> at<00:00:26.650> they're<00:00:26.890> exposed<00:00:27.370> and

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
are they're at they're exposed and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.950 
are they're at they're exposed and
that's<00:00:27.820> very<00:00:28.030> important<00:00:28.390> because<00:00:28.539> the<00:00:28.810> age

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
that's very important because the age

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.590 
that's very important because the age
tells<00:00:29.440> us<00:00:29.590> what<00:00:29.770> animals<00:00:30.190> we<00:00:30.340> might<00:00:30.520> find<00:00:30.880> in

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:31.600 
tells us what animals we might find in

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.160 
tells us what animals we might find in
the<00:00:31.690> kind<00:00:31.990> of<00:00:32.079> rocks<00:00:32.349> are<00:00:33.250> also<00:00:33.399> important<00:00:34.170> we

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
the kind of rocks are also important we

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.319 
the kind of rocks are also important we
look<00:00:35.350> for<00:00:35.650> fossils<00:00:36.010> in<00:00:36.400> sedimentary<00:00:37.000> rocks

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
look for fossils in sedimentary rocks

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.330 
look for fossils in sedimentary rocks
rocks<00:00:37.720> that<00:00:37.989> were<00:00:38.110> laid<00:00:38.140> down<00:00:38.350> by<00:00:38.920> rivers<00:00:39.280> and

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
rocks that were laid down by rivers and

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.160 
rocks that were laid down by rivers and

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.580 
streams when these animals actually
lived<00:00:41.860> lived<00:00:42.640> here<00:00:42.970> in<00:00:43.239> this<00:00:43.540> case<00:00:43.840> about<00:00:44.170> 6<00:00:44.410> to

8 million years ago once we're out in

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
8 million years ago once we're out in
the<00:00:47.050> field<00:00:47.320> we<00:00:47.530> do<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:47.680> lot<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:47.920> walking

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
the field we do a lot of walking

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.920 
paleontologist vertebrate paleontologist
don't<00:00:51.130> do<00:00:51.579> a<00:00:51.610> lot<00:00:51.700> of<00:00:51.940> digging<00:00:52.149> necessarily

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
don't do a lot of digging necessarily

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:53.910 
don't do a lot of digging necessarily
until<00:00:53.140> we<00:00:53.200> find<00:00:53.470> something

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
until we find something

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.040 
until we find something
but<00:00:54.460> it's<00:00:54.610> prospecting<00:00:55.360> or<00:00:55.450> looking<00:00:55.809> for

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
but it's prospecting or looking for

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.100 
but it's prospecting or looking for
fossils<00:00:56.920> that<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.730> gives<00:00:57.969> us<00:00:58.180> these<00:00:58.690> clues

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
fossils that that gives us these clues

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.250 
fossils that that gives us these clues
so<00:00:59.890> we<00:00:59.920> walk<00:01:00.250> up<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.730> down<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.390> around<00:01:01.930> on<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
so we walk up and down and around on the

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.380 
so we walk up and down and around on the
badlands<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.070> and<00:01:03.399> we<00:01:03.520> look<00:01:03.700> for<00:01:03.910> bone<00:01:04.089> that's

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
badlands and and we look for bone that's

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.450 
badlands and and we look for bone that's
actually<00:01:04.780> weathering<00:01:05.259> out<00:01:05.350> eroding<00:01:06.009> out<00:01:06.159> of

the<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.600> surface<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.229> the<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:09.219> these

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
the of the surface of the of these

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.300 
the of the surface of the of these
Badlands<00:01:09.999> and<00:01:10.350> in<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.530> case<00:01:11.740> that<00:01:11.979> gives<00:01:12.130> us

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
Badlands and in that case that gives us

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.730 
Badlands and in that case that gives us
the<00:01:12.459> clues<00:01:12.789> to<00:01:13.060> what<00:01:13.209> might<00:01:13.420> be<00:01:13.560> beneath<00:01:14.560> the

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
the clues to what might be beneath the

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.919 
the clues to what might be beneath the
surface<00:01:14.950> and<00:01:15.369> this<00:01:15.429> bone<00:01:15.700> or<00:01:16.090> float<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:16.659> call

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
surface and this bone or float we call

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:19.859 
surface and this bone or float we call
it<00:01:17.399> as<00:01:18.399> we<00:01:18.579> walk<00:01:18.789> up<00:01:19.029> and<00:01:19.209> down<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.539> collects

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
it as we walk up and down it collects

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.989 
it as we walk up and down it collects
from<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.139> little<00:01:20.319> drainages<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.579> as<00:01:21.850> I

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:21.999 
from the little drainages and and as I

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.760 
from the little drainages and and as I
said<00:01:22.060> that<00:01:22.389> gives<00:01:22.569> us<00:01:22.719> an<00:01:22.869> idea<00:01:23.049> of<00:01:23.409> what<00:01:23.560> might

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
said that gives us an idea of what might

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.980 
said that gives us an idea of what might
be<00:01:23.799> beneath<00:01:24.219> the<00:01:24.369> surface<00:01:24.579> once<00:01:25.509> we<00:01:25.659> find

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
be beneath the surface once we find

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.169 
be beneath the surface once we find
something<00:01:26.380> then<00:01:26.770> we<00:01:26.950> can<00:01:27.130> sit<00:01:27.310> down<00:01:27.340> take<00:01:27.999> our

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
something then we can sit down take our

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.510 
something then we can sit down take our
tools<00:01:28.420> out<00:01:28.630> of<00:01:28.659> our<00:01:28.810> pack<00:01:29.079> and<00:01:29.409> slowly<00:01:30.219> with

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
tools out of our pack and slowly with

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.359 
tools out of our pack and slowly with
with<00:01:30.789> brushes<00:01:31.299> and<00:01:31.539> small<00:01:31.840> picks<00:01:32.369> expose

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
with brushes and small picks expose

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.459 
with brushes and small picks expose
what's<00:01:33.759> there<00:01:34.060> and<00:01:34.299> if<00:01:34.719> you<00:01:34.840> found<00:01:35.049> something

00:01:35.459 --> 00:01:35.469 
what's there and if you found something

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:37.230 
what's there and if you found something
of<00:01:35.619> note<00:01:35.829> then<00:01:36.069> you'll<00:01:36.310> it'll<00:01:36.729> be<00:01:36.909> good<00:01:37.090> you

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
of note then you'll it'll be good you

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.940 
of note then you'll it'll be good you
can<00:01:37.389> stop<00:01:37.599> walking<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.200> can<00:01:38.349> sit<00:01:38.529> there<00:01:38.709> for<00:01:38.920> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
can stop walking you can sit there for a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.910 
can stop walking you can sit there for a
while<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.999> we<00:01:40.029> do<00:01:40.299> a<00:01:40.329> lot<00:01:40.569> of<00:01:40.599> walking<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.259> up

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
while so we do a lot of walking and up

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.580 
while so we do a lot of walking and up
and<00:01:42.159> down<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.670> looking<00:01:42.969> at<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.149> geology

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
and down and looking at the geology

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.899 
and down and looking at the geology
looking<00:01:44.590> at<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:44.829> right<00:01:44.979> levels<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.639> even

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
looking at the right levels is even

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.550 
looking at the right levels is even
where<00:01:45.999> I'm<00:01:46.090> sitting<00:01:46.450> now<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:46.869> was<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.380> was

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
where I'm sitting now this was this was

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.629 
where I'm sitting now this was this was
an<00:01:47.740> old<00:01:47.919> an<00:01:48.729> ancient<00:01:49.119> riverbed<00:01:49.630> river<00:01:50.079> system
