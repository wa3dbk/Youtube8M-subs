00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.870 
video we're gonna start bringing in some
light<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.860> working<00:01:41.190> on<00:01:41.490> improving

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
light and really working on improving

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.790 
light and really working on improving
the<00:01:42.050> direction<00:01:43.050> of<00:01:43.170> light<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.650> now

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
the direction of light because right now

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.890 
the direction of light because right now
we're<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> shade<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> that<00:01:45.540> allows<00:01:45.720> me<00:01:45.870> to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
we're in the shade so that allows me to

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.120 
we're in the shade so that allows me to
control<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> lights<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.710> we'll<00:01:46.860> bring<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
control the lights so we'll bring in a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.090 
control the lights so we'll bring in a
light<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> next<00:01:47.700> video

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
light in the next video

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.330 
light in the next video
all<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:50.460> should<00:01:50.610> be<00:01:50.700> better

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.090 

taking<00:01:56.340> you<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.580> maybe<00:01:57.030> do<00:01:57.330> you<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:58.100> yeah

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
maybe bring your other hand up too so I

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.679 
maybe bring your other hand up too so I
can<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:00.960> shot<00:02:01.170> okay<00:02:01.530> great

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.660 

so<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.590> can<00:02:08.709> see<00:02:08.860> from<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.190> image<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:09.610> a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
so you can see from that image it's a

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.850 
so you can see from that image it's a
lot<00:02:09.880> better<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.239> actually<00:02:10.509> did<00:02:10.929> a<00:02:11.140> crop<00:02:11.590> at

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
lot better I actually did a crop at

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.320 
lot better I actually did a crop at
about<00:02:12.099> the<00:02:12.220> waist<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.790> I<00:02:12.849> got<00:02:13.000> both<00:02:13.209> their

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
about the waist and I got both their

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.790 
about the waist and I got both their
arms<00:02:13.599> in<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:13.810> don't<00:02:13.959> like<00:02:14.080> to<00:02:14.200> crop<00:02:14.380> the<00:02:14.530> arms

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
arms in I don't like to crop the arms

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.470 
arms in I don't like to crop the arms
out<00:02:14.950> but<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.700> see<00:02:15.849> that's<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.300> much

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
out but you can see that's a much

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.120 
out but you can see that's a much
improved<00:02:16.630> shot<00:02:16.989> over<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> other<00:02:17.680> one<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.950> just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
improved shot over the other one so just

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.309 
improved shot over the other one so just
to<00:02:18.220> recap<00:02:18.550> it's<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.239> rule<00:02:19.390> of<00:02:19.540> thirds<00:02:19.690> it's<00:02:20.200> a

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
to recap it's the rule of thirds it's a

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.160 
to recap it's the rule of thirds it's a
focal<00:02:20.650> point<00:02:20.680> its<00:02:21.550> depth<00:02:22.000> its<00:02:22.300> leading<00:02:22.900> lines

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
focal point its depth its leading lines

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.960 
focal point its depth its leading lines
and<00:02:23.650> removing<00:02:24.400> distractions<00:02:24.489> from<00:02:24.880> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
and removing distractions from the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.180 
and removing distractions from the
background
