the two bolts holes one right here and
one<00:00:39.950> down<00:00:40.950> here<00:00:41.390> where<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.660> Caliphate<00:00:43.079> was

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
one down here where the Caliphate was

00:00:43.379 --> 00:01:09.730 
one down here where the Caliphate was
connected<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.190> vehicle

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
poking up and I'm gonna get the other

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:30.280 
poking up and I'm gonna get the other
one

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
one

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:38.889 
one
the<00:01:31.220> lower<00:01:31.430> one<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:35.290> put<00:01:36.290> it<00:01:36.409> in<00:01:37.750> till<00:01:38.750> it's

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
the lower one and put it in till it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.230 
the lower one and put it in till it's
barely<00:01:39.170> poking<00:01:39.320> out<00:01:39.680> or<00:01:40.670> inch<00:01:40.820> all<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.030> rust

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
barely poking out or inch all the rust

00:01:41.240 --> 00:02:02.050 
barely poking out or inch all the rust
stops<00:01:41.630> me<00:01:41.840> from<00:01:41.979> screening<00:02:00.850> it's<00:02:01.850> kind<00:02:02.030> of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
stops me from screening it's kind of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.550 
stops me from screening it's kind of
hard<00:02:02.210> to<00:02:02.270> do<00:02:02.479> this<00:02:02.630> I've<00:02:02.840> kind<00:02:03.229> of<00:02:03.289> got<00:02:03.440> the

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
hard to do this I've kind of got the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.600 
hard to do this I've kind of got the
camera<00:02:04.119> where<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.149> need<00:02:05.330> to<00:02:05.420> work<00:02:06.399> let<00:02:07.399> me<00:02:07.429> see

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
camera where I need to work let me see

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.370 
camera where I need to work let me see
if<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.759> got<00:02:07.880> part<00:02:08.149> passed<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.630> hard<00:02:08.810> spot<00:02:09.080> can

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
if I got part passed the hard spot can

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:21.900 
if I got part passed the hard spot can
do<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:09.679> by<00:02:09.830> hand

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:42.530 

so<00:02:28.660> yeah<00:02:29.660> there's<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.050> camera<00:02:30.350> there

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.640 

okay<00:02:43.540> that's<00:02:43.749> starting<00:02:44.079> to<00:02:44.109> poke<00:02:44.319> out<00:02:44.469> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
okay that's starting to poke out the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.929 
okay that's starting to poke out the
other<00:02:44.769> side<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.249> really<00:02:45.459> tough<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:45.849> I'm

00:02:45.929 --> 00:02:45.939 
other side it's really tough so I'm

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.989 
other side it's really tough so I'm
gonna<00:02:46.030> give<00:02:46.269> it<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.689> little<00:02:47.439> bit<00:02:47.650> through

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:47.999 
gonna give it a little bit through

00:02:47.999 --> 00:03:02.490 
gonna give it a little bit through
threads<00:02:48.999> before<00:02:49.209> I<00:02:50.939> go<00:02:51.939> any<00:02:52.150> further<00:03:01.500> it's

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
threads before I go any further it's

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.309 
threads before I go any further it's
just<00:03:02.709> about<00:03:02.920> even<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> inside<00:03:03.819> and<00:03:04.319> it

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
just about even on the inside and it

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.309 
just about even on the inside and it
barely<00:03:05.620> hits<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.099> inside<00:03:06.430> of<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:07.299> rotor<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.290> I

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
barely hits the inside of the rotor so I

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.990 
barely hits the inside of the rotor so I
need<00:03:08.739> some<00:03:08.980> metal<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.370> put<00:03:09.519> in<00:03:09.639> there<00:03:09.819> you

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
need some metal to put in there you

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.589 
need some metal to put in there you
might<00:03:10.989> recognize<00:03:11.439> these<00:03:11.909> this<00:03:12.909> is<00:03:13.120> some<00:03:13.359> shock

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
might recognize these this is some shock

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.679 
might recognize these this is some shock
armor<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:15.010> I'm<00:03:15.549> gonna<00:03:15.730> use<00:03:15.849> this<00:03:16.090> flat<00:03:16.389> spot

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:16.689 
armor and I'm gonna use this flat spot

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.649 
armor and I'm gonna use this flat spot
right<00:03:16.840> here<00:03:17.760> I'm<00:03:18.760> gonna<00:03:18.969> put<00:03:19.209> it<00:03:19.299> down<00:03:19.449> in

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:19.659 
right here I'm gonna put it down in

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.800 
right here I'm gonna put it down in
there<00:03:20.310> no<00:03:21.310> block<00:03:21.519> view<00:03:21.939> but<00:03:22.329> I'm<00:03:22.419> gonna<00:03:22.540> put<00:03:22.719> it

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
there no block view but I'm gonna put it

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.530 
there no block view but I'm gonna put it
in<00:03:22.900> there<00:03:23.079> to<00:03:23.169> where<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.319> bolt<00:03:23.650> hits<00:03:23.919> that

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
in there to where the bolt hits that

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.689 
in there to where the bolt hits that
instead<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.629> the<00:03:25.719> rotor<00:03:25.930> because<00:03:26.439> I<00:03:26.560> don't<00:03:26.769> I'm

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699 
instead of the rotor because I don't I'm

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.699 
instead of the rotor because I don't I'm
wanting<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.150> turn<00:03:28.900> these<00:03:29.079> rotors<00:03:29.439> I<00:03:29.560> don't

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
wanting to turn these rotors I don't

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.280 
wanting to turn these rotors I don't
really<00:03:29.829> want<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.069> get<00:03:30.189> rid<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.400> them<00:03:30.669> so<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:32.260> mean

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.910

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.140 

I'm<00:03:44.920> simply<00:03:45.160> gonna<00:03:45.400> tighten<00:03:46.360> this<00:03:47.760> until<00:03:48.760> it

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
I'm simply gonna tighten this until it

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.930 
I'm simply gonna tighten this until it
