00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.050 
you really don't as you notice it's it's
it<00:02:16.830> takes<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.220> little<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.640> effort<00:02:17.760> to<00:02:17.910> get

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
it takes a little bit of effort to get

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.610 
it takes a little bit of effort to get
them<00:02:18.240> off<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.569> basically<00:02:18.720> unwind<00:02:19.350> them<00:02:19.500> and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
them off you basically unwind them and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.770 
them off you basically unwind them and
pull<00:02:19.740> them<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:19.950> so<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.580> gets<00:02:20.790> its<00:02:21.209> it's

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
pull them out so it gets its it's

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.290 
pull them out so it gets its it's
secured<00:02:22.319> now<00:02:22.860> another<00:02:23.100> feature<00:02:23.370> about<00:02:24.000> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
secured now another feature about the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.500 
secured now another feature about the
with<00:02:24.750> these<00:02:24.930> headsets<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.850> dis<00:02:26.850> swappable

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
with these headsets is dis swappable

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.990 
with these headsets is dis swappable
cables<00:02:28.410> now<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.709> says<00:02:29.010> swappable<00:02:29.490> cable<00:02:29.880> but<00:02:29.970> i

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
cables now it says swappable cable but i

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.160 
cables now it says swappable cable but i
want<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.209> keep<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.510> mind<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.110> is

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
want to keep it in mind that this is

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.740 
want to keep it in mind that this is
actually<00:02:31.890> not<00:02:32.459> quite<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.850> swappable<00:02:33.209> cable<00:02:33.630> it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
actually not quite a swappable cable it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.570 
actually not quite a swappable cable it
what<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.020> is<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.500> swappable<00:02:34.860> connector

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
what it is it's a swappable connector

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.510 
what it is it's a swappable connector
you<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.030> actually<00:02:36.510> pull<00:02:36.930> out<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:38.100> connector

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
you can actually pull out the connector

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.260 
you can actually pull out the connector
and<00:02:39.080> you<00:02:40.080> have<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.410> choice<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.739> a<00:02:41.459> microphone

just having a regular you know headphone

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
just having a regular you know headphone
connector<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.910> if<00:02:54.120> you're<00:02:54.330> using<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:55.200> you're

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
just want to listen to music this is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.440 
just want to listen to music this is
probably<00:02:58.739> be<00:02:59.130> more<00:02:59.430> appropriate<00:02:59.489> for<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.330> but

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
probably be more appropriate for you but

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.030 
probably be more appropriate for you but
if<00:03:00.540> you're<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.750> your<00:03:00.870> laptop<00:03:01.080> your<00:03:01.530> desktop<00:03:01.560> or

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
if you're on your laptop your desktop or

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.680 
if you're on your laptop your desktop or
a<00:03:02.190> device<00:03:02.489> where<00:03:02.819> you<00:03:02.850> want<00:03:03.180> to<00:03:03.239> actually<00:03:03.420> play

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
a device where you want to actually play

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.870 
a device where you want to actually play
games<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.860> would<00:03:05.100> probably<00:03:05.250> be<00:03:05.459> more

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
games this would probably be more

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.040 
games this would probably be more
appropriate<00:03:05.940> if<00:03:06.480> you're<00:03:06.600> playing<00:03:06.810> like<00:03:07.019> a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
appropriate if you're playing like a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.960 
appropriate if you're playing like a
first-person<00:03:07.410> shooter<00:03:07.800> or<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.430> multiplayer

game<00:03:09.120> any<00:03:09.780> multiplayer<00:03:10.170> game<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.530> requires

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
game any multiplayer game that requires

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.670 
game any multiplayer game that requires
you<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.250> basically<00:03:11.730> be<00:03:12.090> on<00:03:12.239> teamspeak<00:03:12.510> or<00:03:13.080> have

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you to basically be on teamspeak or have

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.520 
you to basically be on teamspeak or have
a<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.489> know<00:03:14.580> just<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.180> team<00:03:15.660> communication

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
a you know just that team communication

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.440 
a you know just that team communication
this<00:03:17.190> will<00:03:17.430> probably<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.760> your<00:03:17.880> choice<00:03:18.209> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
this will probably be your choice so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.940 
this will probably be your choice so
right<00:03:18.720> off<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.870> bat<00:03:19.110> you're<00:03:19.530> killing<00:03:19.799> two

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
right off the bat you're killing two

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
birds with one stone you don't have to

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.350 
birds with one stone you don't have to
pack<00:03:21.570> one<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:21.900> those<00:03:21.989> bulky<00:03:22.530> headsets<00:03:23.180> to<00:03:24.180> walk

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
pack one of those bulky headsets to walk

around now another great feature of this
is<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:28.970> tangle<00:03:29.970> free<00:03:30.890> basically<00:03:31.890> it's<00:03:32.160> just

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
is the tangle free basically it's just

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.020 
is the tangle free basically it's just
the<00:03:33.440> flat<00:03:34.440> notes<00:03:34.860> handle<00:03:35.250> cables<00:03:35.640> well<00:03:35.820> that's

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
the flat notes handle cables well that's

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.940 
the flat notes handle cables well that's
what<00:03:36.150> they're<00:03:36.269> calling<00:03:36.510> it<00:03:36.690> I'll<00:03:37.620> bring<00:03:37.799> this

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
what they're calling it I'll bring this

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.410 
what they're calling it I'll bring this
closer<00:03:38.190> to<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.459> camera<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.000> see<00:03:39.209> right

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
closer to the camera you can see right

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.729 
closer to the camera you can see right
there<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.750> cables<00:03:40.079> were<00:03:40.200> actually<00:03:40.590> pretty

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
there the cables were actually pretty

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.810

I wanna scrunch them up right now just

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.479 
I wanna scrunch them up right now just
scrunch<00:03:48.780> them<00:03:48.900> up<00:03:49.040> try<00:03:50.040> to<00:03:50.100> give<00:03:50.280> them<00:03:50.400> as

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
scrunch them up try to give them as

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.610 
scrunch them up try to give them as
tangled<00:03:50.850> as<00:03:50.940> possible<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.930> all<00:03:52.140> I<00:03:52.170> have<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.500> do
