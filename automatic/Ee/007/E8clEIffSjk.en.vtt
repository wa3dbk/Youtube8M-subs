right with the iPod Classic then what I
am<00:00:02.850> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.870> do<00:00:04.170> is<00:00:04.609> take<00:00:05.609> out<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:05.850> old

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:07.880 
am going to do is take out the old

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.120 
am going to do is take out the old
assembly<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.150> put<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.510> a<00:00:09.660> new<00:00:09.900> one<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.679> these

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
assembly and put in a new one of these

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.759 
assembly and put in a new one of these
now<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.690> I'll<00:00:12.690> say<00:00:12.870> assembly<00:00:13.290> because<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:13.620> is

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
now this I'll say assembly because it is

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.770 
now this I'll say assembly because it is
what<00:00:14.250> you've<00:00:14.370> got<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.790> this<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> back<00:00:15.509> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
what you've got here this at the back of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.019 
what you've got here this at the back of
the<00:00:16.139> switch<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:17.220> lock<00:00:17.400> switch<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.880> goes

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
the switch the lock switch that goes

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.720 
the switch the lock switch that goes
there<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.660> that's<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> headphone<00:00:20.460> socket

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
there and that's the headphone socket

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.929 
there and that's the headphone socket
that<00:00:21.150> goes<00:00:21.330> here<00:00:21.720> everything<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.410> fitted

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
that goes here everything is fitted

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.929 
that goes here everything is fitted
instead<00:00:23.939> of<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.119> top<00:00:24.330> part<00:00:24.630> of<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> back<00:00:25.080> case

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
instead of the top part of the back case

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.400 
instead of the top part of the back case
because<00:00:26.939> what<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:27.119> think<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.449> going<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.140> just

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
because what I think is going on is just

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.320 
because what I think is going on is just
this<00:00:28.710> switches<00:00:29.429> may<00:00:29.580> be<00:00:29.640> worn<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.210> gone

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
this switches may be worn out and gone

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.139 
this switches may be worn out and gone
faulty<00:00:30.810> something<00:00:31.230> like<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.619> that's<00:00:32.149> so

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
faulty something like that that's so

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.889 
faulty something like that that's so
it's<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.450> able<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.750> do<00:00:34.500> his<00:00:34.649> job<00:00:34.680> anymore<00:00:35.899> he

testing to see if it's okay okay the new

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.080 
testing to see if it's okay okay the new
assembly<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:07.470> about<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.820> saw<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
assembly just about in the only saw the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.580 
assembly just about in the only saw the
last<00:01:09.299> thing<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> do<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.350> stick

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
last thing to do really is just stick

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.969 
last thing to do really is just stick
that<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> takedown<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.689> holds<00:01:13.380> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that but a takedown that holds the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.950 
that but a takedown that holds the
shoulder<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.970> loom<00:01:15.210> damn<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.720> gives<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
shoulder of the loom damn just gives it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.649 
shoulder of the loom damn just gives it
a<00:01:16.020> bit<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.200> support<00:01:16.939> that<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.119> go<00:01:18.270> down<00:01:18.479> nice

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
a bit of support that will go down nice

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
a bit of support that will go down nice
and<00:01:18.720> flat<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.619> battery<00:01:20.100> goes<00:01:20.250> back<00:01:20.520> on

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
and flat when the battery goes back on

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.410 
and flat when the battery goes back on
top<00:01:21.140> this<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.729> connected<00:01:24.180> into

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
top this will go to be connected into

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.030 
top this will go to be connected into
the<00:01:24.450> main<00:01:24.720> board<00:01:24.960> underneath<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.590> hard<00:01:25.740> drive

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
the main board underneath the hard drive

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.760 
the main board underneath the hard drive
and<00:01:26.340> then<00:01:27.030> we'll<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> moving<00:01:28.320> again<00:01:28.380> see

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and then we'll get it moving again see

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.950 
and then we'll get it moving again see
if<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> fit<00:01:29.159> okay<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.939> iPod<00:01:30.689> again

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
if it fit okay this is the iPod again

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.929 
if it fit okay this is the iPod again
just<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.979> together<00:01:32.159> as<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.670> see

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just about back together as you can see

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.390 
just about back together as you can see
I<00:01:33.210> haven't<00:01:33.960> clipped<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> screen<00:01:34.619> back<00:01:34.860> in<00:01:35.070> yet

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
iPod just sort of switch off and do its

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.920 
iPod just sort of switch off and do its
own<00:02:38.560> thing<00:02:38.790> as<00:02:39.790> soon<00:02:39.910> as<00:02:40.060> I'm<00:02:40.180> not<00:02:40.360> controlling

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
own thing as soon as I'm not controlling

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.740 
own thing as soon as I'm not controlling
it<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:41.550> by<00:02:42.550> now<00:02:42.760> with<00:02:43.060> the<00:02:43.090> old<00:02:43.300> one<00:02:43.420> as<00:02:43.630> you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
it now by now with the old one as you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.510 
it now by now with the old one as you
saw<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.050> lock<00:02:44.890> symbol<00:02:45.100> would<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.430> been

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
saw the lock symbol would have been

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.900 
saw the lock symbol would have been
flickering<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.209> enough<00:02:47.490> as<00:02:48.490> though<00:02:48.730> there

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
flickering on enough as though there

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.670 
flickering on enough as though there
were<00:02:48.940> issues<00:02:49.570> with<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.020> obviously<00:02:50.350> with<00:02:50.560> it

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
were issues with it obviously with it

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.900 
were issues with it obviously with it
telling<00:02:51.070> the<00:02:51.790> iPod<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.570> lock<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.670> click<00:02:54.670> wheel

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
telling the iPod to lock the click wheel

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.090 
telling the iPod to lock the click wheel
and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:55.750> unlock<00:02:56.050> it<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.470> really<00:02:56.680> quickly

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
and then unlock it really really quickly

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.380 
and then unlock it really really quickly
so<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.370> must<00:02:57.550> have<00:02:57.640> been<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.760> contact<00:02:58.240> issue

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
so it must have been a contact issue

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.870 
so it must have been a contact issue
with<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.440> old<00:03:01.140> switch<00:03:02.140> itself<00:03:02.680> well<00:03:03.640> that<00:03:03.790> all

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
with the old switch itself well that all

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.410 
with the old switch itself well that all
seems<00:03:04.120> ok

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.300 

I'm<00:03:07.959> recording<00:03:08.230> this<00:03:08.500> part<00:03:08.770> of<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.920> movie<00:03:09.099> now

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
I'm recording this part of the movie now

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.460 
I'm recording this part of the movie now
for<00:03:09.459> nearly<00:03:09.550> two<00:03:09.819> minutes<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.420> seems<00:03:10.660> much

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
for nearly two minutes and it seems much

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.690 
for nearly two minutes and it seems much
more<00:03:11.500> consistent<00:03:12.280> than<00:03:12.340> what<00:03:12.520> we've<00:03:12.670> seen

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
more consistent than what we've seen

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.900 
more consistent than what we've seen
previously<00:03:13.450> in<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> movie<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.770> also<00:03:14.920> what

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
previously in the movie and also what

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.470 
previously in the movie and also what
I've<00:03:16.090> seen<00:03:16.480> when<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.230> first<00:03:17.440> came<00:03:18.360> so<00:03:19.360> the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
I've seen when it first came so the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.510 
I've seen when it first came so the
screen<00:03:19.720> still<00:03:20.020> on<00:03:20.140> backlight<00:03:20.560> is<00:03:20.739> off<00:03:20.920> though

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
screen still on backlight is off though

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.390 
screen still on backlight is off though
saving<00:03:21.849> the<00:03:22.270> power<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.410> battery<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:24.280> I'm

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
saving the power in the battery so I'm

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.309 
saving the power in the battery so I'm
just<00:03:24.520> going<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.700> leave<00:03:24.850> it<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.239> now<00:03:25.420> see<00:03:26.260> how

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
just going to leave it and now see how

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.150 
just going to leave it and now see how
it<00:03:26.500> goes<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.310> then<00:03:27.459> we'll<00:03:27.520> be<00:03:27.730> back<00:03:27.760> soon
