00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.029 
actually four by five and a quarter and
so<00:00:50.359> it<00:00:50.479> layers<00:00:50.719> on<00:00:50.989> top<00:00:51.019> of<00:00:51.379> that<00:00:51.469> card<00:00:51.829> base

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.670 
the happy birthday stamp and that's
going<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.299> go<00:03:59.420> in<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.659> Lost<00:03:59.870> Lagoon<00:04:00.080> and<00:04:00.470> come

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
going to go in the Lost Lagoon and come

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.520 
going to go in the Lost Lagoon and come
in<00:04:00.950> right<00:04:01.220> here<00:04:01.519> at<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:01.700> bottom<00:04:02.170> so<00:04:03.170> this<00:04:03.379> is<00:04:03.409> a

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
in right here at the bottom so this is a

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.420 
in right here at the bottom so this is a
very<00:04:03.680> simple<00:04:04.010> call

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
very simple call

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.940 
very simple call
it's<00:04:04.819> just<00:04:05.209> doing<00:04:05.989> that<00:04:06.230> background<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.859> then

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
it's just doing that background and then

bit as you can see here I'm going to use

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.140 
bit as you can see here I'm going to use
the<00:04:38.599> edge<00:04:38.750> of<00:04:38.870> this<00:04:39.020> one<00:04:39.259> and<00:04:39.849> just<00:04:40.849> a<00:04:41.000> little

then this whole piece is going to get

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:17.879 
then this whole piece is going to get
added<00:04:58.250> to<00:05:01.570> the<00:05:02.570> base<00:05:06.039> of<00:05:07.039> my<00:05:07.610> card

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:28.909 

that<00:05:21.569> and<00:05:22.569> then<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.080> might<00:05:23.379> just<00:05:23.620> go<00:05:23.800> ahead<00:05:23.919> and

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.839 

just<00:05:29.919> add<00:05:30.189> a<00:05:30.219> little<00:05:30.580> bit<00:05:30.729> of<00:05:30.789> texture<00:05:31.210> and

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:32.849 
just add a little bit of texture and

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.469 
just add a little bit of texture and
maybe<00:05:35.550> top<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:36.789> firm<00:05:36.999> right<00:05:37.240> to<00:05:37.389> the

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
maybe top of the firm right to the

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.480 
maybe top of the firm right to the
inside<00:05:37.900> just<00:05:38.139> to<00:05:38.229> give<00:05:38.439> it<00:05:38.469> some<00:05:38.800> just<00:05:39.400> a

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
inside just to give it some just a

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.769 
inside just to give it some just a
little<00:05:39.699> bit<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:39.879> something<00:05:40.029> on<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.419> inside

00:05:40.769 --> 00:05:40.779 
little bit of something on the inside

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:42.600 
little bit of something on the inside
and<00:05:41.020> then<00:05:41.409> the<00:05:41.499> last<00:05:41.650> thing<00:05:41.889> I<00:05:42.069> did<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.430> I<00:05:42.550> came

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
and then the last thing I did is I came

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.390 
and then the last thing I did is I came
in<00:05:42.999> with<00:05:43.150> some<00:05:43.389> of<00:05:43.509> my<00:05:43.539> rhinestones<00:05:44.229> and<00:05:44.529> a

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
in with some of my rhinestones and a

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.980 
in with some of my rhinestones and a
blend<00:05:45.610> ability<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.270> these<00:05:46.840> are

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
blend ability and these are

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:48.839 
blend ability and these are
alcohol-based<00:05:47.439> markers<00:05:48.039> this<00:05:48.189> happens<00:05:48.550> to<00:05:48.729> be

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:48.849 
alcohol-based markers this happens to be

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:51.779 
alcohol-based markers this happens to be
the<00:05:49.120> medium<00:05:49.629> old<00:05:50.139> olive<00:05:50.590> and<00:05:50.919> I'm<00:05:51.460> going<00:05:51.610> to<00:05:51.639> go

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
the medium old olive and I'm going to go

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:55.800 
the medium old olive and I'm going to go
ahead<00:05:51.819> and<00:05:52.270> color<00:05:52.509> a<00:05:53.819> couple<00:05:54.819> of<00:05:55.029> rhinestone

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
ahead and color a couple of rhinestone

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.300 
ahead and color a couple of rhinestone
embellishments<00:05:56.529> and<00:05:57.120> change<00:05:58.120> them<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.449> green

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
embellishments and change them to green

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.619 
embellishments and change them to green
and<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.400> nice<00:06:00.550> thing<00:06:00.580> about<00:06:00.819> this<00:06:01.090> is<00:06:01.150> that<00:06:01.360> it

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
and the nice thing about this is that it

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.529 
and the nice thing about this is that it
dries<00:06:02.219> almost<00:06:03.219> immediately<00:06:03.969> on<00:06:04.240> those

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
dries almost immediately on those

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.240 
dries almost immediately on those
rhinestones<00:06:04.900> and<00:06:05.439> then<00:06:05.620> they<00:06:05.770> can<00:06:05.949> just<00:06:05.979> be

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
rhinestones and then they can just be

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.059 
rhinestones and then they can just be
picked<00:06:06.490> up<00:06:06.639> with<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:06.879> scissor<00:06:07.240> or<00:06:07.949> with<00:06:08.949> your

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
picked up with a scissor or with your

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.689 
picked up with a scissor or with your
fingers<00:06:09.460> whichever<00:06:09.879> works<00:06:10.089> best<00:06:10.240> and<00:06:10.779> just

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
fingers whichever works best and just

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:13.980 
fingers whichever works best and just
for<00:06:12.699> the<00:06:12.729> fun<00:06:13.029> of<00:06:13.060> it<00:06:13.240> i'm<00:06:13.419> just<00:06:13.569> going<00:06:13.750> to<00:06:13.810> add
