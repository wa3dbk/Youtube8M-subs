probably know that I'm pretty terrible
at<00:00:05.160> liner<00:00:05.400> and<00:00:05.819> but<00:00:06.240> it's<00:00:06.359> something<00:00:06.600> I'd<00:00:06.660> like

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
to be able to do and I tried the lazy

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.440 
to be able to do and I tried the lazy
Nezumi<00:00:09.570> product<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.440> Photoshop<00:00:11.099> as<00:00:11.670> it's<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
Nezumi product in Photoshop as it's the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.959 
Nezumi product in Photoshop as it's the
program<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.809> used<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.230> most<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.710> didn't<00:00:14.670> really

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
program I used the most I didn't really

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.519 
program I used the most I didn't really
like<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:15.420> much<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.630> didn't<00:00:15.960> feel<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> did

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
like you so much you didn't feel it did

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.439 
like you so much you didn't feel it did
anything<00:00:16.890> different<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.119> video<00:00:18.270> I'm

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
anything different so in this video I'm

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.700 
anything different so in this video I'm
just<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.720> be<00:00:18.810> comparing<00:00:19.410> using

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
just going to be comparing using

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.550 
just going to be comparing using
Photoshop<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.609> manga<00:00:21.210> studio<00:00:21.560> specifically

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
Photoshop and manga studio specifically

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.730 
Photoshop and manga studio specifically
Photoshop<00:00:23.130> cs6<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:24.060> Manga<00:00:24.539> Studio<00:00:24.570> 5<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.590> think

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
Photoshop cs6 and Manga Studio 5 I think

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.009 
Photoshop cs6 and Manga Studio 5 I think
is<00:00:26.119> so<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.269> did<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.599> last<00:00:27.869> video

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
is so if you did see that last video

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.839 
is so if you did see that last video
you'll<00:00:28.380> probably<00:00:28.619> notice<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:29.099> inking<00:00:29.609> over

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
you'll probably notice I'm inking over

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.510 
you'll probably notice I'm inking over
the<00:00:29.939> exact<00:00:30.210> same<00:00:30.390> face<00:00:31.009> again<00:00:32.009> starting<00:00:32.460> in

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
the exact same face again starting in

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.970 
the exact same face again starting in
Photoshop<00:00:33.200> using<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> standard

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Photoshop using one of the standard

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
Photoshop using one of the standard
preset<00:00:35.460> brushes<00:00:36.059> which<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.600> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
preset brushes which is a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.190 
preset brushes which is a
pressure-sensitive<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:39.210> time<00:00:39.420> I'm

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pressure-sensitive one and this time I'm

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.380 
pressure-sensitive one and this time I'm
using<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.680> size<00:00:40.860> 15<00:00:41.399> brush<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.940> I'm<00:00:42.000> doing<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
using a size 15 brush and I'm doing this

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.490 
using a size 15 brush and I'm doing this
a<00:00:42.450> little<00:00:42.570> bit<00:00:42.750> bigger<00:00:42.930> than<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> last

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a little bit bigger than in the last

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.740 
a little bit bigger than in the last
video<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> I'm<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.850> keep<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.539> size

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
video and I'm going to keep same size

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.630 
video and I'm going to keep same size
brush<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.320> goes<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.469> Manga<00:00:46.860> Studio<00:00:46.890> 5<00:00:47.219> as

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
brush when it goes to Manga Studio 5 as

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.910 
brush when it goes to Manga Studio 5 as
well<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> better<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.320> say<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.590> I'm<00:00:49.680> not

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
well it's better to say that I'm not

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.139 
well it's better to say that I'm not
very<00:00:50.100> good<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.309> line<00:00:50.550> art<00:00:50.760> as<00:00:50.879> well<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.120> not

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
very good at line art as well it's not

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
very good at line art as well it's not
something<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.660> very<00:00:51.930> often<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> will

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
something to do very often but I will

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.189 
something to do very often but I will
say<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.190> using<00:00:53.760> Photoshop<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.809> comparison

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
say that using Photoshop in comparison

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.139 
say that using Photoshop in comparison
with<00:00:55.260> other<00:00:55.410> programs<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> comes<00:00:57.000> to

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
with other programs when it comes to

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
with other programs when it comes to
lineup<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.379> feels<00:00:58.620> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
lineup it just it feels like the the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.670 
lineup it just it feels like the the
pressure<00:01:00.210> sensitivity<00:01:00.629> doesn't<00:01:01.109> seem<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
pressure sensitivity doesn't seem to

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.429 
pressure sensitivity doesn't seem to
work<00:01:01.829> so<00:01:02.219> well<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> struggle<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.199> like

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
work so well so I struggle with like

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.560 
work so well so I struggle with like
creating<00:01:05.189> different<00:01:05.670> line<00:01:05.880> wear<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.360> such

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
creating different line wear and such

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.750 
creating different line wear and such
and<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:07.470> generally<00:01:07.920> inking<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.340> Photoshop

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
and just generally inking in Photoshop

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.670 
and just generally inking in Photoshop
my<00:01:08.880> lines<00:01:09.030> just<00:01:09.180> feel<00:01:09.390> fat<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.750> messy<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
my lines just feel fat and messy it's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.780 
my lines just feel fat and messy it's
the<00:01:10.740> only<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.010> could<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> describe

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
the only way I could think to describe

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
the only way I could think to describe
it<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.119> I've<00:01:13.049> taken<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.409> same<00:01:13.680> sketch<00:01:14.040> now

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
it so I've taken that same sketch now

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.390 
it so I've taken that same sketch now
into<00:01:14.610> manga<00:01:14.850> studio<00:01:15.119> 5<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.990> again<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:17.130> time

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
into manga studio 5 and again this time

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.270 
into manga studio 5 and again this time
I'm<00:01:17.549> using<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.970> size<00:01:18.150> 15<00:01:18.540> G<00:01:18.930> pen<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.500> straight<00:01:20.159> way

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
I'm using a size 15 G pen a straight way

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.590 
I'm using a size 15 G pen a straight way
with<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.520> first<00:01:20.729> few<00:01:20.880> lines<00:01:21.150> I'm<00:01:21.330> not<00:01:21.450> sure

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
with the first few lines I'm not sure

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.590 
with the first few lines I'm not sure
how<00:01:21.750> noticeable<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.470> is<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.830> it<00:01:23.460> feels<00:01:24.119> smooth

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
how noticeable it is but it feels smooth

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.899 
how noticeable it is but it feels smooth
that<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:24.960> feels<00:01:25.200> nicer<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.640> bit<00:01:26.790> more

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that it feels nicer it's a bit more

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.300 
that it feels nicer it's a bit more
satisfying<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.900> for<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.200> liner<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
satisfying to use for your liner and the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.130 
satisfying to use for your liner and the
pressure<00:01:29.549> sensitivity<00:01:29.909> seems<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.570> work<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.869> lot

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
pressure sensitivity seems to work a lot

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.899 
pressure sensitivity seems to work a lot
better<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.619> work<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.009> way<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.790> know

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
better and work the way that you know

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.100 
better and work the way that you know
you<00:01:32.939> would<00:01:33.119> expect<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.780> to

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you would expect it to

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.350

for inking I am you know lots of people

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.179 
for inking I am you know lots of people
are<00:01:38.790> good<00:01:39.000> at<00:01:39.090> using<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.540> wish<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.380> was<00:01:40.619> but

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
are good at using it I wish I was but

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
are good at using it I wish I was but
for<00:01:41.369> everything<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:42.000> terrible<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.659> and

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
for everything I'm terrible at it and

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.600 
for everything I'm terrible at it and
just<00:01:43.409> switching<00:01:43.770> over<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.040> using<00:01:44.340> manga

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
just switching over to using manga

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.270 
just switching over to using manga
studio<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.630> I'm<00:01:45.780> doing<00:01:45.990> now<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:47.070> was

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
studio and like I'm doing now it was

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
studio and like I'm doing now it was
just<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> lot<00:01:47.700> better<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.240> felt<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.930> result

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
just a lot better and I felt the result

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
just a lot better and I felt the result
was<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.470> hell<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.860> lot<00:01:50.009> better<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.610> I'll<00:01:50.820> put

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
was a hell of a lot better and I'll put

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
was a hell of a lot better and I'll put
an<00:01:51.119> image<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.450> at<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> end<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
an image up at the end so that you can

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
an image up at the end so that you can
compare<00:01:52.649> them<00:01:52.829> directly<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.700> see<00:01:54.180> what<00:01:54.329> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
compare them directly and see what you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.200 
compare them directly and see what you
think<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.500> also<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:56.490> know<00:01:56.579> worth<00:01:56.820> noting

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
think it is also you know worth noting

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.910 
think it is also you know worth noting
that<00:01:57.240> Photoshop<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.259> lot<00:01:58.469> more<00:01:58.619> expensive

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that Photoshop is a lot more expensive

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.310 
that Photoshop is a lot more expensive
as<00:01:59.280> well<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.000> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.210> are<00:02:00.240> actually<00:02:00.719> after<00:02:00.840> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
as well so if you are actually after you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.319 
as well so if you are actually after you
know<00:02:01.439> line<00:02:01.680> work<00:02:01.890> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.219> comics<00:02:02.640> or<00:02:02.939> manga

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
know line work if you do comics or manga

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.030 
know line work if you do comics or manga
or<00:02:03.420> anything<00:02:03.570> like<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.899> or<00:02:04.320> just<00:02:04.380> prefer

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
or anything like that or just prefer

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.130 
or anything like that or just prefer
line<00:02:05.280> work<00:02:05.460> anyway<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.540> probably<00:02:07.020> actually

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
line work anyway you probably actually

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.600 
line work anyway you probably actually
better<00:02:07.500> off<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:07.829> manga<00:02:08.069> studio<00:02:08.250> than

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
better off with manga studio than

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.999 
better off with manga studio than
Photoshop<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.270> haven't<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.379> learnt<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.770> pin

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
Photoshop I haven't really learnt to pin

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.309 
Photoshop I haven't really learnt to pin
in<00:02:11.340> manga<00:02:11.790> studio<00:02:11.970> though<00:02:12.330> yet<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:13.020> me<00:02:13.170> I'm

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
in manga studio though yet so for me I'm

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.640 
in manga studio though yet so for me I'm
still<00:02:13.470> using<00:02:14.390> Photoshop<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> lot<00:02:15.599> more<00:02:15.780> but<00:02:16.530> the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
still using Photoshop a lot more but the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.869 
still using Photoshop a lot more but the
layout<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.040> things<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.370> pretty<00:02:17.580> much<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
layout and things is pretty much the

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.000 
layout and things is pretty much the
same<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.360> you<00:02:19.110> know<00:02:19.260> third<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> same<00:02:19.800> with

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
same and you know third the same with

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.670 
same and you know third the same with
like<00:02:20.129> coral<00:02:20.489> pen<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.030> pen<00:02:21.750> tool<00:02:22.020> si<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.379> think

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
like coral pen and pen tool si I think

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.199 
like coral pen and pen tool si I think
it's<00:02:22.830> called<00:02:23.069> apparently<00:02:23.760> they're<00:02:23.940> good<00:02:24.090> for

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
it's called apparently they're good for

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.630 
it's called apparently they're good for
line<00:02:24.569> art<00:02:24.599> too<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.860> that's<00:02:26.040> pretty<00:02:26.250> much<00:02:26.340> it

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
line art too so that's pretty much it

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.830 
line art too so that's pretty much it

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it to actually compare the results that

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.610 
it to actually compare the results that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
are on screen now for me if I had to say

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.290 
are on screen now for me if I had to say
I<00:02:34.860> would<00:02:35.010> say<00:02:35.190> manga<00:02:35.489> studio<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.940> definitely

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
I would say manga studio is definitely

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.940 
I would say manga studio is definitely
better<00:02:36.480> for<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.870> line<00:02:37.050> art<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.470> hopefully

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
better for the line art and hopefully

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.979 
better for the line art and hopefully
and<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.730> results<00:02:39.060> on<00:02:39.209> screen<00:02:39.330> speak<00:02:39.840> for

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and the results on screen speak for

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:40.430 
and the results on screen speak for
themselves

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
themselves

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.979 
themselves
but<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.250> still<00:02:41.849> use<00:02:42.060> Photoshop<00:02:42.510> for<00:02:42.540> everything

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
but I still use Photoshop for everything

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.809 
but I still use Photoshop for everything
