00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.540
 knows the packaging as if it were a 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.109
 image of milk we find ourselves in 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.050
 many normal supermarkets are me 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:27.119
 I've already used another year 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.660
 at different times of my day be it in the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.279
 breakfast at lunch no good 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.820
 different types of revenue is the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.350
 hot sweet and salty hot recipe 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:47.100
 everything looks very good is very practical 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:56.390
 problems the process of contamination of the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:56.390
 egg to break the egg that never works 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:10.520
 waste and also suffer risk 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.520
 contamination can happen then it is 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:23.159
 very safe excellent quality as well 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.159
 let me not miss home every 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.159
 days I've aged a new recipe for 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 xix with it gets very good with fruit or 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:43.070
 no and I recommend the use and who does not 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.700
 knows it 's worth it 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.369
 It's a lot of people asking me, are you afraid of? 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:58.520
 tomato make use cooking think I 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:01.579
 I like very hard the rar has nothing and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 I recommend to those who do not know yet 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:10.610
 know also continues excellent value 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.610
 biological 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.650
 who knows 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.490
 the quality of the product in practicality 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.880
 who starts using the kid if 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:25.730
 will hardly reuse the egg 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.850
 separate the light from around the broken egg 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.040
 that work thrown from an outside is 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.160
 this waste 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.960
 the staff then this is the tip to 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.620
 You for those who do not know 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.950
 I recommend the approved ones will be back again 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.630
 in the soft an important tip also 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:51.170
 for you who have already followed a diet 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.590
 a balanced error is 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.360
 tired of staying in the same way in that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:01.670
 ever repetitive mobile diet networks 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.709
 social as facebook table 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.890
 r I always look for myself 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.910
 to innovate is to make new 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.720
 revenue 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:16.459
 left a little of the same sameness and without 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.220
 no doubt fits very well in 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:22.010
 any time in any recipe 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:25.360
 you can bet and that's it folks stay 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.360
