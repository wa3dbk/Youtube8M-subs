a tour basically all the AP junglers
have<00:00:21.630> been<00:00:21.750> testing<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.170> were<00:00:22.289> very<00:00:22.619> defensive

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
have been testing so were very defensive

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.500 
have been testing so were very defensive
runes<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.609> masteries<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:24.180> been<00:00:24.269> doing<00:00:24.480> very

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
runes and masteries have been doing very

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.859 
runes and masteries have been doing very
well<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.910> mordekaiser<00:00:26.910> can<00:00:27.119> sometimes<00:00:27.630> had<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
well and mordekaiser can sometimes had a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.169 
well and mordekaiser can sometimes had a
bit<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.349> hard<00:00:28.560> time<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:29.010> lane<00:00:29.189> he<00:00:29.880> sort<00:00:30.090> of

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
bit of a hard time in lane he sort of

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.150 
bit of a hard time in lane he sort of
he's<00:00:30.660> good<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:30.900> he's<00:00:31.320> sort<00:00:31.500> of<00:00:31.560> weird<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> take

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
he's good but he's sort of weird to take

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.180 
he's good but he's sort of weird to take
into<00:00:32.399> lane<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.500> why<00:00:34.860> don't<00:00:34.980> we<00:00:35.040> see

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
into lane so you know why don't we see

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.500 
into lane so you know why don't we see
if<00:00:35.219> we<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.760> something<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.180> jungle

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
if we can do something the jungle

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.900 
if we can do something the jungle
obviously<00:00:36.930> building<00:00:37.380> hunters<00:00:37.829> machetes<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
obviously building hunters machetes you

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.729 
obviously building hunters machetes you
know<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.180> ideal<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:39.930> him<00:00:40.140> i'm<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:40.410> sure<00:00:40.590> what

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
know not ideal for him i'm not sure what

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.799 
know not ideal for him i'm not sure what
you'd<00:00:40.890> really<00:00:41.040> build<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.760> from<00:00:42.000> there<00:00:42.239> maybe

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
you'd really build into from there maybe

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.690 
you'd really build into from there maybe
you<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.500> some<00:00:43.680> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> weird<00:00:44.070> old<00:00:44.340> school

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
you go some kind of weird old school

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
you go some kind of weird old school
tank<00:00:45.000> build<00:00:45.270> or<00:00:45.390> something<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.930> that's

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
tank build or something really that's

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
tank build or something really that's
not<00:00:46.410> my<00:00:46.530> job<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.039> about<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.370> right<00:00:47.430> now

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
not my job to think about that right now

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
not my job to think about that right now
but<00:00:47.910> let's<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.300> how<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.480> does<00:00:48.629> things<00:00:49.590> we're

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.760 

just<00:01:22.010> grab<00:01:22.549> that<00:01:26.260> you<00:01:27.260> got<00:01:27.380> pretty<00:01:27.500> good<00:01:27.590> air

wing<00:01:38.740> it<00:01:39.740> up<00:01:39.860> here<00:01:40.040> shields<00:01:40.399> keeping<00:01:40.759> them

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
wing it up here shields keeping them

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.550 
wing it up here shields keeping them
pretty<00:01:41.149> healthy<00:01:45.940> that<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:48.140> could<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.409> done<00:01:48.530> a

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
pretty healthy that it could have done a

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.290 
pretty healthy that it could have done a
double<00:01:48.800> attack<00:01:49.280> thing<00:01:49.610> in<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.850> little<00:01:50.090> bit<00:01:50.180> more

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
double attack thing in a little bit more

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.510 
double attack thing in a little bit more
efficiently<00:01:52.630> that's<00:01:53.630> right<00:01:54.110> a<00:01:54.440> little<00:01:55.310> bit

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
efficiently that's right a little bit

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.100 
efficiently that's right a little bit
low<00:01:55.729> but<00:01:55.759> it's<00:01:56.000> clear<00:01:56.210> speeds<00:01:56.450> actually<00:01:56.720> quite

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
low but it's clear speeds actually quite

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.410 
low but it's clear speeds actually quite
good<00:01:57.490> keep<00:01:58.490> in<00:01:58.610> mind<00:01:58.640> i<00:01:58.880> don't<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.179> leash

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
good keep in mind i don't have a leash

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.050 
good keep in mind i don't have a leash
so<00:01:59.869> i<00:02:00.200> wouldn't<00:02:00.979> be<00:02:01.070> anywhere<00:02:01.490> near<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.850> low

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
so i wouldn't be anywhere near this low

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:15.400 
so i wouldn't be anywhere near this low
if<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.270> had<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.450> leash<00:02:04.750> we<00:02:05.750> chose<00:02:06.470> way<00:02:14.230> damaged<00:02:15.230> in

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
if I had a leash we chose way damaged in

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.860 
if I had a leash we chose way damaged in
a<00:02:15.470> cone<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:19.250> it<00:02:20.690> what<00:02:20.840> do<00:02:20.900> I<00:02:20.989> level<00:02:22.870> esker

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
a cone for it what do I level esker

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:40.759 
a cone for it what do I level esker

sickness three minutes 54 seconds that's
one<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.299> again<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.750> faster<00:03:02.170> jungles<00:03:02.560> it<00:03:02.680> seems

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
one of again the faster jungles it seems

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.220 
one of again the faster jungles it seems
like<00:03:03.099> yeah<00:03:03.280> definitely<00:03:03.819> AP<00:03:04.480> junglers<00:03:04.720> are

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
like yeah definitely AP junglers are

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.860 
like yeah definitely AP junglers are
very<00:03:05.890> much<00:03:06.160> more<00:03:06.730> adapted<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.420> I<00:03:07.540> guess<00:03:07.629> the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
very much more adapted to I guess the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.680 
very much more adapted to I guess the
defensive<00:03:08.819> well<00:03:09.819> no<00:03:10.000> it's<00:03:10.150> not<00:03:10.269> definitely<00:03:10.599> I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
defensive well no it's not definitely I

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.630 
defensive well no it's not definitely I
that's<00:03:11.170> still<00:03:11.440> my<00:03:11.590> guess<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.340> whole

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
that's still my guess that the whole

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.099 
that's still my guess that the whole
defensive<00:03:13.150> ruin<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:13.480> master<00:03:13.840> thing<00:03:13.989> I'm

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
defensive ruin and master thing I'm

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.349 
defensive ruin and master thing I'm
going<00:03:14.290> is<00:03:14.560> quite<00:03:15.069> well<00:03:15.340> suited<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> just<00:03:16.239> how

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
going is quite well suited to just how

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.180 
going is quite well suited to just how
the<00:03:16.420> AP<00:03:16.810> junglers<00:03:17.109> are<00:03:17.500> dealing<00:03:17.739> damage<00:03:17.859> in

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
the AP junglers are dealing damage in

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.390 
the AP junglers are dealing damage in
alien<00:03:18.819> stuff<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.500> how<00:03:20.500> does<00:03:20.560> this<00:03:20.890> rate<00:03:21.160> gets

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
alien stuff and how does this rate gets

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.830 
alien stuff and how does this rate gets
taken<00:03:21.609> out<00:03:21.790> immediately<00:03:22.150> in<00:03:22.359> terms<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.629> smite
