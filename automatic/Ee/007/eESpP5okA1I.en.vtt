that<00:03:10.380> has<00:03:10.590> two<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.220> its<00:03:11.400> outer<00:03:11.580> orbit<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:12.450> is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
that has two in its outer orbit this is

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.600 
that has two in its outer orbit this is
also<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.990> noble<00:03:13.290> gas<00:03:13.620> because<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.340> is<00:03:14.460> the

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
also a noble gas because it is the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.820 
also a noble gas because it is the
innermost<00:03:15.150> electron<00:03:15.840> orbit<00:03:16.260> which<00:03:16.410> only<00:03:16.590> has

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
innermost electron orbit which only has

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.949 
innermost electron orbit which only has
room<00:03:17.100> for<00:03:17.130> two<00:03:17.460> electrons<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.420> basically

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
room for two electrons so basically

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.540 
room for two electrons so basically
these<00:03:19.230> have<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> full<00:03:19.890> complement<00:03:20.459> of

these have a full complement of

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.490 
these have a full complement of
electrons<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.090> when<00:03:21.270> we're<00:03:21.450> making<00:03:21.630> molecules

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
electrons so when we're making molecules

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.830 
electrons so when we're making molecules
we're<00:03:22.920> trying<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.370> get<00:03:23.489> up<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.000> magical

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
we're trying to get up to this magical

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.120 
we're trying to get up to this magical
eight<00:03:25.050> and<00:03:25.440> we're<00:03:25.530> going<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> see<00:03:25.920> that

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
eight and we're going to see that

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.220 
eight and we're going to see that
momentarily<00:03:26.790> here<00:03:27.180> when<00:03:27.600> we<00:03:27.690> put<00:03:27.930> some<00:03:28.110> of

momentarily here when we put some of

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.690 
momentarily here when we put some of
these<00:03:28.320> elements<00:03:28.620> together<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.400> make

which<00:05:22.440> we<00:05:22.650> know<00:05:22.889> has<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.430> tremendous<00:05:23.970> amount<00:05:24.180> of

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
which we know has a tremendous amount of

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.839 
which we know has a tremendous amount of
energy<00:05:24.479> we<00:05:24.990> use<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.560> same<00:05:25.830> type<00:05:26.130> of<00:05:26.190> chemical

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
energy we use the same type of chemical

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:29.270 
energy we use the same type of chemical
bonds<00:05:27.330> to<00:05:27.720> provide<00:05:28.080> fuel<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.680> energy<00:05:28.800> for<00:05:29.250> our

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
bonds to provide fuel and energy for our

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.670 
bonds to provide fuel and energy for our
own<00:05:29.490> bodies<00:05:29.970> the<00:05:30.120> only<00:05:30.360> exception<00:05:30.990> is<00:05:31.110> on<00:05:31.560> the

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
own bodies the only exception is on the

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.680 
own bodies the only exception is on the
far<00:05:31.949> end<00:05:32.190> instead<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.820> having<00:05:32.970> a<00:05:33.180> hydrogen

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
far end instead of having a hydrogen

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.170 
far end instead of having a hydrogen
atom<00:05:33.990> we<00:05:34.349> have<00:05:34.380> this<00:05:34.710> carboxyl<00:05:35.610> group<00:05:35.940> which

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
atom we have this carboxyl group which

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.950 
atom we have this carboxyl group which
is<00:05:36.560> COOH<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:38.009> this<00:05:38.430> is<00:05:38.580> the<00:05:38.729> alpha<00:05:39.270> end<00:05:39.479> of<00:05:39.840> the

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
is COOH and this is the alpha end of the

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.920 
is COOH and this is the alpha end of the
fatty<00:05:40.199> acid<00:05:40.889> and<00:05:41.039> if<00:05:41.430> we<00:05:41.580> take<00:05:41.849> that<00:05:42.150> free

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
fatty acid and if we take that free

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.770 
fatty acid and if we take that free
fatty<00:05:43.229> acid<00:05:43.800> and<00:05:43.949> we<00:05:44.490> actually<00:05:44.699> modify<00:05:45.570> that

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
fatty acid and we actually modify that

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.300 
fatty acid and we actually modify that
carboxyl<00:05:46.500> group<00:05:48.080> take<00:05:49.080> away<00:05:49.380> an<00:05:49.530> OHA

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
carboxyl group take away an OHA

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.010 
carboxyl group take away an OHA
and<00:05:51.770> we<00:05:52.770> attach<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.159> to<00:05:53.669> another<00:05:54.210> molecule

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
and we attach it to another molecule

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.310 
and we attach it to another molecule
called<00:05:55.560> glycerol<00:05:56.400> we<00:05:56.940> can<00:05:57.120> add<00:05:57.389> two<00:05:57.870> more<00:05:58.139> of

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
called glycerol we can add two more of

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.339 
called glycerol we can add two more of
these<00:05:58.469> fatty<00:05:58.800> acids<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.520> this<00:05:59.669> is<00:05:59.849> called<00:06:00.090> a

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
these fatty acids and this is called a

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:01.820 
these fatty acids and this is called a
triglyceride

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
triglyceride

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.040 
triglyceride
so<00:06:02.070> it's<00:06:02.219> glycerol<00:06:02.759> with<00:06:02.969> three<00:06:03.300> fatty<00:06:03.539> acids

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
so it's glycerol with three fatty acids

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.020 
so it's glycerol with three fatty acids
attached<00:06:04.349> to<00:06:04.620> it

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
attached to it

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.969 
attached to it
triglyceride<00:06:06.030> this<00:06:06.509> is<00:06:06.719> the<00:06:06.870> storage<00:06:07.349> form<00:06:07.889> of

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
triglyceride this is the storage form of

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.169 
triglyceride this is the storage form of
fat<00:06:08.580> in<00:06:08.849> plants<00:06:09.419> and<00:06:09.570> animals
