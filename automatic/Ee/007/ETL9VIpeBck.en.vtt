00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
and I think it's a solution for so many

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.740 
and I think it's a solution for so many
other<00:02:05.429> elements<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:08.009> can<00:02:08.160> educate

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
other elements so if we can educate

everyone to the level that they should
be<00:02:10.920> educated<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.610> think<00:02:12.209> societies<00:02:12.900> change<00:02:13.200> and
