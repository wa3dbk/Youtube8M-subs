00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.650
 we can so that we have this sauce 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.950
 If you want, you can leave it like this or 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.820

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.860
 Strainer that I leave to your choice 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.120

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.930
 to do is to taste it 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:24.110
 If it is ready, we return it to fire 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:31.790
