 Talk to my beauty pedestrian in the area. 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.820
 bringing you news 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.980
 Let us say, then, one of the last 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.050
 and in fact the bombast in the galley 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.600
 A lot of people are asking me some 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.640
 things on facebook on twitter what 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.680
 happens with the social club website 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 People in the last days , I'm yours. 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.629
 Club is in trouble, I do not know 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.480
 I detected this for three days now. 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.690
 Are you unable to make changes? 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.850

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.000
 I'm showing you. They 'll show. 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.780
 some changes this certainly is 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.850
 it should be the comb-thin there that there is 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.390
 So it is that the rockstar is 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.679
 doing in many ways has a 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.090
 new update to leave there at 1.16 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.729
 probably tomorrow should be coming out 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.890
 on Tuesday I brought the news 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.690
 For you, there speaking that you are 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.670
 Happening to me is not being 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.080
 different it's not only with you 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.030
 I will try to make a change that only 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 for you to have a notion I hope not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.649
 I tried 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.869
 I do not know the change, whatever it is I know 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.610
 here we are going to put a red color here 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.849
 simple color control 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.039
 There you make a change here in the 

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:37.959
 command actions and when you send 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.940
 save the alcohol is a mistake 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:43.270
 Please try again later unfortunately 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.759
 it's happening this is for you 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.360
 add content to be the 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.459
 that is unfortunately not occurring 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.280
 these problems was not supposed to be 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.660
 because in my opinion this is 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.390
 wrong 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.560
 if you have set out to do something 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.450
 your problem 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.000
 you have to do with excellence then 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.520
 you should not let those 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.259
 problems that would disrupt the players 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.179
 We have nothing to do with this. 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.500
 I want to make a fine comb, I want to ban it. 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.819
 do this and that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.550
 but do not, provided it does not interfere 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.310
 the players that is our case the largest 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.769
 we are harmed then beauty is 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.590
 fast simple video and stage to show 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.519
 what is really 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.440
 happening for sure because of this 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.430
 huge sweep the guys are 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.930

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:40.440
 so sperry good things to update 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.319
 pradelli scene that always comes out but not so 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.040
 good for some people expect to be a 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.799
 these 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.879
 but if it's no problem, I'll continue 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.420
 Playing 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.510
 Grandma play with another other game account 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.390
 finally I'm here to talk sport 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.209
 nothing that I am this or that is simple 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.650
 I'm more a player there that brings content 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.650
 for you here on youtube 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.890
 then a message 2 from here not 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.640
 I know it was because I stopped there. 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.890
 so folks 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.549
 Today's video is even more informative. 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:20.940
 It's to leave the crowd very calm. 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.680
 in quotes but not in reality all 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.879
 We 're in trouble, beauty. 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.890
 today is coming to an end 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.420
 I hope you have enjoyed it if you 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.040
 liked the one that liked the most yet 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.780
 favorite in a video and it helps me 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.400
 a lot in the channel video 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.049
 the social networks of the channel are 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.150
 video description has enough thing 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.150
 Nice in the description, do not let 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.549
 check it out from the music of the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.620
 game 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.519
 Anyway, I'm going to stay here a lot.
