gonna show you exactly what this camera
can<00:00:22.980> do<00:00:23.160> because<00:00:23.310> that's<00:00:23.519> what<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.699> bought<00:00:24.060> it

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
can do because that's what I bought it

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.570 
can do because that's what I bought it
for<00:00:24.300> mainly<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.320> photos<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.980> really

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
wanted to seriously get into video and I

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.400 
wanted to seriously get into video and I
have<00:00:29.460> bases<00:00:29.880> stripped<00:00:30.750> down<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.019> camera

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
have bases stripped down the camera

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.920 
have bases stripped down the camera
software<00:00:31.590> wise<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.340> found<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.420> exactly

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
software wise and found that exactly

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.069 
software wise and found that exactly
what<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.200> can<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.800> this<00:00:35.610> camera<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.149> am<00:00:36.630> very

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
what I can get this camera I am very

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.900 
what I can get this camera I am very
impressed<00:00:37.260> okay<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.250> I'll<00:00:38.460> just<00:00:38.489> give<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.670 
impressed okay so I'll just give you a
bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.629> hard<00:00:39.809> specs<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> camera

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
bit of kind of hard specs of the camera

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.030 
bit of kind of hard specs of the camera
for<00:00:40.800> video<00:00:40.950> this<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.790> 1080p<00:00:42.500> 24<00:00:43.500> frames<00:00:43.770> per

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
for video this is 1080p 24 frames per

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.760 
for video this is 1080p 24 frames per
second<00:00:44.520> or<00:00:44.760> 720p<00:00:45.719> 30<00:00:46.820> 24<00:00:47.820> or<00:00:48.090> 25<00:00:48.930> frames<00:00:49.440> per

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
second or 720p 30 24 or 25 frames per

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.310 
second or 720p 30 24 or 25 frames per
second<00:00:50.129> which<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:51.300> not<00:00:51.480> an<00:00:51.660> amazing<00:00:52.110> amount

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
second which it's not an amazing amount

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.590 
second which it's not an amazing amount
of<00:00:52.469> frame<00:00:52.680> options<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.460> considering<00:00:54.149> it's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
of frame options but considering it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.860 
of frame options but considering it's
the<00:00:54.960> cameras<00:00:55.260> position<00:00:55.410> in<00:00:55.829> price<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.489> age<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the cameras position in price and age it

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.900 
the cameras position in price and age it
doesn't<00:00:58.230> do<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> bad<00:00:58.530> job<00:00:58.559> at<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.250> 24

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
doesn't do a bad job at all I think 24

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
doesn't do a bad job at all I think 24
frames<00:01:00.210> per<00:01:00.270> second<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:01.140> will<00:01:01.800> give<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
frames per second would will give you a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.789 
frames per second would will give you a
good<00:01:02.520> look<00:01:02.730> than<00:01:02.969> 1080p<00:01:03.359> now<00:01:04.290> there<00:01:04.439> are<00:01:04.559> quite

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
good look than 1080p now there are quite

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
good look than 1080p now there are quite
a<00:01:04.860> few<00:01:04.979> downsides<00:01:05.339> this<00:01:05.820> camera<00:01:06.210> which

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a few downsides this camera which

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.230 
a few downsides this camera which
filmmakers<00:01:07.140> won't<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.090> no

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
filmmakers won't really like there is no

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.050 
filmmakers won't really like there is no
manual<00:01:09.510> control<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.049> ISO<00:01:10.710> or<00:01:11.040> shutter<00:01:11.670> speed

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
manual control of ISO or shutter speed

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.980 
manual control of ISO or shutter speed
the<00:01:13.100> rolling<00:01:14.100> shutter<00:01:14.130> artefacts<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.240> really

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the rolling shutter artefacts is really

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.990 
the rolling shutter artefacts is really
quite<00:01:16.229> parent<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.830> sensor<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.610> CMOS

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
quite parent on the sensor it's a CMOS

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.200 
quite parent on the sensor it's a CMOS
sensor<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.799> basically<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.729> move<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
sensor and basically if you move the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
sensor and basically if you move the
camera<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.840> lot<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.799> bit<00:01:23.040> like<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
camera a lot it's a bit like a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.420 
camera a lot it's a bit like a
watercolor<00:01:23.939> painting<00:01:24.350> smudging<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:26.189> don't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
watercolor painting smudging you don't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
watercolor painting smudging you don't
really<00:01:26.670> want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> move<00:01:27.180> a<00:01:27.330> huge<00:01:27.570> amount<00:01:27.780> but

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
really want to move a huge amount but

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.929 
really want to move a huge amount but
the<00:01:28.380> VR<00:01:28.740> does<00:01:29.040> help<00:01:29.340> quite<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> bit

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
the VR does help quite a bit

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.140 
the VR does help quite a bit
with<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> kit<00:01:30.479> lens<00:01:30.799> 1855<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> her<00:01:32.880> big

problem<00:01:33.570> for<00:01:33.600> filmmakers<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> Nikon

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
problem for filmmakers is that the Nikon

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
problem for filmmakers is that the Nikon
defect<00:01:35.549> one<00:01:35.729> who<00:01:36.000> does<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:37.049> mic<00:01:37.320> input

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
defect one who does not have a mic input

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.580 
defect one who does not have a mic input
and<00:01:38.060> quite<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> lot<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.270> when<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> comes<00:01:39.900> from

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and quite a lot of when it comes from

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.710 
and quite a lot of when it comes from
the<00:01:40.770> old<00:01:40.950> generation<00:01:41.250> like<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:41.909> don't<00:01:42.570> have

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the old generation like this don't have

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.289 
the old generation like this don't have
either<00:01:42.960> but<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.159> means<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.549> have<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.850> use<00:01:44.880> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
either but that means you have to use a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
either but that means you have to use a
excel<00:01:46.049> source<00:01:46.619> which<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
excel source which this is just a

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.330 
excel source which this is just a
cheapest<00:01:48.270> or<00:01:48.680> external<00:01:49.680> recorder<00:01:50.100> does<00:01:50.310> a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
cheapest or external recorder does a

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.480

and I've got a lavalier microphone
plugged<00:01:53.650> into<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:54.190> okay<00:01:54.430> so<00:01:54.490> we're<00:01:54.670> just<00:01:54.700> a

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
plugged into it okay so we're just a

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.210 
plugged into it okay so we're just a
look<00:01:55.000> at<00:01:55.150> some<00:01:55.299> test<00:01:55.570> shots<00:01:55.690> now<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.350> all<00:01:56.860> of

look at some test shots now and all of
these<00:01:57.340> shots<00:01:57.670> will<00:01:57.880> show<00:01:58.119> you're<00:01:58.299> probably

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
these shots will show you're probably

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.990 
these shots will show you're probably

graded<00:02:03.820> it<00:02:03.940> just<00:02:04.810> really<00:02:05.080> helps<00:02:05.470> the<00:02:05.560> camera

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
graded it just really helps the camera

get<00:02:06.909> the<00:02:06.940> footage<00:02:07.440> lively<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.649> should<00:02:09.429> have<00:02:09.550> a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
get the footage lively I should have a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.370 
get the footage lively I should have a
flat<00:02:10.000> picture<00:02:10.270> profile<00:02:10.720> chopped<00:02:10.989> off<00:02:11.140> but

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
flat picture profile chopped off but

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.949 
flat picture profile chopped off but
later<00:02:11.610> now<00:02:12.610> in<00:02:12.760> this<00:02:12.880> clip<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.330> demonstrate<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
later now in this clip I demonstrate the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.220 
later now in this clip I demonstrate the
rule<00:02:14.170> intro<00:02:14.650> artifacts<00:02:15.130> which<00:02:15.459> it<00:02:15.850> is<00:02:16.750> really

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
rule intro artifacts which it is really

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.740 
rule intro artifacts which it is really
bad<00:02:17.410> if<00:02:17.709> you<00:02:17.830> move<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.100> camera<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.489> lot<00:02:18.700> but<00:02:19.150> you

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
bad if you move the camera a lot but you

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.000 
bad if you move the camera a lot but you
probably<00:02:20.050> shouldn't<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.440> doing<00:02:20.680> that<00:02:20.770> anyway

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
probably shouldn't be doing that anyway

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.030 
probably shouldn't be doing that anyway
of<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> camera<00:02:22.260> okay<00:02:23.260> now<00:02:23.410> we<00:02:23.470> just<00:02:23.560> have<00:02:23.800> some

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
of the camera okay now we just have some

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.650 
of the camera okay now we just have some
night<00:02:24.340> shots<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.970> managed<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.330> get<00:02:25.540> this

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
night shots I managed to get this

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.320 
night shots I managed to get this
outside<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.950> really<00:02:27.250> doesn't<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:28.120> too

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
outside and it really doesn't do too

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.540 
outside and it really doesn't do too
badly<00:02:28.600> in<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.110> shadows<00:02:29.500> there<00:02:30.100> isn't<00:02:30.340> too

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
badly in the shadows there isn't too

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.030 
badly in the shadows there isn't too
much<00:02:30.670> green<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.350> does<00:02:32.590> handle<00:02:32.890> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
much green and it does handle the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.940 
much green and it does handle the
highlights<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.720> huge<00:02:34.720> contrast<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.709> if

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
highlights of huge contrast you get if

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.370 
highlights of huge contrast you get if
you're<00:02:36.430> outside<00:02:36.790> with<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.209> small<00:02:37.989> amount<00:02:38.170> of

you're outside with a small amount of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.000 
you're outside with a small amount of

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
profile to get a good image but when

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.399 
profile to get a good image but when
you've<00:03:53.420> done<00:03:53.629> that<00:03:53.689> when<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.079> watch<00:03:54.260> this

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
you've done that when you watch this

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:56.800 
you've done that when you watch this
video<00:03:54.620> maybe<00:03:55.159> hopefully<00:03:55.970> you<00:03:56.239> learn<00:03:56.510> some<00:03:56.780> new

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
video maybe hopefully you learn some new

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.710 
video maybe hopefully you learn some new
tricks<00:03:57.189> when<00:03:58.189> you've<00:03:58.340> done<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:58.569> you'll<00:03:59.569> have

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
tricks when you've done that you'll have

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.160 
tricks when you've done that you'll have
a<00:03:59.780> great<00:04:00.019> time<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:01.359> just<00:04:02.359> keep<00:04:02.599> on<00:04:02.780> googling

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
a great time and just keep on googling

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.470 
a great time and just keep on googling
and<00:04:03.439> keep<00:04:03.620> on<00:04:03.909> finding<00:04:04.909> out<00:04:05.000> more<00:04:05.180> about<00:04:05.299> it

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
and keep on finding out more about it

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.270 
and keep on finding out more about it
because<00:04:06.049> that's<00:04:06.230> how<00:04:06.469> you<00:04:06.530> get<00:04:06.799> good<00:04:06.859> with<00:04:07.129> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
because that's how you get good with the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.500 
because that's how you get good with the
camera<00:04:07.700> not<00:04:08.359> by<00:04:08.510> buying<00:04:08.810> a<00:04:09.079> very<00:04:09.260> good<00:04:09.560> camera
