the biggest reasons why I did not check

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.499 
the biggest reasons why I did not check
out<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> anime<00:01:17.340> series<00:01:17.640> right<00:01:17.880> after<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:18.390> was

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
out the anime series right after it was

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.030 
out the anime series right after it was
made<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.990> because<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.409> skeptical<00:01:19.920> about

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
made was because I was skeptical about

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.740 
made was because I was skeptical about
an<00:01:20.369> anime<00:01:20.729> adaption<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> really

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
an anime adaption that can really

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
an anime adaption that can really
capture<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.680> essence<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.310> how<00:01:23.430> badass<00:01:23.729> these

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
capture the essence of how badass these

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
capture the essence of how badass these
drawings<00:01:24.540> were<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.200> sometimes<00:01:25.740> although

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
drawings were and sometimes although

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
drawings were and sometimes although
