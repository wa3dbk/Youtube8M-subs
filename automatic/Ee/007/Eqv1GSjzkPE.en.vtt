certain items and it'll give you a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
certain items and it'll give you a
little<00:01:21.479> long<00:01:21.659> speech<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.560> what<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549

pockets but it would be a great way to
see<00:02:32.380> how<00:02:32.410> this<00:02:32.709> being<00:02:32.950> progresses<00:02:33.489> and<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> is

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880

different levels now one of the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.350 
different levels now one of the
interesting<00:02:38.650> things<00:02:38.890> about<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.310> game<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.849> it

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
interesting things about this game is it

comes<00:02:40.959> with<00:02:41.049> a<00:02:41.170> hall<00:02:41.530> joystick<00:02:42.130> and<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:43.239> have<00:02:43.390> to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
comes with a hall joystick and I have to

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.910 
comes with a hall joystick and I have to
admit<00:02:43.750> when<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> first<00:02:44.319> heard<00:02:44.530> it<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:44.739> didn't

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
admit when I first heard it I didn't

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.350 
admit when I first heard it I didn't
know<00:02:44.980> what<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.130> Hall<00:02:45.340> joystick<00:02:45.819> was<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.180> thought

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
know what a Hall joystick was I thought

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.030 
know what a Hall joystick was I thought
it<00:02:46.480> was<00:02:46.569> some<00:02:46.720> kind<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.989> gimmick<00:02:47.230> because<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
it was some kind of gimmick because of

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.000 
it was some kind of gimmick because of
the<00:02:48.190> isometric<00:02:49.180> view<00:02:49.739> having<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.799> do<00:02:50.890> with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
the isometric view having to do with

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.660 
the isometric view having to do with
halls<00:02:51.280> but<00:02:51.640> no<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.840> has<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.049> do<00:02:53.349> with<00:02:53.560> a<00:02:54.069> guy

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
halls but no it has to do with a guy

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.559 
halls but no it has to do with a guy
named<00:02:54.910> Edward<00:02:55.209> Hall<00:02:55.660> who<00:02:56.230> back<00:02:56.709> in<00:02:57.569> 1879

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
named Edward Hall who back in 1879

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.449 
named Edward Hall who back in 1879
discovered<00:02:59.440> something<00:02:59.799> he<00:02:59.920> called<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.280> Hall

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
discovered something he called the Hall

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.539 
discovered something he called the Hall
effect<00:03:00.780> which<00:03:01.780> long<00:03:02.650> story<00:03:02.920> short<00:03:03.160> had<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.430> do

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
effect which long story short had to do

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.110 
effect which long story short had to do
with<00:03:03.670> magnetism<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.600> whatnot<00:03:04.989> and<00:03:05.850> they<00:03:06.850> used

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
with magnetism and whatnot and they used

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.670 
with magnetism and whatnot and they used
it<00:03:07.239> in<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.450> joystick<00:03:07.900> because<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.350> makes<00:03:08.500> it

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
it in the joystick because it makes it

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.069 
it in the joystick because it makes it
super<00:03:08.980> super<00:03:09.430> precise<00:03:10.120> most<00:03:10.810> of<00:03:10.989> these

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
super super precise most of these

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.539 
super super precise most of these
joysticks<00:03:11.590> are<00:03:11.769> used<00:03:11.980> in<00:03:12.160> like<00:03:12.280> heavy

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
joysticks are used in like heavy

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.590 
joysticks are used in like heavy
machinery<00:03:12.940> like<00:03:14.970> things<00:03:15.970> that<00:03:16.150> dig<00:03:16.389> in<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
machinery like things that dig in the

machinery like things that dig in the
dirt<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.220> hydraulics<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.790> really<00:03:19.120> need<00:03:19.269> to

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
dirt and hydraulics that really need to

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.809 
dirt and hydraulics that really need to
be<00:03:19.389> precise<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.290> Atari<00:03:20.950> put<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.340> in<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.579> game

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
be precise and Atari put it in this game

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.539 
be precise and Atari put it in this game
which<00:03:22.329> I'm<00:03:22.690> shocked<00:03:23.049> you<00:03:23.440> could<00:03:24.220> even<00:03:24.340> buy

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
which I'm shocked you could even buy

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.360 
which I'm shocked you could even buy
hall<00:03:24.940> joysticks<00:03:25.510> for<00:03:25.630> your<00:03:26.440> PC<00:03:26.859> today<00:03:27.160> which

up

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.050 

take<00:03:42.569> a<00:03:42.629> look<00:03:42.780> at<00:03:42.870> some<00:03:43.050> of<00:03:43.080> his<00:03:43.170> gameplay<00:03:44.060> it's

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
take a look at some of his gameplay it's

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.720 
take a look at some of his gameplay it's
very<00:03:45.330> bright<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> colorful<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.650> it's<00:03:46.830> got

very bright and colorful and it's got

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.850 
very bright and colorful and it's got
this<00:03:47.959> quirky<00:03:48.959> kind<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.349> feel<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:54.860> it's

this quirky kind of feel to it it's
actually<00:03:55.980> kind<00:03:56.400> of<00:03:56.519> hard<00:03:58.550> maybe<00:03:59.550> if<00:03:59.640> I<00:03:59.760> had<00:03:59.880> a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
actually kind of hard maybe if I had a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.670 
actually kind of hard maybe if I had a
whole<00:04:00.209> dull<00:04:00.569> joystick<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.200> could<00:04:01.380> be<00:04:01.440> playing

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
whole dull joystick I could be playing

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:14.180 
whole dull joystick I could be playing
the<00:04:01.890> same<00:04:02.099> it's<00:04:02.790> just<00:04:02.849> really<00:04:03.180> hard<00:04:13.010> now<00:04:14.010> as

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
the same it's just really hard now as

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:15.800 
the same it's just really hard now as
you<00:04:14.280> go<00:04:14.400> along<00:04:14.519> different<00:04:15.090> robots<00:04:15.420> will<00:04:15.599> come

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
you go along different robots will come

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.610 
you go along different robots will come
up<00:04:16.489> tracking<00:04:17.489> robots<00:04:18.269> little<00:04:18.930> tiny<00:04:19.200> short

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
up tracking robots little tiny short

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:29.830 
up tracking robots little tiny short
robots<00:04:20.010> that<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.910> meal<00:04:21.150> to<00:04:21.419> shoot

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.270 

it's<00:04:30.840> also<00:04:30.990> cute<00:04:31.410> when<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.620> get<00:04:31.740> too<00:04:32.010> close<00:04:32.220> to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
it's also cute when you get too close to

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.270 
it's also cute when you get too close to
an<00:04:32.520> edge<00:04:32.639> you<00:04:32.669> can<00:04:32.940> fall<00:04:33.240> off<00:04:33.830> you<00:04:34.830> gotta<00:04:34.979> jump

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
an edge you can fall off you gotta jump

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:50.659 
an edge you can fall off you gotta jump
