matter of fact it mean just jump off the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.690 
matter of fact it mean just jump off the
flying<00:02:34.890> machine<00:02:35.190> if<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.520> want

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
flying machine if you want

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.119 
flying machine if you want
like<00:02:37.300> this

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.830 

jump<00:02:41.760> over<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.180> thing<00:02:42.390> when<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.599> coals

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
jump over that thing when the coals

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.479 
jump over that thing when the coals
aren't<00:02:43.140> bouncing<00:02:43.469> up<00:02:43.620> same<00:02:44.340> here<00:02:46.249> jump<00:02:47.249> over

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
aren't bouncing up same here jump over

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.860 
aren't bouncing up same here jump over
on<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.670> coals<00:02:47.849> aren't<00:02:48.060> bouncing<00:02:48.359> up<00:02:48.480> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
on the coals aren't bouncing up this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.149 
on the coals aren't bouncing up this
thing<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.109> constantly<00:02:49.439> rotating<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.010> just

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
thing is constantly rotating so just

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.069 
thing is constantly rotating so just
jump<00:02:50.310> over<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.639> fire<00:02:50.909> thing<00:02:51.209> then<00:02:51.749> go<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:51.959> the
