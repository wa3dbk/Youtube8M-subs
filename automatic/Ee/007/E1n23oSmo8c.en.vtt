00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.120 
well he did have something in mind what
would<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.759> play<00:01:30.000> if<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.420> black<00:01:30.630> pieces

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
would you play if you have black pieces

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
would you play if you have black pieces
take<00:01:32.130> note<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:33.259> King<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.500> looking<00:01:34.890> after<00:01:35.040> his

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
lady so if you separate them giving the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.940 
lady so if you separate them giving the
Queen<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.689> why<00:01:39.869> King<00:01:40.350> can't<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
Queen that's why King can't take the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.560 
Queen that's why King can't take the
pawn<00:01:41.189> he<00:01:41.820> has<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> play<00:01:42.649> -<00:01:43.649> e<00:01:43.680> -<00:01:44.329> how<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.390> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
pawn he has to play - e - how would you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.310 
pawn he has to play - e - how would you
continue<00:01:45.930> now<00:01:46.490> well<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.840> continue<00:01:49.290> like

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
continue now well if you continue like

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.789

this

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.899 
this
then<00:01:51.990> knife<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.260> block<00:01:53.530> so<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.159> don't<00:01:54.729> play

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909

Bishop<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.390> g4<00:01:56.159> instead<00:01:57.510> the<00:01:58.510> best<00:01:58.750> move<00:01:58.960> is

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
Bishop to g4 instead the best move is

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.899 
Bishop to g4 instead the best move is
pawn<00:02:01.270> takes<00:02:01.659> on<00:02:01.990> g1<00:02:02.800> and<00:02:03.010> you<00:02:03.190> promote<00:02:03.400> tonight

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
pawn takes on g1 and you promote tonight

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.889 
pawn takes on g1 and you promote tonight
in<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.380> game<00:02:06.000> rook<00:02:07.000> captured<00:02:07.600> on<00:02:08.160> g1<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.899> then

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
in the game rook captured on g1 and then

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.930 
in the game rook captured on g1 and then
black<00:02:11.650> gab<00:02:12.239> check<00:02:13.239> or<00:02:13.480> g4<00:02:14.020> and<00:02:14.580> he<00:02:15.580> won<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
black gab check or g4 and he won the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.350 
black gab check or g4 and he won the
game

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
game

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.430 
game
white<00:02:17.200> designed<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.800> game<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.160> this<00:02:18.310> position

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
white designed the game in this position

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.470 
white designed the game in this position
so<00:02:20.440> instead<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.800> taking<00:02:23.190> with<00:02:24.190> rook<00:02:24.480> best

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
so instead of taking with rook best

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.820 
so instead of taking with rook best
better<00:02:25.900> movies<00:02:27.450> King<00:02:28.450> to<00:02:28.630> Iman<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.260> we

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
better movies King to Iman and then we

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.380 
better movies King to Iman and then we
would<00:02:29.950> have<00:02:30.130> this<00:02:30.340> variation<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.470> black<00:02:33.130> is

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
would have this variation but black is

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.500
