00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
problem but this should get you started

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.520 
problem but this should get you started
so<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.690> first<00:00:46.840> thing<00:00:46.960> you<00:00:47.050> need<00:00:47.200> to<00:00:47.230> do<00:00:47.410> in

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
so the first thing you need to do in

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.500 
so the first thing you need to do in
order<00:00:47.829> to<00:00:47.950> get<00:00:48.130> started<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.700> to<00:00:48.940> power<00:00:49.120> it<00:00:49.270> and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
order to get started is to power it and

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.810 
order to get started is to power it and
turn<00:00:49.660> it<00:00:49.780> on<00:00:49.870> so<00:00:50.200> we<00:00:50.320> include<00:00:50.710> this<00:00:51.190> AC<00:00:51.520> power

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:51.820 
turn it on so we include this AC power

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.760 
turn it on so we include this AC power
supply<00:00:52.000> this<00:00:52.360> is<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.540> universal<00:00:53.170> power<00:00:53.380> supply

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770

7q<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.549> let's<00:01:54.700> actually<00:01:54.970> go<00:01:55.270> ahead<00:01:55.299> and<00:01:55.689> plug

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
7q so let's actually go ahead and plug

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.130 
7q so let's actually go ahead and plug
it<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.829> turn<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.100> on<00:01:57.400> so<00:01:57.729> that<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.810> power

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
it in and turn it on so that the power

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.690 
it in and turn it on so that the power
in<00:01:59.409> right<00:01:59.710> jack<00:02:00.009> is<00:02:00.159> right<00:02:00.310> there<00:02:00.520> on<00:02:00.610> the

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
in right jack is right there on the

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.300 
in right jack is right there on the
bottom<00:02:01.000> left<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.689> just<00:02:02.200> plug<00:02:02.560> this<00:02:02.680> guy<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:03.070> and

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
bottom left we just plug this guy in and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.370 
bottom left we just plug this guy in and
you'll<00:02:03.430> see<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.909> after<00:02:04.210> just<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.630> few<00:02:04.900> seconds

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
you'll see that after just a few seconds

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.020 
you'll see that after just a few seconds
you<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.270> your<00:02:07.739> screen<00:02:08.799> initializing<00:02:09.459> gives

activating the unit if you don't it just

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.550 
activating the unit if you don't it just
means<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.269> you're<00:02:19.540> gonna<00:02:19.600> go<00:02:19.840> into<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.169> demo

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you do wish to activate what we ask it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.440 
you do wish to activate what we ask it
just<00:02:44.040> gives<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.280> some<00:02:44.460> prompts<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.000> asks<00:02:45.360> you

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.270 
to then go to our website and you
register<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.300> unit<00:02:48.690> with<00:02:49.170> us<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.160> we

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
register the unit with us so that we

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
register the unit with us so that we
know<00:02:50.460> that<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> own<00:02:50.970> this<00:02:51.210> individual<00:02:51.870> serial

know that you own this individual serial

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.380 
know that you own this individual serial
number<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.890> reason<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.310> do<00:02:53.460> that<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:53.910> that

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
number the reason we do that is so that

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.020 
number the reason we do that is so that
when<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.470> update<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:56.310> firmware<00:02:56.580> because

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
when we update the firmware because

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.060 
when we update the firmware because
we're<00:02:57.240> gonna<00:02:57.360> be<00:02:57.510> adding<00:02:57.690> lots<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.830> great

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
what device this is going to it's a very

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.310 
what device this is going to it's a very
straightforward<00:03:42.570> process<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:43.080> takes<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
straightforward process just takes a

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.660 
straightforward process just takes a
minute<00:03:43.560> or<00:03:43.590> two<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.100> once<00:03:44.310> you've<00:03:44.430> done<00:03:44.489> that

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
minute or two and once you've done that

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.210 
minute or two and once you've done that
you've<00:03:45.150> now<00:03:45.360> activated<00:03:46.140> your<00:03:46.290> unit<00:03:46.680> we<00:03:47.070> know

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you've now activated your unit we know

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.210 
you've now activated your unit we know
it's<00:03:47.430> yours<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.570> away<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.320> go<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:49.950> let's

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
it's yours and then away you go so let's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.050 
it's yours and then away you go so let's
actually<00:03:50.870> send<00:03:51.870> a<00:03:51.989> video<00:03:52.080> signal<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.580> 7q

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
actually send a video signal to the 7q

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.340 
actually send a video signal to the 7q
now<00:03:54.209> make<00:03:54.360> sure<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.720> use<00:03:54.930> really

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
now make sure you use really

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.930 
now make sure you use really
high-quality<00:03:56.330> 3g<00:03:57.330> rated<00:03:57.810> SDI<00:03:58.680> cables<00:03:59.250> or<00:03:59.459> you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
high-quality 3g rated SDI cables or you

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.910 
high-quality 3g rated SDI cables or you
know<00:04:00.060> very<00:04:00.299> high<00:04:00.420> quality<00:04:00.480> HDMI<00:04:01.260> cables<00:04:01.799> if

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
know very high quality HDMI cables if

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.060 
know very high quality HDMI cables if
you're<00:04:02.100> doing<00:04:02.580> HD<00:04:02.910> on<00:04:03.000> HDMI<00:04:03.750> connection<00:04:04.230> it's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
you're doing HD on HDMI connection it's

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.250 
you're doing HD on HDMI connection it's
important<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:06.000> have<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> good<00:04:06.630> quality<00:04:07.080> signal

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
important to have a good quality signal

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.050 
important to have a good quality signal
coming<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.860> especially<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.549> this<00:04:08.700> is<00:04:08.790> gonna<00:04:08.880> be

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
coming in especially if this is gonna be

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.340 
coming in especially if this is gonna be
where<00:04:09.209> you're<00:04:09.330> gonna<00:04:09.390> record<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.019> signal

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
where you're gonna record the signal

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.110 
where you're gonna record the signal
because<00:04:10.920> otherwise<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.519> know<00:04:11.640> what's<00:04:11.940> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
because otherwise you know what's the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.360 
because otherwise you know what's the
point<00:04:12.590> so<00:04:13.590> you<00:04:13.650> see<00:04:13.860> it<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.100> took<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.280> moment

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
point so you see it just took a moment

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.729 
point so you see it just took a moment
and<00:04:14.700> then<00:04:14.850> it<00:04:14.970> recognized<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.660> and<00:04:15.780> there<00:04:16.350> I<00:04:16.380> am

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and then it recognized it and there I am

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.719 
and then it recognized it and there I am
there's<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.040> slight<00:04:17.220> delay<00:04:17.340> with<00:04:17.640> this

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
there's a slight delay with this

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.880 
there's a slight delay with this
particular<00:04:17.940> camera<00:04:18.269> but<00:04:18.540> you<00:04:18.720> can<00:04:18.900> see<00:04:19.229> what

we've<00:04:20.040> got<00:04:20.070> going<00:04:20.400> there<00:04:20.580> now<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:21.030> course<00:04:21.390> if

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
we've got going there now of course if

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.430 
we've got going there now of course if

00:05:53.669 --> 00:06:03.620 
look at all the different functions
right<00:05:54.240> on<00:05:54.480> the<00:05:54.660> display

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630
