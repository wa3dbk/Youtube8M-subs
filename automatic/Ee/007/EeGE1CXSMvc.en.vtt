00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello that as I always hope you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.940
 you find the best and you know that I 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.680
 I'm gilberto in charge of institutes and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.910
 this time we are going to continue with 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.920
 the videos in which we are 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.809
 checking all the remaining chords 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.400
 with a particular key in this 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 occasion corresponds to review the field 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.420
 harmonic of which in my humble opinion 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.029
 is the fourth you should check 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 after the harmonic field of sun do 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.019
 and of re and well starting quickly you 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.029
 I remember that the first thing we have to 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.640
 do to get the harmonic field of 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.890
 a particular note is to take the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.239
 scale greater than said note that you 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 I remember you can do many 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.360
 forms however this time what 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.360
 let's review the following 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.900
 the notes that later we are going to 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:48.980
 transform chords are the 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.860
 do sharp king and fa sharp and for 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.540
 last a sustained sun 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.000
 now we are going to transform all 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.070
 those notes in chords and first of all 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.140
 we have a side which we are going to 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.520
 transform to a major chord so 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.520
 we will place a the greatest 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.970
 next note is a yes and we have to 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.540
 make a minor chord so it's about 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.690
 of if minor 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.670
 the next note is a sharp c and 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.650
 we also have to make a chord 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.710
 we're just going to put the 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.340
 same figure with what in the room 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.469
 fret 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.359
 the next note is a king and I have it 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:30.079
 have to make a major chord so let's go 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:31.819
 to place greater re of the same form the 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.490
 next note that it is a I'm going to 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:38.420
 transform into major chord so 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.250
 we put a major plus the penultimate note 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.219
 it's a sharp fa and we have to 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.069
 make minor so we put a fa 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.869
 sustained but minor and the last note 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:50.509
 to have all the chords of this 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.549
 key is a sustained sun which 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.950
 we have to transform a chord 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.900
 diminished so we have to place 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.960
 the following figure 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.500
 it's about your three middle ring fingers 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.630
 and little finger on the seventh fret 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.410
 third second and first and then the 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.780
 middle finger 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.730
 sixth fret of the fourth string and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.460
 we only played from fourth to first 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.470
 rope 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.680
 I remind you that the properties of this 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.510
 I agreed are of sensitivity it 's as if I 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 missing a sound that you have to 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.950
 complete which is completed 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.610
 precisely with the first chord of 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.610
 all the field 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 but in particular this chord the sun 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:36.519
 sustained diminished how is very sharp 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.659
 is better with the version as well 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:42.459
 to say it acute of a the one that is got 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.500
 on the fifth fret and well once 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.439
 we get all these chords that you 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.890
 I remember it's the first grade and in that 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:52.870
 order goes up to the seventh which is the sun 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.150
 sustained diminished we can already start 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 to generate our progression and well 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.659
 As in the other videos, we are going to review 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.849
 first of all the progression more 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:05.710
 simple that is a musical triangle that 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:09.010
 it is the greatest of major and my greatest 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.410
 that would correspond to 1st quarter and fifth 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.090
 degree this progression like the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.580
 triangle network is the simplest 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.440
 what is there and if you are starting do not hesitate 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.510
 that this is one of the first things 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.710
 you have to practice whether you 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.710
 print your pop rock beat 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.549
 or that you also put arpeggios 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.209
 actually you can print the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.220
 rhythm or the technique that seems to you 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.470
 now reviewing another position that 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:48.910
 it's also classic we have a circle 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:53.020
 greater than would be the greatest for sustained 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.600
 minor without minor and finally a yes 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:04:00.700
 septic what would be like first 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.739
 sixth sixth grade and the fifth but I've 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.959
 made a seventh as I already have 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.910
 mentioned for other videos with radios 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.050
 simple to down is used quite 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.050
 in the music of rondalla 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.080
 and it also tells you mention that you can 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.030
 play this progression with bass that 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.220
 particularly for a long period of 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.930
 the music was used to make those 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.930
 so emblematic romantic songs 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.400
 in the same way you can use the rhythm 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:41.029
 of bolero that also looks great with 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.029
 this progression 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.919
 actually the most important advice 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.870
 What can I give you is that you do not limit yourself to 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:53.999
 what I tell you but you review 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.889
 any technique or strumming that you 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:58.050
 it seems and of course that you generate the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.879
 progressions that you want already reviewing 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:03.540
 something a little more modern we have the 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:06.840
 next position that would be the greatest 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:10.080
 and higher for minor sustained and for 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.150
 last a king that as I mentioned 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.190
 for the other videos this progression is 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.620
 quite famous because even 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.360
 has parodies since they accommodate these 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.190
 four degrees of the way in which 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.720
 we just reviewed has been used 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.240
 enough for a lot of 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.650
 songs whether it reads new bonuses 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.650
 tell the pop rock beat 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.099
 another position quite used but in 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.849
 particular for this key and for the 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.050
 key of king and sun is the one that takes 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:46.550
 first grade 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:51.870
 a fourth sixth and fifth 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:54.360
 that is to say the minor sustained re f and my 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.129
 you can also touch it from 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:08.789
 many ways putting an example 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:10.199
 different with reggae already to finish me 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.120
 I would like to add that you can do 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:14.690
 progressions beginning with the sixth 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:19.039
 degree of this harmonic field for example 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:23.350
 for minor sustained after major re 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:26.700
 then the biggest and finally 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.560
 a greater what would be the sixth room 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.550
 first and fifth grade 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.200
 I've heard a lot of 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.980
 this progression of degrees with the rhythm 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.980
 pop rock 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.099
 ah 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:46.539
 and well with that we comply with a good 

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.999
 number of progressions that can be 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:50.710
 do with the harmonic field of the tea 

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:52.240
 I remember that if you have any doubt or 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:54.099
 you want to make some clarification me 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.699

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:00.610
 I leave in the video description a thousand 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:04.169
 thanks for watching my video remember to remove
