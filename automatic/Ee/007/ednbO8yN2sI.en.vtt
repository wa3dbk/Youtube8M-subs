00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.259
 they are all friends of giza in fact i 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.180
 team we returned to the lenovo stand for 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.919
 do a deepening of the new wide 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.630
 shut device that we already have 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.280
 shown in a first video hands on 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.750
 but we wish to show you more in the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.210
 detail especially as far as 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.980
 regards the photographic memory sector 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.410
 quickly the technical specifications of 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.710
 this top of the range with a screen a 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 5 inch full HD ips display 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.930
 something dragon 615 processor and ben 3 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.240
 gigabytes of ram to say go to 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.800
 see the photographic sector immediately 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.040
 before we have a camera from 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 8 megapixels with perfect pixel focus for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.350
 any selphy while posteriorly 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.480
 we have a 16 megapixel camera 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.010
 with three-tone flash to illuminate 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.809
 the scene perfectly 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 also note the excellent design with the 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 metal frames in the back cover 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 back we also have a division 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.120
 between these two strips this is in 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 satin aluminum 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.140
 however the satin finish is below the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.359
 glass panel applied in fact to the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.710
 there is no relief 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.449
 let's go to open the application 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.220
 dedicated to the camera 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.320
 I would like to point out that it is also present 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.450
 the standard google but lenovo has 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.960
 installed its own application more 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.880
 professional 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.799
 once opened to the camera you see 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.070
 right away we can try the two 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.260
 mode the smart one that will do to make 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.920
 choose to mobile to the software of 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.720
 device 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.640
 the parameters therefore automatic mode 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.270
 mode suitable for non-experts of 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.000
 photography 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.479
 or the pro switchable one through 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.920
 this dedicated mechanical key 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.020
 the automatic is very similar to the one already 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.240
 present on other android devices 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.259
 so I would say to test the 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.670
 professional mode as you see 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.770
 through this this mode pro 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 we have the opportunity to go to 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.000
 vary the photographic parameters by 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.100
 of the dedicated rings and very much indeed 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.979
 convenient for example with this key 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.200
 we can vary the exposure then 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.000
 increase or decrease the stops of 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.070
 brightness we can vary the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.050
 ISO sensitivity even if we say this 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.720
 a basic function is also present on 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.640
 all andrÃ© sites but function 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.800
 fundamental is very useful for 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.370
 photography lovers is the possibility of 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.019
 go to vary the exposure time 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.500
 you see increasing the time up to 2 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.540
 seconds 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 clearly the photo is overexposed 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.570
 this was very useful in case of 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.310
 night photos for example if you have a 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.769
 easel you can light 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.630
 perfectly the scene without having the 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.489
 afraid to take a picture 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.720
 we are going to reduce the time of 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.030
 exposure 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.070
 we also have the possibility to vary 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.579
 let's say the depth of the mass 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.530
 just through I think the variation of the 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.330
 diaphragm 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.670
 unfortunately as you see the software yet 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.319
 a bit immature and tends to trace at times 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 I hope when this device 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.310
 will be marketed we will have a farm 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.140
 much more stable 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.580
 we said possibility of changing the 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.440
 focus from zero to infinity 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.720
 unfortunately in our tests we have 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.280
 verified that this variation of the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.080
 focusing is a little imprecise 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.220
 we hope for a better future 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.360
 optimization 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.709
 finally we conclude with the balancing 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.330
 of white for a la7 of parameters which 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.190
 can be varied which will succeed to 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.050
 satisfy any fan of 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.840
 photography 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.670
 lenovo wide shut device that fits us 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.190
 if you like it very much we try to perform 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.700
 one test shot in focus 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.620
 quite quickly we reject a lot 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.870
 very intuitive we were told by the 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.730
 delta marketing that we have with 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.010
 had the pleasure of having a brief 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.000
 interview that the form factor of 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.310
 device has been designed to do 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.370
 study the device has one 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.950
 camera say low-end 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.650
 so not a reflex but a reflex 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.150
 let's try to make one 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.829
 test shot at the lenovo stand a lot 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.170
 comfortable to hold especially for 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.610
 the precious metal material 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.290
 unfortunately you see continues to kick 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.459
 because as already said a very farmer 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.750
 very unstable 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.940
 I would say that for the study of the new e 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.590
 all device bike shop really 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.549
 very interesting for lovers of 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.570
 that beautiful world that the 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.370
 photography 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.060
 I would say that I refer you and pass video from 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.060
 dubai world congress
