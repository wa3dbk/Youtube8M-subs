 windows 7 this issue has made it a cv 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.060
 evidently from the movie 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.009

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.680

 excellent and good now you look at it now 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.649

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.609
 interested the subject of personalization 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:41.170
 of the desk and all that because I think 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.239
 that a co 2012 is one of the best 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.890
 youtuber personalizing the desktop and 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.480
 I recommend that you go through your 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.039
 channel is worth the channel will be in the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.530
 description of the video for whoever wants 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.059
 Well, let's go, it's worth saying that 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.980
 let's proceed with what is the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.559
 installation and downloading this 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.819
 fantastic theme as always because the 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.769
 download link will be the description 

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.210
 of the video and to download it 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.100
 we just go to the description 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.470
 click on the link and it will take us to the 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.540
 mediafire page in question once 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.120
 on the page we download it and 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.890
 this winrar file is worth it if we open it 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.920
 to see the content we have what 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.560
 next what are transformers 4 vale 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.570
 the executable that would be what we 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.060
 we will use to install it and then 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.400
 the state that we will see more 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.930
 late khaled good let's proceed with 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.940
 the installation and we simply execute 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.940
 the executable is worth what we have here 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:35.350
 let's close this here and there what 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.299
 we have good highlights this small 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.799
 installation assistant in which we 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.799
 ask us to select English or Spanish 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.780
 We are going to select Spanish we give in 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.520
 accept as you see we have a small in 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 prior to what the topic would be and 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.039
 let's give in next the password 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.569
 we have around here and this password 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.429
 I'll leave in the description of the video for 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:57.250
 all for you to the description of 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:59.709
 video or over here for the video so that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.390
 everyone can see it more easily and 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.670
 So you can proceed with the installation 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.789
 ok we put the contraction and we give 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.440
 in next here we have the route 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.329
 predefined so that you do not have 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.610
 to do absolutely nothing as you see 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:14.680
 in the installation, it is quite 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.910
 simple and this has a lot 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.250
 merit what a core has done because 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.480
 Well, it takes away a lot of time 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.090
 the time for us to install the theme 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.750
 let's give the next one we need 24 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.880
 - to install it 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.740
 and we give you to install to finalize 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.600
 as you see quite simple everything I think 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.690
 that really is pretty good 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.020
 we have to finish automatically 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.180
 because it automatically changes us as 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.150
 You see, what changes us is what 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.230
 desk and we get this 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.900
 spectacular personalization of 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.300
 transformers 4 the last movie is worth 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.690
 that has come out recently as you see 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.940
 we have enough wallpaper 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.730
 which paper are pretty good I think 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.500
 that we have gotten good has gotten 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.820
 a goal to forgive I do not want to attribute 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.190
 merits because he really has done 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.140
 football is made a crack and and good 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.680
 as you are seeing, there is enough 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.380
 well what is the theme is worth everything 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.870
 pretty handsome the funds then which 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.600
 paper all evidently in hd so that 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.470
 do not lose it that at age there we have 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.510
 other 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.730
 I 'm doing more or less a view 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.530
 quick so you can see a little bit above 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 what are all the wallpaper and then 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.030
 we are going to focus on what is the menu 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.610
 the bar and other vouchers 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.730
 and we would have gone back well 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.650
 let's leave it in this 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.540
 let's go here to the menu as you see the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.450
 or also totally personalized me 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.990
 I think I got a result 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.970
 quite excellent the 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.830
 Well, the little lights that the 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.860
 brightness puts all letters and 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.300
 when we place ourselves above 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.240
 we get that the letters are woven 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.060
 of these blurred and the result that 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.740
 you are watching on the screen 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.270
 spectacular not the transformers menu not 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.490
 I know it's pretty good, then 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.650
 we have here to turn on is 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.020
 quite intuitive all the truth here 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.890
 we have the bar what the time is 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.890
 watch all this 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.330
 as you can see the loudspeaker to go up or down 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.079
 the volume depending on vale and good 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.730
 People that most wanted to comment on junk 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.650
 I had lied what the extras are 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.130
 good to look at a little thing that when 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.020
 we place clicks we have the logo of what 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.270
 which are the transformers above or 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.919
 be below the icon forgive as 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.590
 You see it looks pretty good too, I think 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.270
 what 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.750
 has achieved a good result here 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.970
 we also have windows and other 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.230
 ok and pretty handsome I think the 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.490
 excellent result has also 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.110
 introduced here what is the logo 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.100
 of transformers so that everything is 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.230
 totally customized 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.230
 we are going to close here and we are going to open another 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.680
 time the file and we will not go here to 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.710
 Additional features 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.120
 these extras really I'm not going to 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.449
 explain how they work because I think that 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.240
 you must go to the link of the video of a co 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.530
 so you can see the operation a bit 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.870
 how to install all this because I 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.130
 I think it's what it deserves we really have 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.590
 what are the sources do we have what 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.720
 they are football so good douglas is 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.759
 foolish here we activate it 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.380
 we just click here and there 

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:19.900
 down we have it activated now 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.970
 simply if we, well, I'm not 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.400
 let's open a window there we have 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.889
 activated leaks with these blue tones 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.509
 that I think they give a pretty touch 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.580
 more interesting 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:32.990
 I think we got a touch because 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.210
 is really 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.330
 it is well worth it and it fits 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.790
 well to what is transformers we are not going to 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.890
 close here and good as it was going 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.870
 commenting we have enough these 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.930
 little things not here we have what is the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:50.300
 whitlam personal ruiz theme that what 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:52.790
 does it is to customize what it is then the 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.990
 graphical interface of a track and good 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.150
 It also gives the touch of 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.130
 transformers that we are trying to 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.630
 get with this issue not then we have 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.390
 the salon skin that is also 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.460
 totally created by him this I already tell you 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.260
 you can see it in the channel of a corner 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.020
 good to leave the video in the description 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.640
 also so that good then you see how 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.130
 list him and how all this works 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.700
 process that I think is pretty 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.350
 interesting not 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.080
 the sources evidently the sources 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.640
 then the originals of transformers and 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.400
 then these files that are for 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.200
 customize different things is worth as 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:26.390
 You see, it's quite complete the theme 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.220
 It has enough stuff and good because it 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:30.710
 I will appreciate a 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.120
