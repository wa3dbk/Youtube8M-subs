00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello to everything you will be able to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.060
 to publicize the results of my 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.269
 youtube contest 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.769
 you have been more than 700 to participate in 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.410
 this contest which was of a duration 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.360
 of a week and in the theme was the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.310
 flowers so I really thank 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 enormously all the girls who have 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.570
 participated who played the game 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.970
 here is to make a manicure fleury 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.769
 because in fact flowers is the motive 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.660
 which I prefer in any case there is 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.150
 really had beautiful creations 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.219
 I had a lot of trouble separating 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.590
 first among all these pictures that 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.770
 was really a little detail 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.870
 actually for the winners but really 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.879
 congratulations to all the girls who have 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.260
 participated so I will give you without 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 more wait for the results 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.160
 so know that for little reminder 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.110
 I had made categories so there 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.940
 will have the winner of the confirmed 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.920
 intermediates and beginners 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.899
 knowing that the levels I have them class 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.670
 and myself in fact in relation to everything 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.050
 what I had received I tried 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.090
 separated from the level 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.949
 technique that is to say that I could not 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 not to know the level necessarily of 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.210
 the fiq participate but i filed by 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.920
 compared to what she had done it was 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.130
 a very easy flower or a flower 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.869
 rather complicated so here and I had 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.040
 I will also give you all my shots 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 of heart in this video 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.930
 so the photos that were really 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.170
 remarkable for me and I believe that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 unfortunately not publish all the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.170
 pictures of the participants because 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.829
 publish 700 photos it's just 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.390
 impossible and that youtube forbidden 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.430
 how to say youtube forbids that the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.540
 contest is happening elsewhere than on 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.370
 youtube that is to say that I 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.350
 can not for example publish photos 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.760
 on my facebook account since facebook 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.200
 it's out of youtube 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.750
 so in fact I have no right I will be 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.100
 obliged to all wanted to publish in 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.950
 this video but I do not do you 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.700
 show a video with 700 photos I 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.220
 think nobody 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.730
 watch the video if it lasts 30 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.620
 minutes 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.229
 so here's go I show you the 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.140
 results so the winner of the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.300
 beginner category is elodie who has 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.550
 realized this pretty ounce barter with 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.280
 pastel colors and classic flowers 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.520
 but who are traveling well realized 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.979
 pretty pictures of the nails net this is it 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.730
 very well so congratulations elodie for this 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.850
 production 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.740
 the winner of the category 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.600
 intermediary it's noémie who realized 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.370
 a rather original student since she has 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.580
 chose to use watercolor painting 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.580
 to make itself very colorful very 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.350
 very summery fee we will say so here it is 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.940
 we put the realization well then yes 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.260
 I say to them because in fact there is your 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.920
 tickets too who looked at the pictures 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.959
 with me 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.120
 then for the winner who had the 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.040
 more creativity is actually the 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.200
 fault flours the art I found 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.300
 the most original that really came out of the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.100
 lot compared to others and who also 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.080
 was very well done 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.750
 it's the code nail art of the island in 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.160
 treasure that has made flowers but 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.470
 flowers like no other 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.180
 this is mario flowers I think 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.530
 that she made them in painting and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.799
 anyway it's really very well done 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.620
 it's meticulous so congratulations to you ode and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:03.090
 for the big winner of this contest 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.160
 I had a hard time choosing because there 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.010
 had two creations coming out 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.620
 really really the lot of all that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.560
 I was able to receive so it's the creation 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.600
 of lilly carole aurelie and the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.069
 creation of veronique of hens 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.870
 also his polish one does everything 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.599
 two really beautiful creations 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.609
 with a lot of finesse creations 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.230
 also very original it's not flowers 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.629
 we see everywhere 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.030
 so I show you the picture of aurélie 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:33.819
 who comes from guadeloupe who realized 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.889
 flowers ben I guess she got 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.569
 inspired by his island very brakes 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.659
 exotic really very very beautiful 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.680
 a lot of work and here is the creation 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:46.719

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.659

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:52.090
 disney with the little bench bill and flower 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.799
 like that in painting with a lot of 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.760
 work too since there are a lot of 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.530
 detail work 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.000
 there are shadows and also I have 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.090
 liked the fact that she writes pie to 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.909
 strawberries on the go so between the two 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.319

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:10.329
 winner and aurélie of the blog car home is 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.969
 really because in fact she realized 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.829
 flowers in 4d so it requires 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:17.979
 a lot of work and I have a lot 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.380

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.090
 that they are difficult and they are 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.129
 rather well done I really liked

 a lot more but it was 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.610
 difficult to separate small 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.129
 flowers simple but really realized 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.989
 to the perfection of beautiful roses 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.969
