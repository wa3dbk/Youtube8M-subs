00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 peanut is a crop that can be 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.460
 cultivated in family farming 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.529
 in this report you will see a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.900
 southern state family that uses 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.090
 mechanization with animal traction and 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.190
 Manual Peanut Harvesting 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.170
 culture is characteristic of the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.250
 family farming in the southern region of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.060
 parents 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.369
 it represents an alternative 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 important in generating income for this 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.580
 public 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.500
 associated with other 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
 income generation in agriculture 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.110
 it adds up to a cycle culture 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.750
 relatively fast requiring pib 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.730
 relatively little labor-Work 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 agriculture and that it has a very 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.600
 promising budget 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 according to the researcher, the culture comes 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.410
 losing production space due to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.670
 reduction of labor in agriculture 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.710
 family 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.500
 but the military family are 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.460
 south keeps the tradition and see im 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.699
 a great advantage is something more and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.539
 that there are cheaper 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.220
 I even think we will not spend anything. 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.869
 the harvesting process used by your 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.570
 son came from father 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.939
 according to him work and even take 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.330
 so the five stages always counted on 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:20.460
 the wife's help and another tells the mother 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.759
 lost the sheets just was not like this 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.380
 then we start harvesting this is the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 jury time 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.880
 we gain animal traction that has been 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.810
 always clean and let dry but three days 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:41.009
 then put the ball in the way 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.630
 until the average and doing shit now until 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.009
 here already ready like this 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.009
 now I'm putting 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:58.600
 besides the trio the demolisher so the debtor 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:02.830
 and then it's pulling in. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.860
 good background later we put a 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.110
 plastic canvas possible and dared to try 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.970
 sexual intercourse in four camps as soon as 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.640
 time not say when then are young 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.640
 I have been a student until now, more or less. 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.480
 closed its site tells that in the 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.770
 peanut is reserved and therefore dry 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.810
 faster 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.209
 according to him the pod that leaves from there is 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.220
 uniform and can take more time 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.380
 be marketed from a crop to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.910
 other 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.950
 after the shit was built that the 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.930
 the last stage of the harvesting process 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.600
 peanut here on his property. 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.060
 the pod to stand at rest from 30 to 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.549
 100 days only after straw removal 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.190
 cleaned and marketed for being in 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.500
 the work is optimized in each 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.519
 shit takes an average day to be 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.430
 stained 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:17.760
 the couple separates pod from straw in the crop 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:17.760
 even a bag 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.500
 and continue to the last step 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.530
 thirty days later we came back to 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.150
 property of his Syrian to accompany 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.459
 the last step of the production process 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.170
 that when he kills and shits 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.340
 besides using the bread where it will be 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.340
 prepared for commercialization 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.980
 coming to the galvÃ£o 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.130
 the pod is cleaned and bagged 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.319
 definitely the 36 kilos planted 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.840
 in less than half a hectare yielded about 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.950
 of 200 kilos of peanuts that the family 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.950
 comes and still washing
