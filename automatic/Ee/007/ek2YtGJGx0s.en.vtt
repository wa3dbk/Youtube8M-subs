open world if the answer was a
resounding<00:00:22.990> yes<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.490> we<00:00:27.580> started<00:00:27.939> doing<00:00:28.150> some

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
resounding yes so we started doing some

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.420 
resounding yes so we started doing some
quite<00:00:28.750> deep<00:00:28.960> research<00:00:29.349> but<00:00:29.890> I<00:00:29.950> think<00:00:30.250> just

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
quite deep research but I think just

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.519 
quite deep research but I think just
short<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.700> 30<00:00:31.029> real<00:00:31.480> world<00:00:31.509> locations<00:00:31.869> all

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:32.529 
short of 30 real world locations all

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.990 
short of 30 real world locations all
around<00:00:32.710> the<00:00:32.920> globe<00:00:33.040> there<00:00:33.489> was<00:00:33.610> one<00:00:33.790> clear

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
around the globe there was one clear

environment team came back from Colorado

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
environment team came back from Colorado
for<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.199> of<00:00:49.320> their<00:00:49.440> research<00:00:49.710> trips<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.489> goal

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
for one of their research trips the goal

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.130 
for one of their research trips the goal
of<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> first<00:00:51.120> reference<00:00:51.329> trip<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.960> really

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
of the first reference trip was really

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.469 
of the first reference trip was really
to<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.649> an<00:00:52.769> idea<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.159> what<00:00:53.399> Colorado<00:00:53.820> was<00:00:54.239> like

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
to get an idea of what Colorado was like

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.660 
to get an idea of what Colorado was like
and<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.409> the<00:00:55.559> general<00:00:55.739> makeup<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and just the general makeup of the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.880 
and just the general makeup of the
terrain<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.359> there<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.199> came<00:00:58.439> back<00:00:58.619> with

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
terrain that was there we came back with

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.399 
terrain that was there we came back with
video<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.820> no<00:00:59.939> less<00:01:00.149> than<00:01:00.409> 50,000

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
video and like no less than 50,000

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.450 
video and like no less than 50,000
pictures<00:01:03.049> our<00:01:04.049> goal<00:01:04.350> always<00:01:04.649> was<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.280> build

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
pictures our goal always was to build

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
pictures our goal always was to build
our<00:01:05.640> own<00:01:05.789> teeth<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.360> Colorado<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.470> carry

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
our own teeth in Colorado so we carry

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.260 
our own teeth in Colorado so we carry
pets<00:01:08.009> all<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> best<00:01:08.490> bits<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> guys

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
pets all the best bits that the guys

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.899 
pets all the best bits that the guys
have<00:01:09.299> found<00:01:09.689> put<00:01:10.259> them<00:01:10.439> into<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.799> 2d<00:01:11.399> map<00:01:11.610> form

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
have found put them into a 2d map form

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.029 
have found put them into a 2d map form
initially<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> then<00:01:12.690> from<00:01:13.259> that<00:01:13.319> we<00:01:13.500> started

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
initially and then from that we started

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.249 
initially and then from that we started
building<00:01:14.429> a<00:01:14.610> 3d<00:01:14.940> world<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.080> biggest

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
building a 3d world the biggest

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.260 
building a 3d world the biggest
challenges<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.069> finally<00:01:17.580> how<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> transition

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
challenges is finally how to transition

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.090 
challenges is finally how to transition
from<00:01:18.659> one<00:01:18.840> really<00:01:19.289> diverse<00:01:19.740> looking

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
from one really diverse looking

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.160 
from one really diverse looking
environment<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.789> the<00:01:20.880> next<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.929> where

environment to the next and that's where

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.760 
environment to the next and that's where
our<00:01:22.200> extensive<00:01:23.069> research<00:01:23.399> really<00:01:23.670> came<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
our extensive research really came in

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
our extensive research really came in
