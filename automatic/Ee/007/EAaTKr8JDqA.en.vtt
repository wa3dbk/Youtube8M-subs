00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
is doing it moving to new positions you

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.559 
is doing it moving to new positions you

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
know there's some things that max does

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:49.689 
know there's some things that max does
that<00:00:47.569> I<00:00:47.839> know<00:00:48.559> we<00:00:48.829> didn't<00:00:49.039> really<00:00:49.100> know<00:00:49.489> what

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
that I know we didn't really know what

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.039 
that I know we didn't really know what
he's<00:00:49.819> doing<00:00:49.850> yet<00:00:50.149> but<00:00:50.479> he<00:00:50.569> does<00:00:50.780> some<00:00:51.019> things

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:51.049 
he's doing yet but he does some things

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:54.309 
he's doing yet but he does some things
naturally<00:00:51.999> they<00:00:52.999> go<00:00:53.119> along<00:00:53.179> like<00:00:53.269> what<00:00:53.629> I<00:00:53.839> just

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:54.319 
naturally they go along like what I just

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:56.259 
naturally they go along like what I just
had<00:00:54.469> movement<00:00:54.709> skills<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.429> reads<00:00:55.789> and<00:00:56.119> and

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
had movement skills and reads and and

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.389 
had movement skills and reads and and
being<00:00:57.139> in<00:00:57.350> position<00:00:57.920> more<00:00:58.069> than<00:00:58.100> anything

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
being in position more than anything

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.729 
being in position more than anything
else<00:00:58.729> I<00:00:58.999> think<00:00:59.420> is<00:00:59.569> probably<00:01:00.049> his<00:01:00.260> natural

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
else I think is probably his natural

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.319 
else I think is probably his natural
instinct<00:01:01.249> I'm<00:01:01.609> sure<00:01:01.789> that<00:01:01.969> comes<00:01:02.209> from

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
instinct I'm sure that comes from

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.509 
instinct I'm sure that comes from
playing<00:01:02.629> quarterback<00:01:03.289> to<00:01:03.559> some<00:01:03.799> degree<00:01:03.979> have

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
playing quarterback to some degree have

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.819 
playing quarterback to some degree have
some<00:01:04.790> knowledge<00:01:04.970> of<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.420> game<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.869> then<00:01:06.590> as

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
some knowledge of the game and then as

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.880 
some knowledge of the game and then as
we<00:01:07.219> put<00:01:07.460> new<00:01:07.640> stuff<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:09.170> first<00:01:09.469> time<00:01:09.710> he

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
we put new stuff in the first time he

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.529 
we put new stuff in the first time he
may<00:01:10.039> not<00:01:10.159> understand<00:01:10.759> it<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:10.939> he's<00:01:11.180> able<00:01:11.299> to

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
may not understand it but he's able to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.120 
may not understand it but he's able to
just<00:01:11.810> pretty<00:01:12.020> good<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.409> like<00:01:12.590> like<00:01:12.920> what

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
just pretty good and I like like what

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.590 
just pretty good and I like like what
he's<00:01:13.219> picked<00:01:13.490> up<00:01:13.640> on<00:01:13.789> one<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:14.149> the<00:01:14.270> things<00:01:14.450> he

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
he's picked up on one of the things he

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.240 
he's picked up on one of the things he
has<00:01:14.750> to<00:01:14.930> I<00:01:14.990> mean<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.200> lot<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.890> new<00:01:16.039> position

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
has to I mean a lot it's a new position

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.800 
has to I mean a lot it's a new position
to<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.670> but<00:01:16.789> what<00:01:16.880> I<00:01:16.909> say<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.119> think<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.539> speed

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
to it but what I say I think the speed

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.060 
to it but what I say I think the speed
of<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.020> game<00:01:18.049> when<00:01:18.439> we<00:01:18.500> get<00:01:18.740> up<00:01:18.829> here<00:01:18.859> in

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
of the game when we get up here in

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.880 
of the game when we get up here in
scrimmages<00:01:19.369> strength<00:01:20.329> level<00:01:20.689> when<00:01:21.140> it<00:01:21.649> comes

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
scrimmages strength level when it comes

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.560 
scrimmages strength level when it comes
to<00:01:22.039> collisions<00:01:22.490> with<00:01:22.640> either<00:01:22.789> lineman<00:01:23.240> or<00:01:23.299> big

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
to collisions with either lineman or big

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.660 
to collisions with either lineman or big
backs<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.049> know<00:01:24.170> tackling<00:01:24.590> full<00:01:24.859> speed<00:01:25.159> those

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
backs you know tackling full speed those

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.060 
backs you know tackling full speed those
are<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.880> things<00:01:26.060> that<00:01:26.359> we<00:01:27.350> will<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.859> see

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
are the things that we will have to see

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.649 
are the things that we will have to see

as time goes on you know that he'll have

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.149 
as time goes on you know that he'll have

is<00:03:26.819> where<00:03:27.819> are<00:03:28.000> we<00:03:28.150> compared<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.629> where<00:03:28.780> I

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
is where are we compared to where I

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.379 
is where are we compared to where I
expect<00:03:29.410> us<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.709> be<00:03:29.829> and<00:03:30.209> having<00:03:31.209> gone<00:03:31.359> through

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389 
expect us to be and having gone through

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.479 
expect us to be and having gone through
this<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.260> know<00:03:32.410> three<00:03:32.620> or<00:03:32.650> four<00:03:32.889> times<00:03:33.099> before

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
this you know three or four times before

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.900 
this you know three or four times before
of<00:03:33.940> when<00:03:34.870> you<00:03:34.989> install<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.829> you're<00:03:36.040> looking

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
of when you install and you're looking

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.490 
of when you install and you're looking
into<00:03:37.090> technique<00:03:37.599> and<00:03:37.810> stuff<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.139> that<00:03:38.199> and

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
into technique and stuff like that and

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.039 
into technique and stuff like that and
to<00:03:38.889> how<00:03:39.040> fast<00:03:39.340> guys<00:03:39.609> pick<00:03:39.940> things<00:03:40.150> up<00:03:40.419> I<00:03:40.660> think

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
to how fast guys pick things up I think

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.629 
to how fast guys pick things up I think
they've<00:03:41.169> done<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.379> good<00:03:41.560> good<00:03:41.919> job<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.400> think

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
they've done a good good job and I think

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.159 
they've done a good good job and I think
that<00:03:42.790> that<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.359> biggest<00:03:43.690> thing<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.019> that

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169 
that that the biggest thing is that

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.050 
that that the biggest thing is that
they're<00:03:44.349> willing<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.680> chase<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.639> ball<00:03:45.669> and

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
they're willing to chase the ball and

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.390 
they're willing to chase the ball and
and<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.989> work<00:03:47.709> on<00:03:47.889> improving<00:03:47.980> their

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
and and work on improving their

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.159 
and and work on improving their
technique<00:03:48.760> are<00:03:49.209> they<00:03:49.389> where<00:03:49.540> you<00:03:49.840> want<00:03:50.019> them

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
technique are they where you want them

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.509 
technique are they where you want them
to<00:03:50.349> be<00:03:50.470> in<00:03:50.680> terms<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:50.949> where<00:03:51.099> you<00:03:51.159> expected

he<00:05:59.310> hadn't<00:05:59.760> done<00:05:59.880> much<00:05:59.909> but<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:00.389> thought<00:06:00.570> we<00:06:01.169> saw

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
he hadn't done much but I thought we saw

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.420 
he hadn't done much but I thought we saw
him<00:06:01.530> a<00:06:01.560> little<00:06:01.650> bit<00:06:01.830> out<00:06:01.949> there<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.220> first

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
him a little bit out there the first

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.089 
him a little bit out there the first
first<00:06:03.090> couple<00:06:03.690> of<00:06:03.720> days<00:06:03.810> and<00:06:04.260> just<00:06:04.830> doing<00:06:05.070> a

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
first couple of days and just doing a

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:06.260 
first couple of days and just doing a
little<00:06:05.250> bit<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.580> then<00:06:05.669> he's<00:06:05.820> kind<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.060> been<00:06:06.150> on

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
little bit and then he's kind of been on

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.909 
little bit and then he's kind of been on
the<00:06:06.389> shelf<00:06:06.690> and<00:06:06.960> Kim<00:06:07.169> but<00:06:07.349> I<00:06:07.560> think<00:06:07.800> its

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
the shelf and Kim but I think its

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.649 
the shelf and Kim but I think its
comprehension<00:06:08.430> and<00:06:08.669> what<00:06:08.789> we're<00:06:08.940> doing<00:06:08.970> he's

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
comprehension and what we're doing he's

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:11.990 
comprehension and what we're doing he's
played<00:06:09.930> a<00:06:09.990> lot<00:06:10.260> he's<00:06:10.590> you<00:06:11.159> know<00:06:11.220> he's<00:06:11.490> gotta

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.960 
played a lot he's you know he's gotta
come<00:06:12.780> but<00:06:13.139> he's<00:06:13.860> probably<00:06:14.099> one<00:06:14.280> of<00:06:14.310> the<00:06:14.400> lesser

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
come but he's probably one of the lesser

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.129 
come but he's probably one of the lesser
guys<00:06:15.120> that<00:06:15.300> I'm<00:06:15.419> worried<00:06:15.659> about<00:06:15.690> because<00:06:16.110> he
