if<00:02:41.580> those<00:02:41.850> are<00:02:42.030> hanging<00:02:42.360> like<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:44.400> will

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
if those are hanging like that you will

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.810 
if those are hanging like that you will
take<00:02:44.850> your<00:02:45.060> glue<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.830> you're<00:02:50.519> going<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.670> want

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
take your glue and you're going to want

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.390 
take your glue and you're going to want
to<00:02:50.850> go<00:02:50.970> ahead<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.330> cut<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.660> tip<00:02:51.840> off<00:02:52.080> of<00:02:52.260> this

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.680 

like<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.150> flows<00:02:57.420> very<00:02:57.630> nicely<00:02:59.690> then

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
like that so it flows very nicely then

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.470 
like that so it flows very nicely then
you'll<00:03:00.870> take<00:03:01.019> your<00:03:01.200> skid<00:03:01.470> bar<00:03:01.730> or<00:03:02.730> your<00:03:03.209> fing

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
you'll take your skid bar or your fing

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.840 
you'll take your skid bar or your fing
and<00:03:05.120> run<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.150> bead<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.170> gorilla<00:03:07.920> glue<00:03:08.160> down

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
and run a bead of the gorilla glue down

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.270 
and run a bead of the gorilla glue down
each<00:03:09.150> side<00:03:09.530> keeping<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.650> about<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> quarter

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
each side keeping it about a quarter

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.060 
each side keeping it about a quarter
inch<00:03:11.660> from<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:13.110> edges<00:03:13.320> because<00:03:13.680> this<00:03:13.830> glues

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
inch from the edges because this glues

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.920 
inch from the edges because this glues
swells<00:03:14.459> about<00:03:14.700> three<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.090> four<00:03:15.330> times<00:03:15.540> its

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
swells about three to four times its

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.250 
swells about three to four times its
size<00:03:19.340> so<00:03:20.340> go<00:03:20.519> ahead<00:03:20.640> and<00:03:20.820> run<00:03:21.660> one<00:03:21.870> right<00:03:22.080> down

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
size so go ahead and run one right down

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.040 
size so go ahead and run one right down
the<00:03:22.380> center<00:03:22.590> of<00:03:22.830> each<00:03:23.130> side

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.530 

not<00:03:27.860> too<00:03:28.070> big<00:03:28.280> not<00:03:28.310> too<00:03:28.790> small<00:03:28.820> just<00:03:31.390> two<00:03:32.390> about

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
not too big not too small just two about

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:46.270 
not too big not too small just two about
a<00:03:32.600> quarter<00:03:33.020> of<00:03:33.050> the<00:03:33.200> inch<00:03:34.040> from<00:03:34.310> the<00:03:34.430> edge

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.259 

then<00:03:47.280> you're<00:03:47.430> going<00:03:47.519> to<00:03:47.579> want<00:03:47.819> to<00:03:47.909> run<00:03:48.209> a

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
then you're going to want to run a

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:59.780 
then you're going to want to run a
couple<00:03:50.299> right<00:03:51.299> down<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.599> center<00:03:58.670> just<00:03:59.670> like

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
couple right down the center just like

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.099 
couple right down the center just like
that<00:04:00.349> then<00:04:01.349> you<00:04:01.439> set<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.099> side<00:04:03.109> take

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
that then you set that to the side take

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.039 
that then you set that to the side take
your<00:04:04.349> water<00:04:04.590> squirt<00:04:04.980> bottle<00:04:05.689> and<00:04:06.689> go<00:04:06.840> ahead

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
and spray your skid bar down both sides

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
and spray your skid bar down both sides
and<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:16.079> bottom<00:04:17.269> also<00:04:18.269> you're<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.810> want
