00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.680
 this day I wanted to show you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.559
 car charger 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.950
 it will start-up and charger 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.950
 device of available for all parts 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.519
 very fast down the transformer from 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.470
 advertising 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 old lamp tv record 726 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.270
 rewound reason you 16 fold 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.579
 can be rewound by four squares 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.890
 let any store such a reason settled 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.890
 available in the store of the Moscow store 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:52.789
 today is a car at 100 he's drunk 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.579
 drunk with a cross 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:01.430
 innocently shortened it where it is now 8 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.129
 diodes 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.129
 left connected in series 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.290
 consistent sorry felled 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 pointer 4 cut off 8 let's leave 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.350
 regulator 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:38.570
 The regulator is taken from us, you can take any 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.149
 day and also buy in electric 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.009
 shop or take them from any button 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.750
 any buttons from the grinder 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:55.550
 from the punch from the vacuum cleaner regulator 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.030
 engine speed or solder itself not 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.960
 since such folds are far away such 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:07.220
 scarves went on ari will die and how can 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.009
 these two lovers to solder here instead 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.070
 this regulator 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.030
 so the former work scheme is absolutely everywhere 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.209
 equally 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.000
 what a vacuum cleaner regulator be it will 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.959
 grass avatar bosch buttons smashed and 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.989
 Boshev perforators everywhere schemes 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.350
 exactly the same 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:33.079
 there are 100 units there before the wind by 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.970
 control is absolutely the same everywhere 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:41.000
 so you can solder yourself and you can take it 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.720
 or buy a sofa at all time looks 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.010
 very beautiful that little box 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.930
 which is screwed also 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.959
 directly like this one 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:55.940
 this aport's variable resistor on the side 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:58.870
 small box and the scheme itself now 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.870
 what will come of it 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.599
 229 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.739
 until cash seconds at the exit 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.390
 voltage 1526 meters 6 volts out 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:16.040
 need more me 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:16.040
 baby leaders are not on the meta 

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:22.079
 Fall to the fluid is here this dobavochka 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.450
 just an additive for what if we 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:30.510
 use electronic indicators 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.569
 then there should be from 5 to 30 that's just 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:37.730
 power at least 9 we will be at ten let 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.730
 15 miles and dogs 19 volts 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.030
 to feed them directly 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:47.599
 day for the demonstration took the charger 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.599
 device 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:04:11.129
 and so there will be small 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:18.500
 formats 59 ammeter ammeter it goes 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:22.199
 affected by urban test he's drunk 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:26.550
 shunt here it shows an ammeter from 0 to 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:29.330
 100 amps and a voltmeter to ninety 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 nine volts 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.720
 if someone or someone does not want 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.540
 electronic meter 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.229
 you can put ordinary 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:51.199
 mechanical voltmeter and ammeter type 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:55.070
 This is 10 amps and kilometers to 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:05:03.229
 he is no longer the company is faceless two 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:05.360
 I check with him also to these pr 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.580
 local voltmeter can be bought at 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:14.389
 Chinese we wrote in the mail of China 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.220
 aliexpress mail on aliexpress mail 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.990
 send i already described these two 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:27.800
 ammeter and voltmeter and these are 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:30.199
 here and on the meter it's silent because no 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.030
 on dryers native outlets they 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:37.010
 connected to the subway connected to some 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:46.630
 words chn and hoarse tov when 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:46.630
 repairing such god things 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:58.070
 it swear and charger and 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:01.290
 it turns out that he can find the format 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.590
 There are no problems with this, but there are also 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.590
 any store 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:17.310
 them, too, if the subject is the method for now 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:19.920
 No, you can take it, that is, if 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.980
 factory charging right now is somewhere out 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:27.890
 half higher 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.890
 then it is much safer more powerful 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:35.670
 cost much cheaper cost there 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:39.720
 several hundred rubles on high can 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:41.940
 more than what is needed 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:47.750
 Banks perm order this write 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:52.560
 mail by mail may be a little more expensive 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:54.510
 to the body because so the question is not on you 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.470
 finished this is the first part in the second 

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.230
 parts will be how it works completely and 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:02.100
 what opportunities it will be and 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.870
 charger it will and 

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.380
 start - charging device it will be 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:13.700
 cut spirals i need tension 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:15.270
 regulate and it will be for you sealing 

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:20.780
 terminal boxes 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.780
 we will show you all thanks later
