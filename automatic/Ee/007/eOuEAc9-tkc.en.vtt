00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:05.080
 did not happen was the following i wanted 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.520
 I live in the United States and my father does not 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.139
 wanted me to go 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.700
 and then I told him so I'm going to live 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.040
 I just wanted to live in 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.840
 everyone has the same anxiety 18 in 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.299
 An airplane already wants us united states. 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.899
 that is trying to work as a waiter who is 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.399
 that to collect money we have 1,000 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.840
 a thousand things that we think we can do 

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:24.520
 then we see that it does not hold some 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.939
 people can not 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.520
 so I went to live sometimes 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.710
 father was against it and he did not want to 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.750
 celebrate and so I said I was going to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.580
 We fought forced forced one we 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.680
 year discussing Spain at the end of the 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.590
 year and we asked if he assaulted once 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.600
 He attacked me and so was I. 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.640
 I was half a rebel and I did not 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.740
 I stopped talking to him and he was the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.740
 United States I am seen twice I 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.660
 he went there and we remember that the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.460
 people argued and and every time he 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.750
 It was fine, it was a good two days. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.610
 on the fourth day we were fighting 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.810
 he wanted me to come back and come back with 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.070
 this subject is a subject that 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:09.240
 bothered and we end up fighting until 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.640
 that one day he called he hit me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.970
 I called the police and then he almost went 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.560
 I'm stuck so he decided to go back to Brazil 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.159
 And he came back to Brazil at the end of this 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.380
 trip and I did not talk to him and I anymore 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.549
 I remember that soon after he 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.760
 He died and he had a stop. 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.229
 heart in the house and I do not know 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.049
 Very well, what happened to him too? 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.880
 one did not ask much of my mother but 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:43.390
 I know I was very sad 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:49.659
 with his death because when people 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:51.700
 loses the person we have is not that 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.860
 this story of it is one thing 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.930
 that so hoping nemo is a 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.360
 movie that was what the fish it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:03.970
 disobeyed father and e there ipad penou 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.159
 much on the total surface and it is 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.860
 fish and it will stop at an aquarium in 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.379
 Australia was there and the father is right behind 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.959
 him and I think he 's a little 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.770
 similar to mine because it's my father 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.000
 also 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:24.280
 similar in relation to father and son and such 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.460
 And we are 19 years old, do not you think not? 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.920
 They want to surf, but shit stays and I 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.270
 I wanted to tell him that not that I 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.680
 I wish I came back I wanted to be back from 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.420
 Brazil did not want to be with him. 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.550
 I wish I had done this and such but now. 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 He already was the ones by the nema this history 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.290
 he meets the fish at the end 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.850
 and I could not find my but but I 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.390
 I think that 's where he is now. 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.580
 seeing that I regretted that what I 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.100
 I wish I could speak, I'm sorry, and 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.740
 such a was not it was not like I 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:57.400
 my head is crazy at the time I do not 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.430
 I was thinking very wise here if same 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.620
 talk time and such but do not think about it in 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.200
 face there with kaboul that i can not 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.760
 Tell him, but I'm talking. 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.380
 that now I think there must be some place 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.620
 Are you still listening? 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:17.380
 believing in religion for this too 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.030
 It's too much for us. 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.370
 person has another place that lives with 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.230
 this loss is that this emptiness is 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.090
 living with you do not know if the person 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.030
 He died where I went to where he was 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.000
 That guy that called me and it's weird. 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980
 Fuck, but I think he should 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.990
 being somewhere and in this way and 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.290
 adapt me sell I regret the day 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:44.050
 That I'm not 19 anymore understands 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:51.090
 What did you want to protect me from? 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:54.340
 Anyway, I'm really hoping that's it, right? 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.770
 the surface is fished for australia 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.020
 the father is right behind him so I do not 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.840
 I can watch this movie I remember 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.890
 My father was so moved, my father. 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.620
 I was a father denied my father is a 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.500
 Daddy should have taken more 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.550
 But it's like that in life, we have 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.190
 People are the people we think we're going to have. 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.810
 our parents the rest of our lives is nothing 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.840
 that one day he goes away 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.530
 It's normal, that's natural, and there we have it. 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:28.060
 that you accept that 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.060
 accept what to do
