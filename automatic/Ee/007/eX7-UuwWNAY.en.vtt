communication on the network and I want

communication on the network and I want
to<00:01:49.380> compare<00:01:49.799> that<00:01:49.859> for<00:01:50.819> you<00:01:50.969> with<00:01:51.569> something

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
to compare that for you with something

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.789 
to compare that for you with something

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
like an IP fragmentation attack which is

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.690 
like an IP fragmentation attack which is
a<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.579> very<00:01:56.850> different<00:01:57.240> look<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:57.780> feel<00:01:58.020> so

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
a very very different look and feel so

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.949 
a very very different look and feel so

you<00:04:08.160> a<00:04:08.690> interesting<00:04:09.690> first<00:04:09.900> perspective<00:04:10.709> into

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
you a interesting first perspective into

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.030 
you a interesting first perspective into
how<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.060> use<00:04:12.269> network<00:04:13.109> monitor<00:04:13.560> in<00:04:13.680> order<00:04:13.799> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
how to use network monitor in order to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.069 
how to use network monitor in order to
take<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> look<00:04:14.459> at<00:04:14.579> your<00:04:14.730> network<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.239> do<00:04:16.049> a

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
take a look at your network and do a

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.800 
take a look at your network and do a
real<00:04:16.349> basic<00:04:16.769> analysis<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.579> are<00:04:17.849> things<00:04:18.239> going

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
real basic analysis of are things going

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.409 
real basic analysis of are things going
as<00:04:19.049> planned<00:04:19.829> or<00:04:20.250> as<00:04:20.370> expected<00:04:20.820> or<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.329> a

relatively normal way or are there
things<00:04:23.010> that<00:04:23.400> maybe<00:04:23.700> I<00:04:23.820> should<00:04:24.090> take<00:04:24.210> a

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
things that maybe I should take a

things that maybe I should take a
further<00:04:24.630> look<00:04:24.810> at<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.849> possibly<00:04:26.849> analyze<00:04:27.360> to

further look at and possibly analyze to

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.990 
further look at and possibly analyze to
