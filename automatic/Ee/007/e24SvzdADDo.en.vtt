00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.160
 great fighters in the twenty second issue 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.899
 interesting facts we are with you 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.240
 take a closer look at German 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.519
 soup weighed tanchiki 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:20.250
 and make a little stutter for one 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:22.140
 American gunner in the text of the conditions 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 To receive the main caliber black on 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.180
 it is not written to white to touch an ally 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.980
 direct shots that's why in 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.779
 some fights this medal of the hero 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 battle can be seen on the tank which 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 inflicted not the greatest damage but this 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.020
 the condition is still described a little 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.719
 incorrect as when dealing damage 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.520
 to his ally turned light blue 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.430
 the right to receive the main caliber 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.079
 does not go anywhere very soon in the fields 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 battles world of tanks will appear 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.530
 truly huge and cumbersome 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.930
 Japanese tanks 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 but the guys involved in creating models 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.870
 techniques for the game 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.489
 know how to pay attention and very small 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800
 details for example if more closely 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.870
 look at the side can be seen 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.119
 that its periscope is distorted displays 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.100
 the surrounding area damn I think it is 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.510
 really cool because I managed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 notice this chip only with 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 using the free camera hopefully 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.939
 translating borscht leaders with optics nothing 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.939
 nahimil 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.000
 I mentioned in a recent issue 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.110
 daily limit on recruitment 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.300
 free crew 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.210
 it turns out there is a limitation and on 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.460
 sale of equipment in just one day for you 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.230
 allowed to say goodbye to five tanchik 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.420
 me most likely it is done in order 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:40.300
 secure the player in case of possible break 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.660
 his account this time I would like to have you 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.550
 ask which car weight top 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.710
 guns in kilograms exactly twice 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.170
 exceed the maximum amount of HP 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:56.170
 this tank 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:58.360
 I wait for answers in the mail 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.210
 wargaming leagues for a good player 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.399
 high dynamic properties and power 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 up to five millimeter cannon success 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.690
 in battle against any opponent and 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.970
 really a hundred and five millimeter 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.950
 gun is a dangerous weapon is a pity that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.070
 in the arsenal of this average from the american 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.930
 Tank you are not found her Japanese 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.480
 kamikaze were not only among the pilots 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.160
 during the Soviet Japanese War among 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.989
 abundance of captured mines sappers 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.820
 Trans-Baikal Front rushed to the eye 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.459
 brand new wooden cubic boxes 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.100
 forms they had two pens on the sides and 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.860
 two holes for fuses inside 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.080
 from 6 to 10 kilograms of explosives 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.180
 appointment of unusual shells soon 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.190
 cleared up they served as weapons 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.290
 bomber cord from the fuse 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.360
 attached to a belt or buttons 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.310
 fighter jerked by himself a fuse 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.680
 it worked and could only jump 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.390
 under the tank however no case 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.290
 the use of such mines was not 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.269
 fixed on some tanks in the game 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.459
 the same job can do 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.970
 several people for example in the Soviet 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.000
 t28 2 radio operator entry about two loaders 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.700
 Aries 62 gunners with the first two 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.680
 cars everything is clear enough but I'm up 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.320
 so far I can not digest the information on 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.269
 American, I initially thought that 2 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.670
 the gunner controls the fire of these two 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.239
 twin machine guns but no sit there 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.820
 radio operator 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.850
 so I want to ask you for what 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.620
 this tank 2 gunner write your answer 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.790
 in the comments and not necessarily 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 that he was historically correct 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.819
 better be funny and interesting 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.459

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.230

 rotated 45 degrees initially I 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.530
 knew only help these new ones 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.510
