00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.580
 Hello everyone, today we will do all together 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.440
 now the beatles I'm sure the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.600
 however, know as usual here 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.830
 I put the direct link to be able to 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.910
 listen to the songs in this tutorial 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.519
 obviously we will only make the agreements 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.500
 because also because this song is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.000
 very simple and in any case composed only 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 by agreements 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.590
 let's start with the introduction or came 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 but also from the real verse 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.690
 the first chord and the increased sol that 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 it is done by pressing with a ring finger and a little finger 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.399
 the third key of the first string with 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.219
 the index is the second key of the fifth 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.180
 rope and with the middle the third fret 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.180
 of the sixth string 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.950
 the second chord of the of the stanza e 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.830
 the seventh king that is done by pressing with 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:03.309
 the ring finger the second key of the first 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:06.850
 chord with the index the first key of the 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.400
 second string and with the middle the second 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 key of the third string we play though 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:16.030
 only the first four strings remembered 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.619
 which of course the fifth and sixth king for 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.170
 the king fifth if this time they don't have to 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.869
 to be played 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.259
 so sol is the seventh time is 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.259
 this 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.970
 then or more read 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.610
 of course the picking however you can 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.470
 customize it the way you want because it is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.200
 gone to quite simple area is 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.070
 however very customizable 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.070
 you can do 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.440
 you can do anything you do n't 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.350
 just want that you obviously follow 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.930
 time this series of agreements then 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.750
 money on the seventh repeats twice 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.290
 then for the verse 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:34.300
 let's move on to the 3 refrain that it is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.460
 practically the part a little prettier 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.740
 we have the money 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.610
 do major by pressing with 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.950
 the index is the first key of the second 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.560
 rope with the best the second button 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.060
 of the fourth string and with the ring finger the 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.060
 third key of the fifth string 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:58.360
 the major king that is done by pressing with the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.549
 medium the second key of the first string 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.420
 with lamps and the third button of the 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:07.569
 second string and with the index the second 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.180
 key of the third string attention here 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:17.500
 there is an exchange between rr seventh if you want 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.720
 you can leave the seventh king so don't 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.620
 you can do the seventh and with the best 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 press the third key of the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.510
 second string to send more and then 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.510
 immediately raise it when cr seventh 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:44.879
 now I let you hear it then team 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.879
 a sol d e major is the seventh ok 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.670
 I did it this way 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.060
 like I said but you can too 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.300
 get them at 8pm but if it's like living better 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.860
 a fairly quick exchange then 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:16.820
 rightly where to lose even a little 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:19.340
 time if you can't do it or so or 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.959
 in this way we now move on to 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.840
 refrain that it is practically 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.810
 very easy because for the refrain it is 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.660
 means when they say all together now 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:33.290
 it is also repeated about four times 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.720
 in the end then repeated several times for 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.830
 we only need this refrain 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.830
 play the G major 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:55.310
 for the refrain it is then again 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.310
 let's move on to soul sequences is seventh 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.670
 and so on regarding that 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.830
 verse in the final part 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.910
 as already mentioned, that is repeated again 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:11.220
 refrain together now and at the end 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.800
 it is obviously repeated several times then 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.780
 even if you are with friends you can do it 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.620
 several times because rightly a song 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:23.460
 pretty fun i hope to be 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:27.260
 been clear today's tutorial ends 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.260
