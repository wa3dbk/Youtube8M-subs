for anything else I just use a knife to
kind<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.270> mix<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> up<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.950> just<00:01:13.979> use<00:01:14.280> your

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
kind of mix it up you can just use your

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.920 
kind of mix it up you can just use your
hand<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.850> want<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.240> use<00:01:15.659> my<00:01:15.869> fingers<00:01:16.350> yeah

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.210 

the<00:01:21.930> main<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.070> all

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
the main thing is to just get it all

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.420 
the main thing is to just get it all
ripped<00:01:23.549> up<00:01:23.700> into<00:01:24.439> small<00:01:25.439> pieces<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
ripped up into small pieces and in the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.330 
ripped up into small pieces and in the
water<00:01:26.640> through<00:01:27.560> then<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.650> usually<00:01:28.860> let<00:01:29.189> it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
water through then we usually let it

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.800 
water through then we usually let it
soak<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.939> water<00:01:29.970> just<00:01:30.420> for<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.659> little

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
soak in the water just for a little

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.730 
soak in the water just for a little
while<00:01:31.130> blends<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.549> bit<00:01:32.640> easier<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.740> I

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
while blends a little bit easier so I

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.999 
while blends a little bit easier so I
guess<00:01:35.579> what<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> do<00:01:35.970> when<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.920> am<00:01:37.920> making<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
guess what I do when I am making it is

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.999 
guess what I do when I am making it is
once<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.159> have<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> all<00:01:41.670> ripped<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.150> into<00:01:42.479> pieces

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
once I have it all ripped up into pieces

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.469 
once I have it all ripped up into pieces
and<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> water<00:01:44.729> I<00:01:45.320> just<00:01:46.369> um<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> pulse

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and in the water I just um kind of pulse

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.179 
and in the water I just um kind of pulse
the<00:01:48.689> blender<00:01:48.990> real<00:01:49.200> quick<00:01:49.409> once<00:01:49.829> you<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
the blender real quick once you get the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.230 
the blender real quick once you get the
lid<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.430> here

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.510 

just<00:01:55.240> like<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.860> will<00:01:57.070> just<00:01:57.280> kind<00:01:57.399> of

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
just like that that will just kind of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.520 
just like that that will just kind of
get<00:01:57.670> them<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:58.570> they're<00:01:58.720> not<00:01:58.750> touching<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.259> you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
get them so they're not touching it you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.499 
get them so they're not touching it you
know<00:01:59.619> you'll<00:01:59.770> get<00:01:59.920> like<00:02:00.100> five<00:02:01.000> or<00:02:01.149> six<00:02:01.180> pieces

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
know you'll get like five or six pieces

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.609 
know you'll get like five or six pieces
that<00:02:01.810> are<00:02:01.899> just<00:02:02.020> kind<00:02:02.229> of<00:02:02.290> sandwiched

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
that are just kind of sandwiched

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.570 
that are just kind of sandwiched
together<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:03.009> they're<00:02:03.100> not<00:02:03.189> going<00:02:03.369> to<00:02:03.399> soak

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
together and they're not going to soak

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.219 
together and they're not going to soak
up<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.820> water<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:04.149> well<00:02:04.299> so<00:02:04.720> you<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:04.840> pulse

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
up the water as well so you just pulse

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.539 
up the water as well so you just pulse
it<00:02:05.409> once<00:02:05.560> real<00:02:05.770> quick<00:02:05.950> give<00:02:06.220> them<00:02:06.310> a<00:02:06.369> little

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
it once real quick give them a little

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.820 
it once real quick give them a little
time<00:02:06.759> to<00:02:06.970> soak<00:02:07.210> that<00:02:07.390> water<00:02:07.600> up<00:02:07.840> it'll<00:02:08.619> just

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
time to soak that water up it'll just

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.670 
time to soak that water up it'll just
blend<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.160> little<00:02:09.250> bit<00:02:09.369> easier<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:11.410> so

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
blend a little bit easier for you and so

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.660 
blend a little bit easier for you and so
we<00:02:11.800> just<00:02:11.920> let<00:02:12.069> that<00:02:12.190> soak<00:02:12.430> for<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:12.819> bit

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
we just let that soak for a little bit

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.850 
we just let that soak for a little bit
okay<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:15.970> want<00:02:16.150> me<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:17.110> turn<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.410> up<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.709> come

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
okay you want me to turn it up and come

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.670 
okay you want me to turn it up and come
back<00:02:17.980> no<00:02:18.970> that's<00:02:19.239> good<00:02:19.480> enough<00:02:19.660> let's<00:02:20.470> hope

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
back no that's good enough let's hope

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.589 
back no that's good enough let's hope
for<00:02:20.739> a<00:02:20.920> while<00:02:21.160> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.120> just<00:02:22.300> start<00:02:22.480> our

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
for a while and then we just start our

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.170 
for a while and then we just start our
blender<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.140> have<00:02:23.319> our<00:02:23.500> timer<00:02:23.769> here<00:02:24.180> set

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
blender and we have our timer here set

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.660 
blender and we have our timer here set
to<00:02:25.299> thirty<00:02:25.510> seconds<00:02:26.080> mm-hmm<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:27.400> we<00:02:27.519> get<00:02:27.610> a

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to thirty seconds mm-hmm so we get a

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.840 
to thirty seconds mm-hmm so we get a
nice<00:02:27.880> thorough<00:02:28.420> blend<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:30.250> us<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.790> our

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
nice thorough blend with us and our

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.850 
nice thorough blend with us and our
timers<00:02:31.390> yes

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
timers yes

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.430 
timers yes
and<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:34.090> doesn't<00:02:34.870> really<00:02:34.989> matter<00:02:35.200> what

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
and so doesn't really matter what

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.750 
and so doesn't really matter what
setting<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.830> use<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.130> use<00:02:36.280> whatever<00:02:36.489> works

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
setting to use just use whatever works

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.789 
setting to use just use whatever works
best<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.120> you<00:02:37.330> just<00:02:37.540> trial<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:37.780> error<00:02:37.989> but

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
best for you just trial and error but

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.229 
best for you just trial and error but
then<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.130> blend<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:39.700> you're<00:02:39.819> not<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
then we blend and you're not going to

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:56.740 
then we blend and you're not going to
hear<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.450> for<00:02:40.660> a<00:02:40.690> while

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.920 

you<00:02:56.990> should<00:02:57.170> probably<00:02:57.380> come<00:02:57.710> back
