00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:44.920 
500 and name it a loading circle quick
okay<00:00:42.339> now<00:00:43.339> we'll<00:00:43.550> go<00:00:43.699> to<00:00:43.730> our<00:00:44.030> custom<00:00:44.659> shape

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
okay now we'll go to our custom shape

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.689 
okay now we'll go to our custom shape
tool<00:00:46.149> by<00:00:47.290> clicking<00:00:48.290> and<00:00:48.949> holding<00:00:49.010> on<00:00:49.579> the

rectangle tool for the shape tool and

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.819 
rectangle tool for the shape tool and
going<00:00:52.699> on<00:00:52.820> custom<00:00:53.149> shape<00:00:53.359> tool<00:00:53.559> we<00:00:54.559> have<00:00:54.590> to

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
going on custom shape tool we have to

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.630 
going on custom shape tool we have to
select<00:00:55.160> a<00:00:55.840> tick<00:00:56.840> around<00:00:57.320> circle<00:00:57.829> for<00:00:58.309> our

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
select a tick around circle for our

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.330 
select a tick around circle for our
shape<00:00:59.090> and<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.199> might<00:01:00.410> not<00:01:00.590> have<00:01:00.649> it<00:01:00.949> in<00:01:01.100> your

custom<00:01:02.059> shape<00:01:02.359> panel<00:01:02.870> to<00:01:03.469> get<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:03.980> you<00:01:04.399> could

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
custom shape panel to get that you could

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.690 
custom shape panel to get that you could
just<00:01:04.759> go<00:01:05.000> to<00:01:05.030> shapes<00:01:05.570> and<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.250> at<00:01:07.429> the

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
just go to shapes and have it at the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.040 
just go to shapes and have it at the
bottom<00:01:07.970> of<00:01:08.270> these<00:01:08.780> shapes<00:01:09.310> dialog<00:01:10.539> and<00:01:11.539> then

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
bottom of these shapes dialog and then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.350 
bottom of these shapes dialog and then
just<00:01:12.380> create<00:01:12.830> it<00:01:13.990> somewhere<00:01:14.990> here<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:16.460> feel

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
just create it somewhere here the feel

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.380 
just create it somewhere here the feel
could<00:01:17.570> be<00:01:17.630> anything<00:01:18.619> as<00:01:19.100> it<00:01:19.909> doesn't<00:01:20.119> matter

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
could be anything as it doesn't matter

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.630 
could be anything as it doesn't matter
because<00:01:20.810> we<00:01:21.229> are<00:01:21.470> going<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.830> add<00:01:22.099> a<00:01:22.310> gradient

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
because we are going to add a gradient

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.370 
because we are going to add a gradient
overlay<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.569> end<00:01:25.000> I'll<00:01:26.000> have<00:01:26.300> a<00:01:26.630> shift<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
overlay in the end I'll have a shift and

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.900 
overlay in the end I'll have a shift and
alt<00:01:28.060> pressed<00:01:29.060> at<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.450> moment<00:01:29.840> so<00:01:30.770> that<00:01:30.800> it<00:01:31.729> is

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
constrained to a perfect circle we'll go

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.479 
constrained to a perfect circle we'll go
to<00:01:34.970> blending<00:01:35.209> options<00:01:35.479> add<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.649> grade<00:01:37.009> or<00:01:37.220> lay
