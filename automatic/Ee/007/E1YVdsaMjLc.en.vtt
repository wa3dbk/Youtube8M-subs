ultra<00:00:20.689> 24<00:00:23.060> hours<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> got<00:00:25.350> this<00:00:25.530> from<00:00:27.560> John

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
ultra 24 hours so I got this from John

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.370 
ultra 24 hours so I got this from John
Lewis<00:00:28.770> think<00:00:29.760> John<00:00:29.970> Lewis<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.570> few<00:00:31.020> weeks<00:00:31.230> ago

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
Lewis think John Lewis a few weeks ago

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.619 
Lewis think John Lewis a few weeks ago
and<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:32.430> thought<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.730> would<00:00:33.000> try<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.239> different

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
and I thought I would try a different

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.790 
and I thought I would try a different
type<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.780> foundation<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> normally

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
type of foundation because I normally

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.840 
type of foundation because I normally
use<00:00:35.550> them<00:00:36.449> the<00:00:36.930> mac<00:00:37.170> matchmaster<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:38.430> i

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
use them the mac matchmaster and i

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
use them the mac matchmaster and i
normally<00:00:38.909> a<00:00:39.269> shade<00:00:39.539> 8<00:00:39.839> and<00:00:40.679> so<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.039> thought<00:00:41.309> I'd

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
normally a shade 8 and so I thought I'd

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.529 
normally a shade 8 and so I thought I'd
try<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.699> one<00:00:41.999> because<00:00:42.179> I<00:00:42.210> know<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.359> lot<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
try this one because I know a lot of

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:44.930 
try this one because I know a lot of
people<00:00:42.839> have<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.019> talking<00:00:43.440> about<00:00:43.499> it<00:00:43.949> so<00:00:44.519> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
people have been talking about it so I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.599 
people have been talking about it so I
thought<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> was<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:45.929> for<00:00:46.109> a<00:00:46.170> change<00:00:46.409> and<00:00:46.739> so

00:00:47.599 --> 00:00:47.609 
thought it was time for a change and so

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:49.489 
thought it was time for a change and so
I<00:00:47.640> went<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.179> John<00:00:48.390> Lewis<00:00:48.749> and<00:00:48.929> I<00:00:49.019> kind<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.350> had

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:49.499 
I went to John Lewis and I kind of had

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:52.069 
I went to John Lewis and I kind of had
an<00:00:49.589> idea<00:00:50.089> anyway<00:00:51.089> from<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.690> watching

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
an idea anyway from like watching

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
an idea anyway from like watching
YouTube<00:00:52.530> videos<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.129> stuff<00:00:53.339> like<00:00:53.519> what<00:00:53.760> my

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
YouTube videos and stuff like what my

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.739 
YouTube videos and stuff like what my
shade<00:00:54.239> might<00:00:54.479> actually<00:00:54.659> be<00:00:55.109> so<00:00:56.010> I'm<00:00:56.819> shade<00:00:57.120> 13

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749

sturdy bottle I like the fact there's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.959 
sturdy bottle I like the fact there's
actually<00:01:21.659> got<00:01:22.020> a<00:01:22.049> pump<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.649> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.250> about<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> few

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
actually got a pump a lot of about a few

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:25.069 
actually got a pump a lot of about a few
foundations<00:01:24.539> have<00:01:24.630> recently<00:01:24.960> I've<00:01:25.049> started

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
foundations have recently I've started

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.160 
foundations have recently I've started
to<00:01:25.469> be<00:01:25.740> using<00:01:26.460> pumps<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.119> rather<00:01:27.750> than<00:01:27.990> buying

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
to be using pumps and rather than buying

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.529 
to be using pumps and rather than buying
them<00:01:28.320> separately<00:01:29.060> which<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> think<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:30.539 
them separately which is I think is

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:31.910 
them separately which is I think is
really<00:01:30.719> good<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.380> helps<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.680> control

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
really good because it helps you control

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.529 
really good because it helps you control
the<00:01:32.280> amount<00:01:32.520> of<00:01:32.609> foundation<00:01:33.149> that<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.299> want

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
the amount of foundation that you want

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.260 
the amount of foundation that you want
to<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:33.869> onto<00:01:34.259> your<00:01:34.619> face<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.000> yeah<00:01:36.149> it's

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
to put onto your face and so yeah it's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.260 
to put onto your face and so yeah it's
got<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> pump<00:01:36.659> system<00:01:36.929> like<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:38.119> so<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.210> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
got a pump system like that so this is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.969 
got a pump system like that so this is
what<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> bottom<00:01:39.899> looks<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:41.420> think<00:01:42.979> it's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
what the bottom looks like I think it's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.340 
what the bottom looks like I think it's
a<00:01:44.070> 30<00:01:44.340> mil<00:01:44.729> bottle<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.960> think<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
a 30 mil bottle which I think is

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.539 
a 30 mil bottle which I think is
generally<00:01:46.590> standard<00:01:48.560> for<00:01:49.560> most<00:01:49.770> people<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
generally standard for most people and

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.599 
generally standard for most people and
it's<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.960> says<00:01:52.109> wear<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.619> comfort<00:01:53.130> retouch

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
it's it says wear and comfort retouch

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.090 
it's it says wear and comfort retouch
free<00:01:53.969> divine<00:01:54.780> perfection<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> has<00:01:55.829> an<00:01:55.950> SPF

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
free divine perfection and it has an SPF

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.149 
free divine perfection and it has an SPF
of<00:01:56.579> 5<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.749> is<00:01:57.869> not<00:01:58.049> much<00:01:58.320> but<00:01:58.530> I<00:01:58.590> use<00:01:58.920> like<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
of 5 which is not much but I use like a

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.270
