00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.230 
it doesn't stick to the bottom or the
sides<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.140> pan<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:09.610> took<00:02:09.850> around<00:02:10.000> about

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
sides of the pan this took around about

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.900 
sides of the pan this took around about
five<00:02:10.539> minutes<00:02:10.899> and<00:02:11.500> also<00:02:11.890> my<00:02:12.250> creams<00:02:12.550> had<00:02:12.730> ran

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
five minutes and also my creams had ran

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.449 
five minutes and also my creams had ran
about<00:02:13.030> five<00:02:13.300> minutes<00:02:13.600> into<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:13.930> point<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.530> my

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
about five minutes into that point so my

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.280 
about five minutes into that point so my
cream<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.850> never<00:02:16.060> popping<00:02:16.480> consistency<00:02:17.170> which

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
cream is never popping consistency which

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.170 
cream is never popping consistency which
basically<00:02:17.680> means<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.250> not<00:02:18.430> stiff<00:02:18.700> peaks<00:02:18.970> but

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
basically means it's not stiff peaks but

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.050 
basically means it's not stiff peaks but
it<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:22.739> in<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.950> pan<00:02:24.160> here<00:02:24.430> you<00:02:24.640> can<00:02:24.820> probably

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
it is in the pan here you can probably

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.660 
it is in the pan here you can probably
see<00:02:25.600> there<00:02:26.290> are<00:02:26.410> quite<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.709> few<00:02:26.860> bubbles<00:02:27.489> in

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
see there are quite a few bubbles in

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.390 
see there are quite a few bubbles in
there<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.390> want<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.959> keep<00:02:29.170> those<00:02:29.410> bubbles<00:02:29.860> so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
there you want to keep those bubbles so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.040 
there you want to keep those bubbles so
I<00:02:30.430> took<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.850> off<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.150> stove<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.660> left<00:02:31.870> it

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
I took that off the stove and I left it

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.510 
I took that off the stove and I left it
right<00:02:32.170> ten<00:02:32.470> minutes<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.890> cool<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.220> little<00:02:33.250> bit

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
right ten minutes to cool a little bit

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.580 
right ten minutes to cool a little bit
and<00:02:34.090> now<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.540> going<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.989> adding<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.380> to<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
and now I'm going to be adding it to the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.880 
and now I'm going to be adding it to the
cream<00:02:36.060> folds<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.209> mixture<00:02:37.600> it's<00:02:38.410> really

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
cream folds the mixture it's really

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.390 
cream folds the mixture it's really
ready<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.580> fold<00:02:40.360> mixture<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.860> stir<00:02:42.160> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
ready to fold mixture not to stir it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.330 
ready to fold mixture not to stir it
because<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.880> don't<00:02:43.180> want<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.570> knock<00:02:44.280> with<00:02:45.280> a

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
because you don't want to knock with a

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.020 
because you don't want to knock with a
mousse

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
mousse

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.539 
mousse
air<00:02:46.360> is<00:02:46.840> what<00:02:47.049> makes<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.500> light<00:02:47.739> the<00:02:48.070> more<00:02:48.280> air

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549

the<00:02:49.420> lighter<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.989> is<00:02:50.019> this<00:02:50.739> isn't<00:02:51.280> a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
the lighter it is this isn't a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.590 
the lighter it is this isn't a
ridiculously<00:02:52.420> light<00:02:52.720> mixture<00:02:53.820> it's<00:02:54.820> kind<00:02:55.570> of

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
ridiculously light mixture it's kind of

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.130 
ridiculously light mixture it's kind of
a<00:02:55.720> half<00:02:56.140> mousse<00:02:56.620> half<00:02:56.980> pudding<00:02:57.489> consistency

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
a half mousse half pudding consistency

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:08.930 
a half mousse half pudding consistency
but<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.260> is<00:02:59.410> absolutely<00:02:59.620> beautiful

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.880 

fold<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.150> will<00:03:10.570> take<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.810> few<00:03:11.049> minutes<00:03:11.440> you<00:03:11.709> know

fold it will take a few minutes you know

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:39.699 
fold it will take a few minutes you know
it<00:03:12.010> takes<00:03:12.250> longer<00:03:12.640> than<00:03:12.670> stirring

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.259 

so<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.019> put<00:04:18.440> my<00:04:18.590> mousse<00:04:18.829> into<00:04:19.190> these<00:04:19.729> little

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
so I put my mousse into these little

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.059 
so I put my mousse into these little
cups<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:20.629> I<00:04:20.690> made<00:04:21.019> they<00:04:21.590> were<00:04:21.650> in<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.919> fridge

00:04:22.059 --> 00:04:22.069 
cups that I made they were in the fridge

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.619 
cups that I made they were in the fridge
for<00:04:22.220> around<00:04:22.310> about<00:04:22.550> three<00:04:23.000> hours<00:04:23.150> so<00:04:23.419> I<00:04:23.479> just

00:04:23.619 --> 00:04:23.629 
for around about three hours so I just

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.119 
for around about three hours so I just
want<00:04:23.810> to<00:04:23.900> show<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.110> what<00:04:24.259> it<00:04:24.349> looks<00:04:24.530> like<00:04:24.740> I

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
want to show you what it looks like I

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.070 
want to show you what it looks like I
did<00:04:25.819> actually<00:04:25.970> take<00:04:26.270> this<00:04:26.509> straight<00:04:26.840> out<00:04:27.020> of

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
did actually take this straight out of

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.899 
did actually take this straight out of
the<00:04:27.319> fridge<00:04:27.560> and<00:04:27.800> then<00:04:28.039> do<00:04:28.280> a<00:04:28.310> little<00:04:28.490> video<00:04:28.580> on

00:04:28.899 --> 00:04:28.909 
the fridge and then do a little video on

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.999 
the fridge and then do a little video on
it<00:04:29.030> so<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:29.479> was<00:04:29.569> actually<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.050> lot<00:04:30.319> harder<00:04:30.500> so<00:04:30.919> I

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
it so it was actually a lot harder so I

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.800 
it so it was actually a lot harder so I
definitely<00:04:31.370> recommend<00:04:31.909> that<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.389> need<00:04:32.599> them
