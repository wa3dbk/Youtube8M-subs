00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 the crazy bieber arthur and today 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.970
 we're not nervous then what is nervous 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 what is his easiest figure in the kingdom 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.589
 united then some - little scorpions 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.730
 except that scorpions what is it 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:25.499
 simple and that's the figure that can 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.649
 to follow with no movement 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:30.649
 so we forget about kraats that's it 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.199
 so how is there already three 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.949
 points of support to start taking 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:44.239
 will pass two placed on the ground you tend 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:47.960
 your legs you and your left hand 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 far enough to have a good grip 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 ask me head and so you have to there 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.219
 you see 3.2 cooked so you train 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.130
 to ferrol it coming at least a minute 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.170
 train you every day three 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:11.910
 days you have it is really very 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.930
 easy so after you can remove the 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.030
 head and that's it so I'm going to give you 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 a tip later whenever 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.280
 you work a figure work and there 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:30.600
 on both sides right and left handed by 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.800
 example righty koji it can really 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.830
 help you to learn some 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.240
 sequences for example so after I 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.070
 will you make the end of a passage 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.470
 someone finish between at200 does the 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.960
 truce it's really not a freeze a 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 figure it's just a transition for 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:02:00.390
 in china with something that's 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:02:01.470
 really a pass for example tracks and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.010
 also for those who are wondering 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.930
 question 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.170
 the trap is really not a question 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.800
 Forcibly it's really necessary to place 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.800
 his point of support 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.450
 here are these leaflets tutorials I hope that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 I help you and above all train yourself 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.070
 to have the base for a slut 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.070
 tutorial me I tell you to warmer
