we require what is one down you destroy

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:25.310 
we require what is one down you destroy
us<00:04:09.940> fires<00:04:11.520> us

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:34.460 

retribution<00:04:26.220> will<00:04:26.760> be<00:04:26.910> mine<00:04:29.870> speak<00:04:33.470> make

retribution will be mine speak make

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:49.010 
retribution will be mine speak make
school<00:04:34.890> suffer<00:04:47.150> flash-freeze<00:04:48.150> will<00:04:48.540> be<00:04:48.690> here

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
school suffer flash-freeze will be here

00:04:49.020 --> 00:05:04.149 
school suffer flash-freeze will be here
soon<00:04:51.110> yes

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:04.159 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:06.159 

so<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:04.969> trick<00:05:05.179> here<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.419> just<00:05:05.689> a<00:05:05.779> rusher

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
so the trick here is just a rusher

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.129 
so the trick here is just a rusher
zerglings<00:05:06.649> in<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.159> then<00:05:08.089> split<00:05:08.929> with

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
zerglings in and then split with

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:13.570 
zerglings in and then split with
Kerrigan<00:05:09.679> here<00:05:11.349> so<00:05:12.349> everything<00:05:12.919> sprays<00:05:13.369> in

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
Kerrigan here so everything sprays in

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.219 
Kerrigan here so everything sprays in
your<00:05:13.699> cert<00:05:13.909> one<00:05:14.089> is<00:05:14.179> going<00:05:14.330> to<00:05:14.449> rush<00:05:14.719> right<00:05:14.899> in

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
your cert one is going to rush right in

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.649 
your cert one is going to rush right in
you<00:05:15.739> just<00:05:15.889> ignore<00:05:16.369> these<00:05:16.669> sorry<00:05:17.449> for<00:05:17.599> the
