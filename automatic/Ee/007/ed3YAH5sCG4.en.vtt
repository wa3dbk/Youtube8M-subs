 possible for this we have position of 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.910
 speed that lasts six minutes so 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.100
 perfect we are going to put it on and for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.690
 she for them let's be very very very 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.210
 quickly when the bar arrives that 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.800
 pink that we see above we can leave like this 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.380

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.150
 Well we have five minutes and a peak 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.500
 because we have not given it well for 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.240
 to be but good nothing happens there too 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.680
 we have freezing ray so 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.480
 pressures we find some beast that 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.890
 go too much with someone who has 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.330
 come to the end and go too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.670
 sitting we can put a police 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 pretty decent okay okay guys here 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.869
 they are all 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.369
 I am the beast but I am good people 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.079
 look at times people look how good I am 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 I kill you, we are the people who killed you 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.520
 so that he does not continue to suffer vale magic 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.229
 potter 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.030
 shit has happened to me for the damn 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.469
 speed potion that is me doing 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.320
 parkour speed composition I'm 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:33.340
 terrible because I'm not used to 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.810
 well it is not customary to do any 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.610
 kind of parkour really but 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.079
 composing speed guys I'm less 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.520
 accustomed yet and yes that's true 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.409
 that for some things it is very comfortable 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.210
 for others I find it super uncomfortable 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.719
 I would go bad end like that happening 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.880
 runners and such and we see to see is that 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.200
 I do not know a people either I do not know if 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.360
 here we meet someone and that is 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.619
 Good guys, you know that the other time 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600
 also raised a part of here I think that 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.399
 I was being a runner so it's 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.899
 ok vary a bit / being 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.280
 runner and beast is split now 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.619
 I'm bringing with sanders that 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.270
 true for my taste I love to play 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.560
 with knowledge, it is also worth saying 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.810
 guys who have uploaded a video before 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.399
 covers the series this exhibition about 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.470
 how many youtubers so if you have not 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.239
 seen guys you can go to see him and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.190
 my mother this par kurt that like this one 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.319
 I think that as I mentioned in the one the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.730
 last video of this map costs me 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.010
 quite a week ago 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.959
 as well as when this map but as 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.310
 runners so he did not have so much 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.620
 Alaves pse emotion because the 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.670
 true that although it seems easier 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.319
 it's really hard going you have two left 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.220
 runners which I do not know where they are 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.440
 and guys 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.420
 I do not know by the way I would like for me 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.710
 put is for the comments that do not 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.390
 of the game you want me to bring you vale 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.520
 because then well guys would be very 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 important to me that you told me that already 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.150
 that well it burned in game 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.680
 like in the channel and that because 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.510
 sometimes I'm a little lost and only that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 to a broker that should be coming 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.500
 at the end or very at the beginning because 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.420
 really by guys you can not be very 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.490
 very good is because if I do not do not do not do it 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.910
 I explain a girl that I fall mother of mine 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.700
 out there that kiki beating that is us 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.470
 we would have given good he wants to throw 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.510
 over here is I believe and here on the right and 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.220
 we will reach the end where if we arrive 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.630
 we can sit down at least but not 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.170
 I know where to go because I do not have the most 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.320
 remote idea 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.580
 I'm going to go up here, there's no way 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.860
 all nor guys where is the 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.450
 runner but good guys I do not know the 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.780
 true then I hope to make some game 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.730
 out there you have to go up and up I think 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.410
 that was so I think it was what 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.030
 we have to do now the shit that I 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.459
 I fall uncle is not using the potion of 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.980
 lav speed is okay though for things of 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.500
 these are at least useful to do 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.970
 boats of this type is worth but yes but it is 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.170
 that would give me to say in my bar 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.310
 experience as I am from afar respect 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.290
 to the runners why 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.819
 many times it is who I do not know and it is that 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.370
 this broker guys like I say can 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:45.530
 be surfing may be at the end and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.480
 I do not know clearly what you will say but yes if you have 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.819
 problem of yours yes but bus ticos if 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.160
 ends the time that as you see are 327 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.900
 seconds I lose the game and I do not 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.430
 I want to press the game is worth much more 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.989
 starting being at the same time that we are going to 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.150
 see is where they are because they charge me 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.420
 of one and two have died by their own 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.590
 standing basically and here where I'm going now 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.569
 wait I think you have to follow it red 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.030
 but I do not know to what extent we should go down 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.310
 not the red ones here is not clear 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.410
 Well, now to see where I'm going 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.510
 well over here to the end 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.880
 just guys well we have come to the 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.180
 end of this composition of my 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.500
 security kick bastard fireproof potion or 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.590
 it's frozen it's frozen it 's frozen 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.570
 to burst him so it's frozen and 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:33.139
 we can not hit him anymore, it's not worth 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.370
 matt matte please read little 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.980
 We will do enough as it came very good 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.840
 beating and for the setter that leads I think 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.910
 what can we win 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.180

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.960
 It's worth, ok, it does not give me the victory 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 Well guys, now we'll see each other in the 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.440
 second game that 's been when 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.560
 less epic and that we have gone a 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.560
 beast even though we 're going
