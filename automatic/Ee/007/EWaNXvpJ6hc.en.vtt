00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.820
 windows 8 pro what we have to do 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.200

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.640

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.710
 and they wait for download as they see no 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.750
 it weighs a lot 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.579
 once the download is finished 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.820

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 So he asks us for permission, we accept him 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.600
 and everything that asks us for permission we give 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.969

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.369

 these two options 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.869
 and they give in to accept 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.480
 here they give in to accept 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:30.830
 and wait for me to download 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.760
 ok once the process is finished 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.490
