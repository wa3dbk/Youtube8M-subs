00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello and welcome to hardware rat in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.639
 this video the update of the 1800 euro 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.090
 gaming computers november 2013 as 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.889
 processor of the intel core i7 4930 came with 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.789
 six times 3.4 gigahertz 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.480
 he has a day of 3.9 ghz 130 watts 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.000
 tDP 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070
 he took a boat he means 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.500
 has a free multiplier so 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.720
 freis overclocking and hyperthreading the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.970
 means anyone can has two threads as 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.710
 a theoretical 12 cores with the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.719
 Of course you have a processor for one 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.640
 all the way taken care of when still too 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.460
 weak you can overclock him yes 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 this is even better than the 11 55 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 clock until 11.50 clock because this time the hits 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.260
 weather so the metal cover again 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.079
 is soldered as cpu kilowatt peak kwp 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.329
 per two of these cool enough 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.699
 for a quiet operation or the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.730
 Processor dust overclock and as 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.770
 member the ice roddicks 79 extreme 4 with 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.160
 the intel x79 chipset 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.559
 it has usb 3s sata 3 4 ddr3 ram banks 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.939
 the rubbish run pizza express 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:13.020
 3.0 a 10.1 soundchip unam europe and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:17.369
 twice ps 21 reset button a coaxial 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:21.000
 a post link twice usb 3 6 x usb 2 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.840
 a LAN jack, an external SATA 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.509
 firewire port and 6 x 35 mm latches for 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.409
 the sound chip and as a working memory 16 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.009
 gb kingston hyperx ddr3 1600 the 10 9 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.259
 quad kit ddr3 1600 and counting is right 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.939
 afloat it's a quartet that means 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.040
 you do not let a nonsense run 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.540
 Each is connected with 64 bit 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.759
 as a total of 256 bits and 16 gb are for 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.220
 gamer oversized theoretically would now 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.020
 even four gigabytes are enough 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.000
 with 16 gb is now for the future 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.340
 Equipped as ssd the 120 gb samsung 840 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.850
 evo it's a very fast ssd and 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 120 gb s for operating system all 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.099
 programs and one or the other game 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.869
 then as firm as the one terabyte 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:12.959
 desktop hdd resp 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.440
 barracuda 7200 points 10 it's one 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.960
 would 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.070
 the fast hdd and a terabyte are supposed to 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.530
 for most of you the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.880
 sufficient and as graphics card the three 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.530
 gigabyte gb force gt 87 ti it's the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.520
 fastest available on the market 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.740
 graphic card 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.330
 So you should all current games 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.850
 play on the highest settings 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.610
 can and assassin's creed 4 black 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.650
 flags windows heart blacklist and batman 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.440
 Arkham origins is available for free 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.140
 as a power supply the 85 watt be quite 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.290
 straight power e9 ten modules 80 plus 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.120
 gold 580 was 10 for the pc more than 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.010
 enough so you still have air up 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.200
 for later configuration 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.610
 it is modular that means you can do that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.670
 Do not take off the cable anymore 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.110
 needs and 80 plus gold is 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.690
 Energy saving then still a dvd burner 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.520
 from samsung and as housing the track 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.980
 part of the faina for midi tower 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.870
 it is a little worse elegant 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.490
 housing with any amount of space in it 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.070
 but you are allowed to do it yourself 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.600
 decide which one to take yes then 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.130
