you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> weigh<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.340> your<00:01:08.400> ingredients<00:01:09.000> but

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you can weigh all your ingredients but

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
you can weigh all your ingredients but
the<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.409> needs<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.369> most<00:01:11.580> is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
the one that needs when the most is

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.289 
the one that needs when the most is
flour<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.860> u.s.<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.520> people<00:01:14.850> use<00:01:15.000> dry

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
measuring cups for flour let's see how

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
measuring cups for flour let's see how
well<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.119> works<00:01:18.530> here<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> one<00:01:19.890> cup<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.250> flour

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
well that works here is one cup of flour

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.670 
well that works here is one cup of flour
it<00:01:21.720> weighs<00:01:22.460> 164<00:01:23.460> grams<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.439> here<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.560> another

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it weighs 164 grams and here is another

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.749 
it weighs 164 grams and here is another
cup<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.250> flour<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:29.009> weighs<00:01:30.049> 138<00:01:31.049> grams

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
cup of flour and it weighs 138 grams

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.760 
cup of flour and it weighs 138 grams
flour<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> powder<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.110> compressible

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
flour is a powder so it's compressible

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.440 
flour is a powder so it's compressible
here<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> first<00:01:36.150> cup<00:01:36.360> was<00:01:36.540> measured

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
here is how the first cup was measured

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.010 
here is how the first cup was measured
don't<00:01:39.450> laugh

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
don't laugh

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.010 
don't laugh
I<00:01:40.049> used<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> measure<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> way<00:01:41.310> at<00:01:41.430> some<00:01:41.610> point

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
I used to measure that way at some point

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.130 
I used to measure that way at some point
that's<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.229> wrong<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.860> kids<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.049> here<00:01:46.049> is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
that's the wrong way kids and here is

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.960 
that's the wrong way kids and here is
how<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.350> second<00:01:47.009> cup<00:01:47.189> was<00:01:47.399> measured

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
how the second cup was measured

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
how the second cup was measured
I<00:01:48.000> moved<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.079> flour<00:01:49.320> into<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.070> container

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
I moved the flour into the container

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.850 
I moved the flour into the container
fluffed<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.259> up<00:01:52.490> scooped<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.729> gently<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
fluffed it up scooped it gently and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.749 
fluffed it up scooped it gently and
leveled<00:01:55.860> that's<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.390> right<00:01:57.630> way<00:01:58.399> let's<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
leveled that's the right way let's do it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.310 
leveled that's the right way let's do it
again<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.479> way<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.990> how<00:02:01.110> well<00:02:01.290> that

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
again the right way to see how well that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:10.430 
again the right way to see how well that
works<00:02:06.079> 149<00:02:07.079> grams<00:02:08.060> last<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.300> got<00:02:09.509> 138

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
works 149 grams last time I got 138

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.190 
works 149 grams last time I got 138
grams<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.280> even<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.910> right<00:02:12.180> way<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.900> that

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
grams so even the right way is not that

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.699 
grams so even the right way is not that
a<00:02:13.230> cure

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a cure

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.459 
a cure
how<00:02:14.579> much<00:02:14.849> flour<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.719> get<00:02:15.930> when<00:02:16.109> measuring

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:16.469 
how much flour you get when measuring

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.720
