those<00:01:01.890> keyboards<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.339> a<00:01:02.399> macro<00:01:02.609> keys<00:01:02.969> on

which I believe is the roads program to
make<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> macro<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.360> basically<00:01:15.450> does<00:01:15.840> all

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
showing what you can do delete that

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.490 
showing what you can do delete that
first<00:02:14.080> line<00:02:14.730> second<00:02:15.730> line<00:02:15.760> basically<00:02:16.300> has<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
first line second line basically has the

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.380 
first line second line basically has the
dollar<00:02:17.710> sign<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.460> the<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:18.910> next<00:02:19.120> to<00:02:19.300> it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
dollar sign and then the one next to it

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.710 
dollar sign and then the one next to it
and<00:02:19.720> then<00:02:20.020> the<00:02:20.170> two<00:02:20.790> semicolons<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
and then the two semicolons there so

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.720 
and then the two semicolons there so
basically<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.800> one<00:02:23.920> after<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.340> dollar<00:02:24.460> sign

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
basically the one after the dollar sign

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.670 
basically the one after the dollar sign
is<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.450> hotkey<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.140> can<00:02:26.230> change<00:02:26.440> that<00:02:26.560> to

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is the hotkey you can change that to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.560 
is the hotkey you can change that to
whatever<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:27.070> want<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:28.060> change<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.480> to

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
whatever you want don't change it to

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.610 
whatever you want don't change it to
something<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.930> you're<00:02:29.200> going<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.410> use

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
something that you're going to use

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.200 
something that you're going to use
especially<00:02:30.040> like<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> G<00:02:30.700> or<00:02:30.730> something<00:02:31.120> don't

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
especially like a G or something don't

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.880 
especially like a G or something don't
attach<00:02:31.420> it<00:02:31.570> to<00:02:31.690> G<00:02:32.080> because<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.620> know<00:02:32.710> you're

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
attach it to G because you know you're

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.870 
attach it to G because you know you're
typing<00:02:33.280> good<00:02:34.180> good<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.870> GJ<00:02:35.800> as<00:02:36.430> soon<00:02:36.760> as<00:02:36.820> you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
typing good good like GJ as soon as you

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.660 
typing good good like GJ as soon as you
type<00:02:37.060> G<00:02:37.360> which<00:02:37.900> is<00:02:38.020> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> pop<00:02:38.500> out<00:02:38.670> you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
type G which is going to pop out you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.290 
type G which is going to pop out you
don't<00:02:39.820> want<00:02:39.970> that

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
don't want that

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.210 
don't want that
so<00:02:40.900> basically<00:02:41.140> loop<00:02:41.380> 20<00:02:41.740> means<00:02:41.890> it's<00:02:42.040> going<00:02:42.160> to

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
so basically loop 20 means it's going to

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.870 
so basically loop 20 means it's going to
loop<00:02:42.370> everything<00:02:42.760> inside<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.180> following

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
loop everything inside the following

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.100 
loop everything inside the following
brackets<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.300> this<00:02:46.480> one<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.720> this<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:46.870> is

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
brackets so this one of this one is

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.460 
brackets so this one of this one is
going<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.290> do<00:02:48.070> this<00:02:48.280> 20<00:02:48.790> times<00:02:49.260> now<00:02:50.260> we've<00:02:50.380> got

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
going to do this 20 times now we've got

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.340 
going to do this 20 times now we've got
sin<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:50.950> we<00:02:51.010> got<00:02:51.130> shift<00:02:51.430> down<00:02:51.820> enter<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.720> here

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
sin and we got shift down enter so here

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.320 
sin and we got shift down enter so here
a<00:02:53.380> lot<00:02:53.590> of<00:02:53.680> people<00:02:53.920> normally<00:02:54.400> put<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> plus

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
a lot of people normally put a plus

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.880 
a lot of people normally put a plus
which<00:02:55.950> in<00:02:56.950> autohotkey<00:02:57.390> represents<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.630> shift

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
which in autohotkey represents the shift

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.930 
which in autohotkey represents the shift
but<00:02:59.890> basically<00:03:00.280> what<00:03:00.400> that<00:03:00.430> I<00:03:00.520> realize<00:03:00.820> about

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
but basically what that I realize about

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.510 
but basically what that I realize about
that<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:02.440> is<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:02.980> basically

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
that is that it is just basically

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.290 
that is that it is just basically
pressing<00:03:04.120> shift<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.780> then<00:03:05.650> enter<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:07.000> I<00:03:07.030> can

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
pressing shift and then enter so I can

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.360 
pressing shift and then enter so I can
bug<00:03:07.600> out<00:03:07.959> in<00:03:08.260> game<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:09.070> then<00:03:09.220> they're

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
bug out in game and then they're

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.860 
bug out in game and then they're
basically<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.940> spamming<00:03:10.239> keys<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.720> your

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
basically just spamming keys to your

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.940 
basically just spamming keys to your
team<00:03:11.340> so<00:03:12.340> you<00:03:13.120> want<00:03:13.300> shift<00:03:13.600> down<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.739> don't

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
team so you want shift down you don't

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.740 
team so you want shift down you don't
want<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.190> let<00:03:15.310> it<00:03:15.430> go<00:03:15.640> basically<00:03:16.090> because<00:03:16.570> you

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
want to let it go basically because you

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.870 
want to let it go basically because you
can<00:03:16.930> hold<00:03:17.170> shift<00:03:17.260> enter<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.310> keep<00:03:18.640> swiping

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
can hold shift enter and keep swiping

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.620 
can hold shift enter and keep swiping
with<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.570> shift<00:03:19.840> down<00:03:20.640> um<00:03:21.700> I've<00:03:22.090> got<00:03:22.330> it<00:03:22.450> after

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
with the shift down um I've got it after

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.750 
with the shift down um I've got it after
that<00:03:22.989> to<00:03:23.080> sleep<00:03:23.260> for<00:03:23.470> 10<00:03:23.620> milliseconds<00:03:24.190> and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
that to sleep for 10 milliseconds and

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.430 
that to sleep for 10 milliseconds and
I've<00:03:24.880> got<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.180> sending<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.780> the<00:03:25.900> actual<00:03:26.200> G

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
I've got the sending of the actual G

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.170 
I've got the sending of the actual G
itself<00:03:26.769> and<00:03:27.040> I<00:03:27.070> go<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.250> sleep<00:03:27.519> for<00:03:27.760> another<00:03:27.880> 10

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
itself and I go to sleep for another 10

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.920 
itself and I go to sleep for another 10
milliseconds<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:29.380> then<00:03:30.300> anti<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.630> we've

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
milliseconds and then anti and we've

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.440 
milliseconds and then anti and we've
shift<00:03:32.200> up<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.769> know<00:03:32.860> no<00:03:33.040> so<00:03:33.970> basically<00:03:34.269> it's

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
shift up you know no so basically it's

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.229 
shift up you know no so basically it's
going<00:03:34.480> to<00:03:34.630> do<00:03:34.780> that<00:03:35.080> 20<00:03:35.680> times<00:03:35.950> and<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.550> guess

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
going to do that 20 times and I guess

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.560 
going to do that 20 times and I guess
you<00:03:37.450> could<00:03:37.630> remove<00:03:37.959> the<00:03:38.550> sleeps<00:03:39.550> that<00:03:40.180> I

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
you could remove the sleeps that I

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.660 
you could remove the sleeps that I
wouldn't<00:03:41.019> suggest<00:03:41.140> it<00:03:41.620> because<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.489> bit

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
wouldn't suggest it because it's a bit

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.020 
wouldn't suggest it because it's a bit
too<00:03:43.060> spammy<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:43.630> these<00:03:44.730> 20<00:03:45.730> you're<00:03:45.850> going<00:03:45.970> to

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
too spammy and these 20 you're going to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.930 
too spammy and these 20 you're going to
come<00:03:46.180> out<00:03:46.330> over<00:03:46.570> three<00:03:46.840> seconds<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:48.340> basically

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
come out over three seconds so basically

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.120 
come out over three seconds so basically
that's<00:03:49.510> about<00:03:49.720> it<00:03:50.110> I'm<00:03:50.320> just<00:03:50.470> going<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.769> cut

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
that's about it I'm just going to cut
