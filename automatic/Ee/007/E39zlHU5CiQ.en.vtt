power button right there with the Ouya
as<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.660> can<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.260> assembled<00:00:43.739> when<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
as you can see the assembled when you

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
as you can see the assembled when you
push<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.020> there's<00:00:46.020> four<00:00:46.260> lights<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.680> top

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
push that there's four lights at the top

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
push that there's four lights at the top
that<00:00:47.070> indicate<00:00:47.460> which<00:00:47.670> player<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.180> are<00:00:48.210> this

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
