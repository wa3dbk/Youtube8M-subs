00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.089

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.520
 The rain will teach you, will I do it? 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.590
 I asked you a blog if you 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.720
 would like to go step by step through the video 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.240
 You said yes, so here I am. 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.670
 I here I am going to do today is pink color 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.950
 and you can count on several 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.750
 colors on the internet even have several 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.630
 ideas and yes of various colors that you 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.940
 can combine and that's it - hopefully 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.070
 You guys like to try. It 's super easy. 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.500
 do but practice and practice 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.449
 have to train and material notes 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.760
 not always helpful I 'll go 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.600
 show along the video so let's 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.420
 start then let's go girls nails 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.390
 I passed two layers of pink enamel 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.970
 amazing colorama I used those days 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.650
 on the blog, but I liked it so much in this color 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.440
 that I'm using again you can 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:29.030
 choose anything here on the finger 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.009
 I passed a white the white of the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.020
 Impala, you can use any 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.590
 white enamel you have on your 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.380
 house to do decoration on the finger 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.830
 I will use a brush with 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 the bristles are fine, but he is 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.500
 number zero contains stationery 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.020
 There's no brand here, but I just got here. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 asked for a number 10 brush is great for 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.300
 make nail decorations and I too 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 I'll use this brush that has the tip 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.070
 of kamaz balls you can use also 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 if you did not have a little tooth 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.810
 which is the same 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.810
 and to make the decoration I'll use the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.360
 night enamel of the hits you can use 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.430
 any black enamel is only using 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.560
 right here because it's the only one I have 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.750
 to go to buy another because I know 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.380
 It is right at the end but I thing here 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.070
 same 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.610
 so let's start I'll apply here 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.730
 It is a little plastic container 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:33.170
 I'll get the black enamel here to compensate 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:36.549
 the number zero and I'll start making pm 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.549
 circus like 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.220
 so there is a semicircle one 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.220
 half Moon 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:58.870
 you do not have to be very upright thai 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:03:01.450
 you do not have to do the whole thing. 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.379
 same side and you start to get 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.379
 reverse 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.209
 You see this practice sometimes. 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.900
 They leave the wrong ones too but they do not have 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.900
 problem 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.170
 in the beginning you will find that there're 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:52.459
 It's cool, but later on. 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:56.690
 to finish is going to be pretty cool and that's how it is 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:04:00.849
 I always do all the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.849
 my nails of a yes I do so 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.049
 ready Ã³ all with the half moon without being 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:12.440
 obscene in circuses and you're not 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:18.739
 while it will already be with the 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:21.190
 semicircles, people, I'm not much anymore 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.190
 difficult 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:47.870
 I'm going to put a little more enamel 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:51.830
 black and ea and now with the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.950
 ball or a little bit I'll get the 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.400
 black tatÃ¡ and I'm putting around 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:02.600
 so in empty places it's great and 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:08.750
 here is not inside the semicircle is going 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:11.770
 making balls in places that is a 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.770
 little empty 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.730
 It's okay, now, the next step is 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.460
 use the color of your choice I'll use 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:31.460
 This glaze that I passed here will 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:33.790
 put a little bit here and with the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.400
 same ball pin brush or 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.120
 I'll get the rose and I'll go 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:45.340
 fill in here to make some balls 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.340
 within the semi circle 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.800
 I'm going to pass now. 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:17.320
 a little sparkle 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:21.430
 This part is optional, it's just to give a 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:28.840
 little glitter and sidec this enamel 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:31.960
