00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
and iPod nanos I don't know if the Nano

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.109 
and iPod nanos I don't know if the Nano
supports<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.560> full<00:00:23.710> Apple<00:00:24.220> protocol<00:00:24.790> I<00:00:24.970> know

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
supports the full Apple protocol I know

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.499 
supports the full Apple protocol I know
the<00:00:25.480> iPod<00:00:25.989> Touches<00:00:26.619> do<00:00:26.860> let<00:00:27.790> me<00:00:27.820> clarify<00:00:28.119> that

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:28.509 
the iPod Touches do let me clarify that

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:31.380 
the iPod Touches do let me clarify that
as<00:00:28.630> an<00:00:28.750> apple<00:00:29.200> specific<00:00:29.950> protocol<00:00:30.730> some

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
as an apple specific protocol some

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.240 
as an apple specific protocol some
people<00:00:31.660> say<00:00:31.840> well<00:00:32.079> why<00:00:32.259> doesn't<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.920> spider

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
people say well why doesn't the spider

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.100 
people say well why doesn't the spider
support<00:00:33.760> Android<00:00:34.239> it's<00:00:34.480> because<00:00:34.690> Android

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
support Android it's because Android

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.700 
support Android it's because Android
doesn't<00:00:35.440> have<00:00:35.800> the<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:37.000> protocol<00:00:37.540> over<00:00:38.170> USB

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.460 
doesn't have the the protocol over USB
to<00:00:39.040> do<00:00:39.280> this<00:00:39.520> kind<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:39.940> stuff<00:00:40.210> that<00:00:40.870> Apple<00:00:41.260> does

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
to do this kind of stuff that Apple does

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.740 
to do this kind of stuff that Apple does
it's<00:00:41.680> proprietary<00:00:42.340> to<00:00:42.490> Apple<00:00:42.910> and<00:00:43.090> it<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:43.600> so

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
it's proprietary to Apple and it just so

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.320 
it's proprietary to Apple and it just so
happens<00:00:44.200> that<00:00:44.350> the<00:00:44.740> radio<00:00:45.250> sound<00:00:45.730> who<00:00:46.090> makes

happens that the radio sound who makes
the<00:00:46.540> radio<00:00:46.870> for<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.170> spider<00:00:47.640> implemented<00:00:48.640> the

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
the radio for the spider implemented the

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.740 
the radio for the spider implemented the
full<00:00:48.940> Apple<00:00:49.380> control<00:00:50.380> protocol<00:00:50.950> okay<00:00:51.540> again<00:00:52.540> I

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
full Apple control protocol okay again I

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.390 
full Apple control protocol okay again I
don't<00:00:52.840> know<00:00:53.110> if<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.350> nanos<00:00:53.680> support<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.220> full

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
don't know if the nanos support the full

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.340 
don't know if the nanos support the full
protocol<00:00:54.940> if<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.240> don't<00:00:55.540> get<00:00:55.720> these<00:00:55.930> screens

protocol if you don't get these screens

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.510 
protocol if you don't get these screens
maybe<00:00:56.890> it<00:00:57.070> doesn't

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
maybe it doesn't

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.590 
maybe it doesn't
I<00:00:57.579> don't<00:00:57.820> know<00:00:57.940> that<00:00:58.090> there'd<00:00:58.239> be<00:00:58.329> a<00:00:58.360> problem
