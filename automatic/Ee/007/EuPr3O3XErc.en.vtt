00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.580
 The next item is worth lifting a ki 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.359
 processing side slices 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.130
 they have sour cream with the amendment I strings 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.090
 did not pull out and those that were 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.779
 originally because now we 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.359
 We download the exact and the line exactly on our 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.899
 threads that spravochki go or on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.640
 literally 0 1 millimeter next stop 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.280
 it was easy for us to take a thread with 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.280
 brooms after that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.660
 before the beginning and at the end of the line 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:50.329
 tack after 100 tea 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.640
 remove the blending threads measure off 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.520
 beautiful half a centimeter allowances 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.190
 we cut off the excess and sweep over that is 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.920
 we process any seam protecting 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.339
 from shedding in the rastuyuzhku in the rastuyuzhku then 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.890
 there is each layer of fabric we process 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.260
 separately because we have this one 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.100
 Of course it's thick enough 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.960
 wool mixture 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.000
 if we only had cloth could 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.040
 afford to handle for utyazhku 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.509
 front panel since we 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 half-wool we process smoothly 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.970
 that is, seam allowances will be 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.770
 laid out on 2 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.040
 processed and razdzhu dinner and two 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.040
 parties 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.450
 remove after this as our downloaded 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.350
 the threads with the dead are completely us 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.350
 no longer needed 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.860
 now now from seam grinding we measure 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.340
 one and a half centimeters 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:21.670
 and divide by must be neat I'm good 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.080
 Stitched is very important when you feel 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 on itself a product 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:33.940
 a neatly made thing neatly cool 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.690
 that's when you understand that everything is good in it 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.489
 all lines are even everything is accurately measured 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.000
 everything is beautifully crafted 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:48.340
 complete nonsense here we measured out now 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:58.390
 take extra and we have exactly 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:59.440
 One and a half centimeters we grind off 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 I will gather someone 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.630
 then you can boil and and a magnet because if 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.970
 eat him he cuts off if you 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.940
 using machine line which 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.890
 just protects from shedding then 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:16.209
 accordingly, you first need to cut 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:25.750
 too much and then process the line 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:28.380
 slice which is no shortage now our 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.000
 ready to slice 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.540
 because you will process them on someone 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.709
 line go to important abra 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:43.299
 wet-heat treatment of side seams 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:44.799
 we started cutting them off everywhere 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.280
 we have the same stock and a half 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.470
 centimeter swept away or processed 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.500
 stitch guarding japan's tass 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:57.609
 ironing and dressing our 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:03.579
 iron iron on the board 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:06.269
 completely hooked and starting to iron with 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:10.750
 seamy side is our task to achieve 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:15.040
 full fit of the allowances with a cloth 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:18.970
 that is, we iron until we build up 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.600
 until ours are fully started up 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.210
 prill to the cloth and when we clean the iron 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:31.870
 they will have to run completely with us 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:38.250
 on the fabric here and so moving the shevchik 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:42.070
 gradually the path is already the entire side seam 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:47.020
 help fingers straighten iron 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.890
 help on the biggest bulge where 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:55.230
 we have a hip 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:55.230
 so moving on helps further 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:16.770
 so iron both side seams and after 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:19.470
 flat irons we get the side seams in 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:24.540
 razutyuzhku very well in the beautifully 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:27.920
 dozens of this way side seams y 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:35.640
 we are now also processed skirt we 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:37.800
 after the first two points processing 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:43.310
 tuck side seam processing 1 2 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.310
 point we passed they have been completed
