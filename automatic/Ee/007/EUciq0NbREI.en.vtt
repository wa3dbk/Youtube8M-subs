00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
 fuck 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.710
 in Mexico 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.540
 in the poor 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.210
 My name is concha caballero garcÃ­a soy de 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.210
 That is the best sign of identity 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.220
 Olives are picked from the olive tree by hand and 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.820
 they are thrown into this sect called the 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.170
 macaque put two fingers 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.570
 approximately and salt 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.780
 so that while the osmosis process 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.450
 is losing moisture so do not 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.620
 cover totally 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.610
 another layer is cast 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:52.059
 and so on and already the last layer 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.890
 It is completely covered with salt naturally 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.769
 is releasing everything that is the alpechin 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.790
 is losing water the month and a half 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:04.930
 we throw it here to remove the salt 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.940
 shake and now they are going to the bucket 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.500
 to wash it because it always remains 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.990
 some rest of salt 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.600
 we throw the washed olives 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.939
 we extend 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.369
 and we put them in the sun for a day 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 approximately they are consumed only in 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.619

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.770
