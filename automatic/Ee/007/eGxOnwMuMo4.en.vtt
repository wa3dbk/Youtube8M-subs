00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.090
 hello friends and today we are going to do one thing 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 today we are going to talk about how to improve 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.070
 your plectrum technique down 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.199
 first I think we're going to compare the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.649
 sound of the classical technique could already 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:45.180
 against barb and this technique called 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.180
 down picking let's see 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 obviously the second option sounds 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.699
 more powerful and for this good style is 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.409
 obviously the typical error is better 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.149
 of the people who start learning is 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.049
 technique is to place the right hand 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.820
 too low as you see the hand so 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.950
 It will be as good as if it were 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.619
 blocked a bit and does not move with 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.940
 ease in that direction so let's go 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.909
 to place the right hand a little more 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.360
 above 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.520
 and as you see 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.250
 both the technique of could against barb as 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.680
 the technique of barb down is going to 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.290
 leave more easily and something else 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 important is the angle of the barb we're going 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.880
 Let's see when we play like that 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.060
 the angle is quite balanced but 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.980
 if we want to play with the technique of could 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.260
 down 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.960
 we'd better tilt the 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:47.450
 pike well a little higher up let's see 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.280
 as you see now touching up not you 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.610
 it will cost a new one is practically 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.060
 impossible to do well but you will touch 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.070
 down we get a lot better good 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.360
 they are basic tips but I hope that you 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.360
 Serve good until later
