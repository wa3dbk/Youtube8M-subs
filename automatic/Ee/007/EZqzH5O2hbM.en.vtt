00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.880 

they're<00:00:56.550> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.620> kind<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> like

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
they're kind of like the kind of like

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
they're kind of like the kind of like
what<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.699> called<00:00:59.910> megaphones<00:01:00.620> except

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
