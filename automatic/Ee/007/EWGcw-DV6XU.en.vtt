50% and in the meantime I'm gonna

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.320 
50% and in the meantime I'm gonna
Serg<00:06:36.710> that<00:06:37.100> curse<00:06:37.340> of<00:06:37.490> doom<00:06:37.640> might<00:06:37.910> not<00:06:38.090> even

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
Serg that curse of doom might not even

Serg that curse of doom might not even
have<00:06:38.480> the<00:06:38.630> chance<00:06:38.900> to<00:06:39.140> go<00:06:39.260> off<00:06:39.440> in<00:06:40.250> this<00:06:40.490> case

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
have the chance to go off in this case

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.100 
have the chance to go off in this case
it<00:06:40.910> will<00:06:41.120> because<00:06:41.600> my<00:06:42.170> mana<00:06:42.710> surge<00:06:43.010> only<00:06:43.910> did

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
it will because my mana surge only did

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.440 
it will because my mana surge only did
863<00:06:45.110> damage<00:06:45.580> but<00:06:46.580> that's<00:06:46.760> it<00:06:46.970> it's<00:06:47.210> game<00:06:47.420> over

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
863 damage but that's it it's game over

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.710 
863 damage but that's it it's game over
so<00:06:48.050> that<00:06:48.290> that<00:06:48.740> curse<00:06:49.070> of<00:06:49.220> doom<00:06:49.400> killed<00:06:49.760> him<00:06:49.970> he

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 
so that that curse of doom killed him he

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.480 
so that that curse of doom killed him he
reincarnates<00:06:51.560> which<00:06:51.860> doesn't<00:06:52.310> matter

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
reincarnates which doesn't matter

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.760 
reincarnates which doesn't matter
because<00:06:52.820> my<00:06:53.060> ethereal<00:06:53.780> soul<00:06:53.990> trader<00:06:54.320> is<00:06:54.530> still
