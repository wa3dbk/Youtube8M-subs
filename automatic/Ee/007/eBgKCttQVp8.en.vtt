00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
design that will use bamboo it's got a

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.830

really<00:03:30.130> high<00:03:30.370> tensile<00:03:30.670> strength<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.420> a

really high tensile strength and a

really high tensile strength and a
low-slung<00:03:32.560> deck<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:33.489> that<00:03:33.519> makes<00:03:33.940> it<00:03:34.150> much

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
low-slung deck and that makes it much

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.780

out<00:03:36.880> there<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:39.640> board<00:03:40.000> will<00:03:40.330> be<00:03:40.540> lighter<00:03:40.870> and

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
out there the board will be lighter and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.220 
out there the board will be lighter and
hopefully<00:03:42.370> strong<00:03:42.849> enough<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.540> withstand<00:03:43.690> the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
hopefully strong enough to withstand the

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.039 
hopefully strong enough to withstand the
punishment<00:03:44.890> of<00:03:45.010> a<00:03:45.130> downhill<00:03:45.459> run<00:03:46.000> but<00:03:46.720> until

they<00:03:47.200> can<00:03:47.380> get<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:47.680> out<00:03:47.860> of<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.190> hill<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.700> up

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
they can get it out of the hill and up

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.780 
they can get it out of the hill and up
to<00:03:49.390> speed<00:03:49.750> no<00:03:50.590> one<00:03:50.799> will<00:03:50.980> be<00:03:51.130> betting<00:03:51.519> on<00:03:51.670> the
