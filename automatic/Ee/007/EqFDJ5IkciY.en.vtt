January up to this year's high right
here<00:01:24.840> okay<00:01:25.440> and<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.000> market<00:01:27.210> has<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.990> fact

here okay and so the market has in fact

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.430

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
taken out that high right yesterday's

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.850 
taken out that high right yesterday's
high<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.830> crude<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.370> 98<00:01:33.030> 60<00:01:33.720> so<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> trade<00:01:34.740> up

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
high and crude was 98 60 so a trade up

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.210 
high and crude was 98 60 so a trade up
to<00:01:34.980> roughly<00:01:35.400> 98<00:01:36.030> 70<00:01:36.570> would<00:01:36.750> warrant<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.290> trade

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to roughly 98 70 would warrant a trade

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.010
