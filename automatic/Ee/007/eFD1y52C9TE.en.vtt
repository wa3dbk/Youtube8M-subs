00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
next but I just kind of wanted to let

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.359 
next but I just kind of wanted to let
you<00:01:19.650> know<00:01:19.860> how<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> started<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.390> with<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.990> UM

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
you know how I started out with the UM

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.160 
you know how I started out with the UM
do-it-yourself<00:01:23.369> palace<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.000> when<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> run<00:01:25.020> out

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
do-it-yourself palace and when I run out

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.859 
do-it-yourself palace and when I run out
of<00:01:25.229> space<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.460> did<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> same<00:01:27.630> thing

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of space down here I did the same thing

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.499 
of space down here I did the same thing
up<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.200> top<00:01:28.439> so<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.220> would<00:01:29.579> store<00:01:29.880> my<00:01:30.030> eyeshadows

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
up on top so I would store my eyeshadows

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
up on top so I would store my eyeshadows
like<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.070> problem<00:01:32.280> with<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
like this and the problem with this is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
like this and the problem with this is
that<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.960> couldn't<00:01:34.229> close<00:01:34.500> all<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> way

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
that it couldn't close all the way

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.370 
that it couldn't close all the way
because<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.579> very<00:01:35.700> thin<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because it's very thin and the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.380 
because it's very thin and the
eyeshadows<00:01:37.890> were<00:01:38.040> basically<00:01:38.400> resting<00:01:38.970> on<00:01:39.150> top

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
eyeshadows were basically resting on top

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
eyeshadows were basically resting on top
of<00:01:39.570> each<00:01:39.659> other<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.049> eyeshadows<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> top<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
of each other the eyeshadows on top and

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.039 
of each other the eyeshadows on top and
the<00:01:41.100> eyeshadows<00:01:41.520> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> bottom<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.299> they

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
the eyeshadows on the bottom and they

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.289 
the eyeshadows on the bottom and they
would<00:01:43.200> leave<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.590> marks<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.850> know<00:01:44.970> just

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
would leave little marks you know just

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.850

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.880 
I don't have that problem of them you
know<00:03:26.090> leaving<00:03:26.660> little<00:03:26.840> dings<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.620> each<00:03:27.709> other

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
know leaving little dings and each other

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.460 
know leaving little dings and each other
you<00:03:28.040> can<00:03:28.160> see<00:03:28.310> all<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.610> little<00:03:29.200> marks<00:03:30.200> and

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
you can see all the little marks and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.259 
you can see all the little marks and
better<00:03:30.860> there<00:03:31.160> maybe<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.579> can't<00:03:31.850> see<00:03:31.940> but

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
better there maybe you can't see but

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:33.640 
better there maybe you can't see but
that's<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.630> know<00:03:32.750> from<00:03:32.870> them<00:03:33.079> being<00:03:33.290> stored

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
that's you know from them being stored

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.310 
that's you know from them being stored
in<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:33.950> other<00:03:34.100> pallet<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.690> also<00:03:35.900> find

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
in that other pallet and I also find

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.280 
in that other pallet and I also find
that<00:03:36.739> the<00:03:36.950> eye<00:03:36.980> shadows<00:03:37.459> like<00:03:37.959> see<00:03:38.959> how<00:03:39.140> they

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
that the eye shadows like see how they

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.039 
that the eye shadows like see how they
stick<00:03:39.590> quite<00:03:39.890> well<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:40.579> in<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.900> other

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
stick quite well to this in the other

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.650 
stick quite well to this in the other
container<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.670> little<00:03:43.820> metal

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
container because that little metal

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.930 
container because that little metal
sheet<00:03:45.140> is<00:03:45.410> I<00:03:45.620> guess<00:03:45.769> it's<00:03:45.950> relatively<00:03:46.519> thin

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
sheet is I guess it's relatively thin

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.750 
sheet is I guess it's relatively thin
they<00:03:47.870> they<00:03:48.260> stick<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:48.950> but<00:03:49.100> if<00:03:49.190> I<00:03:49.310> move<00:03:49.579> the

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
they they stick to it but if I move the

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.729 
they they stick to it but if I move the
lid<00:03:49.970> a<00:03:50.000> little<00:03:50.269> bit<00:03:50.359> too<00:03:50.540> much<00:03:50.720> they<00:03:51.320> will<00:03:51.500> fall

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
lid a little bit too much they will fall

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.819 
lid a little bit too much they will fall
off<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.359> on<00:03:53.359> this<00:03:53.600> one<00:03:53.870> because<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.500> guess<00:03:54.650> it's

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
off and on this one because I guess it's

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.710 
off and on this one because I guess it's
a<00:03:54.920> thicker<00:03:55.220> piece<00:03:55.579> of<00:03:55.730> metal<00:03:56.030> they<00:03:56.209> stick<00:03:56.510> much

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
a thicker piece of metal they stick much

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.050 
a thicker piece of metal they stick much
nicer<00:03:57.290> so<00:03:57.620> this<00:03:57.920> is<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.100> little<00:03:58.400> bit<00:03:58.519> better<00:03:58.670> too

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
nicer so this is a little bit better too

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.880 
nicer so this is a little bit better too
you<00:03:59.420> don't<00:03:59.540> have<00:03:59.630> to<00:03:59.750> worry<00:03:59.989> as<00:04:00.440> much<00:04:00.500> about

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
you don't have to worry as much about

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.910 
you don't have to worry as much about
them<00:04:01.100> kind<00:04:01.280> of<00:04:01.400> falling<00:04:01.880> out<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.709> this<00:04:03.709> is

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
them kind of falling out and this is

so<00:06:48.110> just<00:06:48.500> so<00:06:48.620> you<00:06:48.680> know<00:06:48.800> that's<00:06:49.280> roughly<00:06:49.700> the

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:49.910 
so just so you know that's roughly the

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.180 
so just so you know that's roughly the
price<00:06:50.090> of<00:06:50.510> something<00:06:51.050> as<00:06:51.200> large<00:06:51.380> as<00:06:51.590> mine<00:06:51.800> all

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
price of something as large as mine all

the<00:06:52.250> smaller<00:06:52.850> ones<00:06:53.180> are<00:06:53.390> obviously<00:06:53.540> cheaper

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
the smaller ones are obviously cheaper

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.030 
the smaller ones are obviously cheaper
another<00:06:55.250> thing<00:06:55.520> that's<00:06:55.640> important<00:06:56.270> is<00:06:56.600> that

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040 
another thing that's important is that

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.770 
another thing that's important is that
the<00:06:58.040> magnet<00:06:58.550> will<00:06:58.730> stick<00:06:59.030> to<00:06:59.090> them<00:06:59.360> I'm<00:06:59.510> pretty

00:06:59.770 --> 00:06:59.780

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.690 
the magnet will stick to them I'm pretty
sure<00:06:59.960> most<00:07:00.200> of<00:07:00.470> them<00:07:00.620> are<00:07:00.770> made<00:07:00.920> from<00:07:00.980> tin<00:07:01.430> and

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
sure most of them are made from tin and

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.040 
sure most of them are made from tin and
they're<00:07:01.790> even<00:07:02.030> called<00:07:02.270> like<00:07:02.570> little<00:07:02.870> tin

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
they're even called like little tin

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.530 
they're even called like little tin
containers<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:04.190> Magnus<00:07:04.640> will<00:07:05.000> stick<00:07:05.330> to

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:05.540 
containers and so Magnus will stick to

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.840 
containers and so Magnus will stick to
tin<00:07:05.810> but<00:07:06.560> if<00:07:06.800> it's<00:07:06.980> something<00:07:07.160> like<00:07:07.310> aluminum

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:07.850 
tin but if it's something like aluminum

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.240 
tin but if it's something like aluminum
which<00:07:08.780> I<00:07:08.960> haven't<00:07:09.230> come<00:07:09.380> across<00:07:09.500> aluminum

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.250 
which I haven't come across aluminum

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:12.070 
which I haven't come across aluminum
containers<00:07:10.730> but<00:07:10.940> I'm<00:07:11.030> assuming<00:07:11.330> they<00:07:11.660> exist

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
containers but I'm assuming they exist

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.920 
containers but I'm assuming they exist
on<00:07:12.400> you<00:07:13.400> know<00:07:13.520> magnets<00:07:14.030> will<00:07:14.240> not<00:07:14.420> stick<00:07:14.780> to

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
on you know magnets will not stick to

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.110 
on you know magnets will not stick to
