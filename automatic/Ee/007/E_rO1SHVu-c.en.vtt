00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.333
The Metzeler factory
has a very long tradition in

00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:19.398
building tyres, and especially
motorcycle tyres,

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:23.564
for the first motorcycle tyre
was built in 1892.

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:27.586
We have here a capacity
for building around

00:00:27.596 --> 00:00:30.551
2 million motorcycle tyres per year.

00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:35.015
And we are a team of more
than 300 hundred people here,

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.313
located in this factory.

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:51.859
The development of the Racetec™ RR

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.703
is coming out of the long history
of developing road racing tyres.

00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:01.447
Latest we can use also new technologies,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.282
like our spiral trait application,

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:09.130
which is giving us maximum opportunities

00:01:09.304 --> 00:01:14.259
to position the material
as estimated for the productor formats.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.068
Racetec™ RR needs to perform
on all different conditions,

00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:20.858
like in the Tourist Trophy

00:01:21.002 --> 00:01:23.393
you will find everything:

00:01:23.693 --> 00:01:28.139
smooth roads, rough roads, whatever
you can imagine we'll find here.

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.619
So you need a tyre which can adapt
to all these different conditions.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.797
The important for the rider is

00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:45.911
that he feels comfortable using the tyre

00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:49.526
and that he finds easily
the correct setup with the tyre,

00:01:49.536 --> 00:01:52.630
also in different... road conditions.
