V I think I already have it um marked as
that<00:03:59.150> specific<00:04:01.220> code<00:04:02.220> I<00:04:02.519> think<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.660> and<00:04:04.079> if<00:04:04.410> you

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
that specific code I think so and if you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.400 
that specific code I think so and if you
want<00:04:04.769> your<00:04:05.010> assault<00:04:05.579> rifle<00:04:05.959> bullet<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.109> become

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.020 
we go
and<00:04:19.160> well<00:04:20.160> I<00:04:21.080> don't<00:04:22.080> think<00:04:22.230> the<00:04:22.560> I<00:04:23.160> don't<00:04:23.880> think

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
and well I don't think the I don't think

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.940 
and well I don't think the I don't think
the<00:04:24.120> Warthog<00:04:24.570> bullets<00:04:24.990> strong<00:04:25.320> enough<00:04:25.590> so<00:04:25.890> I'm
