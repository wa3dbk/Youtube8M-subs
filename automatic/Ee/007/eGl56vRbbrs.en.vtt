00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello today I'm going to do a tutorial of this 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.610
 that you see here of letters in spheres with 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.040
 which can create a text and good 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 first of all advise since I have the 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.550
 latest version of game that is 2.8 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.369
 Y 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.660
 that brings many improvements and news and does not 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.789
 I know if the filter that we are going to use 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.410
 it's in the old version so os 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.410
 notice that there are filters 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.540
 ma to map objects if you do not have it 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 Well, I advise you to download the 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.300
 latest version that really are very 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.750
 well I still have not had time to 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.250
 investigate thoroughly new developments 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.000
 but as soon as 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.310
 I will see it then I will be putting 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.090
 tutorials so that you too what 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:01.380
 you see and well without let's start 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.380
 with this video tutorial 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:09.240
 let's create a new layer in file 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 new and the size it puts of 640 x 400 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.130
 and we accept it in the window of 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.710
 layers instead of creating a new layer 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 let's create a group of layers so 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.210
 We give to the folder instead of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.150
 full and when we have it in this 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.229
 selecting what we created a new layer 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.780
 about 200 x 200 approximately you can 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.440
 make it bigger already like you 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.750
 you want the spheres and we accept 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.540
 we select this and we go to the boat 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.290
 of paint and we choose a color that 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.290
 we want 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.700
 we take the text tool 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.980
 and we wrote our letter one of the 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.040
 what's new 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.230
 the latest version of bing as you see is 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.420
 the one to write 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.480
 at the beginning it will be difficult but 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.790
 then you get used to it and it's better 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.080
 so we are enlarging our letter and the 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.080
 we place in the center 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.459
 let's take the tool 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:34.590
 resize or downloaded and we're going to 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.590
 decrease the width without breaking the channel 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.180
 and we put it back in the center with 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.180
 the tool 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:50.050
 we go to the layers dialog and we 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:52.610
 we give with the right button peron 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.020
 combine well below 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.020
 in layer Letter 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.910
 once we have it we go to map filters 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.920
 map object 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.410
 and there 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.890
 we give you to map wait and fund 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.410
 transparent in options in light copies 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:21.360
 of these values 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.360
 the material the same 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.200
 and in orientation those of position if 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.930
 you can put the same ones and in rotation is 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.810
 according to what you want 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:38.069
 and putting each ball I recommend that 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.590
 go being the preview so that's how 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.480
 my program that does not look automatically 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.940
 but there is that is great and we are going to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.540
 to affect 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.570
 As he says, we are already waiting for 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.940
 to give it more realism we are going to create a 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:58.060
 shadow so for that 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 We give the new coat the same size 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.200
 200 x 200 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.379
 and we give you to accept 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.740
 let's take the tool 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:17.690
 elliptical selection 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.690
 and we are going to make a 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.110
 well 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.360
 what would be the shadow 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.689
 we put it on the site that we 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.689
 we create 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:36.350
 and with the gradient we are going to use a 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.180
 black or a dark gray 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.180
 and in front of transparent 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.400
 we drag and make a line and already 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.580
 when we have it, it is already for 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.870
 do not stay over in the case 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.810
 that your layer has been 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.810
 above the sphere we're going 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.710
 to go in the alpha sphere layer 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.710
 selection 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.249
 and inside the shadow layer 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:13.549
 we erase 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:13.549
 we give it to suppress and it's already bad 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.280
 let's continue creating new letters 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.280
 and for that 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.260
 let's give it 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.260
 to duplicate group 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.969
 with the right mouse button 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.969
 to duplicate layer forgiveness 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.520
 good we have it we give with moving the 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.490
 active layer so that we all move 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.840
 the layers within the group 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.110
 we move the wait to where we are 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.110
 we want 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.360
 we open our group and where is the 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.790
 wait 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:08.560
 well that layer 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.320
 that would come out would be layer 3 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.430
 let's color the color of our 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.230
 next letter 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.820
 you have to mark the selection of 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.850
 fill the selection completely 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.980
 and even if you do not want to see the shadow 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.940
 you can hide it 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.940
 with the eye 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.310
 but you can leave it normal too and 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.400
 let's write 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.380
 our next letter that in my case 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.140
 It is an i 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.850
 if I 'm not going to do it but if it's 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:48.270
 another letter we follow the same step as 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:52.210
 We also have to change the 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:55.800
 width to make it finite 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.800
 we place it at the center 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:01.139
 and click on the right mouse button combined 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:08.479
 down 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:08.479
 and we return to map filters map object 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:14.300
 the values will have already remained but the 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:17.450
 orientation if you can change what 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.320
 When we have it, we will accept it and 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.570
 ready 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.610
 we see our shadow again and 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:26.400
 we have the two letters 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.250
 so until you get all the text that 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.620
 we want the procedure is the 

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:35.260
 same as he tells me is to repeat over and over 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:37.360
 same time or the same steps 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.050
 and this is all then you give to save 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.889
 like a normal picture 

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:48.000
 and we'll see you in the next video 

00:07:44.889 --> 00:07:48.000
 goodbye tutorial
