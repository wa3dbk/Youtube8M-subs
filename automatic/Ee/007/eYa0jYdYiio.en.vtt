00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
in this video I'll be showing you how to

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.309 
in this video I'll be showing you how to
draw<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> difference<00:00:03.480> between<00:00:03.899> men<00:00:04.290> and

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
draw the difference between men and

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.299 
draw the difference between men and
women's<00:00:04.799> faces<00:00:05.420> so<00:00:06.420> start<00:00:06.779> out<00:00:06.899> here<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.560> where

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
women's faces so start out here is where

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.120 
women's faces so start out here is where
our<00:00:08.370> man's<00:00:08.700> face<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.179> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.510> be<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.130> I've

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
our man's face is going to be and I've

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.339 
our man's face is going to be and I've
already<00:00:11.340> got<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.550> circle<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.940> line<00:00:12.259> but<00:00:13.259> I

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
already got the circle on the line but I

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.180 
already got the circle on the line but I
want<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.309> jaw<00:00:14.549> line<00:00:14.820> when<00:00:15.030> you

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
want to show you the jaw line when you

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.760 
want to show you the jaw line when you
come<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.400> kind<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.789> bring<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.960> jaw<00:00:19.260> for<00:00:19.740> a

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
come to kind of bring in the jaw for a

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.400 
come to kind of bring in the jaw for a
guy<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.090> make<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.539> angular<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
guy you want to make it more angular and

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.900 
guy you want to make it more angular and
kind<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:24.619> squarish<00:00:27.769> like<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.550> obviously

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
kind of squarish like that and obviously

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
kind of squarish like that and obviously
this<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.330> rough<00:00:30.510> sketch<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.560> it's<00:00:31.710> really

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
this is the rough sketch so it's really

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.299 
this is the rough sketch so it's really
really<00:00:32.160> rough<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> then<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.350> put<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
really rough and then you can put in the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.810 
really rough and then you can put in the
mid<00:00:35.489> line<00:00:35.670> for<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.180> eye<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> nose<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.640> may

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
mid line for the eye the nose you may

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.600 
mid line for the eye the nose you may
want<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> make<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.649> slightly<00:00:40.649> longer<00:00:41.040> more<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
want to make a slightly longer more of a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.760 
want to make a slightly longer more of a
half<00:00:41.879> way<00:00:42.180> rather<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> third<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.649> way

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
half way rather than a third of the way

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.910 
half way rather than a third of the way
down<00:00:44.539> but<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> obviously<00:00:45.870> really<00:00:46.559> depends

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
down but that obviously really depends

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.830 
down but that obviously really depends
on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.399> kind<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.610> guy<00:00:48.059> you're<00:00:48.180> drawing<00:00:48.450> does

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
on the kind of guy you're drawing does

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.069 
on the kind of guy you're drawing does
it<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> roll<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.610> then<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.120> mouth<00:00:51.329> goes<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it in a roll and then the mouth goes and

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.010 
it in a roll and then the mouth goes and
the<00:00:52.140> other<00:00:52.170> halfway<00:00:52.620> point<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.020> woman's

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the other halfway point on a woman's

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.310 
the other halfway point on a woman's
face<00:00:55.230> however<00:00:56.270> the<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.840> draw<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> jaw

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
face however the when you draw the jaw

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.959 
face however the when you draw the jaw
line<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.520> make<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.879> more<00:01:00.090> oval<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
line you want to make it more oval and

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.130 
line you want to make it more oval and
softer<00:01:02.969> curves<00:01:05.210> granted<00:01:06.210> these<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.659> very

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
softer curves granted these are very

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.130 
softer curves granted these are very
much<00:01:07.380> just<00:01:07.680> generalizations<00:01:08.900> but<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.020> you're

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
much just generalizations but if you're

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.359 
much just generalizations but if you're
drawing<00:01:10.320> characters<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> make

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
drawing characters and you want to make

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.340 
drawing characters and you want to make
the<00:01:11.490> distinction<00:01:11.850> obvious<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.200> guy

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the distinction obvious that it's a guy

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.960 
the distinction obvious that it's a guy
or<00:01:13.500> girl<00:01:13.619> which<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.549> hard<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.760> tell

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
or girl which can be hard to tell

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
or girl which can be hard to tell
sometimes<00:01:15.270> especially<00:01:16.200> when<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:16.830> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
sometimes especially when it's just a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
sometimes especially when it's just a
face<00:01:17.130> these<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.060> just<00:01:18.330> some<00:01:18.479> tips<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.869> will

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
face these are just some tips that will

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.030 
face these are just some tips that will
kind<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.290> help<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:20.600> then<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.530> put<00:01:22.890> in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
kind of help and then you just put in

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.560 
kind of help and then you just put in
the<00:01:23.549> marks<00:01:24.360> make<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> slightly<00:01:25.590> shorter<00:01:25.710> nose

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
the marks make a slightly shorter nose

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.319 
the marks make a slightly shorter nose
but<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.720> doesn't<00:01:28.110> really<00:01:28.259> matter<00:01:28.439> as<00:01:28.680> much

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:38.270 

now<00:01:33.329> if<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.810> zoom<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.950> guy<00:01:37.220> I'm<00:01:38.220> just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
now if we zoom in on the guy I'm just

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.980 
now if we zoom in on the guy I'm just
going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.640> do<00:01:38.729> one<00:01:38.939> half<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> face<00:01:39.570> because

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
going to do one half of the face because

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.050 
going to do one half of the face because
of<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.860> potay<00:01:41.220> too<00:01:41.280> long<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.759> both<00:01:42.079> but<00:01:44.060> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
of the potay too long to do both but the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.710 
of the potay too long to do both but the
eye<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:47.060> just<00:01:48.060> generally<00:01:48.630> speaking<00:01:48.659> usually

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
eye is just generally speaking usually

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.969 
eye is just generally speaking usually
thinner<00:01:51.720> smaller<00:01:54.140> they<00:01:55.140> don't<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.649> like<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
thinner smaller they don't have like the

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.649 
thinner smaller they don't have like the
embellishments<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.439> eyelashes<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.770> stuff

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
embellishments of eyelashes and stuff

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:14.710 
embellishments of eyelashes and stuff
just<00:02:00.659> kind<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.110> simpler

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.260 

now<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.350> eyebrow<00:02:15.950> is<00:02:16.600> usually<00:02:17.600> fuller<00:02:19.270> larger

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
now the eyebrow is usually fuller larger

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.040 
now the eyebrow is usually fuller larger
bushier<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:23.090> guys<00:02:23.330> generally<00:02:23.750> don't

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
bushier because guys generally don't

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.160 
bushier because guys generally don't
pluck<00:02:24.290> their<00:02:24.500> eyebrows<00:02:28.840> have<00:02:29.840> a<00:02:29.930> fuller

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
pluck their eyebrows have a fuller

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.780 
pluck their eyebrows have a fuller
larger<00:02:30.860> eyebrow<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.810> nose<00:02:33.640> generally<00:02:34.640> can

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
larger eyebrow the nose generally can

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.610 
larger eyebrow the nose generally can
have<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.940> lot<00:02:35.210> more<00:02:35.240> fun<00:02:35.630> with<00:02:35.840> on<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.080> guy's<00:02:36.350> nose

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
have a lot more fun with on a guy's nose

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.080 
have a lot more fun with on a guy's nose
than<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:36.890> girl's<00:02:37.130> nose<00:02:37.340> because<00:02:37.670> girls<00:02:37.970> you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
than a girl's nose because girls you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.660 
than a girl's nose because girls you
tend<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.390> want<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.660> make<00:02:38.780> pretty<00:02:39.130> guys<00:02:40.130> don't

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
tend to want to make pretty guys don't

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
longer it extends downward more here

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.640 
longer it extends downward more here
more<00:02:53.750> angular<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:56.090> kind<00:02:56.270> of<00:02:56.350> stronger<00:02:57.350> if

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
more angular just kind of stronger if

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.320 
more angular just kind of stronger if
that<00:02:58.040> makes<00:02:58.280> sense

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:24.229 
stated these in other videos but lips
you<00:03:15.980> tend<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.340> want<00:03:16.520> to<00:03:16.670> make<00:03:16.820> thinner

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.750 

see<00:03:25.239> these<00:03:25.450> like<00:03:25.690> big<00:03:25.870> full<00:03:26.290> lips<00:03:26.319> then<00:03:27.099> the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
see these like big full lips then the

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.300 
see these like big full lips then the
same<00:03:27.970> kind<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.330> girlish<00:03:32.849> then<00:03:33.849> you<00:03:34.269> can

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
same kind of girlish then you can

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.220 
same kind of girlish then you can
redefine<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.730> kind<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.150> angular<00:03:37.569> jawline

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
redefine this kind of angular jawline

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.380 
redefine this kind of angular jawline
that<00:03:38.590> you've<00:03:38.709> created<00:03:39.390> emphasized

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
that you've created emphasized

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:50.780 
that you've created emphasized
cheekbones<00:03:41.170> if<00:03:41.560> you'd<00:03:41.709> like<00:03:41.950> a<00:03:44.610> wider<00:03:45.610> chin

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.039 

and<00:03:51.790> of<00:03:51.849> course<00:03:52.060> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.360> exaggerated<00:03:53.019> a

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
and of course this is exaggerated a

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.170 
and of course this is exaggerated a
little<00:03:53.290> bit<00:03:53.410> not<00:03:53.590> every<00:03:53.890> guy<00:03:54.069> has<00:03:54.549> you<00:03:55.060> know

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
little bit not every guy has you know

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.030 
little bit not every guy has you know
this<00:03:55.390> big<00:03:55.720> strong<00:03:56.140> jaw<00:03:56.440> or<00:03:56.650> whatever<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.920> then

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
this big strong jaw or whatever and then

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.720 
this big strong jaw or whatever and then
ears<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:02.530> protrude<00:04:02.890> maybe<00:04:03.280> a<00:04:03.370> little<00:04:03.610> bit

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
ears can protrude maybe a little bit

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.780 
ears can protrude maybe a little bit
more<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.299> just<00:04:05.110> make<00:04:05.290> everything<00:04:05.790> stronger

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
more just just make everything stronger

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.920 
more just just make everything stronger
and<00:04:07.120> more<00:04:07.840> linear<00:04:08.970> generally<00:04:09.970> when<00:04:10.720> drawing

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
and more linear generally when drawing

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.910 
and more linear generally when drawing
guys<00:04:11.110> especially<00:04:11.620> kind<00:04:11.769> of<00:04:11.860> a<00:04:11.920> cartoon<00:04:13.920> now

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
guys especially kind of a cartoon now

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.729 
guys especially kind of a cartoon now
for<00:04:15.370> girls<00:04:16.260> the<00:04:17.260> point<00:04:17.500> is<00:04:17.590> to<00:04:17.709> make

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
for girls the point is to make

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.560 
for girls the point is to make
everything<00:04:18.070> just<00:04:18.220> kind<00:04:18.579> of<00:04:18.609> curvy<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.180> soft

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
everything just kind of curvy and soft

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:27.170 
everything just kind of curvy and soft
and<00:04:19.959> so<00:04:20.859> eyes<00:04:21.810> will<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:23.040> larger<00:04:24.040> generally<00:04:25.860> and

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
and so eyes will be larger generally and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:44.629 
and so eyes will be larger generally and
rounder

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.200 

you<00:04:45.639> can<00:04:45.819> add<00:04:46.029> eyelashes<00:04:47.669> partly<00:04:48.669> shading

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
you can add eyelashes partly shading

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.939 
you can add eyelashes partly shading
there

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.369 

eyebrows<00:04:56.849> tend<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.300> be<00:04:57.419> thinner<00:04:57.780> and<00:04:58.169> more

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
eyebrows tend to be thinner and more

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:07.999 
eyebrows tend to be thinner and more
arched<00:04:59.419> shapely<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.979> the<00:05:05.099> nose<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:06.830> made<00:05:07.830> this

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
arched shapely and the nose is made this

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:12.369 
arched shapely and the nose is made this
bit<00:05:08.249> too<00:05:08.430> short

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:25.369 

just<00:05:13.379> kind<00:05:13.529> of<00:05:13.560> more<00:05:13.680> fluid<00:05:14.249> lines<00:05:24.259> and<00:05:25.259> the

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:25.379 
just kind of more fluid lines and the

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:28.969 
just kind of more fluid lines and the
mouth<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:26.840> think<00:05:27.840> girls<00:05:28.199> mouths<00:05:28.529> are<00:05:28.770> way

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
mouth I think girls mouths are way

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.149 
mouth I think girls mouths are way
funner<00:05:29.430> to<00:05:29.610> draw<00:05:29.819> because<00:05:30.180> you<00:05:30.330> get<00:05:30.479> to

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
funner to draw because you get to

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:48.310 
funner to draw because you get to
actually<00:05:32.159> draw<00:05:32.520> the<00:05:32.580> lips

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.500 

and<00:05:48.520> so<00:05:49.520> it's<00:05:49.640> all<00:05:49.790> these<00:05:49.910> little<00:05:49.970> pieces<00:05:50.270> that

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
and so it's all these little pieces that

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.480 
and so it's all these little pieces that
come<00:05:50.870> together<00:05:51.080> to<00:05:51.410> create<00:05:51.620> a<00:05:53.230> face<00:05:54.370> in<00:05:55.370> all

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
come together to create a face in all

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.830 
come together to create a face in all
the<00:05:55.610> different<00:05:55.940> videos<00:05:56.060> that<00:05:56.300> I've<00:05:56.540> shown<00:05:56.720> you

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
the different videos that I've shown you

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.030 
the different videos that I've shown you
how<00:05:56.930> to<00:05:56.990> draw<00:05:57.290> each<00:05:57.470> thing<00:05:59.560> that<00:06:00.560> really<00:06:00.740> make

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
how to draw each thing that really make

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.790 
how to draw each thing that really make
it<00:06:01.190> look<00:06:01.310> like<00:06:01.430> a<00:06:01.490> girl<00:06:01.760> or<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.150> guy<00:06:02.270> as<00:06:02.650> you<00:06:03.650> draw

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
it look like a girl or a guy as you draw

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.680 
it look like a girl or a guy as you draw

the jaw line you can add cheekbones

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.790 
the jaw line you can add cheekbones
again<00:06:05.960> if<00:06:06.080> you'd<00:06:06.230> like<00:06:06.410> or<00:06:06.770> not

major chin probably too large and then

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.350 
major chin probably too large and then
just<00:06:12.770> keep<00:06:12.920> in<00:06:13.130> mind<00:06:13.400> just<00:06:13.730> kind<00:06:13.850> of<00:06:14.000> soft
