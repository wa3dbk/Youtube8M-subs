that's<00:00:41.250> not<00:00:41.460> gonna<00:00:41.640> cut<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:41.969> guys

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469 
that's not gonna cut it guys

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's not gonna cut it guys
Heimerdinger<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.680> don't<00:00:44.040> even<00:00:44.100> know<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.399> that's

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
Heimerdinger I don't even know if that's

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.119 
Heimerdinger I don't even know if that's
gonna<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> good<00:00:45.300> option<00:00:45.840> first<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.860> all<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
gonna be a good option first of all you

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.920 
gonna be a good option first of all you
have<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> land<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> e<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.329> serac<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.840> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
have to land the e on the serac that a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.200 
have to land the e on the serac that a
stunner<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.129> probably<00:00:50.520> not<00:00:50.820> gonna

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
stunner and that's probably not gonna

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
stunner and that's probably not gonna
work

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
work

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
work
so<00:00:51.989> hopefully<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.469> can<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.739> into<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.070> game

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
so hopefully we can get into this game

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.830 
so hopefully we can get into this game
right<00:00:53.309> now<00:00:53.640> they're<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:53.910> they're<00:00:54.809> just

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
right now they're just they're just

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.319 
right now they're just they're just
sitting<00:00:55.260> in<00:00:55.379> base<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:56.129> if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.969> go<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.239> a

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
sitting in base because if you go to a

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
sitting in base because if you go to a
lane<00:00:57.600> then<00:00:58.140> Soraka<00:00:58.559> will<00:00:58.770> probably<00:00:59.100> go<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lane then Soraka will probably go to a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.189 
lane then Soraka will probably go to a
different<00:00:59.520> Lane<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.359> wait<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> base<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
different Lane so they wait and base and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.840 
different Lane so they wait and base and
Soraka<00:01:01.530> automatically<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.460> bot<00:01:02.640> Lane

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
Soraka automatically will go bot Lane

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
Soraka automatically will go bot Lane
and<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.090> you<00:01:03.210> follow<00:01:03.480> her<00:01:03.629> down<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> lane

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
and then you follow her down the lane

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.810 
and then you follow her down the lane
and<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> try<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.680> protect<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> shit<00:01:05.549> out<00:01:05.700> of
