thinking<00:01:28.650> should<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> take<00:01:29.520> attack<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
thinking should I take attack from the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.760 
thinking should I take attack from the
top<00:01:30.210> i<00:01:30.240> was<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.570> maybe<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.229> i<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.710> we

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
