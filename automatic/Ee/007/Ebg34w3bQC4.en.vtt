at the card itself very nice looking

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.050 
at the card itself very nice looking
card<00:04:56.410> I<00:04:56.590> like<00:04:56.980> the<00:04:57.160> fact<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.520> they've<00:04:57.790> done

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
card I like the fact that they've done

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.200 
card I like the fact that they've done
it<00:04:58.210> in<00:04:58.300> black<00:04:58.600> beings<00:04:59.170> that<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.940> interior<00:05:00.940> on

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
it in black beings that the interior on

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.450 
it in black beings that the interior on
most<00:05:01.420> cases<00:05:01.750> nowadays<00:05:02.440> are<00:05:02.650> coming<00:05:03.070> in<00:05:03.190> black

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
most cases nowadays are coming in black

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.170

so<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.330> should<00:05:04.600> blend<00:05:05.320> in<00:05:05.620> nicely<00:05:05.850> not<00:05:06.850> stick

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
so it should blend in nicely not stick

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.680 
so it should blend in nicely not stick
out<00:05:07.330> like<00:05:07.360> a<00:05:07.540> sore<00:05:07.660> thumb<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:08.410> some<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.490> your

your<00:06:08.910> Panasonic<00:06:10.230> this<00:06:11.230> one<00:06:11.410> I<00:06:11.440> believe<00:06:11.620> is

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
your Panasonic this one I believe is

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.380 
your Panasonic this one I believe is
Sony<00:06:12.250> and<00:06:12.990> then<00:06:13.990> this<00:06:14.230> is<00:06:14.410> your<00:06:14.440> typical

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
Sony and then this is your typical

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:20.250 
Sony and then this is your typical
auxiliary<00:06:16.390> of<00:06:16.980> sound

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:20.260 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.300 

it<00:06:20.770> has<00:06:21.070> some<00:06:21.310> jumper<00:06:21.730> settings<00:06:22.120> on<00:06:22.390> it<00:06:22.420> I'm

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
it has some jumper settings on it I'm

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.740 
it has some jumper settings on it I'm
not<00:06:24.310> sure<00:06:24.370> what<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.820> optional<00:06:25.180> jumpers<00:06:25.570> are<00:06:25.720> I

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
not sure what the optional jumpers are I

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.980 
not sure what the optional jumpers are I
think<00:06:26.020> that<00:06:26.230> is<00:06:26.410> to<00:06:26.560> configure<00:06:27.600> the<00:06:28.600> different

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
think that is to configure the different

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.460 
think that is to configure the different
surround<00:06:29.970> features<00:06:30.970> of<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:31.420> I'd<00:06:32.080> have<00:06:32.140> to<00:06:32.440> look

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:32.470 
surround features of it I'd have to look

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.530 
surround features of it I'd have to look
in<00:06:32.680> the<00:06:32.770> manual<00:06:32.890> I<00:06:33.190> guess<00:06:33.370> I<00:06:33.520> haven't<00:06:34.390> read

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
in the manual I guess I haven't read

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.340 
in the manual I guess I haven't read
that<00:06:34.600> yet<00:06:34.870> but<00:06:36.390> it's<00:06:37.390> a<00:06:37.540> very<00:06:37.570> decent<00:06:37.960> lookin

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:38.350 
that yet but it's a very decent lookin

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.130 
that yet but it's a very decent lookin
card<00:06:38.620> and<00:06:38.950> as<00:06:39.460> I<00:06:39.610> said<00:06:39.670> earlier<00:06:40.140> anybody

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:41.140 
card and as I said earlier anybody

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.210 
card and as I said earlier anybody
that's<00:06:41.380> used<00:06:42.070> on<00:06:42.460> board<00:06:42.820> audio<00:06:43.890> kind<00:06:44.890> of<00:06:45.010> gets

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220 
that's used on board audio kind of gets

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.320 
that's used on board audio kind of gets
used<00:06:45.640> to<00:06:45.820> that<00:06:45.940> lack<00:06:46.120> of<00:06:46.840> sound<00:06:47.230> quality<00:06:48.330> you

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:49.330 
used to that lack of sound quality you

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.330 
used to that lack of sound quality you
think<00:06:49.780> it<00:06:49.960> may<00:06:50.230> be<00:06:50.260> sounds<00:06:50.830> pretty<00:06:51.070> good<00:06:51.280> but

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
think it may be sounds pretty good but

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.300 
think it may be sounds pretty good but
you<00:06:52.330> haven't<00:06:52.870> really<00:06:53.230> heard<00:06:53.500> what<00:06:53.860> your<00:06:53.980> games

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
you haven't really heard what your games

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.370 
you haven't really heard what your games
or<00:06:54.640> movies<00:06:55.000> and<00:06:55.270> stuff<00:06:55.480> could<00:06:55.870> sound<00:06:56.200> like

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
or movies and stuff could sound like

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.730 
or movies and stuff could sound like
until<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.580> put<00:06:57.940> a<00:06:57.970> decent<00:06:58.480> add-in<00:06:59.020> card<00:06:59.380> in

00:06:59.730 --> 00:06:59.740 
until you put a decent add-in card in

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.090 
until you put a decent add-in card in
and<00:07:00.010> then<00:07:00.520> once<00:07:00.760> you<00:07:00.940> do<00:07:01.210> you'll<00:07:01.540> notice

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
and then once you do you'll notice

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.770 
and then once you do you'll notice
things<00:07:03.100> in<00:07:03.400> movies<00:07:03.580> that<00:07:04.150> you<00:07:04.330> never<00:07:04.510> heard

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:04.780 
things in movies that you never heard

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.860 
things in movies that you never heard
before<00:07:05.490> maybe<00:07:06.490> in<00:07:06.730> games<00:07:07.060> they'll<00:07:07.480> be<00:07:07.630> sound

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
before maybe in games they'll be sound

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.960 
before maybe in games they'll be sound
effects<00:07:08.290> and<00:07:08.560> stuff<00:07:08.680> that<00:07:09.100> you<00:07:09.580> never<00:07:09.790> even

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
effects and stuff that you never even

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.700 
effects and stuff that you never even
realized<00:07:10.270> were<00:07:10.780> there<00:07:11.050> before<00:07:11.230> because

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:11.710 
realized were there before because

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:14.130 
realized were there before because
you're<00:07:11.860> onboard<00:07:12.040> audio<00:07:12.660> just<00:07:13.660> was<00:07:13.900> not

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:14.140 
you're onboard audio just was not

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:18.210 
you're onboard audio just was not

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.220 
picking it up and I think this one would

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.390
