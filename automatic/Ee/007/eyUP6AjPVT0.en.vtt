over x squared minus 5x plus 6 in
simplest<00:00:09.690> form<00:00:10.580> now<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:11.969> problem

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
simplest form now to do this problem

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.669 
simplest form now to do this problem
we're<00:00:12.450> going<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.900> factor<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.469> time

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
we're going to have to factor the time

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.220 
we're going to have to factor the time
in<00:00:13.950> fact<00:00:14.519> at<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.790> bottom<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.240> reduce<00:00:15.660> out<00:00:15.929> any

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
in fact at the bottom and reduce out any

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.849 
in fact at the bottom and reduce out any
like<00:00:16.800> terms<00:00:17.070> so<00:00:17.430> we<00:00:17.970> have<00:00:18.270> x<00:00:18.600> squared<00:00:18.750> minus<00:00:19.439> X

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
like terms so we have x squared minus X

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.810 
like terms so we have x squared minus X
minus<00:00:20.490> 6<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.119> top<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:22.109> x<00:00:22.920> squared<00:00:23.369> minus

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
minus 6 on the top and x squared minus

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.769 
minus 6 on the top and x squared minus
5x<00:00:24.529> plus<00:00:25.529> 6<00:00:25.560> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.010> bottom<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:27.300> factor<00:00:27.660> the

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
5x plus 6 on the bottom to factor the

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.470 
5x plus 6 on the bottom to factor the
top<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.230> need<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.519> factor<00:00:29.789> that<00:00:30.000> trinomial

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
top I need to factor that trinomial

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.520 
top I need to factor that trinomial
there<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.759> so<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.790> need<00:00:33.030> factors<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.840> six<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
there and so I need factors of six that

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.069 
there and so I need factors of six that
are<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.860> add<00:00:35.040> up<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.870> negative<00:00:36.870> one

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
are going to add up to a negative one

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.619 
are going to add up to a negative one
here<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.469> middle<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.640> factors<00:00:39.180> are<00:00:39.360> six

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
here in the middle so factors are six

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.139 
here in the middle so factors are six
are<00:00:40.610> 16<00:00:41.610> 2<00:00:42.420> &amp;<00:00:42.629> 3<00:00:42.860> to<00:00:43.860> get<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.190> negative<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.000> in

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
are 16 2 &amp; 3 to get this negative one in

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.100 
are 16 2 &amp; 3 to get this negative one in
the<00:00:45.239> middle<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:46.550> need<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.760> negative<00:00:48.480> 3<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
the middle I need a negative 3 and a

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.250 
the middle I need a negative 3 and a
positive<00:00:49.710> 2<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> I<00:00:51.690> will<00:00:52.079> have<00:00:52.110> x<00:00:52.739> +<00:00:53.219> 2<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.260> X

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
positive 2 so I will have x + 2 and X

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.040 
positive 2 so I will have x + 2 and X
minus<00:00:55.590> 3<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> top<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.750> bottom

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
minus 3 on the top now on the bottom

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.889 
minus 3 on the top now on the bottom
same<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.770> i'm<00:00:59.520> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.180> factors<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
same thing i'm going to have factors of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
same thing i'm going to have factors of
six<00:01:01.289> except<00:01:01.829> now<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.160> need<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.370> add<00:01:02.579> up<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> a

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
six except now they need to add up to a

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.060 
six except now they need to add up to a
negative<00:01:03.149> 5<00:01:04.610> so<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:05.909> six<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.860> two<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
negative 5 so one in six and two and

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
negative 5 so one in six and two and
three<00:01:10.400> now<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.580> tricky<00:01:12.000> because<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.390> could

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
three now this is tricky because I could

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
three now this is tricky because I could
use<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.689> one<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.170> six<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.619> get<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.890> five<00:01:14.130> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
use the one and six to get the five and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.310 
use the one and six to get the five and
I<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.060> also<00:01:15.210> use<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.990> three<00:01:16.200> to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
I could also use the two and three to

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
I could also use the two and three to
get<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> five<00:01:16.740> now<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> use<00:01:17.850> well<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
get the five now what do I use well I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.039 
get the five now what do I use well I
need<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.439> positive<00:01:19.770> six<00:01:20.640> here<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.869> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
need to have a positive six here so that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.570 
need to have a positive six here so that
means<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> either<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> negative<00:01:23.280> times

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
means I either have a negative times

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.370 
means I either have a negative times
negative<00:01:23.759> or<00:01:24.299> positive<00:01:24.710> times<00:01:25.710> positive<00:01:27.380> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
negative or positive times positive so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
negative or positive times positive so
if<00:01:28.680> that's<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.250> case<00:01:29.430> I'm<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.090> use

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
if that's the case I'm going to use

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.380 
if that's the case I'm going to use
negative<00:01:30.720> 2<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.740> negative<00:01:32.040> 3<00:01:32.880> because

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
negative 2 and negative 3 because

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.140 
negative 2 and negative 3 because
negative<00:01:33.720> 2<00:01:34.049> times<00:01:34.350> negative<00:01:34.590> 3<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.369> negative

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
negative 2 times negative 3 is negative

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.080 
negative 2 times negative 3 is negative
6<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:37.110> here<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.500> then<00:01:38.250> negative<00:01:38.460> 2<00:01:38.759> plus

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
6 right here and then negative 2 plus

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
6 right here and then negative 2 plus
the<00:01:39.210> negative<00:01:39.540> 3<00:01:39.900> gives<00:01:40.439> me<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> negative<00:01:41.189> 5

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
the negative 3 gives me the negative 5

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.999 
the negative 3 gives me the negative 5
in<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.790> middle<00:01:42.090> right<00:01:42.299> there<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.619> X

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
in the middle right there so I have X

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.730 
in the middle right there so I have X
minus<00:01:44.520> two<00:01:46.009> X<00:01:47.009> minus<00:01:47.399> 3<00:01:48.229> now<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> ones<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
minus two X minus 3 now the ones that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.069 
minus two X minus 3 now the ones that
reduce<00:01:50.040> out<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.909> X<00:01:51.030> minus<00:01:51.270> three<00:01:51.600> X<00:01:51.869> minus

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
reduce out is the X minus three X minus

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.679 
reduce out is the X minus three X minus
3<00:01:52.820> leaving<00:01:53.820> me<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.360> answer<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:56.030> x<00:01:57.030> plus<00:01:57.420> 2

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
3 leaving me with my answer of x plus 2

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.579 
3 leaving me with my answer of x plus 2
over<00:01:58.100> X<00:01:59.100> minus<00:01:59.399> 2<00:01:59.759> which<00:02:00.049> is<00:02:01.049> choice<00:02:01.579> one
