00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
spot every time and what we could do is

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.030 
spot every time and what we could do is
we<00:03:38.330> can<00:03:38.600> from<00:03:38.870> there<00:03:39.020> we<00:03:39.170> could<00:03:39.320> alternate<00:03:39.860> and

we can from there we could alternate and

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.130 
we can from there we could alternate and
it<00:03:40.100> could<00:03:40.250> be<00:03:40.400> two<00:03:41.060> hits<00:03:41.330> with<00:03:41.510> the<00:03:41.630> left<00:03:41.870> to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
it could be two hits with the left to

it could be two hits with the left to
the<00:03:42.200> district<00:03:42.530> and<00:03:42.680> right<00:03:42.890> go<00:03:43.490> back<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.880> two

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060

first year we talked about where we hit
them<00:04:12.490> we<00:04:12.790> hit<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> bag<00:04:13.270> with<00:04:13.450> the<00:04:13.540> back<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.870> our

them we hit the bag with the back of our
hand<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.350> we<00:04:14.410> just<00:04:14.650> build<00:04:15.100> up<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.340> where<00:04:15.370> we're

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
hand and we just build up to where we're

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.979 
hand and we just build up to where we're
alternating<00:04:16.209> your<00:04:16.330> right<00:04:16.510> hand<00:04:16.720> and<00:04:16.870> left

alternating your right hand and left

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.110 
alternating your right hand and left
hand<00:04:17.110> that's<00:04:17.739> that's<00:04:18.130> a<00:04:18.250> basic<00:04:18.640> drill<00:04:18.910> a

hand that's that's a basic drill a
little<00:04:19.540> more<00:04:19.870> advanced

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
little more advanced

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.410 
little more advanced
drill<00:04:20.590> is<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:21.370> do<00:04:21.489> something<00:04:21.850> like<00:04:21.940> this<00:04:22.150> and

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
drill is to do something like this and

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.370 
drill is to do something like this and
what<00:04:22.570> we're<00:04:22.660> going<00:04:22.750> to<00:04:22.810> do<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.080> we're<00:04:23.200> going<00:04:23.230> to

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.650 
what we're going to do is we're going to
once<00:04:23.560> again<00:04:23.650> alternate<00:04:24.250> our<00:04:24.370> hands<00:04:24.820> but<00:04:25.540> we're

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
once again alternate our hands but we're

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.330 
once again alternate our hands but we're
going<00:04:25.750> to<00:04:25.840> hit<00:04:25.990> it<00:04:26.110> twice<00:04:26.320> with<00:04:26.680> one<00:04:26.890> hand<00:04:27.160> and

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
going to hit it twice with one hand and

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.530 
going to hit it twice with one hand and
twice<00:04:27.700> with<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:27.910> other<00:04:28.120> we're<00:04:28.240> going<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.390> hit

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
twice with the other we're going to hit

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.540 
twice with the other we're going to hit
it<00:04:28.660> differently<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.290> here's<00:04:30.100> how<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.370> is

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
it differently so here's how this is

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.800 
it differently so here's how this is
going<00:04:30.640> to<00:04:30.700> work<00:04:30.790> we're<00:04:31.330> going<00:04:31.420> to<00:04:31.480> hit<00:04:31.660> it<00:04:31.690> with

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
going to work we're going to hit it with

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.170 
going to work we're going to hit it with
a<00:04:31.930> left<00:04:32.590> cross<00:04:32.860> first<00:04:33.280> or<00:04:33.610> against<00:04:33.940> already

a left cross first or against already

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.540 
a left cross first or against already
right<00:04:34.390> but<00:04:34.630> hit<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.900> with<00:04:35.020> a<00:04:35.050> cross<00:04:35.380> first<00:04:35.710> the

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
right but hit it with a cross first the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.370 
right but hit it with a cross first the
bag<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.090> going<00:04:37.240> to<00:04:37.360> rebound<00:04:37.720> off<00:04:37.960> the<00:04:37.990> platform

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.809 

it's<00:05:25.860> a<00:05:25.919> lot<00:05:26.069> of<00:05:26.190> different<00:05:26.460> things<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:26.699> can

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:26.819 
it's a lot of different things you can

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.730 
it's a lot of different things you can
do<00:05:26.879> with<00:05:27.000> speed<00:05:27.300> back<00:05:27.479> in<00:05:27.660> terms<00:05:27.840> of<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.110> workout

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
do with speed back in terms of a workout

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.439 
do with speed back in terms of a workout
and<00:05:28.979> I<00:05:29.370> think<00:05:29.580> what<00:05:29.699> you<00:05:29.819> want<00:05:29.970> to<00:05:30.060> try<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.210> do

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
and I think what you want to try to do

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.930 
and I think what you want to try to do
though<00:05:30.690> to<00:05:30.750> build<00:05:31.080> up<00:05:31.259> is<00:05:31.500> to<00:05:31.889> do<00:05:32.069> basically<00:05:32.729> do

though to build up is to do basically do

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.300 
though to build up is to do basically do

advanced what we want to do is take it
slow<00:05:42.150> in<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.360> beginning<00:05:42.509> and<00:05:42.990> maybe<00:05:43.289> it's

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
slow in the beginning and maybe it's

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.619 
slow in the beginning and maybe it's
even<00:05:43.710> if<00:05:43.889> you<00:05:44.009> round<00:05:44.280> this<00:05:44.430> 15<00:05:44.909> seconds<00:05:45.389> long

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629 
even if you round this 15 seconds long

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.990 
even if you round this 15 seconds long
so<00:05:46.409> you<00:05:46.500> hit<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.740> speed<00:05:46.979> back<00:05:47.159> for<00:05:47.370> 15<00:05:47.699> minutes

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
so you hit the speed back for 15 minutes

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.760 
so you hit the speed back for 15 minutes
and<00:05:48.150> that's<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.599> that's<00:05:48.780> as<00:05:48.990> much<00:05:49.319> as<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.620> can

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
and that's it that's as much as you can

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.619 
and that's it that's as much as you can
do<00:05:49.919> then<00:05:50.370> you<00:05:50.520> take<00:05:50.699> a<00:05:50.729> rest<00:05:51.000> at<00:05:51.210> that<00:05:51.240> point

00:05:51.619 --> 00:05:51.629 
do then you take a rest at that point

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:53.899 
do then you take a rest at that point
and<00:05:51.870> maybe<00:05:52.020> it's<00:05:52.229> 30<00:05:52.620> seconds<00:05:53.159> so<00:05:53.430> it's<00:05:53.550> 15

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
and maybe it's 30 seconds so it's 15

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.420 
and maybe it's 30 seconds so it's 15
seconds<00:05:54.300> on<00:05:54.449> 30<00:05:54.810> seconds<00:05:55.259> off<00:05:55.409> and<00:05:55.710> over<00:05:56.220> time

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
seconds on 30 seconds off and over time

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.950 
seconds on 30 seconds off and over time
what<00:05:56.580> we<00:05:56.729> can<00:05:56.880> do<00:05:56.970> is<00:05:57.090> we<00:05:57.210> can<00:05:57.330> build<00:05:57.539> up<00:05:57.750> at<00:05:57.930> a

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
what we can do is we can build up at a

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.260 
what we can do is we can build up at a
few<00:05:58.229> seconds<00:05:58.650> so<00:05:58.800> over<00:05:59.520> the<00:05:59.610> course<00:05:59.819> of<00:05:59.940> a<00:06:00.030> week

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
few seconds so over the course of a week

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.939 
few seconds so over the course of a week
or<00:06:00.449> a<00:06:00.509> couple<00:06:00.599> of<00:06:00.900> weeks<00:06:01.050> now<00:06:01.259> you're<00:06:01.409> up<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.590> 20

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:01.949 
or a couple of weeks now you're up to 20

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.890 
or a couple of weeks now you're up to 20
minutes<00:06:02.130> and<00:06:02.430> maybe<00:06:02.550> over<00:06:02.789> 20<00:06:03.090> seconds<00:06:03.479> and<00:06:03.659> at

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
minutes and maybe over 20 seconds and at

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.570 
minutes and maybe over 20 seconds and at
that<00:06:04.020> point<00:06:04.199> you're<00:06:04.380> 20<00:06:04.710> seconds<00:06:05.130> on<00:06:05.280> and

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
that point you're 20 seconds on and

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.969 
that point you're 20 seconds on and
maybe<00:06:06.090> recovering<00:06:06.690> for<00:06:06.870> 60<00:06:07.169> seconds<00:06:07.680> and<00:06:07.770> try

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
maybe recovering for 60 seconds and try

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.409 
maybe recovering for 60 seconds and try
to<00:06:08.069> gradually<00:06:08.580> build<00:06:08.729> it<00:06:08.880> up<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.120> the<00:06:09.210> point

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
to gradually build it up to the point

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:12.589 
to gradually build it up to the point
we're<00:06:09.569> doing<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:10.310> rounds<00:06:11.310> of<00:06:11.430> two<00:06:11.669> minutes<00:06:11.969> or

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
we're doing a rounds of two minutes or

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.149 
we're doing a rounds of two minutes or
more<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:13.110> think<00:06:13.530> the<00:06:13.680> other<00:06:13.800> thing<00:06:13.979> that<00:06:14.099> we

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
more I think the other thing that we

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.159 
more I think the other thing that we
need<00:06:14.310> to<00:06:14.340> talk<00:06:14.550> about<00:06:14.610> too<00:06:15.030> is<00:06:15.270> wrapping<00:06:16.050> your

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
need to talk about too is wrapping your

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:17.570 
need to talk about too is wrapping your
hands<00:06:16.349> or<00:06:16.530> at<00:06:16.590> least<00:06:16.740> covering<00:06:17.099> hand<00:06:17.310> so<00:06:17.430> what

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 
hands or at least covering hand so what

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.369 
hands or at least covering hand so what
we<00:06:17.669> do<00:06:17.759> with<00:06:17.880> the<00:06:18.000> speed<00:06:18.270> bag<00:06:18.509> /<00:06:18.810> -<00:06:18.960> heavy<00:06:19.139> bag

we use it just a lighter wrap we don't
have<00:06:21.389> support<00:06:21.509> gloves<00:06:21.990> on
