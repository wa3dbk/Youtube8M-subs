00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.920 

and<00:04:33.780> here<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:34.990> Z<00:04:35.650> shad<00:04:35.949> Z<00:04:36.819> shad<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.419> actually

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
and here is Z shad Z shad is actually

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.550 
and here is Z shad Z shad is actually
pretty<00:04:38.139> similar<00:04:39.300> to<00:04:40.300> this<00:04:40.750> guy<00:04:40.960> here<00:04:41.229> except

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
pretty similar to this guy here except

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.260 
pretty similar to this guy here except
for<00:04:41.590> it's<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:41.949> non-transparent<00:04:42.400> version<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.120> it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
for it's a non-transparent version of it

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.379 
for it's a non-transparent version of it
and<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.900> colors<00:04:44.199> are<00:04:44.379> a<00:04:44.409> little<00:04:44.500> bit<00:04:44.830> more

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.200 

brighter<00:04:49.389> I<00:04:49.539> guess<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.860> Pearl<00:04:51.699> melon<00:04:52.060> is<00:04:52.180> a

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
brighter I guess the Pearl melon is a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.570 
brighter I guess the Pearl melon is a
more<00:04:52.810> subtle<00:04:53.080> kind<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.560> clear<00:04:53.770> water<00:04:53.800> color<00:04:54.280> I

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
more subtle kind of clear water color I

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.399 
more subtle kind of clear water color I
guess<00:04:55.060> you<00:04:55.180> can<00:04:55.300> use<00:04:55.419> this<00:04:55.539> one<00:04:55.719> in<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.199> clear

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:56.409 
guess you can use this one in a clear

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:59.189 
guess you can use this one in a clear
water<00:04:56.590> settings<00:04:57.099> too<00:04:57.310> but<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.750> colors<00:04:59.050> are<00:04:59.169> a

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
water settings too but the colors are a

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:00.480 
water settings too but the colors are a
little<00:04:59.259> bit<00:04:59.530> brighter<00:04:59.710> on<00:05:00.009> it<00:05:00.129> so<00:05:00.250> you<00:05:00.340> could

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
little bit brighter on it so you could

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.459 
little bit brighter on it so you could
probably<00:05:00.669> fish<00:05:01.150> with<00:05:01.330> it<00:05:01.509> especially<00:05:02.229> with

00:05:02.459 --> 00:05:02.469 
probably fish with it especially with

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:05.999 
probably fish with it especially with
this<00:05:02.710> gold<00:05:03.490> copper<00:05:04.419> color<00:05:04.840> here<00:05:05.169> you<00:05:05.860> could

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
this gold copper color here you could

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.200 
this gold copper color here you could
probably<00:05:06.129> get<00:05:06.340> away<00:05:06.430> with<00:05:06.520> fishing<00:05:06.879> this<00:05:07.029> and

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
probably get away with fishing this and

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.029 
probably get away with fishing this and
a<00:05:07.360> little<00:05:08.319> bit<00:05:08.439> more<00:05:08.560> stained<00:05:08.860> water

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
a little bit more stained water

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.619 
a little bit more stained water
especially<00:05:09.310> because<00:05:09.669> they<00:05:09.819> sit<00:05:10.090> like<00:05:10.120> this<00:05:10.449> in

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
especially because they sit like this in

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.779 
especially because they sit like this in
the<00:05:10.689> water<00:05:11.129> so<00:05:12.479> z<00:05:13.479> shad<00:05:13.860> it's<00:05:14.860> kind<00:05:15.069> of<00:05:15.099> a<00:05:15.250> black

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
the water so z shad it's kind of a black

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.360 
the water so z shad it's kind of a black
dark<00:05:16.210> brown<00:05:16.270> on<00:05:16.629> the<00:05:16.719> back<00:05:16.900> it's<00:05:17.860> got<00:05:17.889> the<00:05:18.159> shad

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
dark brown on the back it's got the shad

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.760 
dark brown on the back it's got the shad
dot<00:05:18.639> right<00:05:18.909> there<00:05:18.939> just<00:05:19.389> like<00:05:19.599> the<00:05:20.259> melon<00:05:20.590> one

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
dot right there just like the melon one

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.760 
dot right there just like the melon one
does<00:05:20.979> and<00:05:23.490> fading<00:05:24.490> into<00:05:24.639> this<00:05:25.319> gold<00:05:26.319> copper

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
does and fading into this gold copper

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.610 
does and fading into this gold copper
color<00:05:27.159> down<00:05:27.759> into<00:05:28.090> this<00:05:28.330> silver<00:05:29.699> and<00:05:30.699> then

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
color down into this silver and then

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.469 
color down into this silver and then
again<00:05:32.620> down<00:05:32.860> into<00:05:33.189> this<00:05:33.550> one<00:05:33.759> isn't<00:05:34.089> so<00:05:34.419> much

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
again down into this one isn't so much

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.629 
again down into this one isn't so much
pearl<00:05:34.900> as<00:05:35.199> it<00:05:35.349> is<00:05:35.469> like<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.710> white<00:05:36.129> kind<00:05:36.520> of

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
pearl as it is like a white kind of

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.959 
pearl as it is like a white kind of

that's just uh you don't have to do
anything<00:06:19.719> to<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.080> it's<00:06:20.349> a<00:06:20.409> little<00:06:20.529> nice<00:06:20.740> right

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
anything to it it's a little nice right

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.860 
anything to it it's a little nice right
off<00:06:21.069> the<00:06:21.189> bat<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.520> pop<00:06:21.699> ARS<00:06:21.939> are<00:06:22.060> like<00:06:22.270> five

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
off the bat the pop ARS are like five

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.550 
off the bat the pop ARS are like five
bucks<00:06:23.169> these<00:06:23.439> are<00:06:23.589> like<00:06:23.710> ten<00:06:23.889> bucks<00:06:24.960> and<00:06:25.960> I

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
bucks these are like ten bucks and I

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.929 
bucks these are like ten bucks and I
think<00:06:26.800> that<00:06:27.039> even<00:06:27.219> with<00:06:27.430> all<00:06:27.580> the<00:06:27.729> goodies

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
think that even with all the goodies

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.329 
think that even with all the goodies
that<00:06:28.180> I<00:06:28.270> put<00:06:28.479> on<00:06:28.569> my<00:06:28.779> pop<00:06:29.110> R<00:06:29.319> I<00:06:29.560> think<00:06:30.219> that

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
that I put on my pop R I think that

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:31.829 
that I put on my pop R I think that
these<00:06:30.460> are<00:06:30.669> still<00:06:30.849> a<00:06:30.909> little<00:06:31.060> bit<00:06:31.270> nicer<00:06:31.629> just

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:31.839 
these are still a little bit nicer just

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:34.950 
these are still a little bit nicer just
because<00:06:32.080> they<00:06:32.169> have<00:06:32.259> nicer<00:06:32.560> paint<00:06:32.800> jobs<00:06:33.960> so

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 
because they have nicer paint jobs so

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:45.679 
because they have nicer paint jobs so
anyway<00:06:35.289> there's<00:06:35.800> the<00:06:36.099> Z<00:06:36.580> shad

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:45.689 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:50.399 

so<00:06:47.280> go<00:06:48.280> ahead<00:06:48.370> and<00:06:48.460> take<00:06:49.150> a<00:06:49.180> measurement<00:06:49.539> for

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:50.409 
so go ahead and take a measurement for

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:56.149 
so go ahead and take a measurement for
ya<00:06:51.300> they're<00:06:52.300> saying<00:06:52.889> 2<00:06:53.889> and<00:06:54.099> 5/16<00:06:55.090> of<00:06:55.360> an<00:06:55.719> inch

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:56.159 
ya they're saying 2 and 5/16 of an inch

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:05.510 
ya they're saying 2 and 5/16 of an inch
