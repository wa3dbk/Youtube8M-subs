00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.680
 since we are talking about games 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 the game is comfortable enough for me now 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:57.090
 hands are pretty big box they 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.800
 lay headphones qyuma cunt 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.840
 I do not know how to read 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
 The title of this topic can google 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 because I found about four 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:11.759
 options reading paper uma kum who 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.159
 as a lot of controversy says video sau 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:18.649
 regarding this brand 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:23.060
 Well, I think that reads the volume is mine 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.549
 opinion so godfather without it is very 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.890
 cool headphones right here briefly 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:35.329
 it is written that they can all their thingies 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.250
 here again repeated repeated 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.849
 repeated in general once again all of them 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.009
 plushy 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:47.000
 Well, there are some characteristics there 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.549
 pompous words and bad headphones 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.229
 allowed myself to get it but if they 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.560
 lay inside then they would be here here 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.829
 so all their buns are visible here again 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.030
 and all angles are all sticky 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.090
 They on magnetics as this often is done 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.390

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.700
 Looks unpacked headphones 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.590
 here they have a microphone he takes out 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.390
 Any microphone can be here. 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.390
 you're comfortable. 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.190

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.260
 it's all very comfortable very softly here 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.880
 here is a soft gasket that's it 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.430
 by the way when i 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.750
 a thing of the past video related to headphones 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.360

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:37.070

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:38.420
 correctly called both noisy further 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.760
 but again you will see that they 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.150
 turning so they fold syk 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.290
 that is, they can be conveniently transported 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.760
 transport either to non sticky and 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.490
 it is fixed in the selected position 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.490
 further deserves special attention 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:59.720

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.510

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:42.490
 wheel and wheel 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:44.380
 the vibrations of these headphones are built in hard drives 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.530
 small vibration motor and headphones on 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.940
 the head vibrates according to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.400
 happening happening in the game 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.470

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.320
 other games must be dealt with separately 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.630
 tune in there vibration feedback and somehow this 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:10.600
