reclined<00:02:28.940> position<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:29.660> here<00:02:29.990> and<00:02:30.350> what

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
reclined position on here and what

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.400 
reclined position on here and what
you'll<00:02:31.070> find<00:02:31.130> is<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.910> find<00:02:32.660> it<00:02:32.810> slightly<00:02:33.110> easier

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
you'll find is I find it slightly easier

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
if you are just putting a little bit of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.780 
if you are just putting a little bit of
pressure<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.170> top<00:02:36.560> of<00:02:36.770> your<00:02:36.800> unit<00:02:37.340> and

pressure on the top of your unit and

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.460 
pressure on the top of your unit and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
then you've got a hand hold squeeze on

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.920 
then you've got a hand hold squeeze on
the<00:02:39.620> back<00:02:39.800> just<00:02:40.610> squeeze<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.090> what<00:02:41.780> you'll

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930

is we have clips that now go over that
metal<00:04:12.950> bar<00:04:13.670> that's<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:14.360> the<00:04:14.480> side<00:04:14.750> so<00:04:15.320> I've<00:04:15.440> got

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
metal bar that's on the side so I've got

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.590 
metal bar that's on the side so I've got
two<00:04:15.890> of<00:04:16.040> those<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.520> just<00:04:16.730> popping<00:04:17.120> those<00:04:17.299> out

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
two of those so just popping those out

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.410 
two of those so just popping those out
like<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.170> and<00:04:18.440> just<00:04:18.880> lining<00:04:19.880> up<00:04:19.970> where<00:04:20.299> the

like so and just lining up where the
little<00:04:20.600> notches<00:04:20.870> are<00:04:21.230> that<00:04:21.739> hold<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.250> into

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
little notches are that hold that into

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.510 
little notches are that hold that into
position<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.650> as<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.710> say<00:04:24.890> that<00:04:25.160> we'll<00:04:25.310> just

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
position and as I say that we'll just

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.730 
position and as I say that we'll just
break<00:04:25.760> that<00:04:26.060> off<00:04:26.090> we<00:04:26.870> don't<00:04:27.140> want<00:04:27.320> any<00:04:27.530> rough

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
break that off we don't want any rough

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.350 
break that off we don't want any rough
edges<00:04:27.980> or<00:04:28.220> anything<00:04:28.430> for<00:04:28.700> the<00:04:28.790> child<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.300> that

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
edges or anything for the child and that

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.930 
edges or anything for the child and that
just<00:04:29.690> makes<00:04:29.840> that<00:04:30.050> all<00:04:30.110> nice<00:04:30.470> and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
just makes that all nice and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.960 
just makes that all nice and
and<00:04:31.720> then<00:04:32.140> hiding<00:04:32.440> underneath<00:04:32.950> again<00:04:33.250> and

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
and then hiding underneath again and

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.730 
and then hiding underneath again and
I'll<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:34.330> pop<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.570> flat<00:04:34.990> back<00:04:35.230> up<00:04:35.440> because

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
I'll just pop that flat back up because

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.570 
I'll just pop that flat back up because
I<00:04:35.800> finished<00:04:36.100> hiding<00:04:36.820> inside<00:04:37.210> there<00:04:37.540> now

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
I finished hiding inside there now

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.640 
I finished hiding inside there now
so<00:04:39.580> that's<00:04:39.940> your<00:04:40.150> blanking<00:04:40.630> off<00:04:40.750> adapter<00:04:41.410> and

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
so that's your blanking off adapter and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.230 
so that's your blanking off adapter and
that's<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.220> end<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.550> your<00:04:42.670> five-point

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
that's the end of your five-point

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.790 
that's the end of your five-point
harness<00:04:43.360> which<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:43.990> just<00:04:44.170> going<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.410> pop<00:04:44.590> into

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
harness which is just going to pop into

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.520 
harness which is just going to pop into
that<00:04:45.010> housing<00:04:45.520> there<00:04:45.730> and<00:04:46.120> then<00:04:46.990> all<00:04:47.320> that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
that housing there and then all that

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.620 
that housing there and then all that
happens<00:04:47.920> is<00:04:48.070> it<00:04:48.220> goes<00:04:48.430> into<00:04:48.460> exactly<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.360> same

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
happens is it goes into exactly the same

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.900 
happens is it goes into exactly the same
opening<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.260> we<00:04:50.350> had<00:04:50.530> earlier<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.250> that

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
opening that we had earlier and that

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.730 
opening that we had earlier and that
will<00:04:52.060> then<00:04:52.090> just<00:04:52.510> click<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.930> its<00:04:53.050> position<00:04:53.320> and

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
will then just click in its position and

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.100 
will then just click in its position and
that's<00:04:54.280> now<00:04:54.580> blanked<00:04:55.090> off<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.540> part<00:04:55.840> so<00:04:56.020> we

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
that's now blanked off that part so we

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.260 
that's now blanked off that part so we
now<00:04:56.290> have<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.560> seat<00:04:56.860> unit<00:04:57.310> that's<00:04:57.760> completely

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
now have a seat unit that's completely

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.860 
now have a seat unit that's completely
secure<00:04:58.810> and<00:04:59.020> safe<00:04:59.320> for<00:04:59.590> your<00:04:59.650> baby<00:05:00.630> now<00:05:01.630> this

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
secure and safe for your baby now this

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.570 
secure and safe for your baby now this
is<00:05:02.020> in<00:05:02.170> the<00:05:02.320> mode<00:05:02.590> when<00:05:02.920> it's<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.220> first

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
is in the mode when it's that first

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.790 
is in the mode when it's that first
stage<00:05:04.030> when<00:05:04.360> it's<00:05:04.510> from<00:05:04.750> three<00:05:05.110> months<00:05:05.350> up<00:05:05.740> to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
stage when it's from three months up to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.370 
stage when it's from three months up to
six<00:05:06.280> months<00:05:06.700> and<00:05:07.360> what<00:05:07.630> will<00:05:07.780> happen<00:05:08.170> is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
six months and what will happen is

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.790 
six months and what will happen is
that's<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.730> in<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.330> cradle<00:05:10.690> mode<00:05:11.170> so<00:05:11.530> what

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
that's it in this cradle mode so what

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.450 
that's it in this cradle mode so what
will<00:05:11.980> happen

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
will happen

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.760 
will happen
you<00:05:13.120> can<00:05:13.300> put<00:05:13.480> baby<00:05:13.720> in<00:05:13.870> there<00:05:14.170> for<00:05:14.350> sleeping

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
you can put baby in there for sleeping

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.310 
you can put baby in there for sleeping
from<00:05:14.950> three<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.430> six<00:05:15.700> months<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.330> we<00:05:17.110> know

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
from three to six months and we know

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.540 
from three to six months and we know
that<00:05:17.560> they're<00:05:17.680> going<00:05:17.800> to<00:05:17.890> be<00:05:18.010> nice<00:05:18.190> and<00:05:18.430> secure

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
that they're going to be nice and secure

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.390 
that they're going to be nice and secure
though<00:05:19.360> in<00:05:19.510> the<00:05:19.600> right<00:05:19.930> position<00:05:20.470> without

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
though in the right position without

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.340 
though in the right position without
that<00:05:21.610> five-point<00:05:22.210> harness<00:05:22.300> holding<00:05:23.050> them<00:05:23.200> in

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
that five-point harness holding them in

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.440 
that five-point harness holding them in
so<00:05:24.010> it's<00:05:24.190> a<00:05:24.250> very<00:05:24.580> innovative<00:05:25.230> idea<00:05:26.230> and<00:05:27.450> then

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
so it's a very innovative idea and then

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.240 
so it's a very innovative idea and then
what<00:05:28.660> will<00:05:28.840> happen<00:05:29.230> is<00:05:29.380> when<00:05:29.740> they<00:05:29.920> get<00:05:30.070> an

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
what will happen is when they get an

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.540 
what will happen is when they get an
older<00:05:30.580> child<00:05:30.610> so<00:05:31.090> it's<00:05:31.240> two<00:05:31.420> to<00:05:31.630> four<00:05:31.900> years

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
older child so it's two to four years

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.090 
older child so it's two to four years
still<00:05:33.550> got<00:05:33.730> the<00:05:33.820> stable<00:05:34.600> unit<00:05:35.470> there<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.860> hold

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
still got the stable unit there to hold

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.160 
still got the stable unit there to hold
them<00:05:36.280> into<00:05:36.520> position<00:05:36.970> but<00:05:37.600> we're<00:05:37.720> then<00:05:37.930> going

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
them into position but we're then going

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.930 
them into position but we're then going
to<00:05:38.260> just<00:05:38.560> adjust<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.100> port<00:05:39.520> rest<00:05:39.700> down

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
to just adjust that port rest down

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.330 
to just adjust that port rest down
because<00:05:40.900> we're<00:05:41.110> a<00:05:41.140> much<00:05:41.410> bigger<00:05:41.680> child<00:05:42.070> now

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
because we're a much bigger child now

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.250 
because we're a much bigger child now
and<00:05:42.370> we<00:05:42.640> can<00:05:42.820> now<00:05:43.030> sit<00:05:43.360> against<00:05:43.630> the<00:05:43.780> table<00:05:43.990> if

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
and we can now sit against the table if

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.440
