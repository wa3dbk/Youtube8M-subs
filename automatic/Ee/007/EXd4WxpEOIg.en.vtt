however<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.999> battery<00:00:57.480> life<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:58.050> still<00:00:58.319> the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
however the battery life is still the

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.559 
however the battery life is still the
same<00:00:58.710> at<00:00:58.920> 10<00:00:59.309> hours<00:00:59.609> which<00:00:59.819> is<00:00:59.969> still<00:01:00.239> pretty

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
same at 10 hours which is still pretty

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:03.439 
same at 10 hours which is still pretty
good<00:01:00.929> now<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.859> resolution<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.969> device<00:01:03.210> is

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
good now the resolution of the device is

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.090 
good now the resolution of the device is
still<00:01:03.659> the<00:01:03.749> same<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.440> said<00:01:04.500> graphics

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
still the same but like I said graphics

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.170 
still the same but like I said graphics
performance<00:01:05.280> supposed<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:05.940> 9<00:01:06.150> times

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
performance supposed to be 9 times

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.360 
performance supposed to be 9 times
better<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.200> device<00:01:07.410> will<00:01:07.560> also<00:01:07.920> come<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.160> an

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
better the device will also come with an

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.480 
better the device will also come with an
hdmi<00:01:08.490> output<00:01:09.480> capable<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.440> 1080p<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.280> you'll

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
hdmi output capable of 1080p but you'll

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.850
