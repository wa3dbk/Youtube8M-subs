out<00:01:11.200> of<00:01:11.259> the<00:01:11.440> chute<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.159> think<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.549> odds<00:01:12.729> were

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
out of the chute I think the odds were

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.219

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
talk about things like that he just kind

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.840

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
of put them on the back burner worked

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.760 
of put them on the back burner worked
around<00:01:25.300> them<00:01:25.659> I<00:01:25.869> think<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.200> just<00:01:26.350> makes<00:01:26.530> me<00:01:26.740> a
