I'm<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.640> sure<00:00:30.090> why<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.359> isn't<00:00:30.630> bothering<00:00:31.199> it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I'm not sure why it isn't bothering it

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.240 
I'm not sure why it isn't bothering it
at<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> moment<00:00:33.170> but<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.290> battery<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> fully

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
at the moment but the battery is fully

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.069 
at the moment but the battery is fully
submerged<00:00:36.649> through<00:00:37.649> submerging<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.610> water

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.830 

it's<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.140> quite<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.710> flat<00:00:44.010> surface<00:00:44.840> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's not quite on a flat surface it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's not quite on a flat surface it
doesn't<00:00:46.289> help<00:00:47.750> but<00:00:48.750> give<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> between<00:00:53.360> seven

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
doesn't help but give it between seven

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.099 
doesn't help but give it between seven
and<00:00:54.449> fourteen<00:00:55.050> days<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:55.820> with<00:00:56.820> I'm<00:00:57.480> not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
sure that sugar or salt in the bowl

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.619 
sure that sugar or salt in the bowl
because<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.590> isn't<00:01:01.710> labeled<00:01:02.359> it's<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.539> in

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
because it isn't labeled it's just in

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690 
because it isn't labeled it's just in
the<00:01:03.719> pot<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.559> bothering<00:01:04.769> at<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.400> I<00:01:05.430> -

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the pot it's not bothering at all so I -

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.179 
the pot it's not bothering at all so I -
means<00:01:06.119> there's<00:01:06.330> no<00:01:06.510> voltage<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> battery

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
means there's no voltage in the battery

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.510 
means there's no voltage in the battery
or<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.850> thought<00:01:09.150> sugar<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.189> I'm<00:01:11.430> gonna

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520
