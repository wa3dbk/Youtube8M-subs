is either to the left or to the right of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
is either to the left or to the right of
you<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.670> X<00:01:23.850> 41<00:01:24.240> lets<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> pinpoint<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.380> exact

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
you the X 41 lets you pinpoint the exact

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.969

that<00:01:45.270> make<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.810> much<00:01:45.960> better<00:01:46.020> than<00:01:46.259> the

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that make it so much better than the

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.639 
that make it so much better than the
original<00:01:46.799> X<00:01:46.950> 4<00:01:47.189> here's<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.149> quick<00:01:48.360> rundown<00:01:48.649> just

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
original X 4 here's a quick rundown just

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.039 
original X 4 here's a quick rundown just
like<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.920> X<00:01:50.040> 4<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.579> X<00:01:50.729> 41<00:01:51.090> has<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.509> headset<00:01:51.990> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
like the X 4 the X 41 has a headset and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.170 
like the X 4 the X 41 has a headset and
transmitter<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.220> colors<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.700> been<00:01:53.729> changed

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
transmitter the colors have been changed

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.639 
transmitter the colors have been changed
so<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.420> easy<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.170> new<00:01:55.259> model

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
so it's easy to see it's a new model

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.160 
so it's easy to see it's a new model
also<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.060> velvet<00:01:57.360> ear<00:01:57.540> cushions<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:58.049> been
