00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.920 
may be in there from the use of products
you<00:05:02.440> know<00:05:02.560> I<00:05:02.830> realized<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.790> most<00:05:04.660> of<00:05:04.840> the

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
you know I realized that most of the

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.040 
you know I realized that most of the
products<00:05:05.320> was<00:05:05.890> closer<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.240> end<00:05:07.480> and

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
products was closer to the end and

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.720 
products was closer to the end and
really<00:05:08.890> that's<00:05:09.130> from<00:05:10.770> when<00:05:11.770> I<00:05:11.800> had<00:05:12.040> started<00:05:12.580> to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
really that's from when I had started to

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.120 
really that's from when I had started to
like<00:05:12.880> my<00:05:13.000> hair<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.240> I<00:05:13.300> was<00:05:13.510> using<00:05:14.500> products<00:05:14.980> oh

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
like my hair and I was using products oh

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.460 
like my hair and I was using products oh
I<00:05:15.520> forgot<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.090> mention<00:05:16.210> I'm<00:05:16.690> how<00:05:17.020> often<00:05:17.320> do<00:05:17.440> I

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
I forgot to mention I'm how often do I

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.240 
I forgot to mention I'm how often do I
reach<00:05:17.830> as<00:05:18.040> many<00:05:18.250> Lux<00:05:19.890> every<00:05:20.890> three<00:05:21.070> months

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
reach as many Lux every three months

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.280 
reach as many Lux every three months
about<00:05:21.490> every<00:05:21.850> three<00:05:22.060> months<00:05:22.270> but<00:05:22.450> I<00:05:22.570> do<00:05:22.720> think

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
about every three months but I do think

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.920 
about every three months but I do think
that<00:05:23.820> there<00:05:24.820> are<00:05:24.850> some<00:05:25.060> areas<00:05:25.240> that<00:05:25.450> I<00:05:25.570> have<00:05:25.600> to

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
that there are some areas that I have to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.610 
that there are some areas that I have to
start<00:05:26.230> paying<00:05:26.530> close<00:05:27.100> attention<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.760> it's<00:05:28.620> the

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
start paying close attention to it's the

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.090 
start paying close attention to it's the
hairline<00:05:30.360> front<00:05:31.360> and<00:05:31.630> back<00:05:31.900> for<00:05:32.410> those<00:05:32.560> errors

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
hairline front and back for those errors

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.160 
hairline front and back for those errors
I'm<00:05:33.460> tend<00:05:33.760> to<00:05:33.880> unravel<00:05:34.030> very<00:05:34.480> easily<00:05:34.720> because

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170 
I'm tend to unravel very easily because

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.710 
I'm tend to unravel very easily because
of<00:05:35.290> hair<00:05:35.410> texture<00:05:35.890> in<00:05:36.790> those<00:05:37.030> areas<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.480> little

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
of hair texture in those areas a little

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.740 
of hair texture in those areas a little
bit<00:05:37.840> softer<00:05:38.200> than<00:05:38.320> the<00:05:38.440> rest<00:05:38.620> of<00:05:38.770> my<00:05:39.040> man

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
bit softer than the rest of my man

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.490 
bit softer than the rest of my man
so<00:05:40.700> you<00:05:41.700> know<00:05:41.820> normally<00:05:42.780> when<00:05:42.900> those<00:05:43.170> areas

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
so you know normally when those areas

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.560 
so you know normally when those areas
come<00:05:43.650> in<00:05:43.770> contact<00:05:43.950> with<00:05:44.190> water<00:05:44.570> everything

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
come in contact with water everything

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.310 
come in contact with water everything
seems<00:05:46.290> to<00:05:46.410> become<00:05:46.620> undone<00:05:47.520> so<00:05:47.930> usually<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:48.960> just

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
seems to become undone so usually I just

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.230 
seems to become undone so usually I just
try<00:05:49.620> to<00:05:49.650> make<00:05:49.980> sure<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.250> those<00:05:50.430> areas<00:05:50.730> remain

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
try to make sure that those areas remain

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.160 
try to make sure that those areas remain
twisted<00:05:51.750> but<00:05:52.170> yeah<00:05:52.700> that's<00:05:53.700> it<00:05:54.000> that's<00:05:54.360> the

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
twisted but yeah that's it that's the

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.400 
twisted but yeah that's it that's the
