this<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.049> K<00:00:04.230> MDS<00:00:04.950> 250<00:00:06.859> it's<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> 250<00:00:08.370> cc<00:00:08.400> quad

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
this is the K MDS 250 it's a 250 cc quad

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
this is the K MDS 250 it's a 250 cc quad
fully<00:00:10.290> automatic<00:00:12.650> doesn't<00:00:13.650> take<00:00:13.769> much<00:00:14.030> much

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
fully automatic doesn't take much much

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.929 
fully automatic doesn't take much much
skill<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.480> use<00:00:15.509> but<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.410> pretty<00:00:17.279> decent<00:00:17.580> quad

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:28.339 

it's<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:21.590> chain<00:00:22.590> driven<00:00:26.570> got<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.779> brakes<00:00:28.140> all

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it's a chain driven got this brakes all

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.810 
it's a chain driven got this brakes all
around<00:00:28.380> pretty<00:00:29.340> cool

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.549 

just<00:00:37.510> an<00:00:37.600> all-around<00:00:37.840> good<00:00:38.140> quad<00:00:40.350> things<00:00:41.350> that

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
just an all-around good quad things that

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.200 
just an all-around good quad things that
don't<00:00:41.710> really<00:00:41.890> like<00:00:42.130> about<00:00:42.309> it<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.970> seat

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
don't really like about it is the seat

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.780 
don't really like about it is the seat
height<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.540> little<00:00:43.660> bit<00:00:44.079> too<00:00:44.650> high<00:00:44.830> it<00:00:45.160> has<00:00:45.760> a

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
height is a little bit too high it has a

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.210 
height is a little bit too high it has a
very<00:00:46.210> high<00:00:46.360> center<00:00:46.690> of<00:00:46.720> gravity<00:00:46.840> so<00:00:47.260> you're

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220 
very high center of gravity so you're

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.160 
very high center of gravity so you're
taking<00:00:48.370> turns<00:00:48.760> pretty<00:00:49.059> pretty<00:00:49.690> sharp<00:00:49.989> you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
taking turns pretty pretty sharp you

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.950 
taking turns pretty pretty sharp you
definitely<00:00:50.620> have<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:51.030> kind<00:00:52.030> of<00:00:52.090> lean<00:00:52.360> really

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
definitely have to kind of lean really

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.600 
definitely have to kind of lean really
far<00:00:53.350> into<00:00:53.530> it<00:00:56.040> doesn't<00:00:57.040> have<00:00:57.129> as<00:00:57.220> much<00:00:57.309> power

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
far into it doesn't have as much power

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.420 
far into it doesn't have as much power
as<00:00:57.970> I<00:00:58.180> would<00:00:58.330> like<00:00:58.510> but<00:00:59.080> it<00:00:59.739> is<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.949> very<00:01:00.220> heavy

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
as I would like but it is a very heavy

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
as I would like but it is a very heavy

this<00:01:51.490> particular<00:01:52.000> quad<00:01:52.710> has<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:56.229> about

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
this particular quad has probably about

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.859 
this particular quad has probably about
thirty<00:01:56.740> hours<00:01:56.860> on<00:01:57.430> it<00:01:57.700> not<00:01:58.450> really<00:01:58.600> ridden

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
thirty hours on it not really ridden

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.719 
thirty hours on it not really ridden
that<00:01:59.079> much<00:01:59.670> the<00:02:00.670> main<00:02:02.340> problem<00:02:03.340> with<00:02:03.369> this

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
that much the main problem with this

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.480 
that much the main problem with this
quad<00:02:04.000> is<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.530> radiator<00:02:05.979> sits<00:02:06.310> right

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
quad is that the radiator sits right

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.780 
quad is that the radiator sits right
behind<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.909> bumper<00:02:07.270> right<00:02:07.299> there<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:09.610> you

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
behind the bumper right there and if you

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.120 
behind the bumper right there and if you
hit<00:02:10.179> something<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.959> bumper<00:02:11.350> will<00:02:11.470> smash<00:02:11.829> in

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
hit something this bumper will smash in

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.900 
hit something this bumper will smash in
and<00:02:12.519> smash<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.239> radiator<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.670> it'll<00:02:15.670> put<00:02:15.820> you

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
and smash the radiator and it'll put you

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.210 
and smash the radiator and it'll put you
out<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.060> business<00:02:16.150> for<00:02:16.799> for<00:02:17.799> a<00:02:17.829> little<00:02:18.040> while

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
out of business for for a little while

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.120 
out of business for for a little while
so<00:02:19.209> you<00:02:19.299> get<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.480> new<00:02:19.600> radiator<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.739> actually

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
so you get a new radiator so actually

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.080 
so you get a new radiator so actually
that's<00:02:21.250> one<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.489> reasons<00:02:21.730> why<00:02:21.820> hasn't

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
that's one of the reasons why hasn't

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
that's one of the reasons why hasn't
been<00:02:22.209> ridden<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:22.570> much<00:02:22.769> about<00:02:24.989> three<00:02:25.989> or

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
been ridden that much about three or

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.170 
been ridden that much about three or
four<00:02:26.320> years<00:02:26.350> ago<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.100> crashed<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.880> that

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
four years ago this was crashed and that

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.069 
four years ago this was crashed and that
exact<00:02:28.750> thing<00:02:28.959> happened<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:30.180> it<00:02:31.180> uh<00:02:31.209> kind<00:02:31.959> of

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079 
exact thing happened and it uh kind of

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.170 
exact thing happened and it uh kind of
sat<00:02:32.260> around<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.739> finally<00:02:33.700> put<00:02:33.970> it<00:02:34.060> back

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
sat around and finally put it back

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.900 
sat around and finally put it back
together<00:02:34.329> recently<00:02:35.110> so<00:02:35.579> just<00:02:36.579> figured<00:02:36.820> I'd

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
together recently so just figured I'd

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.850 
together recently so just figured I'd
