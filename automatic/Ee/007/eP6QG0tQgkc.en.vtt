00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.720
 No 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.779
 we play in the abe lenstra stadium 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.790
 becomes the Frisian national anthem and so too 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.610
 Friday at the women 's competition 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.220
 van heerenveen and the women of ajax 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.840
 an important duel for third place 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.269
 ran behind the standard hatch in the legs 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.239
 and fc twente and ajax what to the point 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.129
 enough to be the number four Heerenveen 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.050
 to keep behind but here 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.360
 heerenveen the first chance for vivianne 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.699
 miedema to score in the bene league with 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.519
 no less than 37 knols 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.350
 and the first corner for heerenveen 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.320
 mountains stood rue Barschot for 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.500
 feet of her isa burgman and one 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.990
 beautiful opening goal the one 0 for 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.510
 heerenveen 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.200
 and the party with the supporters in it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.050
 abe lenstrastadion is a good pornobob 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.090
 but completely lost burgwal 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:13.960
 0, and then the one with the beautiful foil on 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:16.240
 new corner for the feet of miedema 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.160
 minimal equipment 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.570
 human being claimed but not before 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.330
 whistled 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.460
 then Claudia cleans the holy mountain 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.880
 is reduced then the weeks 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.610
 at sisca folkertsma now again the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.260
 good rescue for your box 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.600
 you have to perform in the first minutes 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.130
 of this ajax match must be the game 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.540
 to make 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.540
 heerenveen lurks a bit more on the counter 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.650
 here claudia from the holy mountain with a 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.880
 beautiful ball on desiree van 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.400
 lunging 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.780
 this evolve scores it is the first 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.300
 Great opportunity for her is in this 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 match in the 35th minute but it is 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.560
 hit right away 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.600
 beautiful cross from claudia van den 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.800
 heiligenberg and coolly finished 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.800
 by desiree van lunteren 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.990
 Ubachs here lunteren in 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.540
 defense sends away becomes 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.220
 detained but allowed to continue 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.460
 then ball does not indicate baking mandy 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.860
 Versteegt takes the ball'm not great 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.660
 always steal but she writes this 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.870
 ball beside 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.110
 huge opportunity just before the break but the toe 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.050
 from newport to it is a one 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.060
 rest position itself also Riemer van der Velde 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.940
 here flat and rest miedema 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.820
 harassed by Petra Hogewoning 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.180
 hence the striker ball in hands 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.180
 your box 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.080
 he slept baker does she did the 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.660
 burg role but there is mandy alleys 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.550
 against the pole again and that 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.380
 the rebound likes to be in the lead 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:02.450
 for ajax 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.450
 mandy increases ten minutes after rest 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.269
 she just before halftime with a view 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.940
 nicole to fog it is now hit 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.940
 through the post and then the lead 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.900
 you again a nice picture of kelly 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.080
 sailor in fixed at eshly baker and drag 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.260
 baker needs that until time 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.129
 tinkering as this is a great opportunity 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.530
 forget baker 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.269
 he put the game in the slot 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.329
 looks every time 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.129
 that another hot final phase is coming 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.110
 here with the long ball extended to 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:38.299
 miedema no offside because suzanne 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.209
 but reading is upside down 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:44.810
 below for where you have certain minima 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.370
 also lost sharp and then takes tree away 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.469
 just before the line of the saint 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.230
 mountain 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.459
 and so cool there is well gone and has 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.920
 miedema goal yet 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.349
 today then there is the last minute 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.359
 of the match the ball comes for the 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.310
 feet of folkertsma 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.569
 against the bar but then in a guide 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.280
 herbs and them 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.290
 scores in the very last minute 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.900
 equalizer 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.329
 filter where it has a ball on the 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.239
 bar and then slide is on the right 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:19.039
 place and so ends the duel in 2 2 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.840
 ice in the last minute victory 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.669
 away but it is third in the leg 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.259
 league and so live mixed 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.759
 feelings 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:27.320
 now in the dressing room when I go to the 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.000
 players look over you first especially the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.400
 disappointment is that it is in itself 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.110
 on the other hand I have a good one 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.820
 during a draw through the draw 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.860
 you are certainly fourth in third place and that 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.509
 is what we ultimately have to go 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.699
 have worked so that is also one 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.080
 compliment the group so that 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.280
 have done it 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.780
 yes I suspect I say what it is about 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.950
 lies why when we won but 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.690
 guess the last 10 minutes 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.320
 actually were guests you should 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.700
 actually 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.980
 good game play that we have 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.410
 I think renounced or she would give him three 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.430
 to make one we must say what lies 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.830
 perhaps the biggest paths there 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.290
 you two don't stand a big chance 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.380
 yes i think too much nsp 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.010
 easier and without printing 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.720
 largely dominate where you 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.550
 competitions and we are in the last 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.200
 few flavors did not diminish that and then 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:12.300
 get him very unhappy 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.210
 so we just have to go for it 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.620
 do more to score and yes that is 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.240
 actually important with that you win 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.500
 ultimately matches and that is not 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.480
 the first time 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.720
 so you watch our psv competitions 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.980
 from a good standard light at home that 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.140
 are all competitions in which we do it 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.250
 just be able to decide for yourself only then 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.130
 it takes too long 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.480
 and then we are just not clever 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.860
 enough or there are decisive here 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.690
 enough for duel 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.950
 yes and of course you can now 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.140
 to go get put defense 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.400
 yes you are not defending well but 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.340
 maybe you should just do it earlier 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:46.050
 quickly just for that is the 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.280
 steps you have to make to next 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.540
 not to be bothered for years but really with 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.479
 those first two until the end of it 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.880
 to compete seasonally like us 

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.530
 just keep saying what we are doing 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.720
 and we anticipate the opportunities we have 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.000
 get off yes then you stand a lot higher 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.070
 who is only in our second year and we 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.840
 are still growing and we 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.600
 took a long time to get to the top spots 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.280
 competed unfortunately we are therefore 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.870
 dropped out of it before 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.520
 said third place the objective 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.660
 so nice that we achieved that and we 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.660
 can of course still take the prize
