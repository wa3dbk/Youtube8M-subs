00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
the all the letters were see-through it

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.490 
the all the letters were see-through it
would<00:01:42.530> by<00:01:43.280> its<00:01:43.310> actually<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.119> white<00:01:44.900> paint<00:01:45.260> on

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
would by its actually a white paint on

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.740 
would by its actually a white paint on
black<00:01:46.420> so<00:01:48.100> that's<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.400> thing<00:01:49.610> let<00:01:50.540> me<00:01:50.600> just
