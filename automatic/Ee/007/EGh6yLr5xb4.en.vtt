00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:06.639 
attack followed by the expansion but um

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:09.159 
attack followed by the expansion but um
he<00:04:07.639> just<00:04:07.669> pulled<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.599> know<00:04:08.689> didn't<00:04:08.989> do<00:04:09.049> as

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
he just pulled you know didn't do as

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:10.659 
he just pulled you know didn't do as
much<00:04:09.409> damage<00:04:09.439> remember<00:04:10.159> with<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.489> six

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
Marines because he was a little

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.740 
Marines because he was a little
overzealous<00:04:12.349> he<00:04:12.799> went<00:04:12.979> in<00:04:13.039> too<00:04:13.250> far<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.759> that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
overzealous he went in too far and that

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.199 
overzealous he went in too far and that
didn't<00:04:14.930> help<00:04:15.019> him<00:04:15.310> Moss<00:04:16.310> is<00:04:16.549> early<00:04:16.820> attack

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
didn't help him Moss is early attack

didn't help him Moss is early attack
force<00:04:17.509> there<00:04:17.719> that's<00:04:18.259> pretty<00:04:18.469> important

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
force there that's pretty important

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.589 
force there that's pretty important
because<00:04:19.130> if<00:04:19.579> you<00:04:19.669> kept<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.030> live<00:04:20.269> he<00:04:20.419> could

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
because if you kept that live he could

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:22.450 
because if you kept that live he could
have<00:04:20.690> reinforced<00:04:21.169> the<00:04:21.229> tank<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:22.159> Marines

have reinforced the tank and the Marines

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.010 
have reinforced the tank and the Marines
and<00:04:22.669> then<00:04:22.789> maybe<00:04:23.120> even<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.389> stronger<00:04:23.779> push

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
and then maybe even a stronger push

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.660 
and then maybe even a stronger push
maybe<00:04:24.229> actually<00:04:24.590> done<00:04:24.770> some<00:04:24.979> real<00:04:25.130> damage

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
maybe actually done some real damage

annoy those probes so to get out of the
way<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.370> don't<00:05:01.670> even<00:05:01.730> know<00:05:01.850> what<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.060> was<00:05:02.300> for

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
way I don't even know what that was for

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.470 
way I don't even know what that was for
but<00:05:03.530> flash<00:05:03.770> right<00:05:04.010> now<00:05:04.160> is<00:05:04.400> gonna<00:05:04.880> expand<00:05:05.270> as

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
but flash right now is gonna expand as

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.080 
but flash right now is gonna expand as
expected<00:05:05.990> now<00:05:06.170> is<00:05:06.320> El<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.650> out<00:05:06.800> flash'<00:05:07.460> has<00:05:07.940> to

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
expected now is El it out flash' has to

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.690 
expected now is El it out flash' has to
run<00:05:08.330> in<00:05:08.840> the<00:05:08.960> face<00:05:09.140> of<00:05:09.170> it<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.620> you<00:05:10.550> know<00:05:10.580> it

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
run in the face of it and you know it

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.310 
run in the face of it and you know it
seems<00:05:11.150> like<00:05:11.240> more<00:05:11.600> or<00:05:11.720> less<00:05:11.870> shuttle<00:05:12.200> has

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
seems like more or less shuttle has

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.840 
seems like more or less shuttle has
gotten<00:05:12.590> away<00:05:12.680> so<00:05:12.830> far<00:05:13.250> with<00:05:13.490> his<00:05:13.640> vast

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
gotten away so far with his vast

expanses flash has not gone for any kind
of<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.420> fast<00:05:17.840> rush<00:05:18.140> attack<00:05:18.470> he's<00:05:18.860> not<00:05:19.100> gonna<00:05:19.220> be

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
of a fast rush attack he's not gonna be

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.000 
of a fast rush attack he's not gonna be

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.010 
able to do any damage and this is going

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:24.670 
able to do any damage and this is going
to<00:05:22.070> play<00:05:22.310> well<00:05:22.700> for<00:05:22.940> a<00:05:23.150> shuttle<00:05:23.450> but<00:05:24.290> flash<00:05:24.500> by

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
to play well for a shuttle but flash by

to play well for a shuttle but flash by
double<00:05:24.980> expand<00:05:25.250> himself<00:05:25.730> and<00:05:25.970> if<00:05:26.570> shuttle

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
double expand himself and if shuttle

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.720 
double expand himself and if shuttle
continues<00:05:27.380> to<00:05:27.440> play<00:05:27.560> expansion<00:05:28.070> game<00:05:28.160> I<00:05:28.430> don't

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
continues to play expansion game I don't

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.520 
continues to play expansion game I don't
know<00:05:28.790> it<00:05:29.630> seems<00:05:29.660> that<00:05:29.960> he's<00:05:30.080> very<00:05:30.170> good<00:05:30.500> with

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
know it seems that he's very good with

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.560 
know it seems that he's very good with
arbiters<00:05:30.950> but<00:05:31.220> uh<00:05:31.250> otherwise<00:05:31.970> I<00:05:32.030> don't<00:05:32.390> think

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
arbiters but uh otherwise I don't think

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.210 
arbiters but uh otherwise I don't think
his<00:05:32.660> play<00:05:32.870> was<00:05:32.990> absolutely<00:05:33.470> fantastic<00:05:33.620> last

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
his play was absolutely fantastic last

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.970 
his play was absolutely fantastic last
game<00:05:34.460> Oh<00:05:34.630> what<00:05:35.630> is<00:05:35.750> he<00:05:35.900> doing<00:05:36.230> ok<00:05:36.650> he's<00:05:36.770> running

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:36.980 
game Oh what is he doing ok he's running

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.490

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
away from the one vulture they're not

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.250 
away from the one vulture they're not
managing<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.160> kill<00:05:40.640> any<00:05:40.820> probes<00:05:41.780> their<00:05:41.990> flash

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.260 
managing to kill any probes their flash

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.340 
managing to kill any probes their flash
is<00:05:42.440> not<00:05:42.680> able<00:05:42.860> to<00:05:43.160> so<00:05:43.430> nice<00:05:43.790> work<00:05:44.000> by<00:05:44.840> shuttle

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:45.350 
is not able to so nice work by shuttle

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.270 
is not able to so nice work by shuttle
and<00:05:46.240> flash<00:05:47.240> now<00:05:47.570> with<00:05:48.380> expansion<00:05:48.500> almost<00:05:49.070> done

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
and flash now with expansion almost done

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.340 
and flash now with expansion almost done
I<00:05:49.460> think<00:05:49.910> really<00:05:50.150> uh<00:05:50.270> oh<00:05:50.690> there<00:05:51.230> we<00:05:51.320> go

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
I think really uh oh there we go

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.320 
I think really uh oh there we go
starport<00:05:52.070> going<00:05:52.400> up<00:05:52.550> for<00:05:52.760> flash<00:05:52.970> he's<00:05:53.210> gonna

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
starport going up for flash he's gonna

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.700 
starport going up for flash he's gonna
try<00:05:53.540> to<00:05:53.600> get<00:05:53.720> a<00:05:53.780> little<00:05:53.840> more<00:05:54.080> creative<00:05:54.410> this

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
try to get a little more creative this

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.230 
try to get a little more creative this
game<00:05:54.890> I<00:05:54.920> think<00:05:55.130> it's<00:05:55.250> a<00:05:55.280> smart<00:05:55.400> move<00:05:55.610> actually

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
game I think it's a smart move actually

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.570 
game I think it's a smart move actually
because<00:05:56.780> last<00:05:56.960> game<00:05:57.200> it<00:05:57.350> showed<00:05:57.680> that<00:05:57.710> I<00:05:58.190> think

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
because last game it showed that I think

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.060 
because last game it showed that I think
flash-based<00:05:59.200> learned<00:06:00.200> that<00:06:00.440> shuttle<00:06:00.860> can

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
flash-based learned that shuttle can

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.920 
flash-based learned that shuttle can
play<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.370> longer<00:06:01.910> game<00:06:02.060> you<00:06:02.330> know<00:06:02.420> despite<00:06:02.690> what

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
play a longer game you know despite what

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:04.270 
play a longer game you know despite what
I<00:06:02.960> have<00:06:03.080> a<00:06:03.110> saved<00:06:03.410> before<00:06:03.500> you<00:06:04.040> know<00:06:04.130> obviously

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 
I have a saved before you know obviously

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.340 
I have a saved before you know obviously
he<00:06:04.670> was<00:06:04.970> capable<00:06:05.180> winning<00:06:05.630> a<00:06:05.720> long<00:06:05.900> game<00:06:06.140> with

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
he was capable winning a long game with

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.050 
he was capable winning a long game with
his<00:06:06.470> arbiter<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.130> he's<00:06:07.580> certainly<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:07.970> threat

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
his arbiter so he's certainly a threat

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.810 
his arbiter so he's certainly a threat
and<00:06:08.570> flash<00:06:08.810> is<00:06:09.020> gonna<00:06:09.170> try<00:06:09.380> to<00:06:09.440> you<00:06:10.160> know<00:06:10.190> test

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
and flash is gonna try to you know test

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.060 
and flash is gonna try to you know test
out<00:06:10.970> his<00:06:11.000> micro<00:06:11.600> a<00:06:11.630> little<00:06:11.900> bit<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.770> he<00:06:12.920> might

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
out his micro a little bit and he might

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.700 
out his micro a little bit and he might
find<00:06:13.310> himself<00:06:13.340> lacking<00:06:14.110> in<00:06:15.110> last<00:06:15.470> game<00:06:15.680> I

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
find himself lacking in last game I

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.760 
find himself lacking in last game I
think<00:06:15.860> he<00:06:16.220> made<00:06:16.370> a<00:06:16.400> couple<00:06:16.610> strategic<00:06:17.150> errors

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
think he made a couple strategic errors

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.680 
think he made a couple strategic errors
shuttle<00:06:18.770> did<00:06:18.950> also<00:06:19.430> I<00:06:19.460> mean<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:20.210> expansion

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:20.690 
shuttle did also I mean that expansion

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.210 
shuttle did also I mean that expansion
was<00:06:20.960> so<00:06:21.110> hard<00:06:21.320> to<00:06:21.350> hold<00:06:21.530> I<00:06:21.710> mean<00:06:21.860> putting<00:06:22.130> those

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
was so hard to hold I mean putting those

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.760 
was so hard to hold I mean putting those
cannons<00:06:22.610> up<00:06:22.760> working<00:06:23.150> too<00:06:23.270> much<00:06:23.420> um<00:06:23.810> so<00:06:24.710> you

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:24.770 
cannons up working too much um so you

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.190 
cannons up working too much um so you
know<00:06:25.360> you<00:06:26.360> know<00:06:26.480> it's<00:06:26.660> hard<00:06:26.840> it's<00:06:27.110> hard

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
know you know it's hard it's hard

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.540 
know you know it's hard it's hard
because<00:06:27.500> it<00:06:27.890> was<00:06:28.010> so<00:06:28.190> good<00:06:28.340> with<00:06:28.490> this

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
because it was so good with this

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.160 
because it was so good with this
arbiters<00:06:28.970> but<00:06:29.150> yeah<00:06:29.240> he<00:06:29.390> will<00:06:29.510> really<00:06:29.690> didn't

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.170 
arbiters but yeah he will really didn't

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.110 
arbiters but yeah he will really didn't
mention<00:06:30.530> do<00:06:30.650> anything<00:06:31.070> and<00:06:31.370> let<00:06:31.520> himself<00:06:31.700> get

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
mention do anything and let himself get

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.470 
mention do anything and let himself get
contained<00:06:32.690> for<00:06:32.870> example<00:06:33.200> early<00:06:33.440> on<00:06:33.620> so<00:06:34.610> um<00:06:34.910> you

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.480 
contained for example early on so um you

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.910 
contained for example early on so um you
know<00:06:35.600> if<00:06:35.780> flash<00:06:36.020> managers<00:06:36.410> get<00:06:36.530> an<00:06:36.620> earlier

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
know if flash managers get an earlier

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.220 
know if flash managers get an earlier
attack<00:06:37.190> off<00:06:37.400> before<00:06:38.330> those<00:06:38.420> magic<00:06:38.840> units<00:06:39.110> are

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:39.230
