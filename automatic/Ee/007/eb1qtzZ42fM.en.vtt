00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.900
 well for a hundred as he was explaining for the hour kilometers what we're going to 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.740
 do 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.509
 is to use 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.959
 a program that tells us 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.959
 what is the value of the kilometers that we have to put 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.829
 percent 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:16.960
 My car 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.169
 at this moment it has 140 thousand 38 kilometers 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.669
 so 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.640
 we choose bmv 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.099
 3 xx 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.309
 put soon m 35 0 dt 80 of the years 2001 2002 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.750
 touch here we put the value 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 one hundred 40 thousand 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.250
 30 and 8 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.860
 and we give you to calculate 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.460
 You can put us 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.460
 we have to put him 1 1 1 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.580
 Well, let's go to the program 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.030
 and here we change 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.150
 and we put 1 1 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.140
 1 8 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.310
 one to one one 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 bochum 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.340
 we confuse itunes the portals 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.500
 1 8 1 1 min 8 1 1 1 8 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.770
 it's not time to see you again soon 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 we will call you 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.010
 ee 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.610
 in the three 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.870
 when one 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.479
 English 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.400
 modify it 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.400
 it's my chassis world 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.070
 i the 550 thousand 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.530
 0 38 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.650
 lupus 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.910
 point min 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.300
 we must address 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.860
 and now simply 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 we click min program 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 we want to program we say yes 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.709
 then they start scheduling 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.689
 at 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.689
 picture 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.009
 and to check that it's okay what we're going to do next is verify that 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:31.329
 information 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.809
 he says yes in all that now we click 

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:37.809
 in verifying 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:39.819
 he can not 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 ap has just given us four rounds 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.919
 in the time 1 200 euros 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:50.309
 d 102 305 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.429
 So what we are going to do is 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.129
 pass an erasure 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.349
 I will go and Saturday 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.349
 we say yes 

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:10.779
 He has told us right and then we can schedule it 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.579
 we give or schedule 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.579
 we say yes 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:22.179
 we care 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.729
 bouza correct i do as always the verification 

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.939
 and now yes the verification is not correct then with this we have 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.209
 finished what is changed the chassis name the kilometers to the box 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.129
 in the next video habit as ascer the change of the bunnies who 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.889
 with him in this semester 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.179
 at this time we can proceed to close the box leave it normal
