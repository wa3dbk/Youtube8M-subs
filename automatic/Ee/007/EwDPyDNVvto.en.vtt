that's weird okay me try again region
add<00:01:53.850> owner<00:01:56.360> test

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
add owner test

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.490 
add owner test
one<00:01:59.250> two<00:01:59.369> three<00:01:59.580> three<00:01:59.900> four<00:02:00.900> five<00:02:01.229> six<00:02:01.350> seven

one two three three four five six seven

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.499 
one two three three four five six seven
eight<00:02:01.680> nine<00:02:01.890> ten<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:03.680> intermediate<00:02:05.479> okay<00:02:06.479> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
eight nine ten then intermediate okay I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.100 
eight nine ten then intermediate okay I
guess<00:02:06.720> so<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.680> we<00:02:07.770> check<00:02:07.920> our<00:02:08.220> region<00:02:08.580> info

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
guess so if we check our region info

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990 
guess so if we check our region info
then<00:02:10.110> test<00:02:10.649> one<00:02:11.340> two<00:02:11.459> three<00:02:11.610> four<00:02:11.760> five<00:02:11.880> six

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
then test one two three four five six

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.420 
then test one two three four five six
seven<00:02:12.150> eight<00:02:12.360> nine<00:02:12.739> it's<00:02:13.739> gonna<00:02:13.860> say<00:02:14.040> owners

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
seven eight nine it's gonna say owners

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.580
