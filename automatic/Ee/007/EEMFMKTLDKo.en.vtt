I'm<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.330> doing<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.020> well<00:00:22.050> at<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> beginning

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
I'm not doing so well at the beginning

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
I'm not doing so well at the beginning
of<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.769> match<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.490> tell<00:00:23.670> kazuya's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
of this match as you can tell kazuya's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.750 
of this match as you can tell kazuya's
down<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.510> nearly<00:00:24.689> ten<00:00:24.960> percent<00:00:25.289> health<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.760> I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
down to nearly ten percent health and I

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.220 
down to nearly ten percent health and I
might<00:00:26.939> need<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> find<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> raw<00:00:27.480> tagpoint<00:00:27.779> year

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
might need to find a raw tagpoint year

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.529 
might need to find a raw tagpoint year
ok<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:29.070> was<00:00:29.099> pretty<00:00:29.340> good<00:00:29.609> it<00:00:29.820> gave<00:00:30.179> Hugo

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
ok so that was pretty good it gave Hugo

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
ok so that was pretty good it gave Hugo
a<00:00:30.570> moment<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.410> just<00:00:31.679> off<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.399> sonic

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
a moment to get in just off one sonic

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.240 
a moment to get in just off one sonic
boom<00:00:33.480> which<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.870> barely<00:00:34.290> any<00:00:34.590> damage<00:00:34.980> against

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
boom which was barely any damage against

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.520 
boom which was barely any damage against
the<00:00:35.370> caracal<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.140> but<00:00:37.140> as<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.380> can

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the caracal like you go but as you can

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.080 
the caracal like you go but as you can
tell<00:00:37.590> guile<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> definitely<00:00:38.760> playing<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
tell guile is definitely playing the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.780 
tell guile is definitely playing the
keep<00:00:39.270> away<00:00:39.510> game<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.260> extent<00:00:40.770> um<00:00:41.010> there's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
keep away game to the extent um there's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
keep away game to the extent um there's
a<00:00:41.879> lot<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.120> keep-away<00:00:42.450> teams<00:00:42.840> that<00:00:43.170> you'll<00:00:43.350> run

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a lot of keep-away teams that you'll run

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110 
a lot of keep-away teams that you'll run
into<00:00:43.500> Xbox<00:00:44.040> Live<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.460> especially<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.940> ranked

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
into Xbox Live and especially in ranked

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.940 
into Xbox Live and especially in ranked
games<00:00:45.329> right<00:00:45.539> now<00:00:45.570> you'd<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.350> surprised<00:00:46.770> how

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
games right now you'd be surprised how

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.440 
games right now you'd be surprised how
many<00:00:47.100> people<00:00:47.370> just<00:00:47.730> take<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> damage<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
many people just take the damage and

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
many people just take the damage and
then<00:00:48.600> run<00:00:48.840> away<00:00:48.870> for<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> duration<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
then run away for the duration of the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.860 
then run away for the duration of the
match<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.000> really<00:00:51.329> what's<00:00:51.480> happening

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
match and that's really what's happening

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
match and that's really what's happening
right<00:00:51.899> now<00:00:52.050> guile<00:00:52.800> actually<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.879> were

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
right now guile actually we were

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.970 
right now guile actually we were
thinking<00:00:54.180> was<00:00:54.750> going<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:54.989> suffer<00:00:55.379> pretty<00:00:55.620> hard

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
thinking was going to suffer pretty hard

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.369 
thinking was going to suffer pretty hard
in<00:00:56.190> street<00:00:56.370> fighter<00:00:56.550> cross<00:00:56.640> tekken<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.390> turns

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
in street fighter cross tekken but turns

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.470 
in street fighter cross tekken but turns
out<00:00:58.559> he's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.160> bad<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.640> all<00:00:59.760> if<00:01:00.000> he<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.239> build

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
out he's not bad at all if he can build

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
out he's not bad at all if he can build
the<00:01:00.600> meter<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.410> anti-air<00:01:02.160> supers<00:01:02.670> like

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the meter and do anti-air supers like

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.030 
the meter and do anti-air supers like
the<00:01:03.030> one<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.359> saw<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.860> round

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
the one you just saw and the first round

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
the one you just saw and the first round
is<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> family<00:01:06.330> man<00:01:06.479> keV<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
is going to go to family man keV that is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
is going to go to family man keV that is
using<00:01:07.740> guile<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.640> Vega<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:09.990> come

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
using guile and Vega so here we come

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.450 
using guile and Vega so here we come
with<00:01:10.290> round<00:01:10.500> two<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.950> gonna<00:01:11.070> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> find<00:01:11.400> a

with round two I'm gonna have to find a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.820 
with round two I'm gonna have to find a
way<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:11.850> past<00:01:12.150> his<00:01:12.450> offense<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> defense

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
way to make past his offense and defense

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.550 
way to make past his offense and defense
either<00:01:14.400> by<00:01:14.700> finding<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.659> good<00:01:15.869> jump<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.290> point

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
either by finding a good jump in point

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.429 
either by finding a good jump in point
or<00:01:16.770> using<00:01:17.250> miss<00:01:17.759> steps<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.540> but<00:01:18.900> there

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
or using miss steps to get in but there

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.649 
or using miss steps to get in but there
we<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:19.979> extended<00:01:20.549> using<00:01:21.240> kazuya's

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
we go using extended using kazuya's

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.870 
we go using extended using kazuya's

command grab characters they do a lot of
damage<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:04.079> some<00:02:04.259> pretty<00:02:04.469> cool<00:02:04.649> synergy

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100

it cleans house with those supers and

it cleans house with those supers and
really<00:02:11.039> beefy<00:02:11.340> come

but<00:02:12.370> once<00:02:12.519> again<00:02:12.640> I'm<00:02:12.909> in<00:02:12.939> that<00:02:13.209> little<00:02:13.540> bit<00:02:13.629> of

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
but once again I'm in that little bit of

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:15.059 
but once again I'm in that little bit of
a<00:02:13.780> mix-up<00:02:14.200> string<00:02:14.500> right<00:02:14.650> here<00:02:14.709> where<00:02:14.980> I'm

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
a mix-up string right here where I'm

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.339 
a mix-up string right here where I'm
trying<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.370> get<00:02:15.549> him<00:02:15.720> between<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:16.959> area

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
trying to get him between that area

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.839 
trying to get him between that area
where<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> can<00:02:17.709> go<00:02:17.799> for<00:02:17.980> an<00:02:18.069> overhead<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:18.489> a<00:02:18.670> low

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
where I can go for an overhead or a low

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.250 
where I can go for an overhead or a low
attack<00:02:19.180> but<00:02:19.390> I<00:02:19.420> tagging<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.840> writing<00:02:20.079> but<00:02:20.200> he

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
attack but I tagging to writing but he

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.410 
attack but I tagging to writing but he
sadly<00:02:20.530> misses<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.159> combo<00:02:21.489> in<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.700> corner<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
sadly misses the combo in the corner and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.149 
sadly misses the combo in the corner and
now<00:02:22.540> he's<00:02:22.689> on<00:02:22.870> the<00:02:23.049> approach<00:02:23.439> and<00:02:23.739> this<00:02:24.069> is

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
now he's on the approach and this is

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.890 
now he's on the approach and this is
going<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.340> be<00:02:24.430> difficult<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.030> oh<00:02:25.239> I<00:02:25.329> think

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
going to be difficult but oh I think

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.050 
going to be difficult but oh I think
that<00:02:26.049> was<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.590> was<00:02:26.650> very<00:02:26.860> very<00:02:27.010> bad<00:02:27.670> tactic

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
that was a that was very very bad tactic

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.640 
that was a that was very very bad tactic
on<00:02:28.150> my<00:02:28.299> part<00:02:28.569> I<00:02:28.689> brought<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.140> because<00:02:29.319> he<00:02:29.500> got

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
on my part I brought in because he got

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.170 
on my part I brought in because he got
the<00:02:29.769> worst<00:02:29.980> time<00:02:30.280> and<00:02:30.519> he<00:02:30.579> probably<00:02:30.790> could

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the worst time and he probably could

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.929 
the worst time and he probably could
have<00:02:31.209> finished<00:02:31.540> off<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:32.140> guile<00:02:32.379> as<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.739> result<00:02:33.489> I

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:33.939 
have finished off of guile as a result I

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:35.610 
have finished off of guile as a result I
can't<00:02:34.569> even<00:02:34.659> tell<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.019> what<00:02:35.109> i<00:02:35.170> was<00:02:35.349> thinking

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
can't even tell you what i was thinking

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.110 
can't even tell you what i was thinking
in<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:35.739> moment<00:02:35.859> but<00:02:36.609> now<00:02:36.730> we<00:02:36.790> got<00:02:36.970> another

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
in that moment but now we got another

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.429 
in that moment but now we got another
chance<00:02:37.359> of<00:02:37.540> really<00:02:37.689> good<00:02:37.870> damage<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.290> is

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
chance of really good damage this is

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.869 
chance of really good damage this is
about<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.739> most<00:02:38.980> damage<00:02:39.489> because<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.790> you

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
about the most damage because that you

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.759 
about the most damage because that you
can<00:02:40.060> do<00:02:40.150> with<00:02:40.180> one<00:02:40.510> meter<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:41.049> it<00:02:41.200> took<00:02:41.379> off<00:02:41.560> I

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
can do with one meter and it took off I

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.140 
can do with one meter and it took off I
think<00:02:41.980> about<00:02:42.159> fifty<00:02:42.430> percent<00:02:42.700> from<00:02:42.909> Vega

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
think about fifty percent from Vega

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.420 
think about fifty percent from Vega
pretty<00:02:43.930> good<00:02:44.109> stuff<00:02:44.319> lead<00:02:44.709> into<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> one<00:02:45.250> two

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
pretty good stuff lead into a one two

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.819 
pretty good stuff lead into a one two
and<00:02:45.700> then<00:02:45.849> one<00:02:45.879> two<00:02:46.209> three<00:02:46.540> chain<00:02:46.959> with<00:02:47.290> Kazuya

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
and then one two three chain with Kazuya

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.349 
and then one two three chain with Kazuya
and<00:02:48.040> Rennick<00:02:48.400> might<00:02:48.579> choose<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.790> tag<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.209> here

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
and Rennick might choose to tag in here

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.509 
and Rennick might choose to tag in here
no<00:02:49.510> he<00:02:49.690> doesn't<00:02:50.049> he's<00:02:50.859> falling<00:02:51.280> for<00:02:51.459> the

no he doesn't he's falling for the

no he doesn't he's falling for the

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
overhead combo that's the last hit of

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
another good set of games actually I

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.660

that<00:03:06.730> that<00:03:07.030> wasn't<00:03:07.209> actually<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> hit<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.139> was

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that that wasn't actually a hit it was

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.470

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.960 
and if you see what just happened right
there<00:06:29.240> I<00:06:29.419> went<00:06:29.570> for<00:06:29.750> an<00:06:29.840> overhead<00:06:30.320> and<00:06:30.850> cozy<00:06:31.850> is

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:31.970 
there I went for an overhead and cozy is

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.550 
there I went for an overhead and cozy is
overhead<00:06:32.450> if<00:06:32.630> you<00:06:32.720> get<00:06:32.870> a<00:06:32.900> counter<00:06:33.289> hit<00:06:33.440> with

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
overhead if you get a counter hit with

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.930 
overhead if you get a counter hit with
it<00:06:33.710> it<00:06:33.830> actually<00:06:33.950> puts<00:06:34.220> them<00:06:34.370> into<00:06:34.490> a<00:06:34.550> crumpled

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
it it actually puts them into a crumpled

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.159 
it it actually puts them into a crumpled
state<00:06:35.120> so<00:06:35.240> it<00:06:35.330> gave<00:06:35.450> me<00:06:35.630> a<00:06:35.660> chance<00:06:35.720> to<00:06:36.050> do<00:06:36.140> a

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
state so it gave me a chance to do a

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.590 
state so it gave me a chance to do a
little<00:06:36.410> bit<00:06:36.560> more<00:06:36.680> damage<00:06:37.070> but<00:06:37.760> I'm<00:06:37.880> trying<00:06:38.300> to

good damage and I don't know if there's

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.450 
good damage and I don't know if there's
anything<00:06:45.140> else<00:06:45.680> he<00:06:45.890> can<00:06:46.040> do<00:06:46.220> in<00:06:46.340> this

anything else he can do in this

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.250 
anything else he can do in this
situation<00:06:46.700> because<00:06:47.150> he<00:06:47.360> didn't<00:06:47.660> have<00:06:47.810> meter

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
situation because he didn't have meter

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.950 
situation because he didn't have meter
even<00:06:49.130> if<00:06:49.220> he<00:06:49.340> raw<00:06:49.580> tagged<00:06:50.000> he's<00:06:50.270> still<00:06:50.510> up<00:06:50.690> he's

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960 
even if he raw tagged he's still up he's

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.420 
even if he raw tagged he's still up he's
still<00:06:51.140> vulnerable<00:06:51.290> for<00:06:51.740> a<00:06:51.800> moment<00:06:52.070> and<00:06:52.340> the

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430 
still vulnerable for a moment and the

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.630 
still vulnerable for a moment and the
spin<00:06:52.730> kicks<00:06:53.000> last<00:06:53.300> a<00:06:53.510> little<00:06:53.660> while<00:06:53.780> so<00:06:54.320> I

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:54.640 
spin kicks last a little while so I

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.500 
spin kicks last a little while so I
really<00:06:55.640> don't<00:06:55.790> think<00:06:55.850> there<00:06:56.120> was<00:06:56.210> anything

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
really don't think there was anything

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.670 
really don't think there was anything
that<00:06:56.720> row<00:06:56.990> lentil<00:06:57.260> could<00:06:57.380> have<00:06:57.470> done<00:06:57.560> in<00:06:57.650> that
