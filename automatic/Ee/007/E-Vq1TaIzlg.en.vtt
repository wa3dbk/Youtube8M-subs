00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.770
 bills 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.020
 either on the hacienda any the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.850
 Grocery store in any city in Boston or 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:38.960
 in new york or at the border and just 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.200
 you have to go to the development section 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.930
 and I'm going to do it for those who do not have 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.930
 the planes you go to this option objects 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.770

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.340
 example done only with skin 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:01:00.370
 hare and this I do not remember when his life 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.070
 in the second bag of cartridges that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.890
 does with deerskin and threads 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.720
 sewing this already or if you have 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.340
 completed the essentials of hacienda os 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 only the artisans will come out 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.799
 and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.720
 in fact if in the third bag of 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.720
 cartridges is made short well with thread 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.020
 stitching but with fox fur and here in 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 the 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:32.850
 and 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.950
 good actions and good tutorials for the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.500
 string dart bag that is made 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.500
 with well leliÃ¨vre and sewing threads 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:49.330
 reading 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.050
 the bag of traps that wolf skin and 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.050
 the sewing 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.470
 well this is equal very important load 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.640
 with strawberry wood 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.520
 and cow skin you know the young obese 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.940
 after which he works the fabrics and the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940
 Carpenter 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.580
 the washington sword that is a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.730
 small of a new weapon that requires 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:27.099
 silver and an ingot of special iron 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:31.299
 the bullion bullshit I'm an idiot 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:34.110
 the various supplies if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.110
 they were here 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.230
 force 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.239
 But here fuck is the same as not for 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.540
 nothing 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.540
 because it's worth 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.579
 I already said and this the double covers that 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.430
 is what allows you to carry two pistols 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.079
 different good I do not lie two pistols 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.459
 at the same time two different pistols I think 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.110
 that you can not just take the 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.530
 same the same type of gun but do 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.049
 tests two that is what it is 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.430
 quite useful is made with wood from 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.370
 rosewood 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.709
 and wolf skin and working the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.709
 fabrics and I do not remember how much 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.510
 well the pump bag improvement that is 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:27.439
 does with sewing threads and tends back 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.810
 to the sewing threads then diego and in 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:32.319
 the one that works the fabrics percent well 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.319
 taking advantage 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:40.340
 to see what else he would sing 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.230
 the d 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.670
 the bag of poisoned darts that is 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.819
 with them I miss looking seams 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.120
 be useful hare skin and skin 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.120
 beaver 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:58.840
 the musket of the royal army that 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.150
 makes with gold flint and ingot 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.150
 special iron I will make the blacksmith 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.319
 and last but not least 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.150
 important good the French coat 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.080
 which is made with flint iron and 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.080
 special iron ingot 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.260
 Y 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.650
 seen the church spark key wood 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.960
 special net is a carpenter and the 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.960
 blacksmith 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.539
 and I think it's good to take the taken 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.120
 of war 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:44.129
 take advantage of special iron ingot 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.129
 and you need a blacksmith 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.360
 and not so 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.780

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.970
 requires fox fur sewing threads 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.320
