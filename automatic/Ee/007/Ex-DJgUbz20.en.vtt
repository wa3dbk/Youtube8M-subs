 tells after such a match the result is just 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.909
 whatever he who it was about to come for utrecht in short then you make 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.520
 not too many words but about money 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.060

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.320
 so all have the courage to come 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.450
 and yesterday it was a very nice competition for the public too 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.280
 the public has verdict yes if you supported well and I think fellow offender also yes 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.340
 we could still push in the final phase 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.340
 yes you are now afraid of your place again 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.080
 now also to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.020
 if you have often experienced a peaceful experience in the Sint, I have in fact 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.940
 Italy 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.230
 that's it then I have the feeling he had but for me this is just a matter of 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.780
 but a lot of rhythm 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.190
 a lot to play and then make sure that I am ordinary and stays that way 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.050
 gone with willem van hanegem and recruiters 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.530
 Anyway I have a good relationship with him from the beginning 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.910
 and we just talked a good about how grasp the situation 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.780
 and year 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.969
 it just goes that i just have to train well 

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:11.969
 and ma okay and now it's my turn 

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:16.219
 it is a beautiful beautiful woman me you have accepted that curve 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.739
 yes but i have too 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.569
 I also have a good relationship with him, but I am also very happy with the results 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.249
 well talked about 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.619
 and but those conversations 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:27.359
 but good 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:30.279
 I have also given a lot of confidence that I can imagine old guys 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:33.209
 who have that responsibility to you are a young guy that team 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.979
 all have to make 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.359
 do you look with a different head hair son from hanegem than that old man 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:41.359
 guys who know a bit easier about it 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:43.329
 but also i have 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.799
 I think it is great to work with him because yes it is a very good one 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.909
 trainer can very well give the hague 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.209
 the charts of mariken for me it is a privilege because sometimes it does 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.499
 animals to work 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.850
 can specify the details 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.060
 which league details 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.260
 what is so terribly important for you as a player to come 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.839
 you only explained 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:06.379
 They are just certain situations on training in the competition some 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.799
 he comes to me for matches and then after 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.410
 so then you do not assume that we are 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.119
 when it came to this time, actually 

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:16.899
 it exactly what you are talking about what you see him just a state just quiet the 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.859
 time on a workout and then now it's a moment to stop and cross over from that 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:20.819
 because we like that 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.569
 he drove they go right away 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.649
 and things like that by citi equality de sees everything 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.189
 so that is very nice to be confronted with a path taken 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.189
 which you think is how you can do this at the right time after mass 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:34.079
 I now can grow 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:36.969
 of that whole thing and that a good football player 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.230
 it does matter a bit 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.689
 I suppose he thought he was one to me 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.569
 That can very well help in mariÃ«nheem attracts to a good player 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:47.379
 to be and year 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.019
 he can only help for the rest must do it himself 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.590
 with that cross, talking later with a friend was excellent business in the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.399
 fight for 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:58.459
 Roy Hodsgon is a good friend of your percent 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:59.599
 world soccer team 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.129
 yes very good players get around seventy scored afterwards 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:06.439
 to shorten a good boy 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.359
 with it goes well understand 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.159
