00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
version of it but I didn't really talk

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.140 
version of it but I didn't really talk
about<00:00:53.710> it<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.100> lot<00:00:54.250> I<00:00:54.280> was<00:00:54.430> mostly<00:00:54.699> just<00:00:54.910> running

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
about it a lot I was mostly just running

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.759 
about it a lot I was mostly just running
around<00:00:55.239> showing<00:00:55.690> that<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.900> can<00:00:56.199> still<00:00:56.559> do

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
around showing that you can still do

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.160 
around showing that you can still do
kind<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.309> decent<00:00:57.820> with<00:00:57.970> it<00:00:58.150> but<00:00:58.390> it's

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
kind of decent with it but it's

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.290 
kind of decent with it but it's
definitely<00:00:59.410> fallen<00:01:00.340> pretty<00:01:00.550> far<00:01:00.879> from<00:01:01.149> what

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
definitely fallen pretty far from what

no<00:01:17.470> longer<00:01:17.710> anywhere<00:01:18.340> near<00:01:18.759> what<00:01:19.119> it<00:01:19.210> used<00:01:19.240> to

no longer anywhere near what it used to

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:20.760 
no longer anywhere near what it used to

of that I know a lot of you guys out

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.440 
of that I know a lot of you guys out
there<00:01:22.930> are<00:01:23.080> probably<00:01:23.440> guilty<00:01:24.009> of<00:01:24.190> abusing<00:01:24.610> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
there are probably guilty of abusing the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.270 
there are probably guilty of abusing the
frag<00:01:25.690> rounds<00:01:25.720> back<00:01:26.229> when<00:01:26.470> it<00:01:26.590> was<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.770> super

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
frag rounds back when it was a super

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.310 
frag rounds back when it was a super
super<00:01:27.520> powerful<00:01:27.700> and<00:01:28.179> I<00:01:28.360> think<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.899> the<00:01:29.110> most

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
super powerful and I think that the most

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.510 
super powerful and I think that the most
frustrating<00:01:29.890> thing<00:01:30.039> about<00:01:30.070> frag<00:01:30.490> rounds

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
frustrating thing about frag rounds

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.219 
frustrating thing about frag rounds
wasn't<00:01:31.150> so<00:01:31.299> much<00:01:31.450> that<00:01:31.509> you<00:01:31.780> could<00:01:31.930> get<00:01:32.049> just

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
wasn't so much that you could get just

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.370 
wasn't so much that you could get just
killed<00:01:32.680> across<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.220> map<00:01:33.430> it<00:01:33.880> was<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
killed across the map it was that the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.530 
killed across the map it was that the
suppression<00:01:36.040> was<00:01:36.400> just<00:01:36.700> unbearable<00:01:37.180> you

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
suppression was just unbearable you

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.820 
suppression was just unbearable you
would<00:01:37.780> just<00:01:37.900> get<00:01:38.049> suppressed<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.770> you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
would just get suppressed and you

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.130 
would just get suppressed and you
couldn't<00:01:39.159> shoot<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.700> even<00:01:40.450> if<00:01:40.540> you<00:01:40.630> did<00:01:40.869> stay

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
couldn't shoot and even if you did stay

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.840 
couldn't shoot and even if you did stay
alive<00:01:41.409> eventually<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:41.979> would<00:01:42.130> die<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.400> like

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
alive eventually you would die to like

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.340 
alive eventually you would die to like
the<00:01:43.000> hundredth<00:01:43.390> frag<00:01:43.810> round<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.170> came<00:01:44.320> over

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
the hundredth frag round it came over

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.630 
the hundredth frag round it came over
your<00:01:44.650> head<00:01:44.860> but<00:01:45.040> you<00:01:45.100> could<00:01:45.250> never<00:01:45.369> shoot

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
your head but you could never shoot

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.859 
your head but you could never shoot
anything<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.060> could<00:01:46.210> never<00:01:46.390> hit<00:01:46.689> the

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
anything you could never hit the

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.719 
anything you could never hit the
broadside<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.320> the<00:01:47.409> barn<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:48.040> when<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:48.520> did

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
broadside of the barn and when you did

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.640 
broadside of the barn and when you did
you<00:01:48.880> would<00:01:49.000> blow<00:01:49.210> yourself<00:01:49.659> up<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.140> I<00:01:50.350> do<00:01:50.409> that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
you would blow yourself up and I do that

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.620 
you would blow yourself up and I do that
quite<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.920> few<00:01:51.009> times<00:01:51.369> in<00:01:51.549> this<00:01:51.670> video<00:01:51.850> and<00:01:52.420> when

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
quite a few times in this video and when

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.819 
quite a few times in this video and when
I<00:01:52.659> was<00:01:52.840> going<00:01:53.079> back<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.259> watching<00:01:53.530> this

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:53.829 
I was going back and watching this

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:55.289 
I was going back and watching this
footage<00:01:54.159> I<00:01:54.250> was<00:01:54.400> like<00:01:54.490> man<00:01:54.729> I<00:01:54.970> don't<00:01:55.119> think

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
footage I was like man I don't think

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.940 
footage I was like man I don't think
I've<00:01:55.479> ever<00:01:55.509> showed<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:55.990> gameplay<00:01:56.530> where<00:01:56.770> I<00:01:56.799> die

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
I've ever showed a gameplay where I die

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.700 
I've ever showed a gameplay where I die
as<00:01:57.460> many<00:01:57.729> times<00:01:58.000> as<00:01:58.240> in<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.930> particular<00:01:59.500> game

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
as many times as in this particular game

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.899 
as many times as in this particular game
play<00:01:59.950> because<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.310> frag<00:02:00.520> rounds<00:02:00.549> are

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
play because the frag rounds are

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:02.429 
play because the frag rounds are
frustrating<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.780> learned<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.290> very

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
frustrating and I learned a very

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.800 
frustrating and I learned a very
important<00:02:02.979> lesson<00:02:03.009> when<00:02:03.759> doing<00:02:04.030> this<00:02:04.240> this

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
important lesson when doing this this

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.210 
important lesson when doing this this
little<00:02:04.960> challenge<00:02:05.290> that<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:05.740> was<00:02:05.860> doing<00:02:06.100> which

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
little challenge that I was doing which

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.520 
little challenge that I was doing which
I'll<00:02:06.369> explain<00:02:06.490> here<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.540> bit<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.259> that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
I'll explain here in a bit it's that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.499 
I'll explain here in a bit it's that
close<00:02:09.369> quarters<00:02:09.759> it's<00:02:09.940> probably<00:02:10.269> not<00:02:10.390> the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
close quarters it's probably not the

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.449 
close quarters it's probably not the
best<00:02:10.540> place<00:02:10.959> in<00:02:11.110> the<00:02:11.140> world<00:02:11.380> for<00:02:12.070> the<00:02:12.220> frag

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
best place in the world for the frag

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.890 
best place in the world for the frag
rounds<00:02:12.489> I<00:02:12.760> think<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.000> does<00:02:13.150> better<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.630> a<00:02:13.660> more

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
rounds I think it does better on a more

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.180 
rounds I think it does better on a more
wide<00:02:14.110> open<00:02:14.140> map<00:02:14.680> where<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.890> can<00:02:15.040> actually

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
wide open map where you can actually

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.160 
wide open map where you can actually
like<00:02:15.459> snipe<00:02:15.760> people<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.390> I've<00:02:16.780> had<00:02:16.930> good

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
like snipe people and I've had good

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.140 
like snipe people and I've had good
success<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.829> like<00:02:17.980> aftermath<00:02:18.459> aftermath<00:02:18.970> has

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
success on like aftermath aftermath has

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.670 
success on like aftermath aftermath has
a<00:02:19.209> lot<00:02:19.480> of<00:02:19.600> long<00:02:19.780> lines<00:02:19.989> of<00:02:20.140> sight<00:02:20.350> where<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
a lot of long lines of sight where the

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.870 
a lot of long lines of sight where the
frag<00:02:20.890> rounds<00:02:20.920> can<00:02:21.250> actually<00:02:21.549> be<00:02:21.670> beneficial

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
frag rounds can actually be beneficial

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.420 
frag rounds can actually be beneficial
but<00:02:22.570> on<00:02:22.810> maps<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.620> these<00:02:23.799> close<00:02:24.040> quarters

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
but on maps like these close quarters

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.580 
but on maps like these close quarters
maps<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.329> just<00:02:25.540> don't<00:02:25.750> really<00:02:25.900> do<00:02:26.170> that<00:02:26.350> hot

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
maps I you just don't really do that hot

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.199 
maps I you just don't really do that hot
because<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.519> was<00:02:27.640> saying<00:02:27.850> you<00:02:27.940> blow

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
because like I was saying you blow

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.960 
because like I was saying you blow
yourself<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.780> like<00:02:29.170> five<00:02:29.650> five<00:02:30.489> times<00:02:30.730> out<00:02:30.940> of

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
yourself up like five five times out of

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.580 
yourself up like five five times out of
ten<00:02:31.209> you're<00:02:31.390> either<00:02:31.480> blowing<00:02:31.900> yourself<00:02:31.989> up<00:02:32.440> or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
ten you're either blowing yourself up or

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.259 
ten you're either blowing yourself up or
at<00:02:32.680> least<00:02:32.709> damaging<00:02:33.370> yourself<00:02:33.760> enough<00:02:34.090> to

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
at least damaging yourself enough to

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.819 
at least damaging yourself enough to
where<00:02:34.449> you're<00:02:34.600> actually<00:02:35.019> getting<00:02:35.440> killed

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
where you're actually getting killed

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.310 
where you're actually getting killed
pretty<00:02:36.100> quickly<00:02:36.370> so<00:02:36.970> frag<00:02:37.570> rounds<00:02:37.600> there<00:02:38.230> are

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
pretty quickly so frag rounds there are

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.900 
pretty quickly so frag rounds there are
a<00:02:38.350> pretty<00:02:38.530> high<00:02:38.769> risk<00:02:39.100> low

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
a pretty high risk low

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.150 
a pretty high risk low
word<00:02:40.150> type<00:02:40.420> weapon<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.020> I<00:02:41.320> playing<00:02:41.980> with<00:02:42.040> a

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
word type weapon but I playing with a

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.470 
word type weapon but I playing with a
bunch<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.490> other<00:02:42.670> youtubers<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.270> you'll

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
bunch of other youtubers that you'll

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.880 
bunch of other youtubers that you'll
probably<00:02:43.690> recognize<00:02:43.960> throughout<00:02:44.560> this<00:02:44.710> video

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
probably recognize throughout this video

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.520 
probably recognize throughout this video
and<00:02:45.670> we<00:02:45.760> basically<00:02:45.970> were<00:02:46.360> doing<00:02:46.660> like<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.200> don't

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
and we basically were doing like I don't

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:48.600 
and we basically were doing like I don't
know<00:02:47.590> we<00:02:47.710> were<00:02:47.800> just<00:02:47.830> fooling<00:02:48.100> around<00:02:48.460> and<00:02:48.550> I

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
know we were just fooling around and I

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.100 
know we were just fooling around and I
was<00:02:48.700> like<00:02:48.820> hey<00:02:48.970> how<00:02:49.150> about<00:02:49.330> we<00:02:49.450> do<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.840> sass

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
was like hey how about we do you sass

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.630 
was like hey how about we do you sass
frag<00:02:50.410> rounds<00:02:50.440> only<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:51.130> see<00:02:51.280> how<00:02:51.400> long<00:02:51.580> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
frag rounds only and see how long it

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.520 
frag rounds only and see how long it
takes<00:02:51.970> before<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.390> entire<00:02:52.630> servers<00:02:53.140> doing<00:02:53.320> it

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
takes before the entire servers doing it

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.410 
takes before the entire servers doing it
and<00:02:53.680> sure<00:02:54.130> enough<00:02:54.160> you<00:02:54.580> know<00:02:54.640> people<00:02:55.210> caught

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
and sure enough you know people caught

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.030 
and sure enough you know people caught
on<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.840> where<00:02:56.020> everybody<00:02:56.530> got<00:02:56.740> out<00:02:56.770> their

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
on to where everybody got out their

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.580 
on to where everybody got out their
useless<00:02:57.370> frag<00:02:57.700> rounds<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.240> it<00:02:59.140> basically

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
useless frag rounds and it basically

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.000 
useless frag rounds and it basically
just<00:02:59.680> turned<00:03:00.070> into<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.310> a<00:03:01.240> frag<00:03:01.870> round<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.830> it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
just turned into a a frag round and it

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.640 
just turned into a a frag round and it
wasn't<00:03:03.430> really<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:03.880> much<00:03:04.120> fun<00:03:04.660> because<00:03:04.960> frag

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
wasn't really that much fun because frag

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.260 
wasn't really that much fun because frag
rounds<00:03:05.830> are<00:03:06.280> pretty<00:03:06.790> bad

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
rounds are pretty bad

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630 
rounds are pretty bad
when<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.140> go<00:03:08.230> up<00:03:08.350> against<00:03:08.650> an<00:03:08.710> m16<00:03:09.220> you're

when you go up against an m16 you're

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.520 
when you go up against an m16 you're

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
gonna die when you go up against an AEK

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.900 
gonna die when you go up against an AEK
you're<00:03:11.740> gonna<00:03:11.890> die<00:03:12.100> when<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.460> go<00:03:12.580> against

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
you're gonna die when you go against

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.850 
you're gonna die when you go against
anything<00:03:13.210> they<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.750> do<00:03:13.900> more<00:03:14.200> than<00:03:14.380> like<00:03:14.590> 5

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
anything they can do more than like 5

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.220 
anything they can do more than like 5
damage<00:03:15.340> you're<00:03:15.760> probably<00:03:16.030> gonna<00:03:16.240> die<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.510> would

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
damage you're probably gonna die I would

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.320 
damage you're probably gonna die I would
say<00:03:17.410> if<00:03:17.590> I<00:03:17.710> went<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.160> this<00:03:18.310> battle<00:03:18.580> first<00:03:19.150> the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
say if I went to this battle first the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.940 
say if I went to this battle first the
use<00:03:19.510> ass<00:03:19.720> frag<00:03:20.020> rounds<00:03:20.050> I<00:03:20.440> would<00:03:20.590> be<00:03:20.710> better

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
use ass frag rounds I would be better

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.340 
use ass frag rounds I would be better
off<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.520> a<00:03:21.760> pistol<00:03:22.240> of<00:03:22.390> some<00:03:22.600> design<00:03:22.930> than

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
off with a pistol of some design than

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.200 
off with a pistol of some design than
this<00:03:23.560> particular<00:03:24.100> weapon<00:03:24.280> that's<00:03:24.580> how<00:03:24.700> bad<00:03:25.030> it

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
this particular weapon that's how bad it

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.030 
this particular weapon that's how bad it
is<00:03:25.330> on<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.600> close<00:03:25.750> quarters<00:03:26.140> Maps<00:03:26.410> but<00:03:26.920> if

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
is on the close quarters Maps but if

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.130 
is on the close quarters Maps but if
you're<00:03:27.160> feeling<00:03:27.550> gutsy<00:03:28.030> you're<00:03:28.450> feeling<00:03:28.930> like

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
you're feeling gutsy you're feeling like

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140 
you're feeling gutsy you're feeling like
you<00:03:29.800> want<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.160> go<00:03:30.280> out<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.790> actually

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
you want to go out there and actually

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.910 
you want to go out there and actually
try<00:03:31.450> out<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.840> use<00:03:31.990> ass<00:03:32.200> frag<00:03:32.530> rounds<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
try out the use ass frag rounds and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.260 
try out the use ass frag rounds and
confirm<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.490> for<00:03:33.700> yourself<00:03:34.090> you're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
confirm this for yourself you're

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.490 
confirm this for yourself you're
probably<00:03:34.450> like<00:03:34.690> well<00:03:34.840> what's<00:03:35.050> the<00:03:35.230> damage

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
probably like well what's the damage

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.320 
probably like well what's the damage
like<00:03:35.860> on<00:03:36.010> these<00:03:36.160> things<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:37.030> actually

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
like on these things and it's actually

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.260 
like on these things and it's actually
kind<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.960> little<00:03:38.350> bit<00:03:38.590> tricky<00:03:39.250> if<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.120> do

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
kind of a little bit tricky if you do

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.180 
kind of a little bit tricky if you do
equip<00:03:40.570> frag<00:03:40.810> rounds<00:03:40.840> you<00:03:41.200> USS<00:03:41.620> is<00:03:41.830> going<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.100> go

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
equip frag rounds you USS is going to go

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:43.650 
equip frag rounds you USS is going to go
down<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.550> rate<00:03:42.700> a<00:03:42.730> fire<00:03:42.970> that<00:03:43.000> was<00:03:43.330> one<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
down and rate a fire that was one of the

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.890 
down and rate a fire that was one of the
way<00:03:43.810> dice<00:03:44.140> kind<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.560> balance<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.280> out<00:03:45.400> because

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
way dice kind of balance it out because

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.030 
way dice kind of balance it out because
before<00:03:46.900> there<00:03:47.080> was<00:03:47.200> some<00:03:47.410> glitch<00:03:47.650> out<00:03:47.860> there

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
before there was some glitch out there

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.320 
before there was some glitch out there
where<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.220> could<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.520> fire<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.880> thing<00:03:49.060> at

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
where you could just fire this thing at

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:50.790 
where you could just fire this thing at
its<00:03:49.480> normal<00:03:49.690> speed<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.110> it<00:03:50.380> made<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.620> just

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
its normal speed and it made it just

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.470 
its normal speed and it made it just
super<00:03:51.070> super<00:03:51.220> overpowered<00:03:51.820> now<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.060> can<00:03:52.300> only

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
super super overpowered now you can only

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.510 
super super overpowered now you can only
shoot<00:03:52.780> it<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.110> think<00:03:53.470> 200<00:03:54.040> rounds<00:03:54.130> per<00:03:54.400> minute

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
shoot it I think 200 rounds per minute

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.880 
shoot it I think 200 rounds per minute
they've<00:03:55.390> capped<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.840> at<00:03:55.930> that<00:03:56.110> so<00:03:56.350> you<00:03:56.380> do<00:03:56.650> lose

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
they've capped it at that so you do lose

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.040 
they've capped it at that so you do lose
a<00:03:56.920> little<00:03:57.190> bit<00:03:57.310> on<00:03:57.400> your<00:03:57.520> rate<00:03:57.670> of<00:03:57.700> fire<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.959> if

00:03:59.040 --> 00:03:59.050 
a little bit on your rate of fire but if

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.740 
a little bit on your rate of fire but if
the<00:03:59.320> damage<00:03:59.709> is<00:03:59.890> kind<00:04:00.490> of<00:04:00.550> weird<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.120> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
the damage is kind of weird so the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.800 
the damage is kind of weird so the
damage<00:04:01.990> is<00:04:02.320> between<00:04:02.830> 20<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.430> 5<00:04:03.970> if<00:04:04.390> you

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
damage is between 20 and 5 if you

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.690 
damage is between 20 and 5 if you
directly<00:04:05.440> hit<00:04:05.800> them<00:04:06.040> now<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.220> does<00:04:06.520> not

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
directly hit them now that does not

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.310 
directly hit them now that does not
account<00:04:07.000> for<00:04:07.120> Splash<00:04:07.540> Damage<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:08.140> there's<00:04:08.260> a

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
account for Splash Damage and there's a

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.900 
account for Splash Damage and there's a
lot<00:04:08.560> of<00:04:08.709> factors<00:04:09.100> that<00:04:09.130> go<00:04:09.280> into<00:04:09.550> that<00:04:09.640> like

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
lot of factors that go into that like

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.240 
lot of factors that go into that like
angles<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:10.959> know<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.230> radius<00:04:11.590> within<00:04:12.070> the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
angles you know the radius within the

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.890 
angles you know the radius within the
splash<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:12.880> if<00:04:13.030> you're<00:04:13.150> within<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.600> splash

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
splash so if you're within the splash

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.680 
splash so if you're within the splash
from<00:04:14.200> like<00:04:14.680> point<00:04:15.160> 1<00:04:15.459> point<00:04:15.610> 5<00:04:15.910> meters<00:04:16.330> to<00:04:16.359> like

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
from like point 1 point 5 meters to like

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.630 
from like point 1 point 5 meters to like
3<00:04:16.959> meters<00:04:17.230> will<00:04:17.470> depend<00:04:17.859> on<00:04:17.980> how<00:04:18.190> much<00:04:18.370> damage

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
3 meters will depend on how much damage

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.970 
3 meters will depend on how much damage
you<00:04:18.850> actually<00:04:19.180> do<00:04:19.390> I<00:04:20.020> think<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.650> can<00:04:20.799> do

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
you actually do I think you can do

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.850 
you actually do I think you can do
anywhere<00:04:21.430> between<00:04:21.640> 25<00:04:22.419> all<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:22.810> way<00:04:22.930> down<00:04:23.320> to

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
anywhere between 25 all the way down to

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.470 
anywhere between 25 all the way down to
like<00:04:24.040> 2<00:04:24.340> damage<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.060> think<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:25.360> actually

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
like 2 damage I think it actually

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.200 
like 2 damage I think it actually
teeters<00:04:25.990> off<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.650> low<00:04:26.860> so<00:04:27.220> sometimes

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
teeters off really low so sometimes

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.180 
teeters off really low so sometimes
you'll<00:04:28.390> get<00:04:28.480> like<00:04:28.720> 11<00:04:29.470> hit<00:04:29.650> markers<00:04:30.040> you're

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
you'll get like 11 hit markers you're

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.470 
you'll get like 11 hit markers you're
like<00:04:30.370> well<00:04:30.580> why<00:04:30.760> didn't<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.030> kill<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.390> guy

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
like well why didn't I kill that guy

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.510 
like well why didn't I kill that guy
well<00:04:31.750> you<00:04:31.780> turn<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.350> you<00:04:32.620> know<00:04:32.710> you<00:04:33.160> find<00:04:33.370> out

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
well you turn to you know you find out

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.610 
well you turn to you know you find out
that<00:04:33.669> you<00:04:33.760> only<00:04:33.910> actually<00:04:34.150> did<00:04:34.510> like<00:04:34.750> I<00:04:34.990> don't

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
that you only actually did like I don't

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.230 
that you only actually did like I don't
know<00:04:35.800> maybe<00:04:36.040> like<00:04:36.250> 20<00:04:36.610> damage<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:37.060> them

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
know maybe like 20 damage to them

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.630 
know maybe like 20 damage to them
altogether<00:04:37.419> if<00:04:37.870> even<00:04:38.200> that<00:04:38.230> because<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:39.490> can

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
altogether if even that because you can

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.520 
altogether if even that because you can
get<00:04:39.760> it<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.360> get<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.570> lot<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.930> hit<00:04:41.200> markers

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
get it you can get a lot of hit markers

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.990 
get it you can get a lot of hit markers
and<00:04:41.680> realize<00:04:42.130> that<00:04:42.340> you're<00:04:42.460> really<00:04:42.669> not<00:04:42.820> doing

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
and realize that you're really not doing

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.360 
and realize that you're really not doing
that<00:04:43.480> much<00:04:43.660> damage<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.380> these<00:04:44.919> things<00:04:45.190> are

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
that much damage so these things are

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.490 
that much damage so these things are
pretty<00:04:45.610> much<00:04:46.060> if<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.840> don't<00:04:47.169> hit<00:04:47.380> them

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
pretty much if you don't hit them

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.740 
pretty much if you don't hit them
directly<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.220> and<00:04:48.460> take<00:04:48.700> you<00:04:49.510> know<00:04:49.570> the

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
directly and and take you know the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.659 
directly and and take you know the
direct<00:04:50.050> impact<00:04:50.440> damage<00:04:50.590> plus<00:04:51.039> the<00:04:51.250> splash

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
direct impact damage plus the splash

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:52.950 
direct impact damage plus the splash
damage<00:04:51.700> you're<00:04:52.180> really<00:04:52.450> not<00:04:52.600> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.870> do

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
damage you're really not going to do

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:53.730 
damage you're really not going to do
that<00:04:53.140> that<00:04:53.410> much

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
that that much

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.339 
that that much
to<00:04:53.830> them<00:04:54.009> so<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.970> will<00:04:55.150> take<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.389> lot<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.960> rounds

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
to them so it will take a lot of rounds

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.620 
to them so it will take a lot of rounds
to<00:04:56.470> take<00:04:56.650> people<00:04:56.979> out<00:04:57.099> now<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:58.180> do<00:04:58.360> frag

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
to take people out now what do frag

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.960 
to take people out now what do frag
rounds<00:04:58.660> actually<00:04:59.229> do<00:04:59.620> well<00:04:59.860> and<00:05:00.220> they<00:05:00.789> don't

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
rounds actually do well and they don't

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.550 
rounds actually do well and they don't
do<00:05:01.120> much<00:05:01.330> well<00:05:01.569> but<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.900> one<00:05:02.080> thing<00:05:02.259> they<00:05:02.410> will

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
do much well but the one thing they will

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.110 
do much well but the one thing they will
do<00:05:02.770> is<00:05:02.949> suppress<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.520> I<00:05:03.550> kind<00:05:03.759> of<00:05:03.880> talked

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
do is suppress you I kind of talked

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.189 
do is suppress you I kind of talked
about<00:05:04.330> this<00:05:04.479> at<00:05:04.630> beginning<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:04.990> the<00:05:05.050> video

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
about this at beginning of the video

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.379 
about this at beginning of the video
there<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.949> no<00:05:06.160> other<00:05:06.400> thing<00:05:06.729> in<00:05:06.880> the<00:05:06.970> game<00:05:07.150> that

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
there is no other thing in the game that

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:08.969 
there is no other thing in the game that
will<00:05:07.509> suppress<00:05:07.870> you<00:05:08.050> like<00:05:08.229> a<00:05:08.259> frag<00:05:08.590> round<00:05:08.830> and

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
will suppress you like a frag round and

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.230 
will suppress you like a frag round and
it<00:05:09.069> kind<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.310> makes<00:05:09.520> sense<00:05:09.669> because<00:05:09.849> they're

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
it kind of makes sense because they're

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.730 
it kind of makes sense because they're
probably<00:05:10.389> these<00:05:10.690> big<00:05:10.930> explosive<00:05:11.349> pellets

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
probably these big explosive pellets

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.830 
probably these big explosive pellets
going<00:05:12.130> off<00:05:12.250> around<00:05:12.639> you<00:05:13.120> you'll<00:05:13.479> get<00:05:13.599> a<00:05:13.660> little

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
going off around you you'll get a little

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.330 
going off around you you'll get a little
bit<00:05:14.020> nervous<00:05:14.169> you<00:05:14.380> would<00:05:14.650> probably<00:05:15.160> become

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
bit nervous you would probably become

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.150 
bit nervous you would probably become
suppressed<00:05:15.970> in<00:05:16.180> the<00:05:16.300> real<00:05:16.479> world<00:05:16.690> so<00:05:17.080> heck<00:05:17.949> why

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
suppressed in the real world so heck why

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.589 
suppressed in the real world so heck why
don't<00:05:18.340> we<00:05:18.400> give<00:05:18.610> them<00:05:18.759> the<00:05:18.910> best<00:05:19.090> suppression

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
don't we give them the best suppression

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.659 
don't we give them the best suppression
the<00:05:19.720> game<00:05:19.900> makes<00:05:20.169> sense<00:05:20.259> right<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.370> they<00:05:21.490> will

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
the game makes sense right so they will

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.219 
the game makes sense right so they will
suppress<00:05:22.060> people<00:05:22.360> pretty<00:05:22.569> well<00:05:22.690> but<00:05:23.050> does

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
suppress people pretty well but does

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.689 
suppress people pretty well but does
that<00:05:23.410> make<00:05:23.620> up<00:05:23.800> for<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.069> fact<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.370> it<00:05:24.550> takes

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
that make up for the fact that it takes

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:26.760 
that make up for the fact that it takes
11<00:05:25.090> rounds<00:05:25.569> to<00:05:25.720> kill<00:05:25.930> like<00:05:26.110> one<00:05:26.349> person

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
11 rounds to kill like one person

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.800 
11 rounds to kill like one person
probably<00:05:27.400> not<00:05:27.729> most<00:05:28.090> times<00:05:28.360> you're<00:05:28.539> probably

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
probably not most times you're probably

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.409 
probably not most times you're probably
going<00:05:29.169> to<00:05:29.289> die<00:05:29.500> before<00:05:29.740> then<00:05:30.099> because<00:05:30.419> you

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
going to die before then because you

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.089 
going to die before then because you
know<00:05:31.539> some<00:05:31.810> of<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:31.990> stray<00:05:32.259> bullets<00:05:32.680> even<00:05:32.830> if

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
know some of the stray bullets even if

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:34.200 
know some of the stray bullets even if
you<00:05:33.190> are<00:05:33.340> suppressed<00:05:33.819> you're<00:05:33.970> eventually

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
you are suppressed you're eventually

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.790 
you are suppressed you're eventually
going<00:05:34.630> to<00:05:34.750> get<00:05:34.930> some<00:05:35.169> one<00:05:35.289> target<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.680> you're

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
going to get some one target and you're

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.860 
going to get some one target and you're
probably<00:05:35.889> gonna<00:05:36.159> take<00:05:36.370> him<00:05:36.520> out<00:05:36.610> so<00:05:36.909> if<00:05:37.659> you're

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
probably gonna take him out so if you're

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.240 
probably gonna take him out so if you're
one<00:05:38.020> to<00:05:38.169> try<00:05:38.349> out<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> frag<00:05:38.830> rounds<00:05:38.919> if<00:05:39.159> you

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
one to try out the frag rounds if you

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.920 
one to try out the frag rounds if you
want<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:39.580> figure<00:05:39.819> it<00:05:40.030> out<00:05:40.090> for<00:05:40.300> yourself

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
want to figure it out for yourself

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.200 
want to figure it out for yourself
I<00:05:40.960> would<00:05:41.440> suggest<00:05:41.620> a<00:05:42.039> more<00:05:42.310> wide<00:05:42.550> open<00:05:42.580> map<00:05:43.060> I

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
I would suggest a more wide open map I

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.670 
I would suggest a more wide open map I
wouldn't<00:05:43.479> hawk<00:05:43.630> go<00:05:43.840> in<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.080> close<00:05:44.259> quarters

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
wouldn't hawk go in the close quarters

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.950 
wouldn't hawk go in the close quarters
cuz<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.039> was<00:05:45.190> a<00:05:45.220> failed<00:05:45.580> experiment<00:05:46.030> this<00:05:46.900> is

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 
cuz it was a failed experiment this is

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.050 
cuz it was a failed experiment this is
one<00:05:47.199> of<00:05:47.259> the<00:05:47.380> ugliest<00:05:47.800> games<00:05:48.159> that<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:48.490> think<00:05:48.970> I

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
one of the ugliest games that I think I

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.580 
one of the ugliest games that I think I
had<00:05:49.180> had<00:05:49.330> in<00:05:49.449> a<00:05:49.509> while<00:05:49.690> now<00:05:49.960> I<00:05:50.169> didn't<00:05:50.500> do<00:05:50.560> a

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
had had in a while now I didn't do a

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:51.990 
had had in a while now I didn't do a
horrible<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.009> think<00:05:51.190> I<00:05:51.220> ended<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:51.520> game<00:05:51.759> like

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 
horrible I think I ended this game like

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.439 
horrible I think I ended this game like
42<00:05:52.539> in<00:05:53.289> like<00:05:53.699> 29<00:05:54.699> or<00:05:54.970> something<00:05:55.300> like<00:05:55.389> that

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
42 in like 29 or something like that

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.439 
42 in like 29 or something like that
which<00:05:55.780> isn't<00:05:55.960> super<00:05:56.770> super<00:05:57.039> bad<00:05:57.220> but<00:05:57.520> it<00:05:58.300> was

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
which isn't super super bad but it was

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.790 
which isn't super super bad but it was
an<00:05:58.570> interesting<00:05:58.780> experience<00:05:59.380> to<00:05:59.560> say<00:05:59.770> the

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
an interesting experience to say the

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.040 
an interesting experience to say the
least<00:05:59.979> now<00:06:00.669> I<00:06:00.699> did<00:06:00.909> discover<00:06:01.300> one<00:06:01.630> thing<00:06:01.870> about

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
least now I did discover one thing about

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:03.930 
least now I did discover one thing about
the<00:06:02.259> USS<00:06:02.680> that<00:06:02.919> I<00:06:02.949> think<00:06:03.219> is<00:06:03.310> actually<00:06:03.639> kind<00:06:03.880> of

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
the USS that I think is actually kind of

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.459 
the USS that I think is actually kind of
redeemable<00:06:04.419> about<00:06:04.780> it<00:06:04.960> is<00:06:05.080> it's<00:06:05.259> pretty

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
redeemable about it is it's pretty

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:07.080 
redeemable about it is it's pretty
decent<00:06:06.009> with<00:06:06.159> slug<00:06:06.400> rounds<00:06:06.610> I've<00:06:06.880> talked

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
decent with slug rounds I've talked

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.999 
decent with slug rounds I've talked
about<00:06:07.240> this<00:06:07.509> in<00:06:07.570> one<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:07.840> my<00:06:07.960> USS<00:06:08.380> videos<00:06:08.740> but

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
about this in one of my USS videos but

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.310 
about this in one of my USS videos but
if<00:06:09.250> you<00:06:09.520> put<00:06:09.759> slug<00:06:10.090> rounds<00:06:10.330> on<00:06:10.599> the<00:06:10.630> USS<00:06:11.169> you

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
if you put slug rounds on the USS you

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.350 
if you put slug rounds on the USS you
can<00:06:11.440> actually<00:06:11.770> be<00:06:11.979> kind<00:06:12.370> of<00:06:12.580> decent<00:06:13.030> with<00:06:13.180> it

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
can actually be kind of decent with it

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.230 
can actually be kind of decent with it
it<00:06:13.539> can<00:06:13.690> actually<00:06:14.020> get<00:06:14.169> some<00:06:14.349> kills<00:06:14.940> and<00:06:15.940> I

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
it can actually get some kills and I

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.300 
it can actually get some kills and I
would<00:06:16.389> really<00:06:16.810> recommend<00:06:17.080> though<00:06:17.650> if<00:06:17.889> you<00:06:18.039> do

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
would really recommend though if you do

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.459 
would really recommend though if you do
try<00:06:18.669> out<00:06:18.849> the<00:06:19.060> frag<00:06:19.300> rounds<00:06:19.330> if<00:06:19.690> you<00:06:19.780> do<00:06:19.990> try<00:06:20.409> to

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
try out the frag rounds if you do try to

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.159 
try out the frag rounds if you do try to
run<00:06:20.919> it<00:06:21.070> around<00:06:21.280> with<00:06:21.610> these<00:06:21.820> bad<00:06:22.030> boys<00:06:22.240> on<00:06:22.539> you

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
run it around with these bad boys on you

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.709 
run it around with these bad boys on you
got<00:06:23.440> to<00:06:23.650> put<00:06:23.860> on<00:06:23.889> squad<00:06:24.490> flak<00:06:24.940> because<00:06:25.509> you're

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:25.719 
got to put on squad flak because you're

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:27.209 
got to put on squad flak because you're
going<00:06:25.900> to<00:06:26.050> hurt<00:06:26.169> yourself<00:06:26.319> a<00:06:26.650> lot<00:06:26.860> when<00:06:27.069> you're

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:27.219 
going to hurt yourself a lot when you're

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:28.920 
going to hurt yourself a lot when you're
getting<00:06:27.520> uh<00:06:27.550> when<00:06:28.330> you're<00:06:28.419> getting<00:06:28.659> shot<00:06:28.900> by

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
getting uh when you're getting shot by

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.480 
getting uh when you're getting shot by
these<00:06:29.259> things<00:06:29.530> I<00:06:29.740> mean<00:06:29.770> that's<00:06:30.099> that's<00:06:30.400> just

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
these things I mean that's that's just

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.640 
these things I mean that's that's just
the<00:06:30.729> nature<00:06:30.940> of<00:06:31.090> explosions<00:06:31.930> I<00:06:32.139> think<00:06:32.620> I

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
the nature of explosions I think I

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.649 
the nature of explosions I think I
suicided<00:06:33.310> like<00:06:33.460> two<00:06:33.729> or<00:06:33.880> three<00:06:34.090> times<00:06:34.300> in<00:06:34.539> this

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:34.659 
suicided like two or three times in this

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.749 
suicided like two or three times in this
video<00:06:34.810> so<00:06:35.229> it<00:06:35.650> does<00:06:35.919> happen<00:06:36.190> you<00:06:36.460> can<00:06:36.610> see
