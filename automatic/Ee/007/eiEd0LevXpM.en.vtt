managed to make the to show the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570 
managed to make the to show the
devastation<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.770> show<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.159> difficult

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
devastation to show the difficult

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.249 
devastation to show the difficult

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
situation that people find themselves in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.350 
situation that people find themselves in
but<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.430> makes<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.820> feel<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.210> can

make<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> difference<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.140> think<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.470> trick

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
make a difference so I think the trick

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.950 
make a difference so I think the trick
that<00:01:19.740> Fairtrade<00:01:20.369> has<00:01:20.549> done<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:21.000> show<00:01:21.900> you

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that Fairtrade has done is show you

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.719 
that Fairtrade has done is show you
difficult<00:01:22.650> things<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.159> say<00:01:23.340> it's<00:01:23.580> got

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
difficult things and say it's got

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.820 
difficult things and say it's got
something<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.350> buy

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
something to do with you because you buy

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.260 
something to do with you because you buy
a<00:01:25.860> chocolate<00:01:26.130> bar<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:27.240> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.149 
a chocolate bar so you can make a
difference<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.380> drink<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.770> cup<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.009> coffee

earthquake<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> Haiti<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.030> sort<00:01:42.509> of

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
earthquake in Haiti is the sort of

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960

hopelessness<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.950> it's<00:01:44.310> hopeless<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.700> them

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
hopelessness of it's hopeless for them

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.310 
hopelessness of it's hopeless for them
and<00:01:45.180> it's<00:01:45.270> hopeless<00:01:45.450> because<00:01:45.899> what<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.259> do

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and it's hopeless because what can I do

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.050 
and it's hopeless because what can I do
about<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.130> I've<00:01:47.250> seen<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.549> awful<00:01:47.909> thing

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
about it so I've seen this awful thing

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.410 
about it so I've seen this awful thing
and<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.570> next<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:50.009> the

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
and what can I do next and I think the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.420 
and what can I do next and I think the
success<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.780> divine<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.500> Fairtrade<00:01:53.040> has<00:01:53.250> been

success of divine and Fairtrade has been

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.889 
success of divine and Fairtrade has been
that<00:01:53.640> we've<00:01:53.790> offered<00:01:53.970> people<00:01:54.299> something<00:01:54.720> that

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that we've offered people something that

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.580 
that we've offered people something that
they<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.320> do<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:56.219> we've<00:01:56.490> also<00:01:57.590> shortened

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
they can do I think we've also shortened

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.310 
they can do I think we've also shortened
the<00:01:59.159> distance<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.719> chocolate<00:02:01.110> comes

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the distance so that the chocolate comes

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
the distance so that the chocolate comes

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
half thousand miles away and so that

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.280

as a consumer that that's the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.460 
as a consumer that that's the
relationship<00:02:32.180> you<00:02:32.359> have<00:02:32.599> and<00:02:32.900> that<00:02:33.019> you<00:02:33.109> can

actually own 45% of the company then you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.770 
actually own 45% of the company then you
can<00:02:42.680> make<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.430> difference<00:02:43.730> between<00:02:43.909> choosing

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
can make the difference between choosing

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.300 
can make the difference between choosing
to<00:02:44.900> buy<00:02:44.989> something<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.650> doesn't<00:02:46.129> guarantee

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
to buy something that doesn't guarantee

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.710 
to buy something that doesn't guarantee
that<00:02:46.549> people<00:02:46.819> can<00:02:47.150> afford<00:02:47.359> to<00:02:47.510> send<00:02:47.599> their

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
that people can afford to send their

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.059 
that people can afford to send their
children<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.139> school<00:02:48.379> and<00:02:48.530> put<00:02:48.650> food<00:02:48.829> on<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
children to school and put food on the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.009 
children to school and put food on the
table<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.639> something<00:02:49.819> that<00:02:50.030> does<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:50.989> I

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
table and something that does and so I

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.690 
table and something that does and so I
think<00:02:51.139> it's<00:02:51.379> very<00:02:51.470> important<00:02:52.159> to<00:02:52.250> make<00:02:52.400> people

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
think it's very important to make people

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.059 
think it's very important to make people
not<00:02:52.819> feel<00:02:53.060> useless<00:02:53.689> and<00:02:53.870> hopeless<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.500> so<00:02:54.590> I

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
not feel useless and hopeless and so I

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.679 
not feel useless and hopeless and so I
think<00:02:55.310> where<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.489> don't<00:02:55.669> like<00:02:56.030> what<00:02:56.239> charities

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
think where I don't like what charities

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:58.089 
think where I don't like what charities
do<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.049> when<00:02:57.200> they<00:02:57.349> show<00:02:57.379> you<00:02:57.620> things<00:02:57.950> that

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
do is when they show you things that

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.099 
do is when they show you things that
just<00:02:58.280> seem<00:02:58.459> absolutely<00:02:58.930> overwhelming<00:02:59.930> and

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:00.109 
just seem absolutely overwhelming and

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.259 
just seem absolutely overwhelming and
out<00:03:00.500> of<00:03:00.709> control<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.430> if<00:03:01.790> you<00:03:01.879> can't<00:03:02.120> do

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
out of control and if you can't do

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:03.039 
out of control and if you can't do
anything<00:03:02.480> about<00:03:02.689> it

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
anything about it

out our shop clearly we wanted to

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.110 
out our shop clearly we wanted to
convert<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.889> major<00:03:28.069> chocolate<00:03:28.489> companies<00:03:28.909> to

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
threat of a good example we wanted to

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.890 
threat of a good example we wanted to
show<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.430> if<00:03:34.639> a<00:03:34.729> small<00:03:34.970> company<00:03:35.510> could<00:03:35.750> do

show that if a small company could do
business<00:03:36.229> well<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.739> be<00:03:37.400> a<00:03:37.430> success<00:03:38.030> then

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
business well and be a success then

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.270 
business well and be a success then
shouldn't<00:03:38.720> big<00:03:38.840> companies<00:03:39.229> do<00:03:39.379> that<00:03:39.409> too<00:03:39.829> so

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
shouldn't big companies do that too so

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.039 
shouldn't big companies do that too so
clearly<00:03:40.579> we<00:03:40.790> wanted<00:03:41.180> Cadbury's<00:03:41.569> to<00:03:41.720> convert

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
clearly we wanted Cadbury's to convert

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:43.780 
clearly we wanted Cadbury's to convert
to<00:03:42.199> Fairtrade<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.099> we're<00:03:43.250> really<00:03:43.430> pleased

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
to Fairtrade so we're really pleased

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.520 
to Fairtrade so we're really pleased
that<00:03:44.000> they<00:03:44.239> have<00:03:44.479> converted<00:03:45.079> Cadbury's<00:03:45.500> Dairy

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
that they have converted Cadbury's Dairy

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.979 
that they have converted Cadbury's Dairy
Milk<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.370> Fairtrade<00:03:46.819> we'd<00:03:47.299> like<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.659> see<00:03:47.810> them

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
Milk to Fairtrade we'd like to see them

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:49.539 
Milk to Fairtrade we'd like to see them
convert<00:03:48.349> the<00:03:48.590> rest<00:03:48.769> of<00:03:48.919> their<00:03:49.010> chocolate<00:03:49.340> bars

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
convert the rest of their chocolate bars

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.899 
convert the rest of their chocolate bars
to<00:03:49.729> Fairtrade<00:03:50.150> but<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.349> think<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.250> thing<00:03:52.459> and

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:52.909 
to Fairtrade but I think the thing and

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:54.699 
to Fairtrade but I think the thing and
that<00:03:53.150> has<00:03:53.359> delivered<00:03:53.629> real<00:03:54.079> benefits<00:03:54.620> to

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
that has delivered real benefits to

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.740 
that has delivered real benefits to
cocoa<00:03:55.040> farmers<00:03:55.370> in<00:03:55.519> Ghana<00:03:55.699> because<00:03:56.209> they

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
cocoa farmers in Ghana because they

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.719 
cocoa farmers in Ghana because they
obviously<00:03:57.260> use<00:03:57.739> a<00:03:57.769> much<00:03:58.040> bigger<00:03:58.220> volume<00:03:58.430> of

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:58.729 
obviously use a much bigger volume of

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.119 
obviously use a much bigger volume of
cocoa<00:03:58.939> beans<00:03:59.209> than<00:03:59.510> divine<00:03:59.840> can<00:04:00.079> can<00:04:00.889> use

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
cocoa beans than divine can can use

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:03.129 
cocoa beans than divine can can use
because<00:04:01.879> they<00:04:02.120> have<00:04:02.239> a<00:04:02.269> much<00:04:02.479> bigger<00:04:02.659> market

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
because they have a much bigger market

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.830 
because they have a much bigger market
share<00:04:03.970> but<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.000> think<00:04:05.269> what<00:04:05.419> you<00:04:05.510> need<00:04:05.540> to

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
share but I think what you need to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360 
share but I think what you need to
recognize<00:04:06.290> is<00:04:06.560> that<00:04:06.709> ten<00:04:06.919> years<00:04:07.159> ago<00:04:07.189> that

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
recognize is that ten years ago that

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.770 
recognize is that ten years ago that
really<00:04:07.639> wouldn't<00:04:07.909> have<00:04:08.090> been<00:04:08.239> possible<00:04:08.389> and

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
really wouldn't have been possible and

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.939 
really wouldn't have been possible and
it<00:04:08.840> wouldn't<00:04:09.049> have<00:04:09.139> been<00:04:09.199> possible<00:04:09.739> for<00:04:09.799> a

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
it wouldn't have been possible for a

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.499 
it wouldn't have been possible for a
number<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.250> reasons<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:11.030> wouldn't<00:04:11.269> have<00:04:11.359> been

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:11.509 
number of reasons it wouldn't have been

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.059 
number of reasons it wouldn't have been
possible<00:04:11.659> because<00:04:12.079> there<00:04:12.379> wasn't<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.739> market

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
possible because there wasn't a market

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.860 
possible because there wasn't a market
for<00:04:13.250> Fairtrade<00:04:13.669> so<00:04:14.030> consumers<00:04:14.569> weren't

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
for Fairtrade so consumers weren't

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.279 
for Fairtrade so consumers weren't

asking for that guarantee what we've

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.960 
asking for that guarantee what we've
done<00:04:18.530> over<00:04:18.650> the<00:04:18.769> 10<00:04:19.039> years<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.400> established

they're potentially prepared to go to a

that there is a market demand but we've
