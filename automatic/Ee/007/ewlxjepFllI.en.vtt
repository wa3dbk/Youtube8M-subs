thing you need to do is get 300 kills
with<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.589> the<00:00:22.739> marksman<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.789> handling

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
with this is the marksman the handling

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.409 
with this is the marksman the handling
is<00:00:24.390> +1<00:00:24.749> mobility<00:00:25.589> plus<00:00:25.979> 1<00:00:26.249> equal<00:00:26.699> C<00:00:26.819> minus<00:00:27.089> 1

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
is +1 mobility plus 1 equal C minus 1

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.599 
is +1 mobility plus 1 equal C minus 1
fire<00:00:27.689> rate<00:00:27.929> minus<00:00:28.199> 1<00:00:28.559> and<00:00:29.159> the<00:00:29.249> thing<00:00:29.399> about

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
fire rate minus 1 and the thing about

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.429 
fire rate minus 1 and the thing about
the<00:00:29.759> Atlas<00:00:30.149> is<00:00:30.389> that<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.079> have<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.229> lot<00:00:31.409> of

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the Atlas is that it don't have a lot of

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.229 
the Atlas is that it don't have a lot of
bullets<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> lot<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> people<00:00:32.850> would

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
bullets in it so a lot of people would

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.569 
bullets in it so a lot of people would
like<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.960> variance<00:00:34.379> with<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.920> bullet

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
like the variance with more bullet

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.240 
like the variance with more bullet
capacity<00:00:36.239> in<00:00:36.480> it<00:00:36.629> so<00:00:37.109> what<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.710> come<00:00:38.010> on

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
capacity in it so what I will come on

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.610 
capacity in it so what I will come on
we'll<00:00:39.179> get<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.449> that<00:00:39.480> later<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:40.019> the<00:00:40.079> video<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
we'll get to that later in the video so

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
we'll get to that later in the video so
the<00:00:41.070> next<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.489> improved<00:00:42.239> action<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the next one is improved action is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.369 
the next one is improved action is
enlisted<00:00:43.789> magazine<00:00:44.789> capacity<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.629> +1<00:00:46.019> which

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
enlisted magazine capacity is +1 which

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.639 
enlisted magazine capacity is +1 which
is<00:00:46.530> good<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.980> handling<00:00:47.760> is<00:00:47.910> minus<00:00:48.269> 1<00:00:48.410> so<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.440> lot

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
is good and handling is minus 1 so a lot

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.680 
is good and handling is minus 1 so a lot
of<00:00:49.679> people<00:00:49.949> would<00:00:50.129> like<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:51.120> magazine

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
of people would like that the magazine

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.419 
of people would like that the magazine
capacity<00:00:51.870> plus<00:00:52.440> 1<00:00:52.710> because<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.280> more

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:53.429 
capacity plus 1 because you have more

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:56.209 
capacity plus 1 because you have more
bullets<00:00:53.820> less<00:00:54.600> time<00:00:54.960> reloading<00:00:55.620> which<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
bullets less time reloading which is

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.040 
bullets less time reloading which is
which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> great<00:00:56.909> so<00:00:57.269> let's<00:00:57.570> go<00:00:57.749> to<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.960> next

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
which is great so let's go to the next

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.270 
which is great so let's go to the next
one<00:00:58.170> which<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:58.890> 13<00:00:59.550> twist<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.149> listed

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
one which is 13 twist and listed

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.929 
one which is 13 twist and listed
accuracy<00:01:02.280> plus<00:01:02.579> 1<00:01:02.819> fire<00:01:03.149> rate<00:01:03.359> minus<00:01:03.749> 1

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
accuracy plus 1 fire rate minus 1

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.539 
accuracy plus 1 fire rate minus 1
accuracy<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.149> it's<00:01:06.450> good<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:07.380> fire<00:01:07.770> rate<00:01:08.070> Stroup

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
accuracy up it's good a fire rate Stroup

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.280 
accuracy up it's good a fire rate Stroup
slower<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.030> this<00:01:09.210> gun<00:01:09.390> shoots<00:01:09.659> fast<00:01:09.990> though
