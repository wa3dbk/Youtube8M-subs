00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
more challenging you know I thought that

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.320 
more challenging you know I thought that
here<00:01:17.470> it's<00:01:17.649> more<00:01:17.890> students<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:18.850> more<00:01:19.000> into

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
here it's more students and more into

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.060 
here it's more students and more into
actually<00:01:19.840> learning<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.229> material<00:01:20.380> whereas

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
actually learning the material whereas

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.670 
actually learning the material whereas
in<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.910> public<00:01:22.240> school<00:01:22.420> setting<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:23.140> seems<00:01:23.500> that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
in a public school setting it seems that

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.300 
in a public school setting it seems that
most<00:01:23.860> kids<00:01:24.159> are<00:01:24.369> lost<00:01:24.549> in<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.880> shuffle

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
most kids are lost in the shuffle

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.039 
most kids are lost in the shuffle
especially<00:01:27.310> for<00:01:27.430> my<00:01:27.610> kids<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.299> I<00:01:28.509> had<00:01:28.810> last
