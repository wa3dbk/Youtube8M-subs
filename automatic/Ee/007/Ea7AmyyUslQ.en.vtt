but when you play the card it'll say if

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.850 
but when you play the card it'll say if
you<00:04:23.370> need<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.730> use<00:04:23.910> these<00:04:24.150> pieces<00:04:27.860> that's

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
you need to use these pieces that's

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.820 
you need to use these pieces that's
roughly<00:04:29.430> about<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:32.240> so<00:04:33.240> really<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.500> need<00:04:34.680> to

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
roughly about it so really you need to

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.200 
roughly about it so really you need to
have<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.190> arena<00:04:36.740> which<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:38.160> assemble<00:04:38.670> with
