them in the vegetable oil there's room

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.349 
them in the vegetable oil there's room
temperature<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.759> they<00:01:35.880> go<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
temperature and then they go to the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:43.039 
temperature and then they go to the
stove<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.020> around<00:01:40.280> 10-15<00:01:41.630> minutes<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
stove so it's around 10-15 minutes that

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.429 
stove so it's around 10-15 minutes that
the<00:01:43.439> fries<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.219> been<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> oil<00:01:45.109> after<00:01:46.109> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the fries have been in the oil after it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.649 
the fries have been in the oil after it
reached<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.859> boiling<00:01:47.039> point<00:01:47.219> and<00:01:47.819> I<00:01:48.569> think

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
reached a boiling point and I think

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.840
