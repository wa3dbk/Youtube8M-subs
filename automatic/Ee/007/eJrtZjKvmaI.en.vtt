00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:12.170
 the first most important championship that 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:15.840
 I won was in the year 1973 to get 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:20.340
 world champion in cadaquÃ©s 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.660
 championship naturally difficult for a 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.150
 young like me who had not won 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.630
 important championships apart from this 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:32.500
 I was noguera and I was a perfect connoisseur 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.949
 of the area was scarpatti maximums that 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.140
 for me it was at that time the 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.489
 best fisherman that existed in question 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.489
 of for grouper fishing 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.899
 ah 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:10.590
 I saw before starting the championship 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.170
 that most likely he will win because 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.820
 I had a house someone everyone is 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 he knew the area perfectly 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.870
 but hey there was a lot of difference 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.820
 age I was a little older I was very 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.530
 young and eager to compete 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.490
 win important championships 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.490
 on the first day I remember what 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.390
 his followed but with the 17 or 18 kilos 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 that was the biggest piece of this day 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.409
 together with created 2 - more smaller 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.950
 and some pieces 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.950
 Y 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.070
 and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.070
 Y
