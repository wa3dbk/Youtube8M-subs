chance of pulling a bronzer than a
silver<00:03:13.879> which<00:03:14.359> in<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.629> case<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.930> good<00:03:15.440> so

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
silver which in this case is good so

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.990 
silver which in this case is good so
we'll<00:03:16.579> try<00:03:16.849> to<00:03:17.620> finish<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.949> real<00:03:19.190> quick<00:03:19.489> two

players and we'll just go to prices and
we'll<00:04:02.359> see<00:04:02.569> how<00:04:03.169> much<00:04:03.230> they<00:04:03.500> go<00:04:03.650> for<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.040> if<00:04:04.099> we

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
we'll see how much they go for so if we

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.460 
we'll see how much they go for so if we
do<00:04:04.280> 3,000<00:04:05.090> if<00:04:05.510> they're<00:04:05.750> coming<00:04:06.049> up<00:04:06.109> like<00:04:06.319> this

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
do 3,000 if they're coming up like this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.930 
do 3,000 if they're coming up like this
obviously<00:04:07.190> you<00:04:07.250> don't<00:04:07.370> want<00:04:07.400> to<00:04:07.549> snipe<00:04:07.790> them

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
obviously you don't want to snipe them

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.990 
obviously you don't want to snipe them
it's<00:04:08.269> not<00:04:08.389> a<00:04:08.449> slight<00:04:08.750> so<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.739> want<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.280> go<00:04:10.400> keep

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
it's not a slight so you want to go keep

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.089 
it's not a slight so you want to go keep
going<00:04:11.030> lower<00:04:11.540> and<00:04:11.690> lower<00:04:11.959> until<00:04:12.349> you<00:04:12.859> get<00:04:12.979> to

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
going lower and lower until you get to

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.500 
going lower and lower until you get to
that<00:04:13.129> breaking<00:04:13.459> point<00:04:14.030> where<00:04:14.239> like<00:04:14.510> this

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
that breaking point where like this

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.190 
that breaking point where like this
as<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.590> see<00:04:17.860> there<00:04:18.100> are<00:04:18.960> you<00:04:19.960> know<00:04:20.080> what

I'm saying it's like these ones are

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.450 
I'm saying it's like these ones are
Snipes<00:04:22.960> because<00:04:23.230> all<00:04:23.470> these<00:04:23.650> players<00:04:23.890> go<00:04:24.190> for

very<00:06:00.370> very<00:06:01.000> difficult<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.810> people<00:06:02.140> might

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:02.440 
very very difficult the people might

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.900 
very very difficult the people might
pull<00:06:02.590> each<00:06:02.740> other<00:06:02.980> really<00:06:03.220> good<00:06:03.460> guys<00:06:03.700> and
