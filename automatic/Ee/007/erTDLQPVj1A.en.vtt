now<00:00:00.450> when<00:00:00.599> you<00:00:00.690> go<00:00:00.840> underneath<00:00:01.199> the<00:00:01.469> vehicle

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
now when you go underneath the vehicle

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.230 
now when you go underneath the vehicle
you<00:00:02.010> want<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.250> take<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> look<00:00:02.639> at<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.820> few<00:00:03.030> things

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
you want to take a look at a few things

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.510 
you want to take a look at a few things
around<00:00:04.200> your<00:00:04.440> rear<00:00:04.589> differential<00:00:05.100> you<00:00:05.370> want

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
around your rear differential you want

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.430 
around your rear differential you want
to<00:00:05.609> see<00:00:05.759> if<00:00:05.879> it's<00:00:06.029> leaking<00:00:06.330> that's<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.170> fairly

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
to see if it's leaking that's a fairly

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.890 
to see if it's leaking that's a fairly
expensive<00:00:07.919> job<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:09.179> want<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.510> check<00:00:09.719> your

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
expensive job you want to check your

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.990 
expensive job you want to check your
brakes<00:00:10.200> on<00:00:10.469> all<00:00:10.500> four<00:00:11.040> corners<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.639> make<00:00:11.790> sure

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
brakes on all four corners to make sure

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.580 
brakes on all four corners to make sure
not<00:00:12.179> only<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.599> there's<00:00:12.780> some<00:00:12.929> pads<00:00:13.230> there

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
not only that there's some pads there

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.539 
not only that there's some pads there
and<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.769> have<00:00:13.920> to<00:00:14.009> go<00:00:14.099> around<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.370> other<00:00:14.429> side

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
and I have to go around the other side

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.660 
and I have to go around the other side
for<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.480> side<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.440> also<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:17.490> they've

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
for that that side but also that they've

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.279 
for that that side but also that they've
been<00:00:17.880> done<00:00:18.090> recently<00:00:18.359> in<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.900> they're<00:00:19.140> in

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
been done recently in that they're in

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230 
been done recently in that they're in
pretty<00:00:19.470> good<00:00:19.650> shape<00:00:19.789> you<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.060> take<00:00:21.210> a

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
pretty good shape you want to take a

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.779 
pretty good shape you want to take a
look<00:00:21.510> at<00:00:21.600> your<00:00:21.720> brake<00:00:21.990> rotors<00:00:22.410> okay<00:00:22.980> right<00:00:23.580> up

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
look at your brake rotors okay right up

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
look at your brake rotors okay right up
in<00:00:23.970> here<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> can<00:00:24.480> glimpse<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.109> okay<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
in here you can glimpse it okay but you

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.109 
in here you can glimpse it okay but you
probably<00:00:26.250> want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> take<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.730> least<00:00:26.789> one<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
probably want to take at least one of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.939 
probably want to take at least one of
your<00:00:27.180> wheels<00:00:27.390> off<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.990> front<00:00:28.289> because

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
your wheels off on the front because

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
your wheels off on the front because
very<00:00:29.160> often<00:00:29.580> under<00:00:29.730> hard<00:00:30.060> braking<00:00:30.119> conditions

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
very often under hard braking conditions

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.470 
very often under hard braking conditions
the<00:00:31.410> brake<00:00:31.920> rotors<00:00:32.309> will<00:00:32.460> get<00:00:32.640> cracks<00:00:33.030> in<00:00:33.329> them

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the brake rotors will get cracks in them

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690 
the brake rotors will get cracks in them
and<00:00:33.870> that's<00:00:34.050> even<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:34.739> have<00:00:34.920> new<00:00:35.130> pads<00:00:35.430> on

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and that's even if they have new pads on

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.430 
and that's even if they have new pads on
them<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:36.270> going<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.540> have<00:00:36.690> some<00:00:36.960> squealing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
them you're going to have some squealing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.260 
them you're going to have some squealing
and<00:00:37.620> some<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.309> longevity<00:00:38.520> problems

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and some and some longevity problems

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.119 
and some and some longevity problems
with<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.450> rotors<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:39.899> again<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.710> costs

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
with the rotors and again that costs

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.700 
with the rotors and again that costs
money<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.579> replace<00:00:41.930> you<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.260> want<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> take<00:00:43.649> a

usually<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.260> leak<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.710> on<00:01:07.860> top<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.460> engine

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
usually a leak up on top of the engine

usually a leak up on top of the engine
from<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:09.030> high-pressure<00:01:09.390> pump<00:01:09.810> or<00:01:09.960> from

from a high-pressure pump or from
something<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.159> there<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:12.330> want<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.540> take<00:01:12.689> a

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
something up there we want to take a

something up there we want to take a
look<00:01:12.930> around<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> transmission<00:01:13.920> pan<00:01:14.189> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
look around the transmission pan and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.980 
look around the transmission pan and
check<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.150> seal<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> rear<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
check your seal at the rear of the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
check your seal at the rear of the
transmission<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:17.070> make<00:01:17.250> sure<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.729> not

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
transmission to make sure that it's not

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.210 
transmission to make sure that it's not
pouring<00:01:18.299> fluid<00:01:18.659> from<00:01:18.810> anywhere<00:01:19.110> is<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.979> pan

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pouring fluid from anywhere is the pan

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.609 
pouring fluid from anywhere is the pan
cleaner<00:01:20.759> than<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> rest<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> vehicle

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
cleaner than the rest of the vehicle

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.590 
cleaner than the rest of the vehicle
underneath<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.580> means<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.030> probably

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
underneath that means it is probably

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.530 
underneath that means it is probably
been<00:01:24.840> serviced<00:01:25.320> fairly<00:01:25.799> regularly<00:01:26.390> now<00:01:27.390> I'm

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
been serviced fairly regularly now I'm

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
been serviced fairly regularly now I'm
going<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> show<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.049> something<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:29.009> is

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
going to show you something now that is

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.740 
going to show you something now that is
probably<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> single<00:01:30.000> best<00:01:30.210> thing<00:01:30.540> in<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
probably the single best thing in this

you<00:01:39.000> know<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> motor<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.869> of<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.020> truck

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
you know a motor that's out of a truck

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.140 
you know a motor that's out of a truck
and<00:01:40.500> here's<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:40.979> exhaust<00:01:41.340> manifold<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and here's your exhaust manifold this is

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.670 
and here's your exhaust manifold this is
the<00:01:42.270> front<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.780> goes<00:01:42.960> towards<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.470> rear

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the front and it goes towards the rear

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.950 
the front and it goes towards the rear
and<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.369> tube<00:01:44.640> goes<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
and then this tube goes up to the to the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.630 
and then this tube goes up to the to the
turbocharger<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> see<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.130> behind<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
turbocharger you see it behind the
