bring<00:02:01.340> it<00:02:01.430> all<00:02:01.610> the<00:02:01.640> way<00:02:01.790> down<00:02:02.710> we<00:02:03.710> make

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
bring it all the way down we make

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.410 
bring it all the way down we make
another<00:02:04.130> wrapped<00:02:04.400> loop<00:02:04.670> so<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.030> take<00:02:05.270> our

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
another wrapped loop so we take our

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.800 
another wrapped loop so we take our
chain<00:02:05.659> nose<00:02:06.010> make<00:02:07.010> our<00:02:07.159> 90-degree<00:02:07.700> angle<00:02:08.030> take

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
chain nose make our 90-degree angle take

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.590 
chain nose make our 90-degree angle take
our<00:02:08.959> round<00:02:09.170> nose<00:02:11.680> finish<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.860> loop<00:02:13.420> close<00:02:14.420> it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
our round nose finish the loop close it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.510 
our round nose finish the loop close it
off<00:02:14.720> but<00:02:14.990> this<00:02:15.170> time<00:02:15.410> we're<00:02:15.650> not<00:02:15.680> trimming<00:02:16.400> off

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
off but this time we're not trimming off

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.260 
off but this time we're not trimming off
that<00:02:16.730> tail<00:02:16.970> we<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.510> keep<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.780> on<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.120> we're

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
that tail we want to keep it on so we're

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.309 
that tail we want to keep it on so we're
left<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:21.140> our<00:02:21.440> B<00:02:22.190> looking<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:24.110> now

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
left with our B looking like that so now

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.900 
left with our B looking like that so now
we're<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.739> go<00:02:24.890> ahead<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.550> like<00:02:25.760> to

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
we're going to go ahead and I like to

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.479 
we're going to go ahead and I like to
use<00:02:25.940> my<00:02:26.239> finger<00:02:26.600> to<00:02:26.810> kind<00:02:26.959> of<00:02:27.080> contour<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
use my finger to kind of contour the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.030 
use my finger to kind of contour the
wire<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:29.030> little<00:02:29.390> bit<00:02:29.510> before<00:02:29.780> I<00:02:30.260> bring<00:02:30.890> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
wire a little bit before I bring it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.520 
wire a little bit before I bring it
around<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.580> bead<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:31.940> this<00:02:32.810> helps<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.350> keep

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
around the bead and this helps to keep

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.509 
around the bead and this helps to keep
that<00:02:33.769> curve<00:02:34.070> nice<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:35.019> circular<00:02:36.400> so<00:02:37.400> I'm

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
that curve nice and circular so I'm

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.890 
that curve nice and circular so I'm
going<00:02:37.670> to<00:02:37.730> wrap<00:02:37.850> it<00:02:37.880> around<00:02:38.090> the<00:02:38.330> bead<00:02:38.510> first

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
going to wrap it around the bead first

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.990 
going to wrap it around the bead first
and<00:02:39.290> then<00:02:39.920> I'm<00:02:40.010> going<00:02:40.160> to<00:02:40.220> bump<00:02:40.489> it<00:02:40.640> out<00:02:40.730> and

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
and then I'm going to bump it out and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.780 
and then I'm going to bump it out and
this<00:02:41.780> all<00:02:42.170> depends<00:02:42.830> on<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.130> spacing<00:02:43.550> that<00:02:43.640> you

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
this all depends on the spacing that you

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.520 
this all depends on the spacing that you
want<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.090> have<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.540> between<00:02:44.930> your<00:02:45.110> bead<00:02:45.320> and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
want to have in between your bead and

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.340 
want to have in between your bead and
the<00:02:46.250> wire<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:47.120> can<00:02:47.269> have<00:02:47.450> more<00:02:47.870> if<00:02:47.989> you'd<00:02:48.170> like

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
the wire you can have more if you'd like

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.259 
the wire you can have more if you'd like
you<00:02:48.620> just<00:02:48.800> bump<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.100> out<00:02:49.160> even<00:02:49.489> more<00:02:49.519> or<00:02:49.880> you

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
you just bump it out even more or you

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.060 
you just bump it out even more or you
can<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.630> less<00:02:50.900> you<00:02:51.260> could<00:02:51.440> even<00:02:51.590> have<00:02:51.860> it

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
can have less you could even have it

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.300 
can have less you could even have it
going<00:02:52.790> right<00:02:53.000> to<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.780> pearl<00:02:53.989> itself<00:02:54.410> but

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
going right to the pearl itself but

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.710 
going right to the pearl itself but
right<00:02:55.519> now<00:02:55.670> I'm<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.060> keep<00:02:56.239> my<00:02:56.390> spacing

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
right now I'm going to keep my spacing

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.780 
right now I'm going to keep my spacing
about<00:02:57.140> here<00:02:57.530> and<00:02:57.950> I<00:02:58.040> want<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.310> make<00:02:58.459> sure<00:02:58.610> that

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
about here and I want to make sure that

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.300 
about here and I want to make sure that
it<00:02:58.910> kind<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.180> meets<00:02:59.510> the<00:03:00.440> same<00:03:00.650> spacing<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.250> I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
it kind of meets the same spacing that I

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.449 
it kind of meets the same spacing that I
have<00:03:01.550> on<00:03:01.790> my<00:03:01.819> other<00:03:02.150> earring<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:04.280> looks

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
have on my other earring and it looks

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.150 
have on my other earring and it looks
pretty<00:03:04.700> good<00:03:04.880> so<00:03:04.940> I'm<00:03:05.239> going<00:03:05.420> to<00:03:05.450> go<00:03:05.630> ahead<00:03:05.720> and

while I'm holding the wire and the bead

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.550 
while I'm holding the wire and the bead
I'm<00:03:09.200> going<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.160> pull<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:13.549> wire<00:03:13.760> around<00:03:14.560> my

I'm going to pull the wire around my

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.940 
I'm going to pull the wire around my

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.740 
go ahead and do the same thing on the
other<00:03:20.329> side<00:03:20.950> I'm<00:03:21.950> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.220> contour<00:03:22.670> my<00:03:23.510> wire

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
other side I'm going to contour my wire

and following the spacing now this is

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.670 
and following the spacing now this is
going<00:03:33.240> to<00:03:33.300> be<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:36.540> opposite<00:03:36.990> direction<00:03:37.110> so

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
going to be in the opposite direction so

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670 
going to be in the opposite direction so
I<00:03:38.100> want<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.580> put<00:03:38.819> my<00:03:39.240> beads<00:03:39.540> up<00:03:39.780> here<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:40.350> need<00:03:40.590> to

I want to put my beads up here I need to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.170 
I want to put my beads up here I need to
anchor<00:03:40.980> them<00:03:41.130> over<00:03:41.370> here<00:03:41.580> with<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.850> micro
