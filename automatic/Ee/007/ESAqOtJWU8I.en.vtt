this reveal screen and it's that the
text<00:00:38.550> doesn't<00:00:38.850> match<00:00:39.149> any<00:00:39.450> of<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.750> other

version<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.440> already<00:00:46.710> out<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.190> everybody

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
version was already out so everybody

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.400 
version was already out so everybody
knew<00:00:47.910> they're<00:00:48.059> already<00:00:48.329> characters<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
knew they're already characters but the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
knew they're already characters but the
text<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.770> those<00:00:49.920> screen<00:00:50.219> still<00:00:50.489> matches<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
text on those screen still matches the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
text on those screen still matches the
rest<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.629> rosters<00:00:52.079> reveal<00:00:52.440> screen<00:00:52.800> but

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
rest of the rosters reveal screen but

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.430 
rest of the rosters reveal screen but
for<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.670> reason<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.059> Rayman<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.840> seems<00:00:55.320> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
for some reason the Rayman one seems to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900 
for some reason the Rayman one seems to
be<00:00:55.620> using<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:55.949> text<00:00:56.280> from<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.460> character

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
be using the text from the character

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
be using the text from the character
select<00:00:57.270> screen<00:00:57.390> rather<00:00:58.260> than<00:00:58.590> from<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
select screen rather than from the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
select screen rather than from the
reveal<00:00:59.399> trailers<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:00.870> bit<00:01:01.020> odd

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
reveal trailers that's a little bit odd

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.229 
reveal trailers that's a little bit odd
to<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.070> guess<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.609> total

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to me but I guess it's not total

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.840 
to me but I guess it's not total
evidence<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.840> isn't<00:01:04.080> real<00:01:04.530> yet

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
evidence that this isn't real yet

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.340 
evidence that this isn't real yet
speaking<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> roster<00:01:06.450> we<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:06.900> also<00:01:07.020> given

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
speaking of the roster we are also given

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
speaking of the roster we are also given
a<00:01:07.439> shot<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> character<00:01:08.310> select<00:01:08.640> screen

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
a shot of the character select screen

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.240 
a shot of the character select screen
showing<00:01:09.420> not<00:01:09.570> only<00:01:09.840> Rain<00:01:10.320> Man<00:01:10.350> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.770> roster

but<00:01:11.280> also<00:01:11.670> Mewtwo<00:01:12.299> this<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.380> gives<00:01:13.830> some

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
but also Mewtwo this also gives some

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.800 
but also Mewtwo this also gives some
possible<00:01:14.430> validity<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> leak<00:01:15.360> because

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
possible validity to the leak because

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.300 
possible validity to the leak because
Mewtwo<00:01:16.200> resides<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.770> characters<00:01:17.250> from

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
Mewtwo resides with the characters from

Mewtwo resides with the characters from
the<00:01:17.460> Pokemon<00:01:17.880> series<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.450> rayman<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.320> with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
the Pokemon series and rayman is with

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
the Pokemon series and rayman is with
the<00:01:19.619> third<00:01:19.830> party<00:01:20.189> characters<00:01:20.549> down<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:20.820> the

the third party characters down at the

the third party characters down at the
bottom<00:01:21.180> row<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.140> could<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.830> clever

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
bottom row this could just be clever

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
bottom row this could just be clever
photoshopping<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.390> if<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.780> were

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
photoshopping because if I were

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.899 
photoshopping because if I were
releasing<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.470> fake<00:01:25.680> leak<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:26.189> would<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:26.759> my<00:01:26.880> best

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
releasing a fake leak I would do my best

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.280 
releasing a fake leak I would do my best
to<00:01:27.240> make<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.479> look<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.750> legitimate<00:01:28.170> as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to make it look as legitimate as

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.649 
to make it look as legitimate as
possible<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.040> putting<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.820> characters<00:01:30.450> with

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
possible and putting the characters with

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.350 
possible and putting the characters with
their<00:01:30.810> proper<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.979> know<00:01:32.009> series<00:01:32.579> or<00:01:32.820> down

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
their proper you know series or down

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.730 
their proper you know series or down
there<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> third-party<00:01:34.110> ones<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.560> just

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
there with the third-party ones it just

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980 
there with the third-party ones it just
seems<00:01:34.950> like<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> thing<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.460> should<00:01:35.759> do<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
seems like the thing you should do the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
seems like the thing you should do the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
4th images of rain man being hovered

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.550

over by player 1 ready to be selected
this<00:01:40.770> looks<00:01:41.579> legitimate<00:01:41.970> particularly<00:01:42.840> with

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
this looks legitimate particularly with

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.080 
this looks legitimate particularly with

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the series icon just behind him this

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.580 
the series icon just behind him this
render<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.540> interesting<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.409> matches

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
render is interesting because it matches

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.410 
render is interesting because it matches

this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:53.100> solid<00:01:53.460> evidence<00:01:54.000> because

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
this is some very solid evidence because

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.209 
this is some very solid evidence because
Sakurai<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> definitely<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> add<00:01:56.009> this

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
Sakurai is definitely one to add this

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.830 
Sakurai is definitely one to add this

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
simply the real deal personally I think

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.320 
simply the real deal personally I think
this<00:02:14.129> leak<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> real<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.000> we're<00:02:15.180> going

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
this leak is real and that we're going

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.180 
this leak is real and that we're going
to<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.629> a<00:02:15.660> pair<00:02:15.959> release<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.500> Mewtwo<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:16.920> Rain

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
to see a pair release of Mewtwo and Rain

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.979 
to see a pair release of Mewtwo and Rain
Man<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.580> mean<00:02:18.150> there<00:02:18.300> are<00:02:18.330> always<00:02:18.540> those<00:02:18.690> random

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
Man I mean there are always those random

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.020 
Man I mean there are always those random
Rain<00:02:19.349> Man<00:02:19.379> trophies<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.099> Smash<00:02:20.370> 4<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.879> just

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
Rain Man trophies in Smash 4 that just

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
Rain Man trophies in Smash 4 that just
really<00:02:21.599> seemed<00:02:21.840> out<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:21.989> place<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.010> this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
really seemed out of place and so this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.800 
really seemed out of place and so this
would<00:02:23.310> definitely<00:02:23.489> explain<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> event<00:02:24.510> Rain

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
would definitely explain the event Rain

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.110 
would definitely explain the event Rain
Man<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.050> going<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.410> DLC<00:02:25.920> character<00:02:26.400> so

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
Man is going to be a DLC character so

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.089 
Man is going to be a DLC character so
this<00:02:27.270> makes<00:02:27.480> me<00:02:27.599> think<00:02:27.629> for<00:02:28.080> future<00:02:28.440> DLC<00:02:29.069> but

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
this makes me think for future DLC but

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.040 
this makes me think for future DLC but
we<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.580> characters<00:02:29.879> released<00:02:30.360> in<00:02:30.510> pairs<00:02:30.780> a
