00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
compliment our audible so we'll add a

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.000 
compliment our audible so we'll add a
couple<00:03:24.730> plays<00:03:25.030> from<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.600> form<00:03:25.900> tight<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
for whatever reason some plays won't

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.100 
for whatever reason some plays won't
translate<00:03:33.459> over<00:03:33.760> into<00:03:34.030> your<00:03:34.510> quick<00:03:34.720> audibles

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
translate over into your quick audibles

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.020 
translate over into your quick audibles
but<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.830> mess<00:03:36.100> around<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:36.580> tinker<00:03:36.850> with<00:03:36.880> it

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
but just mess around and tinker with it

worked I want to know another quick

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.600 
worked I want to know another quick
thing<00:04:25.840> here<00:04:26.350> as<00:04:26.440> well<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.860> can<00:04:27.010> do<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.310> same

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
thing here as well you can do the same

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.930 
thing here as well you can do the same
exact<00:04:28.419> setup<00:04:29.289> for<00:04:30.130> your<00:04:30.370> defense

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
exact setup for your defense

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.630 
exact setup for your defense
playbook<00:04:31.210> so<00:04:31.360> it<00:04:31.450> doesn't<00:04:31.720> just<00:04:31.960> have<00:04:32.170> to<00:04:32.200> be

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
playbook so it doesn't just have to be

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.220 
playbook so it doesn't just have to be
for<00:04:33.640> often<00:04:33.880> so<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.300> can<00:04:34.450> do<00:04:34.630> offense<00:04:35.050> and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
for often so you can do offense and

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.080 
for often so you can do offense and
defense<00:04:35.560> so<00:04:35.740> here<00:04:35.920> we<00:04:36.010> have<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.370> plays<00:04:36.640> that

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
defense so here we have the plays that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.700 
defense so here we have the plays that
we<00:04:37.180> added<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:37.540> we<00:04:37.570> see<00:04:37.780> how<00:04:37.900> backdrop<00:04:38.350> mesh

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
we added so we see how backdrop mesh

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.980 
we added so we see how backdrop mesh
from<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.220> shotgun<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.640> back<00:04:39.910> half<00:04:40.510> back<00:04:40.750> slash
