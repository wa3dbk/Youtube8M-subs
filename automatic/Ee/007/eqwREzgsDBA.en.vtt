is Vivek now you have a really cool job
can<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.060> explain<00:00:18.359> what<00:00:18.810> we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.170> here<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
can you explain what we have here and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.269 
can you explain what we have here and
what<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:20.010> yeah<00:00:20.760> what<00:00:21.390> we<00:00:21.990> have<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
what you do yeah what we have here is a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
what you do yeah what we have here is a
moon<00:00:23.609> tire<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:25.050> we<00:00:25.170> do<00:00:25.380> is<00:00:25.619> try<00:00:25.830> to

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
moon tire and what we do is try to

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.849 
moon tire and what we do is try to
develop<00:00:26.189> tires<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.660> act<00:00:28.080> like<00:00:28.380> air<00:00:28.650> filled

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
develop tires that act like air filled

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.609 
develop tires that act like air filled
tires<00:00:28.970> but<00:00:29.970> don't<00:00:30.150> use<00:00:30.300> any<00:00:30.480> air<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.349> don't

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
tires but don't use any air and don't

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.620 
tires but don't use any air and don't
use<00:00:31.710> any<00:00:31.890> rubber<00:00:32.070> cool<00:00:32.790> so<00:00:33.030> what<00:00:33.180> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.480> on

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
use any rubber cool so what we have on

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.150 
use any rubber cool so what we have on
typical<00:00:34.110> cars<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.620> now<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:35.040> these

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
typical cars right now are these

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130 
typical cars right now are these
pneumatic<00:00:35.730> tires<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.180> air-filled<00:00:36.540> ones<00:00:36.840> kind

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
pneumatic tires the air-filled ones kind

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.450 
pneumatic tires the air-filled ones kind
of<00:00:37.200> like<00:00:37.380> what<00:00:37.559> you're<00:00:37.710> seeing<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
of like what you're seeing here on the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.030 
of like what you're seeing here on the
chariot<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.420> Rover<00:00:39.780> right<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.620> why

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
chariot right Rover right and so why

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.830 
chariot right Rover right and so why
would<00:00:41.070> we<00:00:41.520> want<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> go<00:00:41.850> away<00:00:41.969> from<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.420> for

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
would we want to go away from that for

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.010 
would we want to go away from that for
lunar<00:00:43.260> exploration<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.969> guess<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.899> first

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
lunar exploration so I guess the first

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
lunar exploration so I guess the first
point<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.410> for<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> manned<00:00:46.860> mission<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.399> can't

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
point is for a manned mission you can't

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.450 
point is for a manned mission you can't
have<00:00:47.789> an<00:00:47.910> airfield<00:00:48.239> structure<00:00:48.739> because<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:50.039> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
have an airfield structure because if it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850 
have an airfield structure because if it
goes<00:00:50.610> flat<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.420> aborts<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> mission<00:00:52.170> ok<00:00:52.620> good

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
goes flat it aborts the mission ok good

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.150 
goes flat it aborts the mission ok good
point<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.640> tires<00:00:53.879> bad<00:00:54.180> ok<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.800> second

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
point that tires bad ok and the second

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.619 
point that tires bad ok and the second
point<00:00:56.309> is<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> rubber<00:00:56.910> doesn't<00:00:57.270> work<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
point is that rubber doesn't work on the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.170 
point is that rubber doesn't work on the
moon<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.649> temperature<00:00:59.160> swings<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.760> extreme

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
moon the temperature swings are extreme

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.869 
moon the temperature swings are extreme
and<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:01.410> hot<00:01:01.620> temperature<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.280> rubber<00:01:02.520> soft

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
and in hot temperature is rubber soft

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.990 
and in hot temperature is rubber soft
and<00:01:03.600> cold<00:01:03.840> temperatures<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:04.470> brittle<00:01:04.739> ok<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
and cold temperatures very brittle ok so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.820 
and cold temperatures very brittle ok so
can<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> talk<00:01:06.840> me<00:01:07.080> through<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.439> bit<00:01:07.650> I

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
can you talk me through a little bit I

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.100 
can you talk me through a little bit I
mean<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.130> like<00:01:08.310> metal<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.119> plastic<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.990> all

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
mean it's like metal and plastic and all

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.969 
mean it's like metal and plastic and all
kinds<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> cool<00:01:10.650> stuff

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
kinds of cool stuff

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
kinds of cool stuff
what<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:11.430> have<00:01:11.610> here<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> we<00:01:12.869> work<00:01:13.080> with

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
what do we have here so we work with

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
what do we have here so we work with
some<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.770> major<00:01:13.920> tire<00:01:14.340> manufacturers

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
some of the major tire manufacturers

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.499 
some of the major tire manufacturers
this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.720> this<00:01:16.049> happens<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.790> lunar<00:01:18.299> tire

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
this is this happens to be a lunar tire

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.870 
this is this happens to be a lunar tire
we<00:01:18.720> developed<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> partnership<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.460> Michelin

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
we developed a partnership with Michelin

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.020 
we developed a partnership with Michelin
ok<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.720> cool<00:01:21.930> they<00:01:22.140> call<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> tuile<00:01:23.030> tire

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
ok very cool they call it the tuile tire

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.590 
ok very cool they call it the tuile tire
and<00:01:24.299> wheel<00:01:24.479> nice<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:26.220> deforms<00:01:26.640> like<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.240> tire

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and wheel nice it deforms like a tire

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.660 
and wheel nice it deforms like a tire
but<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.320> requires<00:01:28.650> no<00:01:28.890> air<00:01:29.070> rubber<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.549> we

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
but it requires no air rubber like we

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.929 
but it requires no air rubber like we
said<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.740> looks<00:01:31.950> very<00:01:32.070> complicated<00:01:32.310> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
said and it looks very complicated but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.749 
said and it looks very complicated but
it's<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:33.930> simple<00:01:34.140> ok<00:01:34.740> if<00:01:35.490> you

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
it's actually really simple ok if you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.510 
it's actually really simple ok if you
put<00:01:36.000> weight<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.479> tire<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:38.009> outer<00:01:38.159> band

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
put weight on this tire the outer band

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.260 
put weight on this tire the outer band
grows<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.299> these<00:01:40.079> spokes<00:01:40.439> go<00:01:40.619> into<00:01:40.799> tension

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
grows and these spokes go into tension

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.359 
grows and these spokes go into tension
so<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.600> amount<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:42.960> they<00:01:43.140> stretch<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
so the amount that they stretch is the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.730 
so the amount that they stretch is the
amount<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.659> wheel<00:01:46.049> will<00:01:46.290> deform<00:01:46.590> at

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
amount that this wheel will deform at

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.649 
amount that this wheel will deform at
the<00:01:46.799> bottom<00:01:47.070> okay<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.090> deforms<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the bottom okay so it deforms like a

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.870 
the bottom okay so it deforms like a
tire<00:01:48.869> interesting<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> ask<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.850> a

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
tire interesting now I have to ask you a

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.429 
tire interesting now I have to ask you a
serious<00:01:51.210> question<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.840> because<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> know

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
serious question here because you know

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.080 
serious question here because you know
when<00:01:52.649> we're<00:01:52.770> talking<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.189> exploration

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
when we're talking about exploration

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.330 
when we're talking about exploration
we're<00:01:54.630> designing<00:01:54.930> Rovers<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.770> spacesuits

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
we're designing Rovers and spacesuits

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
we're designing Rovers and spacesuits
why<00:01:56.850> should<00:01:57.119> we<00:01:57.270> be<00:01:57.450> paying<00:01:57.689> particular

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
why should we be paying particular

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.520 
why should we be paying particular
attention<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.770> designing<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.549> tire<00:02:00.200> well<00:02:01.200> I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
attention to designing a tire well I

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440 
attention to designing a tire well I
guess<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> can't<00:02:02.250> have<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> vehicle<00:02:03.030> without<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
guess you can't have a vehicle without a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420 
guess you can't have a vehicle without a
tire<00:02:03.689> good<00:02:04.140> point<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.979> moon<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.340> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
tire good point and on the moon if you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.550 
tire good point and on the moon if you
can't<00:02:05.640> use<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> ones<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.439> do

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
can't use the ones we have we have to do

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.440 
can't use the ones we have we have to do
some<00:02:07.740> technology<00:02:08.340> development<00:02:08.789> awesome

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
some technology development awesome

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.339
