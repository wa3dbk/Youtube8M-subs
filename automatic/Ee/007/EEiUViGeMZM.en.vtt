00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
find out where it screwed up because it

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
find out where it screwed up because it
probably<00:01:03.329> will<00:01:03.600> so<00:01:04.229> let's<00:01:04.409> go<00:01:04.589> ahead<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.890> get

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
first thing we want to do is kind of cut

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.359 
first thing we want to do is kind of cut

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
so that we have sort of an area we can

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.200 
so that we have sort of an area we can
roll<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.430> we're<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> do<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.000> same

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
roll to now we're going to do the same

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.600 
roll to now we're going to do the same

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.070 

and<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.730> see<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:33.030> texture<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.510> different<00:01:33.660> to

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
right here you see that slide we want to

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.530 
right here you see that slide we want to
fix<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:13.250> it's<00:02:14.250> not<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> perfect<00:02:14.940> science<00:02:15.120> so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540

just kind of work with the paint too now
once<00:02:18.450> again<00:02:18.600> you're<00:02:18.870> gonna<00:02:18.959> have<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.200> get<00:02:19.320> this

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
once again you're gonna have to get this

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.970 
once again you're gonna have to get this
edge<00:02:19.680> up<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.100> too<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:21.330> square<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.530> up<00:02:22.590> for

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
edge up here too and square that up for

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.910 
edge up here too and square that up for
yourself<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.850> see<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.300> on<00:02:27.570> this

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
yourself so you can see that on this

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.370 
yourself so you can see that on this
that<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:30.150> side<00:02:30.420> makes<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.810> line<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.230> other

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
that the one side makes a line the other

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.500 
that the one side makes a line the other
side<00:02:31.560> takes<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.040> off<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:32.880> just<00:02:33.060> even<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.450> out

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
side takes it off so just even that out

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.960 
side takes it off so just even that out
with<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.810> light<00:02:34.080> touch<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.920> you'll<00:02:35.670> get<00:02:35.820> the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
with a light touch and you'll get the

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.220 
with a light touch and you'll get the
feel<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.450> after<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.720> work<00:02:36.870> with<00:02:37.049> it<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
feel of it after you work with it a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.830 
feel of it after you work with it a
