hi everyone Dara Cooper here want to
talk<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.639> little<00:00:11.850> bit<00:00:12.120> today<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.600> a

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
talk to you a little bit today about a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.049 
talk to you a little bit today about a
ball<00:00:13.230> flight<00:00:13.500> error<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.129> see<00:00:14.430> not<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
ball flight error that we see not the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.460 
ball flight error that we see not the
most<00:00:15.180> common<00:00:15.540> ball<00:00:15.690> flight<00:00:15.900> error<00:00:16.080> but<00:00:16.260> still

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
most common ball flight error but still

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.440 
most common ball flight error but still
one<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:16.860> see<00:00:17.040> too<00:00:17.250> much<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.939> that<00:00:18.330> is

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
one that we see too much of and that is

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.839 
one that we see too much of and that is
a<00:00:18.480> hook<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.470> hook<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> right-handed<00:00:20.700> player

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849 
a hook so hook for a right-handed player

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.820 
a hook so hook for a right-handed player
is<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> ball<00:00:21.450> that<00:00:21.630> curves<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.349> left

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
is a ball that curves to the left

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.800 
is a ball that curves to the left
the<00:00:23.279> reason<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.790> ball<00:00:23.939> curves<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> left

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the reason the ball curves to the left

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.160 
the reason the ball curves to the left
is<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.529> at<00:00:25.680> impact<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> clubface<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.000> left<00:00:27.660> in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
is it at impact the clubface is left in

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.320 
is it at impact the clubface is left in
relation<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> where<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.220> club<00:00:29.430> path<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:30.090> and

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
relation to where the club path is and

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.240 
relation to where the club path is and
that<00:00:30.779> differential<00:00:31.560> between<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.949> two

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
that differential between the two

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
that differential between the two
produces<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.059> curve<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.750> off<00:00:33.900> to<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.559> left

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
produces the curve going off to the left

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
produces the curve going off to the left
that<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.920> call<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.190> hook<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.570> want<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.840> first

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
that we call the hook so I want to first

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.509 
that we call the hook so I want to first
of<00:00:37.170> all<00:00:37.290> talk<00:00:37.470> a<00:00:37.530> little<00:00:37.800> bit<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.340> how

of all talk a little bit about well how

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.460 
of all talk a little bit about well how
does<00:00:38.580> a<00:00:38.850> player<00:00:39.150> get<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> clubface<00:00:39.870> closed<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:40.470 
does a player get the clubface closed in

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.469 
does a player get the clubface closed in
relation<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> path<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.970> a<00:00:42.030> couple<00:00:42.210> things

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:42.479 
relation to the path and a couple things

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:43.820 
relation to the path and a couple things

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.969 
remembering that the hook is going to be
as<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.299> result<00:00:57.449> of<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.930> clubface<00:00:58.199> being<00:00:58.830> aimed

contact with the golf ball and the thing
that's<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.210> have<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:03.479> biggest<00:01:03.750> control

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that's going to have the biggest control

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's going to have the biggest control
biggest<00:01:05.159> influence<00:01:05.670> sorry<00:01:05.940> over<00:01:06.270> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
biggest influence sorry over the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.030 
biggest influence sorry over the
clubface<00:01:06.780> position<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.409> impact<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.860> going<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
clubface position the impact is going to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.320 
clubface position the impact is going to
be<00:01:08.130> gripped<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.670> that's<00:01:08.850> where<00:01:09.060> I'm<00:01:09.150> always

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
be gripped so that's where I'm always

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.170 
be gripped so that's where I'm always
going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> start<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.920> typically<00:01:11.640> people<00:01:11.790> who

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
going to start so typically people who

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
going to start so typically people who
hook<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.750> ball<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.230> their<00:01:13.440> hands<00:01:13.710> rotated

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
hook the ball have their hands rotated

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
hook the ball have their hands rotated
too<00:01:14.580> far<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.150> right<00:01:15.480> on<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.870> club<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
too far to the right on the club and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.650 
too far to the right on the club and
that<00:01:16.950> promotes<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.640> closed<00:01:17.880> clubface<00:01:18.240> at

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
that promotes the closed clubface at

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.110 
that promotes the closed clubface at
impact<00:01:19.080> which<00:01:19.260> produces<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> hook<00:01:20.010> flight<00:01:20.340> so

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
impact which produces the hook flight so

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.190 
impact which produces the hook flight so
I'm<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.540> their<00:01:21.720> grip<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.050> little

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I'm going to get their grip a little

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.890 
I'm going to get their grip a little
more<00:01:22.470> neutral<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> start<00:01:23.460> with<00:01:23.730> then<00:01:24.600> from

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
more neutral to start with then from

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.930 
more neutral to start with then from
there<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.710> other<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.160> that<00:01:26.370> we<00:01:26.460> tend<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.760> see

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
there the other way that we tend to see

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.520 
there the other way that we tend to see
players<00:01:27.180> hook<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.570> ball<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.050> as<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.320> come

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
players hook the ball is it as they come

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
players hook the ball is it as they come
through<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.860> hips<00:01:29.220> don't<00:01:29.460> rotate<00:01:29.900> club<00:01:30.900> head

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
through the hips don't rotate club head

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
through the hips don't rotate club head
passes<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.860> body<00:01:32.100> too<00:01:32.340> much<00:01:32.370> again<00:01:33.060> closing

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
passes the body too much again closing

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
passes the body too much again closing
the<00:01:33.660> clubface<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.140> producing<00:01:34.830> that<00:01:34.920> hook

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the clubface and producing that hook

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.490 
the clubface and producing that hook
shot<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> we<00:01:36.540> get<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:36.810> grip<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.050> little<00:01:37.230> more

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
from there we're gonna talk about well

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.190 
from there we're gonna talk about well
how<00:02:05.729> do<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:05.880> move<00:02:06.150> the<00:02:06.360> club<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.720> impact<00:02:07.049> from

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
how do we move the club to impact from

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.139 
how do we move the club to impact from
there<00:02:07.409> keeping<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.190> mind<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.909> hip

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
there keeping in mind that it's a hip

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.059 
there keeping in mind that it's a hip
rotation<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.019> I<00:02:10.049> want<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.319> get<00:02:10.409> the<00:02:10.590> sense<00:02:10.830> of

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
rotation so I want to get the sense of

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.759 
rotation so I want to get the sense of
the<00:02:11.849> belt<00:02:12.150> buckle<00:02:12.510> more<00:02:12.720> towards<00:02:13.200> target

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
the belt buckle more towards target

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.910 
the belt buckle more towards target
because<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.549> more<00:02:14.849> I<00:02:14.879> rotate<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.140> body<00:02:16.349> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
because the more I rotate the body the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.380 
because the more I rotate the body the
more<00:02:17.100> difficult<00:02:17.400> that's<00:02:17.850> going<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.090> be<00:02:18.209> to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
more difficult that's going to be to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.020 
more difficult that's going to be to
close<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.810> club<00:02:18.990> face<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:20.100> we<00:02:20.459> get<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.819> set

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
close the club face so we get them set

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
close the club face so we get them set
up<00:02:21.060> first<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:21.510> all<00:02:21.600> just<00:02:21.840> here

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
seeing that clubface more square due to

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.550 
seeing that clubface more square due to
the<00:02:26.130> face<00:02:26.370> do<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.880> body<00:02:27.120> rotating<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.930> then

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
the face do the body rotating I then

we're<00:03:06.540> looking<00:03:06.690> for<00:03:06.930> is<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.560> they're<00:03:07.710> trying

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860

to hit little cuts or straight so we're

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.720 
to hit little cuts or straight so we're
going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:10.800> on<00:03:11.040> getting<00:03:11.250> the<00:03:11.310> body<00:03:11.490> to

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
going to work on getting the body to

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880 
going to work on getting the body to
rotate<00:03:12.210> more<00:03:12.420> handle<00:03:13.380> leading<00:03:13.770> you're

keeping<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.220> club<00:03:14.430> face<00:03:14.670> feels<00:03:15.120> like<00:03:15.480> far

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
keeping the club face feels like far

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.020 
keeping the club face feels like far
more<00:03:15.900> open<00:03:16.350> than<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.620> they're<00:03:16.800> used<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.190> so

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
more open than what they're used to so

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.580 
more open than what they're used to so
if<00:03:18.210> you<00:03:18.240> if<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.750> player<00:03:19.020> that<00:03:19.170> hooks<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.560> ball

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
if you if the player that hooks the ball

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.650 
if you if the player that hooks the ball
can<00:03:20.010> now<00:03:20.130> starting<00:03:20.460> the<00:03:20.550> ball<00:03:20.670> straighter<00:03:21.060> or

can now starting the ball straighter or

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.030 
can now starting the ball straighter or
even<00:03:21.960> a<00:03:22.020> little<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.500> right<00:03:22.680> with<00:03:22.920> that

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
even a little to the right with that

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
even a little to the right with that
short<00:03:23.370> swing<00:03:23.640> we're<00:03:24.240> heading<00:03:24.450> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> right

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
short swing we're heading in the right

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.170 
short swing we're heading in the right
direction<00:03:25.160> then<00:03:26.160> from<00:03:26.370> there<00:03:26.550> we<00:03:26.670> step<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.060> up

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
direction then from there we step it up

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.660 
direction then from there we step it up
to<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.330> half<00:03:27.540> swing<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.500> 3/4<00:03:29.130> swing<00:03:29.400> and

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
to a half swing then a 3/4 swing and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.550 
to a half swing then a 3/4 swing and
then<00:03:29.760> eventually<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.360> full<00:03:30.540> swing<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.350> whole

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
then eventually the full swing the whole

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.440 
then eventually the full swing the whole
time<00:03:31.830> taking<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.370> feeling<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:33.030> had<00:03:33.239> with

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
time taking the feeling that we had with

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.540 
time taking the feeling that we had with
the<00:03:33.570> shorter<00:03:33.930> swings<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.550> incorporating

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
the shorter swings and incorporating

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.940 
the shorter swings and incorporating
that<00:03:35.580> into<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.030> full<00:03:36.209> swing<00:03:36.650> keeping<00:03:37.650> in<00:03:37.770> mind

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
that into the full swing keeping in mind

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.350 
that into the full swing keeping in mind
that<00:03:38.070> that<00:03:38.250> progression<00:03:38.640> that<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.970> just<00:03:39.209> went

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
that that progression that I just went

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.610 
that that progression that I just went
through<00:03:39.450> in<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.720> few<00:03:39.750> seconds<00:03:40.320> is<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
through in a few seconds is going to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.440 
through in a few seconds is going to
take<00:03:40.800> a<00:03:40.830> few<00:03:41.040> weeks<00:03:41.310> you<00:03:41.730> know<00:03:41.820> you<00:03:41.880> keep<00:03:42.330> in

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
take a few weeks you know you keep in

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.600 
take a few weeks you know you keep in
mind<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:43.320> work<00:03:43.500> really<00:03:43.530> really<00:03:43.890> hard<00:03:44.190> to

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
mind that you work really really hard to

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:46.430 
mind that you work really really hard to
perfect<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.060> hook<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.930> it's<00:03:46.050> going<00:03:46.170> to<00:03:46.230> take

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
perfect that hook and it's going to take

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.530 
perfect that hook and it's going to take
some<00:03:46.620> time<00:03:46.860> for<00:03:46.890> you<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.220> change<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.330> you've

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
some time for you to change it so you've

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.000 
some time for you to change it so you've
got<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.780> give<00:03:48.900> yourself<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.380> chance<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.800> learn

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
got to give yourself the chance to learn

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.770 
got to give yourself the chance to learn
the<00:03:50.220> new<00:03:50.370> pattern<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:50.970> thus<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.239> new<00:03:51.390> skill

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
the new pattern and thus the new skill

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.020 
the new pattern and thus the new skill
to<00:03:52.260> be<00:03:52.380> able<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.560> hit<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.739> ball<00:03:52.769> straight<00:03:53.030> so

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
to be able to hit the ball straight so

if you're hooking the ball couple things
to<00:03:55.769> check<00:03:56.010> check<00:03:56.790> your<00:03:56.940> grip<00:03:57.150> first<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.720> all<00:03:57.870> in
