00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
you do is you if you can see here you

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.649 
you do is you if you can see here you
push<00:00:42.530> down<00:00:42.559> that<00:00:43.039> and<00:00:43.460> pull<00:00:44.149> the<00:00:44.269> trigger<00:00:44.510> up

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:48.309 
push down that and pull the trigger up
the<00:00:44.780> same<00:00:44.989> time<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.789> then<00:00:46.789> push<00:00:47.269> down<00:00:47.300> on<00:00:48.170> your

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:48.319 
the same time and then push down on your

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.439 
the same time and then push down on your
thumb<00:00:48.769> right<00:00:50.409> there<00:00:51.409> if<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.829> can<00:00:51.949> see<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:52.449> and

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
thumb right there if you can see it and

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.569 
thumb right there if you can see it and
that<00:00:53.929> actually<00:00:54.319> locks<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:54.859> trigger<00:00:55.159> in<00:00:55.339> just

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
that actually locks that trigger in just

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.450 
that actually locks that trigger in just
a<00:00:55.670> little<00:00:55.909> bit<00:00:56.059> it<00:00:56.420> locks<00:00:56.929> that<00:00:57.219> that<00:00:58.219> trigger

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
a little bit it locks that that trigger

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.540 
a little bit it locks that that trigger
holds<00:00:59.030> that<00:00:59.179> down<00:00:59.449> in<00:00:59.659> place<00:00:59.920> so<00:01:00.920> then<00:01:01.100> this

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
holds that down in place so then this

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.920 
holds that down in place so then this
primer<00:01:01.909> bulb<00:01:02.409> right<00:01:03.409> here<00:01:04.360> you<00:01:05.360> push<00:01:05.600> it<00:01:05.750> at

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
primer bulb right here you push it at

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.069 
primer bulb right here you push it at
least<00:01:06.110> five<00:01:06.409> times<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:09.340> about<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.840> 3/4<00:01:11.840> time

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
least five times is about the 3/4 time

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.600 
least five times is about the 3/4 time
before<00:01:12.439> I<00:01:12.469> really<00:01:12.680> felt<00:01:12.890> good<00:01:13.040> feel<00:01:13.250> coming

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
before I really felt good feel coming

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.249

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
that primer bulb you will not flood it

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.279 
that primer bulb you will not flood it
so<00:01:25.039> don't<00:01:25.219> worry<00:01:25.280> about<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.960> then<00:01:26.960> set<00:01:27.170> it<00:01:27.259> on

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
so don't worry about that then set it on

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.100 
so don't worry about that then set it on
solid<00:01:27.710> ground<00:01:27.950> when<00:01:28.729> you<00:01:28.820> start<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:29.930> don't

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
solid ground when you start it you don't

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.240 
solid ground when you start it you don't
pull<00:01:30.799> it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250
