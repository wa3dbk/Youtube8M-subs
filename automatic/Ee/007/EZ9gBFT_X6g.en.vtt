to make sure that you're not going to
have<00:02:15.580> like<00:02:15.670> a<00:02:15.700> big<00:02:15.880> eruption<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.390> if<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:16.600> do<00:02:16.750> it

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
have like a big eruption or if you do it

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
have like a big eruption or if you do it
controls<00:02:17.320> it<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.530> little<00:02:17.620> better<00:02:17.800> it<00:02:18.040> keeps<00:02:18.190> it

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
controls it a little better it keeps it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.590 
controls it a little better it keeps it
from<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.610> going<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.910> over<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.150> place<00:02:19.390> and

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
from just going all over the place and

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.570 
from just going all over the place and
get<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.810> huge<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.380> know<00:02:20.410> off<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:21.430> one<00:02:21.550> side

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
get this huge you know off to one side

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.190 
get this huge you know off to one side
whatever<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.060> actually<00:02:22.360> will<00:02:22.480> expand<00:02:22.780> outward

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
whatever it actually will expand outward

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.050 
whatever it actually will expand outward
and<00:02:23.320> upward<00:02:23.410> like<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> but<00:02:24.040> ours<00:02:24.250> kept<00:02:25.000> it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
and upward like this but ours kept it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.699 
and upward like this but ours kept it
nice<00:02:25.180> and<00:02:25.420> controlled<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:25.900> tight<00:02:26.050> so<00:02:26.080> now

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
nice and controlled and tight so now

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:27.660 
nice and controlled and tight so now
what<00:02:26.830> we're<00:02:26.920> going<00:02:27.010> to<00:02:27.100> do<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.430> we're<00:02:27.580> to

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
what we're going to do is we're to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.460 
what we're going to do is we're to
transfer<00:02:28.030> these<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.570> cooling<00:02:29.140> rack<00:02:29.200> so

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
transfer these to a cooling rack so

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.770 
transfer these to a cooling rack so
let's<00:02:29.620> do<00:02:29.740> that
