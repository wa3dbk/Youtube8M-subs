00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.799
 hi friends and friends today I'm going to 

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:09.760
 teach how to make the doll that refers 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 to my childhood that were babies that 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.820
 they came inside a matchbox 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:19.510
 and in this case we're going to use a box of 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:22.960
 matches this bigger yes a little bit 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:27.960
 large of the flat if it is in the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 height roughly two centimeters 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.699
 more or less it has two centimeters of 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.850
 high then what are we going to 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.510
 do 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.000
 first let's take out the box we're going to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.559
 paint here the part is also able to 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.629
 paint the one below if they want or not 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:47.019
 then we are going to remove the part of 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:51.370
 inside with acrylics and we will cover 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:56.550
 the box as we are going to cover it, we are going to 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:01:02.160
 first to see where are we going to put 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.690
 this one plaster here if a lace the 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.770
 let's paste here all around everything 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.000
 around they come after here we are going to put 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 a little wadding if of wadding here and we go 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.880
 to cut a strip according to the size of 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.550
 our box and we will start to paste 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 here first we paste the wadding and then 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.620
 we stick the strip and we're hitting 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.630
 campbell 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.630
 here we go to put more silicone 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.259
 and we are going to stick 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.259
 according to the size of our box 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:52.530
 well stretched and here the last 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.530
 let's also put here 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.180
 and we are going to 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.260
 paste 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.530
 d 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.130
 then it is lined our 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.130
 small box 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.650
 pretending to be a bed of our baby 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.180
 let's move on to the baby let's grab 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:22.390
 a ball if it can be this micro polar or 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:27.250
 it can be the normal polar and we're going to 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:29.709
 cut this mold that is of the baby if the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.599
 baby's body in polar or micro polar 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.480
 or now some cute elastic fabric and 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.230
 softly we are going to sew it we are going to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.290
 cut with margin here we will make type 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.280
 point 0 fill them before and close 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:49.560
 ok let's make the hat and also 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.950
 with margin in the cap 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.840
 and we go finally to make the face with 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.500
 a circle 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.320
 5 centimeters 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.430
 with the zero point back and just the 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.780
 little mouth in or if they already know how to do it 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.210
 look for the first tutorials which 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.050
 no and with little eyes or in this case I put 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:15.280
 the number four 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:19.450
 let's hit the cap to the head 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:24.630
 there is covering the zero point well 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:28.110
 and we're going to paste it up here 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.330
 As you can see it's easy but this is what 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:37.410
 you have to make a doll so tiny 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:40.080
 if so tiny it takes your time if 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.680
 you have to be more careful than with one 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.620
 Biggest all the little dolls 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.740
 they are harder to do than 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.460
 big ones take more time there are also 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:55.430
 another thing that he had not told them 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.760
 is this they are going to make a little pillow if 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.850
 they want they can do it not to put it 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.800
 here inside 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.830
 this damn is just a 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.280
 rectangle and they will fill it and what 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.840
 they close 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:17.329
 then there we have our green 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.199
 we are going to put it inside the box 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.030
 we can put it like this when it comes out in the 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:27.889
 pad here 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:32.020
 like leaning on the bed and if not what 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:35.039
 we can store inside the box 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.039
 to our baby 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:41.979
 they are going to put carefully and we are going to 

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:41.979
 close 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.590
 hello to the box yes and there is our 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.080
 baby as in a bed see and then the 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.380
 can close well this is very nice 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.000
 to give as a souvenir or for 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.500
 babies to play with the 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.020
 girls to play in the houses 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.520
 with the dolls well I hope that you 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.060
 I liked that you have found 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.380
 practical and easy and see you in the 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.380
