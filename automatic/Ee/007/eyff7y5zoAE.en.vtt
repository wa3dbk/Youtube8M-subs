00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
that it makes more than just whistles

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.949 
that it makes more than just whistles
and<00:03:14.939> steam<00:03:15.239> sounds<00:03:15.780> is<00:03:16.069> is<00:03:17.299> in<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.659> and

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
and steam sounds is is in this and

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.140 
and steam sounds is is in this and
that's<00:03:19.530> why<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.769> highly<00:03:20.400> recommend<00:03:20.549> this<00:03:21.090> one

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
that's why I highly recommend this one

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.149 
that's why I highly recommend this one
if<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:22.739> want<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:25.290> know<00:03:25.409> if<00:03:25.590> you<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:26.129> a

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:26.159 
if you want you know if you have a

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.020 
if you want you know if you have a
collection<00:03:26.879> you<00:03:26.909> want<00:03:27.900> to<00:03:28.109> get<00:03:28.349> all<00:03:28.590> of<00:03:28.739> them

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
collection you want to get all of them

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.160 
collection you want to get all of them
so<00:03:30.030> that<00:03:30.060> your<00:03:30.420> collection<00:03:30.870> would<00:03:30.989> be

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
so that your collection would be

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.589 
so that your collection would be
complete<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.420> once<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.859> one<00:03:35.209> does<00:03:36.209> not

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
complete and once and this one does not

this one is the best despite that this

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.360 
this one is the best despite that this
has<00:05:08.290> engine<00:05:09.290> recognition<00:05:09.980> technology<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:11.720> uh

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:12.370 
has engine recognition technology so uh

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.960 
has engine recognition technology so uh
cuz<00:05:13.370> that's<00:05:13.640> it<00:05:13.880> get<00:05:14.540> a<00:05:14.570> close-up
