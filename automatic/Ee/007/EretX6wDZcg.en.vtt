00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
would have a more important job to do in

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.009 
would have a more important job to do in
space<00:03:40.100> other<00:03:40.489> than<00:03:40.580> walk<00:03:41.030> around<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.510> circles

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
space other than walk around in circles

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.390 
space other than walk around in circles
but<00:03:42.320> I<00:03:42.530> guess<00:03:42.800> I<00:03:42.920> don't<00:03:42.980> know<00:03:43.130> much<00:03:43.370> about

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
but I guess I don't know much about

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.310 
but I guess I don't know much about
being<00:03:43.880> an<00:03:43.970> astronaut<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:44.720> I<00:03:44.930> wonder<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.260> it

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
being an astronaut so I wonder if it

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.229 
being an astronaut so I wonder if it
gives<00:03:45.440> you<00:03:45.620> points<00:03:46.100> when<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:46.700> shoot<00:03:47.030> them

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
gives you points when you shoot them

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.090 
gives you points when you shoot them
with<00:03:47.450> those<00:03:47.660> things<00:03:47.989> maybe<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.890> would<00:03:49.070> make

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
with those things maybe that would make

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.130 
with those things maybe that would make
more<00:03:49.370> sense<00:03:49.430> otherwise<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.600> a<00:03:50.630> three<00:03:50.989> like

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
more sense otherwise I have a three like

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.350 
more sense otherwise I have a three like
