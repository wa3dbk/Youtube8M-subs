00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.900 
up and actually force myself through all
of<00:03:30.870> this<00:03:31.019> just<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.380> I<00:03:31.470> could<00:03:31.590> say<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.519> I<00:03:32.549> did

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
of this just so I could say that I did

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.340 
of this just so I could say that I did
because<00:03:33.450> from<00:03:33.570> what<00:03:33.750> I've<00:03:33.870> read<00:03:34.080> and<00:03:34.320> what

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
because from what I've read and what

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.560 
because from what I've read and what
I've<00:03:34.530> seen<00:03:34.799> so<00:03:35.100> far<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:36.030> actual<00:03:36.390> plot

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
I've seen so far of the the actual plot

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.180 
I've seen so far of the the actual plot
of<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> story<00:03:37.110> was<00:03:37.320> very<00:03:37.350> interesting<00:03:38.010> it's

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
of the story was very interesting it's

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.710 
of the story was very interesting it's
like<00:03:38.220> these<00:03:38.489> parasites<00:03:38.940> that<00:03:39.209> come<00:03:39.360> down<00:03:39.480> and

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
like these parasites that come down and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.600 
like these parasites that come down and
basically<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.830> really<00:03:40.890> tried<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.310> take<00:03:41.519> over

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
basically not really tried to take over

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.400 
basically not really tried to take over
the<00:03:41.760> world<00:03:41.970> but<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.330> kind<00:03:42.510> of<00:03:42.600> live<00:03:43.049> how<00:03:43.380> they

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
the world but just kind of live how they

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.930 
the world but just kind of live how they
live<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:43.890> that's<00:03:44.190> just<00:03:44.430> kind<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.670> what<00:03:44.820> they

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
live and that's just kind of what they

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.330 
live and that's just kind of what they
do<00:03:45.000> they<00:03:45.600> take<00:03:45.750> over<00:03:46.080> people<00:03:46.410> but<00:03:46.590> that's<00:03:47.220> how

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
do they take over people but that's how

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.890 
do they take over people but that's how
they<00:03:47.459> exist<00:03:47.880> now<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.360> didn't<00:03:48.630> see<00:03:48.750> any

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
they exist now I didn't see any

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.479 
they exist now I didn't see any
semblance<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.470> large-scale<00:03:49.799> fighting

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
semblance of large-scale fighting

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.970 
semblance of large-scale fighting
between<00:03:50.640> like<00:03:51.000> parasites<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.810> humans<00:03:52.650> at<00:03:52.830> all

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
between like parasites and humans at all

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.610 
between like parasites and humans at all
or<00:03:53.220> an<00:03:53.459> attempted<00:03:53.820> eradication<00:03:54.660> of<00:03:54.780> them<00:03:54.959> but

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
or an attempted eradication of them but

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.470 
or an attempted eradication of them but
the<00:03:55.860> description<00:03:56.400> various<00:03:57.030> different<00:03:57.299> places

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
the description various different places

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.330 
the description various different places
mentions<00:03:58.080> like<00:03:58.260> a<00:03:58.290> war<00:03:58.590> between<00:03:58.799> humans<00:03:59.070> and

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
mentions like a war between humans and

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.070 
mentions like a war between humans and
parasites<00:03:59.820> now<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> didn't<00:04:00.570> see<00:04:00.690> anything<00:04:00.930> like

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
parasites now I didn't see anything like

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.900 
parasites now I didn't see anything like
that<00:04:01.230> in<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.920> first<00:04:02.100> three<00:04:02.310> episodes<00:04:02.400> that's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that in the first three episodes that's

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.060 
that in the first three episodes that's
not<00:04:03.120> saying<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:04.049> not<00:04:04.290> there<00:04:04.650> because

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
not saying that it's not there because

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.130 
not saying that it's not there because
it<00:04:05.280> probably<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.880> but<00:04:06.269> then<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.870> means

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
it probably is but then that just means

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.440 
it probably is but then that just means
that<00:04:07.230> the<00:04:07.440> secretive<00:04:07.860> nature<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:09.299> main

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
that the secretive nature of the main

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.300 
that the secretive nature of the main
character<00:04:09.840> having<00:04:10.019> this<00:04:10.230> parasite<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.829> has<00:04:11.100> to

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
character having this parasite is has to

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.800 
character having this parasite is has to
be<00:04:11.430> lifted<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.450> would<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.690> very

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
be lifted and that would be very

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.289 
be lifted and that would be very
interesting<00:04:13.350> to<00:04:13.380> see<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.890> know<00:04:14.070> besides<00:04:15.030> the

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
interesting to see you know besides the

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.440 
interesting to see you know besides the
whole<00:04:15.979> yeah<00:04:16.979> the<00:04:17.489> thing<00:04:17.790> is<00:04:18.060> hmm
