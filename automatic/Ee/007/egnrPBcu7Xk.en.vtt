00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
results from it at all so me personally

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.500 
results from it at all so me personally
I<00:04:43.590> would<00:04:43.740> advise<00:04:43.950> against<00:04:44.220> that

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
I would advise against that

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.000 
I would advise against that
the<00:04:45.930> steroid<00:04:46.260> injections<00:04:46.650> there's<00:04:46.860> no

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
the steroid injections there's no

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.340 
the steroid injections there's no
negative<00:04:47.310> effect<00:04:47.880> to<00:04:48.060> trying<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.290> you

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
negative effect to trying it so you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.740 
negative effect to trying it so you
could<00:04:49.590> definitely<00:04:49.770> search<00:04:50.160> that<00:04:50.310> Avenue<00:04:50.760> and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
could definitely search that Avenue and

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.450 
could definitely search that Avenue and
then<00:04:51.930> like<00:04:52.050> I<00:04:52.170> said<00:04:52.230> the<00:04:52.680> reasons<00:04:53.160> I<00:04:53.250> even

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
then like I said the reasons I even

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.010 
then like I said the reasons I even
started<00:04:53.730> making<00:04:53.940> these<00:04:54.210> videos<00:04:54.540> is<00:04:54.780> because

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
started making these videos is because

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.530 
started making these videos is because
there<00:04:55.230> really<00:04:55.260> was<00:04:55.740> no<00:04:55.890> documentation<00:04:56.540> for

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
there really was no documentation for

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.990 
there really was no documentation for
kilos<00:04:57.960> and<00:04:58.200> tattoos<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.890> what<00:04:59.040> did<00:04:59.130> they<00:04:59.220> do

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
kilos and tattoos and what did they do

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.210 
kilos and tattoos and what did they do
and<00:05:00.420> just<00:05:00.750> because<00:05:00.900> in<00:05:01.200> my<00:05:01.320> specific<00:05:01.560> case<00:05:01.980> I

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
and just because in my specific case I

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:05.390 
and just because in my specific case I
didn't<00:05:02.490> have<00:05:02.640> any<00:05:02.850> adverse<00:05:03.690> effect<00:05:04.220> I'm<00:05:05.220> not

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
went and I got the outline done first

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.640 
went and I got the outline done first
came<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.090> about<00:06:33.210> two<00:06:33.419> three<00:06:33.600> weeks<00:06:33.660> and<00:06:34.440> then

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
came to about two three weeks and then

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.650 
came to about two three weeks and then
went<00:06:34.860> back<00:06:34.890> you<00:06:35.130> got<00:06:35.250> the<00:06:35.340> shading<00:06:35.640> done<00:06:35.820> the

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
went back you got the shading done the

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.810 
went back you got the shading done the
shading<00:06:36.960> itself<00:06:37.260> took<00:06:37.560> probably<00:06:38.340> over<00:06:38.669> two

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
shading itself took probably over two

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.730 
shading itself took probably over two
hours<00:06:39.180> he<00:06:39.870> said<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.140> was<00:06:40.350> on

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
hours he said it was on

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.110 
hours he said it was on
longest<00:06:41.130> sittings<00:06:41.460> it<00:06:41.610> probably<00:06:41.940> was<00:06:42.090> the

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
longest sittings it probably was the

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.809 
longest sittings it probably was the
most<00:06:42.389> trauma<00:06:43.080> I<00:06:43.380> have<00:06:43.979> had<00:06:44.250> induced<00:06:44.520> in<00:06:44.729> my

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819 
most trauma I have had induced in my

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:48.140 
most trauma I have had induced in my
skin<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.440> this<00:06:46.440> was<00:06:46.770> probably<00:06:47.039> more<00:06:47.849> for<00:06:48.030> two

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
skin and this was probably more for two

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.140 
skin and this was probably more for two

no issues nunu keloids and that's one of
other<00:06:54.000> things<00:06:54.270> when<00:06:54.419> I<00:06:54.479> initially<00:06:54.840> started

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
other things when I initially started

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.930 
other things when I initially started
getting<00:06:55.410> tattoos<00:06:55.800> I<00:06:56.720> didn't<00:06:57.720> see<00:06:58.020> any<00:06:58.940> new

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.050 
evidence of any nudity boys uh so I know

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.659 
evidence of any nudity boys uh so I know
when<00:07:04.050> I<00:07:04.080> was<00:07:04.199> younger<00:07:04.410> you<00:07:04.560> see<00:07:05.250> maybe<00:07:05.430> a<00:07:05.520> new

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:05.669 
when I was younger you see maybe a new

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.089 
when I was younger you see maybe a new
one<00:07:05.880> pop<00:07:06.090> up<00:07:06.270> here<00:07:06.300> or<00:07:06.599> there<00:07:06.830> that<00:07:07.830> stopped

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
one pop up here or there that stopped

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.589 
one pop up here or there that stopped
happening<00:07:08.580> so<00:07:08.699> that<00:07:08.729> was<00:07:08.940> one<00:07:09.120> of<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.270> kind<00:07:09.479> of

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
happening so that was one of the kind of

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:10.790 
happening so that was one of the kind of
determining<00:07:10.020> factors<00:07:10.380> that<00:07:10.470> led<00:07:10.620> me<00:07:10.680> to

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 
determining factors that led me to

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.670 
determining factors that led me to
finally<00:07:11.130> push<00:07:11.370> to<00:07:11.520> get<00:07:11.669> the<00:07:11.910> tattoo<00:07:12.530> but<00:07:13.530> I
