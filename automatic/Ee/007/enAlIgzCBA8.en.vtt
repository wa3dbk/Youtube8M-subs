00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
then I look up here towards the reverse

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.060 
then I look up here towards the reverse
light<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.899> it's<00:00:41.289> really<00:00:41.500> hard<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.800> tell

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
light and it's really hard to tell

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.849 
light and it's really hard to tell
through<00:00:42.969> the<00:00:43.090> packaging<00:00:43.660> but<00:00:43.840> it<00:00:43.960> appears

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
through the packaging but it appears

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.400 
through the packaging but it appears

moved it up to there and then move some

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.780 
moved it up to there and then move some
wires<00:01:36.910> around<00:01:37.300> and<00:01:38.040> now<00:01:39.040> my<00:01:39.220> brake<00:01:39.430> lights<00:01:39.640> are

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
wires around and now my brake lights are

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.560 
wires around and now my brake lights are
full<00:01:39.970> LED<00:01:40.120> and<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:42.250> you're<00:01:42.490> gonna<00:01:42.610> mount<00:01:42.940> your

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
you're gonna need to figure something

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.690 
you're gonna need to figure something
out<00:01:48.670> I'm<00:01:48.910> not<00:01:49.210> I'm<00:01:49.510> gonna<00:01:49.750> mount<00:01:49.930> mine<00:01:50.550> in<00:01:51.550> the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
out I'm not I'm gonna mount mine in the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.520 
out I'm not I'm gonna mount mine in the
factory<00:01:52.060> location<00:01:52.420> under<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:52.990> rear<00:01:53.140> bumper

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.320 
mounted right underneath my tail light
so<00:02:08.080> let<00:02:08.739> me<00:02:08.800> get<00:02:08.920> started<00:02:09.099> and<00:02:09.429> I'll<00:02:10.090> show<00:02:10.269> you

so let me get started and I'll show you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.670 
so let me get started and I'll show you
how<00:02:10.509> I<00:02:10.740> move<00:02:11.790> these<00:02:12.790> little<00:02:12.940> LEDs<00:02:13.450> up<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.530> to

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
how I move these little LEDs up here to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.699 
how I move these little LEDs up here to
become

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
become

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.740 
become
the<00:02:15.920> reverse<00:02:16.219> lights<00:02:16.459> so<00:02:17.359> a<00:02:17.390> couple<00:02:17.629> things

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the reverse lights so a couple things

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.759 
the reverse lights so a couple things
first<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.530> came<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.670> here<00:02:19.909> and<00:02:20.049> one<00:02:21.049> pulled<00:02:21.650> my

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
first I came in here and one pulled my

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.220 
first I came in here and one pulled my
little<00:02:22.540> weatherstripping<00:02:23.540> outta<00:02:23.780> there

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
little weatherstripping outta there

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.170 
little weatherstripping outta there
we'll<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.829> throw<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.159> back<00:02:25.760> in<00:02:25.909> the<00:02:25.969> box

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
we'll just throw that back in the box

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.050 
we'll just throw that back in the box
we'll<00:02:26.390> get<00:02:26.510> to<00:02:26.599> that<00:02:26.629> later<00:02:26.920> next<00:02:27.939> come<00:02:28.939> in

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
we'll get to that later next come in

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.599 
we'll get to that later next come in
here<00:02:29.329> and<00:02:30.230> pull<00:02:30.650> out<00:02:30.799> the<00:02:31.099> little

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
here and pull out the little

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.729 
here and pull out the little
incandescent<00:02:32.120> bulb<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.200> those<00:02:33.439> are<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.620> first

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
incandescent bulb so those are the first

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.709 
incandescent bulb so those are the first
two<00:02:33.859> steps<00:02:34.159> and<00:02:34.459> we'll<00:02:35.030> just<00:02:35.150> take<00:02:35.299> this<00:02:35.450> we'll

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:35.719 
two steps and we'll just take this we'll

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:38.080 
two steps and we'll just take this we'll
throw<00:02:35.870> this<00:02:35.989> aside<00:02:36.379> I<00:02:36.680> just<00:02:37.459> don't<00:02:37.790> want<00:02:37.939> that
