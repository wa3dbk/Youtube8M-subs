00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:26.060
 if you want to tell the public 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.689
 Milanese 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 the story of a role though this time 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:35.170
 not just putting together works 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.230
 taken from places 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.719
 different areas from the artist's history 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.449
 through the eyes of a very much 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:46.659
 special and very privileged of one 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.640
 peter brant person who of warhol is 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:50.649
 been both first collector and then 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.180
 great friend until death 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.000
 here 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.090
 he who also becomes the curator of the 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.090
 exhibition 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.000
 makes us understand very well precisely the 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.400
 creative path of emptiness given when 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.770
 it was not even a role called the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.229
 Andy's original name wants andy wahrol 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.000
 until his death in 1987 in New York but 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:19.050
 immediately after making the last one 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.050
 show here in Milan 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.860
 the exhibition is 160 works 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.680
 mainly 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.280
 canvas designs 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.730
 the structures of tipsy boxes 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 Kellogg's 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.740
 the first rooms are are mainly 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:46.320
 dedicated to the drawings from 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.990
 illustrator that good he had done then 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.980
 you go right to the first screen prints 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.050
 you pass there are the works the first works 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.970
 that he had tried to do by taking 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.710
 the comics of newspapers the strips you 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.920
 they run in the newspapers get to the idea 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.140
 of the ticket soup box 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.530
 and don women then all that remains will follow 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.470
 almost like a domino effect with nuoro 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.720
 that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.220
 engulfs the reality came back to itself 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.220
 transforms into fantastic works 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:35.220
 I'll do the details for the scenes 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.920
 or shadows a Rossoneri shadow is a little 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.950
 from the 80s of the 70s 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.590
 which is the role attempt to come to 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.080
 pacts with abstract expressionism that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.700
 it was the movement that came first 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.880
 of pop art and who had seen pop 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:56.080
 art and like one like smoke in the eyes 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:03:00.030
 and role test with these scenes 80 a 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.709
 act of making a square not so much for 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.440
 the infinite complex but a bit almost 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.190
 were there any fault of trying to 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.209
 do it too 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.209
 matias treats 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.880
 there is a polaroid room that too 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.520
 that's very interesting 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.640
 sanapo le roi that he snaps so 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.550
 compulsive in the 70s when love 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.370
 becomes a reach of all and there are 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.710
 two very famous role portraits at 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.620
 parties with the polaroid attached to the neck 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:42.390
 and he at these parties that he to whom 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.580
 they always participate with great pleasure 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.010
 equal then a festaiolo precisely the 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.960
 like to go to parties take these 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.210
 photos of all these characters that are 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.980
 both famous and friends all become 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.330
 friends of warhol in a sense that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.010
 that was what he really wanted 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.010
 that everyone become everyone's friend 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.710
 we wanted to achieve precisely 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.900
 for the autumn a study on 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.900
 American culture from the 40s to 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.570
 80s the first period is represented 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.580
 that of the abstract expressionists 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.320
 then from the da pollock which is an exhibition 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.300
 which you see down on the ground floor 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.940
 however it is going very well 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.700
 immediately afterwards the daniel 60 was born 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.730
 the pop art of which we say warhol is the 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.380
 most significant representative 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.120
 we couldn't talk about culture 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.550
 American of the 40s to the 80s 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.550
 without making an exhibition on su andy warhol
