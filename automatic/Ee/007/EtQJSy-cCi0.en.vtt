hey<00:00:13.190> everyone<00:00:13.639> today<00:00:14.360> we're<00:00:14.540> going<00:00:14.660> to

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
hey everyone today we're going to

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:16.220 
hey everyone today we're going to
continue<00:00:14.990> our<00:00:15.170> little

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
continue our little

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.260 
continue our little
on<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.859> string<00:00:17.189> study<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:17.850> did<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> few

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
on one string study that we did a few

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.470 
on one string study that we did a few
lessons<00:00:18.449> back<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.980> created<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> little<00:00:20.939> fun

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
lessons back and I created a little fun

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.150 
lessons back and I created a little fun
little<00:00:21.720> e<00:00:21.869> -<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.410> able<00:00:22.500> to<00:00:22.590> practice<00:00:22.800> with

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
little e - to be able to practice with

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.040 
little e - to be able to practice with
one<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.460> those<00:00:23.520> patterns<00:00:23.789> what<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:24.779> want<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
one of those patterns what you want to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
one of those patterns what you want to
do<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.320> maybe<00:00:25.529> practice<00:00:25.860> it<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.610> pattern

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
do is maybe practice it with the pattern

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.779 
do is maybe practice it with the pattern
that<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.360> show<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:27.989> with<00:00:28.230> initially<00:00:28.800> but<00:00:29.550> then

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
that I show you with initially but then

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.509 
that I show you with initially but then
try<00:00:30.689> to<00:00:30.750> play<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.079> exact<00:00:31.470> same<00:00:31.710> piece<00:00:32.040> but

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
try to play the exact same piece but

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.549 
try to play the exact same piece but
using<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> three<00:00:33.269> other<00:00:33.420> patterns<00:00:33.839> from<00:00:34.470> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
using the three other patterns from the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.009 
using the three other patterns from the
first<00:00:34.860> blessing<00:00:35.100> okay<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.720> fun<00:00:36.839> with

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
first blessing okay so have fun with

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:41.210 
first blessing okay so have fun with
this<00:00:37.110> one<00:00:39.470> okay<00:00:40.470> so<00:00:40.500> I'm<00:00:40.769> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.949> go<00:00:41.070> ahead

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
this one okay so I'm going to go ahead

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.369 
this one okay so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:00:41.519> just<00:00:41.699> play<00:00:41.910> through<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.329> etude<00:00:42.839> up<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
and just play through this etude up to

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.869 
and just play through this etude up to
speed<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:44.400> etude<00:00:44.730> uses<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
speed this etude uses one of the

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.959 
speed this etude uses one of the
patterns<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.150> learned<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.809> our<00:00:48.960> first

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969 
patterns that we learned in our first

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.360 
patterns that we learned in our first
tapping<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.329> string<00:00:51.690> lesson<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.920> I'm<00:00:53.190> just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
tapping on one string lesson so I'm just

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.439 
tapping on one string lesson so I'm just
going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.520> take<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.059> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.210> be<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
going to take it it's going to be the

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.970 
going to take it it's going to be the
same<00:00:54.719> pattern<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> we're<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
same pattern and we're just going to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
same pattern and we're just going to
take<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:56.460> through<00:00:57.180> different<00:00:57.510> or<00:00:57.600> peji<00:00:57.840> OHS

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
take it through different or peji OHS

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.619 
take it through different or peji OHS
down<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.129> string<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.059> create<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> little

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
down this one string and create a little

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.200 
down this one string and create a little
étude<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.500> basically<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.699> an<00:01:02.789> e<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.090> it

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
étude so it's basically what an e to it

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.369 
étude so it's basically what an e to it
is<00:01:03.300> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.050> is<00:01:04.170> it's

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
is if you don't know what it is it's

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.170 
is if you don't know what it is it's
just<00:01:04.440> a<00:01:04.649> piece<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> music<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.309> usually<00:01:05.759> uses

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
just a piece of music that usually uses

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.600 
just a piece of music that usually uses
a<00:01:06.420> single<00:01:07.320> technique<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:09.000> work<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:10.369> so<00:01:11.369> it's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a single technique to work on so it's

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.249 
a single technique to work on so it's
basically<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.149> technical<00:01:12.509> exercise<00:01:12.810> but<00:01:13.080> then

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:13.259 
basically a technical exercise but then

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.719 
basically a technical exercise but then
I<00:01:13.350> turn<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.530> into<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.890> piece<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.130> music<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.580> it's

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
I turn it into a piece of music so it's

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.960 
I turn it into a piece of music so it's
it's<00:01:15.720> bearable<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.200> practice<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:16.950> here<00:01:17.789> we<00:01:17.850> go

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
it's bearable to practice so here we go

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.550 
it's bearable to practice so here we go
here's<00:01:18.300> a<00:01:18.360> little<00:01:18.600> easy<00:01:18.869> right<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
here's a little easy right here this is

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
here's a little easy right here this is
what<00:01:19.679> we're<00:01:19.770> going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.039> doing<00:01:20.160> today

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.800 

okay<00:01:53.020> so<00:01:53.560> it's<00:01:53.710> a<00:01:53.890> very<00:01:54.189> simple<00:01:54.520> pattern<00:01:55.060> just

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
okay so it's a very simple pattern just

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.620 
okay so it's a very simple pattern just
taking<00:01:56.560> pretty<00:01:56.950> much<00:01:57.130> across<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.640> string<00:01:57.909> so

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
taking pretty much across the string so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.679 
taking pretty much across the string so
let's<00:01:58.659> start<00:01:59.250> just<00:02:00.250> follow<00:02:00.460> along<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:01.000> the<00:02:01.210> PDF

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
let's start just follow along on the PDF

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.149 
let's start just follow along on the PDF
download<00:02:02.170> that<00:02:02.319> you<00:02:02.380> can<00:02:02.469> get<00:02:02.679> from<00:02:02.829> the<00:02:02.950> site

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
download that you can get from the site

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.999 
download that you can get from the site
and<00:02:04.079> anything<00:02:05.079> that<00:02:05.109> has<00:02:05.350> a<00:02:05.380> T<00:02:05.619> over<00:02:05.920> it

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
and anything that has a T over it

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.100 
and anything that has a T over it
obviously<00:02:06.159> we're<00:02:06.610> gonna<00:02:06.700> tap<00:02:06.969> with<00:02:07.209> our<00:02:07.329> first

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
obviously we're gonna tap with our first

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.710 
obviously we're gonna tap with our first
finger<00:02:08.640> alright<00:02:09.670> and<00:02:09.879> then<00:02:10.090> everything<00:02:10.569> is

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
finger alright and then everything is

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.199 
finger alright and then everything is
going<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:10.899> be<00:02:11.019> him<00:02:11.830> pulled<00:02:12.549> off<00:02:12.760> from<00:02:12.790> there

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
going to be him pulled off from there

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.410 
going to be him pulled off from there
and<00:02:14.489> basically<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.700> beginning<00:02:15.819> patterns

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
and basically the beginning patterns

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.789 
and basically the beginning patterns
everything's<00:02:16.959> going<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.230> be<00:02:17.319> done<00:02:17.500> that

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
everything's going to be done that

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.589 
everything's going to be done that
basically<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:18.819> little<00:02:19.030> pattern<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.450> we

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
basically the one little pattern that we

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.330 
basically the one little pattern that we
learned<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:20.620> can<00:02:20.769> probably<00:02:20.920> find<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
learned you can probably find the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.759 
learned you can probably find the
pattern<00:02:21.700> in<00:02:21.819> the<00:02:22.150> previous<00:02:22.599> lesson<00:02:23.049> on<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
pattern in the previous lesson on the

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.759 
pattern in the previous lesson on the
previous<00:02:24.370> download<00:02:24.849> it's<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:26.200> the<00:02:26.380> three<00:02:26.620> no

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
previous download it's just the three no

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:32.670 
previous download it's just the three no
pattern<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.430> tap<00:02:28.440> pull<00:02:29.940> pull<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.680> we're

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
pattern that you tap pull pull and we're

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.259 
pattern that you tap pull pull and we're
basically<00:02:32.860> gonna<00:02:33.099> do<00:02:33.190> that<00:02:33.310> eight<00:02:33.489> times<00:02:33.849> in

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
basically gonna do that eight times in
