00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.839 
from one guy we have to discard your
stare<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.530> we<00:00:13.620> go<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:13.980> buy<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.099> marquee<00:00:14.580> CO

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
stare so we go out and buy a marquee CO

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.870 
stare so we go out and buy a marquee CO
and<00:00:15.179> from<00:00:16.020> your<00:00:16.170> Ventus<00:00:16.859> just<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.460> link<00:00:17.699> up

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
and from your Ventus just to link up

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.090 
and from your Ventus just to link up
with<00:00:18.029> benue<00:00:18.330> cheese<00:00:18.600> italian<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.470> juventus

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
with benue cheese italian and juventus

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.070 
with benue cheese italian and juventus
so<00:00:20.279> since<00:00:20.520> he's<00:00:20.640> got<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.820> nationality<00:00:21.300> ankle

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
so since he's got that nationality ankle

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.259 
so since he's got that nationality ankle
blink<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.519> free<00:00:23.880> missing

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
blink and they can have free missing

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.870 
blink and they can have free missing
links<00:00:24.660> each<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:25.320> they<00:00:25.890> will<00:00:26.070> still<00:00:26.400> both<00:00:26.609> get

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
links each and they will still both get

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.849 
links each and they will still both get
now<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.180> chemistry<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.930> guys<00:00:28.140> didn't<00:00:28.650> know

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
now in chemistry if you guys didn't know

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.490 
now in chemistry if you guys didn't know
that<00:00:29.330> so<00:00:30.330> that's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> nice<00:00:30.750> little<00:00:30.960> tip<00:00:31.230> for<00:00:31.410> you

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that so that's a nice little tip for you

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
that so that's a nice little tip for you
to<00:00:31.619> get<00:00:31.769> chemistry<00:00:32.219> obviously<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.969> players

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to get chemistry obviously the players

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.030 
to get chemistry obviously the players
around<00:00:33.690> him<00:00:33.870> loose<00:00:34.170> chemistry<00:00:34.620> such<00:00:34.800> as<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
around him loose chemistry such as the

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
around him loose chemistry such as the
left<00:00:35.250> midi<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.670> only<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.940> two<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
left midi was only on two and the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080

striker Linfield is only on for now

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
striker Linfield is only on for now
hopefully<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.899> still<00:00:40.140> perform<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.739> his

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
hopefully you can still perform to his

were<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.080> only<00:01:10.229> other<00:01:10.500> chance<00:01:10.680> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> game

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
were the only other chance of the game

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.340 
were the only other chance of the game
nice<00:01:12.000> little<00:01:12.330> shot<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> edge<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> box

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
nice little shot on the edge of the box

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.899 
nice little shot on the edge of the box
and<00:01:13.560> he<00:01:13.710> seems<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.310> position<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and he seems to get in that position a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.370 
and he seems to get in that position a
lot<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.360> shoot<00:01:15.570> on<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> edge<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> box

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
lot to shoot on the edge of the box

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.810 
lot to shoot on the edge of the box
don't<00:01:16.979> know<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.340> maybe<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.759> just

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
don't know what it is maybe it's just

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 
don't know what it is maybe it's just
he's<00:01:18.060> running<00:01:18.450> his<00:01:18.540> work<00:01:18.810> rate<00:01:19.049> etc<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:20.009> is

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
he's running his work rate etc but is

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
he's running his work rate etc but is
definitely<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> key<00:01:21.689> player<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> notice<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
definitely a key player you notice that

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
definitely a key player you notice that
his<00:01:23.729> pace<00:01:24.090> compared<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.869> bronze<00:01:25.110> players

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
his pace compared to the bronze players

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.320 
his pace compared to the bronze players
at<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.680> stage<00:01:25.920> he's<00:01:26.159> got<00:01:26.520> blistering<00:01:27.090> pace

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
at this stage he's got blistering pace

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.410 
at this stage he's got blistering pace
and<00:01:27.740> outdoes<00:01:28.740> them<00:01:28.770> every<00:01:29.579> time<00:01:29.880> down<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.339 
contract in real life could you imagine
like<00:03:13.819> offering<00:03:14.299> this<00:03:14.450> contract<00:03:14.959> to<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.109> whole

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
like offering this contract to the whole

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.039 
like offering this contract to the whole
team<00:03:15.680> for<00:03:15.920> four<00:03:16.129> years<00:03:16.400> you<00:03:17.120> do<00:03:17.449> offer<00:03:17.750> them

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
team for four years you do offer them

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.599 
team for four years you do offer them
individually<00:03:18.470> so<00:03:19.010> i<00:03:19.040> think<00:03:19.129> it<00:03:19.400> should<00:03:19.579> stay

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
individually so i think it should stay

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.059 
individually so i think it should stay
as<00:03:19.940> individual<00:03:20.510> contracts<00:03:21.019> because<00:03:21.199> it<00:03:21.919> just

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:22.069 
as individual contracts because it just

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.360 
as individual contracts because it just
adds<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.519> little<00:03:22.790> bit<00:03:22.940> of<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.980> real-life<00:03:24.980> effect

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
adds a little bit of a real-life effect

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.800 
adds a little bit of a real-life effect
on<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.699> how<00:03:25.849> they<00:03:26.030> did<00:03:26.150> not<00:03:26.299> score<00:03:26.569> their

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
on it and how they did not score their

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.240 
on it and how they did not score their
