00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.730

 b series teams for their next edition 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.090
 but unfortunately we can not find 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.640
 the corinthians in this list so far 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.729

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.530
 ea sports producers in brazil 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.950
 stated with certainty that the Corinthians 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.259
 Going is not fifa but now 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.360
 negotiations are underway not yet 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.490
 is 100% confirmed but we believe that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.580
 sure, and we also hope that the 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.119
 corinthians is coming to be part of this 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.250
 difficult 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.250
 Now let's change the subject let's talk 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.050
 of what docs watch doc a world game 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.690
 open where you will get into the 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.250
 a hacker will here all the city will 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.979
 be a very interesting game 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.799
 many people consider the possibility of a 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.560
 coping with that gta5 and the art dollars 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.110
 Stick the stick there to see who's going to be 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.150
 which is going to be the best game of the genre right? 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.070
 So we'll wait and see. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.350
 and now great news for anyone who has 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.390
 an xbox 360 and ps3 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.959
 bad news for anyone who asks 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.120
 want the ps4 and also with the xbox onu is 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.180
 that the hot dog producers affirmed 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.370
 that the game will be exactly the same between 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.840
 these platforms there will be no difference 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.000
 from generation to generation 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.950
 only slightly compared to the graph 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.440
 but it's not much like that 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.049
 and also will have much more much more 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.820
 people on the scenery in the consoles of 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.130
 next generation is clear because they 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.290
 they can have much more 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 particles is a good business. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.019
 cool that the radio is ps 4 is much more 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.910
 powerful that ps3 and xbox unites a lot more 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.640
 important that xbox 360 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.650
 the spirit is this idea of â€‹â€‹having more 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.820
 people more movement in the scenario that will 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.590
 to be very nice 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.870
 we hope the games well to be a 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.790
 next year 's big game 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.650
 I await for sure the watchdog one 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.060
 good tip for you 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.190
 Now, let's talk about the games. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.650
 promising more for this generation epr 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.510
 next, which is the cradle of 4 that 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:13.090
 will be released now in October to 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.620
 ps3 ps 4 xbox 360 xbox of the year and pc 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.530
 and this game will have a novelty 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:20.380
 amazing that it will be totally dubbed 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.960
 in Portuguese including subtitles and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.330
 will also have the presence of the actors 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.040
 eduardo martins that that affection of the 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.280
 elite troop there like leaving photo here 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.320
 and 20, I think that's how I was told about it. 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.560
 I'll leave a photo here and you'll see the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.430
 who is promising a lot because 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.380
 dubbing in Portuguese is something that 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.270
 I was really missing to the end 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.980
 of four and we all hope that 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.320
 It's very good to see you're seeing 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.810
 then one game to 24 you can see that is 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.700
 I really did not want a game and now I say 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.760
 more as a soloist going out rope or 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.610
 accept chan will get your x 1 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.680
 module player versus players that I take 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.570
 to cope is to be one thing 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.790
 Unbelievable, I'll leave you guys. 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.180
 follow the trailer with the sound I heard 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.180
 kiss 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:25.330
 they play is another 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.330
 looks 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.930
 the transmission
