the Lambada actually plug the action

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.340 
the Lambada actually plug the action
tugs<00:01:34.460> in<00:01:34.580> at<00:01:34.730> the<00:01:34.820> back<00:01:35.030> so<00:01:35.810> showing<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:36.260> in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
tugs in at the back so showing you in

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.200 
tugs in at the back so showing you in
the<00:01:36.500> previous<00:01:36.980> video<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.610> cable<00:01:38.000> which<00:01:38.120> is

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
the previous video the cable which is

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.570 
the previous video the cable which is
very<00:01:38.480> difficult<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.170> film<00:01:39.440> has<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.190> plug<00:01:40.370> in<00:01:40.490> at

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
very difficult to film has to plug in at

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.520 
very difficult to film has to plug in at
the<00:01:40.670> back<00:01:40.850> there's<00:01:41.690> your<00:01:41.900> black<00:01:42.110> pile<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
the back there's your black pile the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.080 
the back there's your black pile the
cable<00:01:42.860> plugging<00:01:43.160> in<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.310> back<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.700> cable

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
cable plugging in the back and the cable

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.420 
cable plugging in the back and the cable
runs<00:01:44.300> through<00:01:44.720> here<00:01:45.020> so<00:01:45.770> make<00:01:45.950> sure<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.190> get

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
runs through here so make sure you get

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.830 
runs through here so make sure you get
the<00:01:46.550> cable<00:01:46.880> plugged<00:01:47.060> in<00:01:47.210> in<00:01:47.300> the<00:01:47.390> back<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
the cable plugged in in the back and the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.540 
the cable plugged in in the back and the
wire<00:01:48.020> through<00:01:48.320> now<00:01:48.650> as<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.490> probably

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
wire through now as you can probably

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.100 
wire through now as you can probably
tell<00:01:50.060> from<00:01:50.120> this<00:01:50.390> video<00:01:50.660> here<00:01:50.900> I've<00:01:50.990> actually

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
tell from this video here I've actually

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.890 
tell from this video here I've actually
just<00:01:51.320> dropped<00:01:51.680> this<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:51.950> as<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:53.120> was<00:01:53.420> virtually

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
just dropped this on as it was virtually

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.590 
just dropped this on as it was virtually
impossible<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:54.409> film<00:01:54.800> it<00:01:54.980> and<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:56.210> actually<00:01:56.330> do

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
impossible to film it and to actually do

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.420 
impossible to film it and to actually do
the<00:01:56.750> job<00:01:56.780> as<00:01:57.050> well<00:01:57.230> so<00:01:57.500> all<00:01:57.950> of<00:01:58.130> it<00:01:58.250> was<00:01:58.400> a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
the job as well so all of it was a

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.040 
the job as well so all of it was a
reversal<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.060> Windows<00:01:59.360> taking<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.810> off<00:01:59.870> or

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
reversal of Windows taking it off or

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.210 
reversal of Windows taking it off or
didn't<00:02:00.200> try<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.409> hook<00:02:00.530> it<00:02:00.680> over<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:00.980> top

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
didn't try and hook it over the top

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.130 
didn't try and hook it over the top
actually<00:02:02.030> put<00:02:02.210> it<00:02:02.300> on<00:02:02.390> at<00:02:02.480> this<00:02:02.600> near<00:02:02.870> side

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
actually put it on at this near side

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.320 
actually put it on at this near side
here<00:02:03.620> and<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.310> pushed<00:02:04.550> it<00:02:04.730> on<00:02:04.820> with<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.030> couple<00:02:05.150> of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
here and I pushed it on with a couple of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.600 
here and I pushed it on with a couple of
flathead<00:02:05.690> screwdrivers<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.040> once<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.490> on

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
flathead screwdrivers and once it's on

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.790 
flathead screwdrivers and once it's on
basically<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.659> long<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:08.959> don't<00:02:09.080> press

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
basically as long as you don't press

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.030 
basically as long as you don't press
down<00:02:09.979> on<00:02:10.129> this<00:02:10.190> cable<00:02:10.729> I'll<00:02:11.030> move<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:12.040> that's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
down on this cable I'll move it that's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.800 
down on this cable I'll move it that's
what<00:02:13.220> for<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.489> end<00:02:13.730> move<00:02:14.269> it<00:02:14.390> down<00:02:14.540> at<00:02:14.720> this

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
what for this end move it down at this

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.899 
what for this end move it down at this
end<00:02:14.959> before<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.349> get<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.620> handle<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.099> then<00:02:16.790> it

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
end before you get the handle on then it

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.179 
end before you get the handle on then it
should<00:02:17.090> be<00:02:17.209> okay<00:02:17.569> to<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:18.530> connect<00:02:18.799> back<00:02:18.920> up<00:02:19.069> to

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
should be okay to to connect back up to

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.500 
should be okay to to connect back up to
this<00:02:19.280> handle<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:19.730> what<00:02:19.939> I'm<00:02:19.999> going<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.180> do<00:02:20.299> now

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
this handle so what I'm going to do now

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.539 
this handle so what I'm going to do now
is<00:02:20.659> just<00:02:20.840> basically<00:02:21.099> connect<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.189> back<00:02:22.400> up

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
is just basically connect this back up

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:23.780 
is just basically connect this back up
here<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.849> this<00:02:22.909> this<00:02:23.450> is<00:02:23.569> your

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
here and this this is your

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
here and this this is your
there's<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:24.239> tension<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.870> cable<00:02:25.230> show<00:02:25.469> at

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
there's just tension to cable show at

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.800 
there's just tension to cable show at
the<00:02:25.680> beginning<00:02:25.799> of<00:02:26.099> part<00:02:26.400> 1<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.629> going<00:02:27.719> to

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
the beginning of part 1 and I'm going to

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.209 
the beginning of part 1 and I'm going to
hook<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:27.959> if<00:02:28.079> I<00:02:28.170> cut<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.469> this<00:02:28.590> handle<00:02:29.010> here

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:29.219 
hook you if I cut to this handle here

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:31.550 
hook you if I cut to this handle here
and<00:02:29.459> then<00:02:30.209> hopefully<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:30.959> lawnmower<00:02:31.200> will

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
and then hopefully this lawnmower will

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.099 
and then hopefully this lawnmower will
once<00:02:31.769> again<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.280> self-propelled<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.870> can

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
once again be self-propelled and I can

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.880 
once again be self-propelled and I can
turn<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> good<00:02:35.189> profit<00:02:35.579> on<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:36.590> so<00:02:37.590> as<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.799> can

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
turn a good profit on it so as you can

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.289 
turn a good profit on it so as you can
see<00:02:37.950> here<00:02:38.340> I've<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.579> basically<00:02:38.730> push<00:02:39.150> this

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
see here I've just basically push this

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.300 
see here I've just basically push this
cable<00:02:39.719> housing<00:02:40.140> into<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.620> adjuster<00:02:41.129> which

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
cable housing into this adjuster which

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.789 
cable housing into this adjuster which
sets<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.640> tension<00:02:42.150> now<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.930> virtually

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
sets the tension now this is virtually

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:44.990 
sets the tension now this is virtually
the<00:02:43.920> same<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.250> where<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.430> plugs<00:02:44.609> in<00:02:44.819> at<00:02:44.909> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
the same as where it plugs in at the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.789 
the same as where it plugs in at the
back<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.359> transmission<00:02:45.569> box<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.709> to

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
back of the transmission box you have to

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.289 
back of the transmission box you have to
plug<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.129> housing<00:02:47.579> in<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.909> back<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.090> the

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
plug this housing in at the back of the

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.140 
plug this housing in at the back of the
box<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.840> can<00:02:48.870> see<00:02:49.019> there<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.849> have<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:50.939> plug

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
box you can see there you have to plug

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.420 
box you can see there you have to plug
this<00:02:51.299> housing<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.109> then<00:02:52.560> this<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:53.250> actual

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
this housing in and then this the actual

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.160 
this housing in and then this the actual
wire<00:02:53.730> or<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.090> cable<00:02:54.450> power<00:02:54.659> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.870> actual

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
wire or the cable power of the actual

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.379 
wire or the cable power of the actual
cable<00:02:55.409> pulls<00:02:55.799> through<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.819> goes<00:02:56.970> into<00:02:57.269> the

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
cable pulls through and goes into the

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:58.910 
cable pulls through and goes into the
handle<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.959> you<00:02:58.019> must<00:02:58.230> make<00:02:58.409> sure<00:02:58.439> that<00:02:58.650> when

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
handle so you must make sure that when

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.899 
handle so you must make sure that when
you<00:02:59.010> channel<00:02:59.280> do<00:02:59.340> it<00:02:59.459> at<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.609> back<00:02:59.730> of<00:02:59.849> the

00:02:59.899 --> 00:02:59.909 
you channel do it at the back of the

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:00.800 
you channel do it at the back of the
transmission<00:03:00.329> box

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
transmission box

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.479 
transmission box
it<00:03:01.170> feels<00:03:01.379> like<00:03:01.560> it's<00:03:01.739> pushed<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.129> nice<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
it feels like it's pushed in nice and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.280 
it feels like it's pushed in nice and
solid<00:03:02.730> into<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> back<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.019> you<00:03:04.049> pull

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
solid into the back and then you pull

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.129 
solid into the back and then you pull
this<00:03:04.439> cable<00:03:04.889> through<00:03:05.069> now<00:03:05.819> I've<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.450> put

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
this cable through now I've just put

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.110 
this cable through now I've just put
that<00:03:07.260> into<00:03:07.379> the<00:03:07.500> handle<00:03:07.859> as<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.579> see<00:03:08.790> here

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
that into the handle as you can see here

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.429 
that into the handle as you can see here
moves<00:03:09.989> up<00:03:10.139> and<00:03:10.230> down

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
moves up and down

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.409 
moves up and down
probably<00:03:10.859> moves<00:03:11.040> up<00:03:11.250> down<00:03:11.430> around<00:03:12.000> about<00:03:12.269> an

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
probably moves up down around about an

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.750 
probably moves up down around about an
inch<00:03:12.599> so<00:03:13.379> we'll<00:03:13.889> take<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.099> look<00:03:14.280> about<00:03:14.549> in<00:03:14.669> the

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
inch so we'll take a look about in the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.250 
inch so we'll take a look about in the
back<00:03:14.879> of<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.090> mower<00:03:15.269> just<00:03:15.959> see<00:03:16.079> if<00:03:16.139> this

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
back of the mower just see if this

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
back of the mower just see if this
transmission<00:03:16.829> appears<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.549> be<00:03:17.609> working<00:03:18.000> okay

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
transmission appears to be working okay

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.740 
transmission appears to be working okay
as<00:03:20.280> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.579> see<00:03:20.790> it's<00:03:20.970> now<00:03:21.150> we're<00:03:21.389> operating

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
as you can see it's now we're operating

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.409 
as you can see it's now we're operating
the<00:03:22.169> lever<00:03:22.349> now<00:03:22.650> just<00:03:23.159> a<00:03:23.280> word<00:03:23.459> while<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.359> on

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
the lever now just a word while we're on

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.330 
the lever now just a word while we're on
about<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:24.989> just<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.620> cable<00:03:25.859> as<00:03:26.189> well

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
about that it's just the cable as well

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.039 
about that it's just the cable as well
on<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.579> handle<00:03:26.939> it<00:03:27.090> won't<00:03:27.269> operate<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.780> speed

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
on the handle it won't operate the speed

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.899 
on the handle it won't operate the speed
if<00:03:28.229> you<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.409> any<00:03:28.560> tighter<00:03:28.889> or<00:03:29.519> anything<00:03:29.699> like

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
if you do any tighter or anything like

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.819 
if you do any tighter or anything like
that<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.269> box<00:03:30.479> is<00:03:30.659> the<00:03:31.139> set<00:03:31.319> to<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.560> speed

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
that the box is the set to the speed

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.129 
that the box is the set to the speed
basically<00:03:32.310> runs<00:03:32.549> on<00:03:32.729> the<00:03:32.879> off<00:03:33.389> off<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.720> engine

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
basically runs on the off off the engine

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.319 
basically runs on the off off the engine
from<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.319> belt<00:03:34.620> there's<00:03:34.829> no<00:03:34.979> change<00:03:35.879> of<00:03:36.000> speed

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
from the belt there's no change of speed

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.330 
from the belt there's no change of speed
by<00:03:36.569> altering<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.409> tension<00:03:37.829> or<00:03:37.919> anything<00:03:38.099> like

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
by altering the tension or anything like

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.219 
by altering the tension or anything like
that<00:03:38.400> but<00:03:38.729> it's<00:03:39.030> not<00:03:39.209> tension<00:03:39.750> it's<00:03:40.109> not

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:40.229 
that but it's not tension it's not

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.740 
that but it's not tension it's not
tensioned<00:03:40.709> enough<00:03:41.010> it<00:03:41.669> won't<00:03:41.909> pull<00:03:42.209> when<00:03:42.389> your

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
tensioned enough it won't pull when your

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.210 
tensioned enough it won't pull when your
lawnmower<00:03:42.930> want<00:03:43.349> drivers<00:03:43.829> said<00:03:44.040> at<00:03:44.159> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
lawnmower want drivers said at the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.439 
lawnmower want drivers said at the
beginning<00:03:44.579> that's<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.940> thing<00:03:45.120> to<00:03:45.239> check

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
beginning that's the thing to check

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.990 
beginning that's the thing to check
first<00:03:45.829> so<00:03:46.829> I've<00:03:47.220> got<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.519> all<00:03:47.579> back<00:03:47.819> together

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
first so I've got that all back together

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.789 
first so I've got that all back together
of<00:03:48.269> course<00:03:48.419> I<00:03:48.569> need<00:03:48.659> to<00:03:48.720> pull<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> blade<00:03:49.139> back

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
of course I need to pull the blade back

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.949 
of course I need to pull the blade back
on<00:03:49.979> and<00:03:50.220> the<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.400> belt<00:03:51.120> gown<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.750> belt

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
on and the the belt gown and the belt

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.689 
on and the the belt gown and the belt
and<00:03:52.109> everything<00:03:52.169> else<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:53.159> get<00:03:53.340> this<00:03:53.489> up<00:03:53.609> and

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
and everything else and get this up and

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.569 
and everything else and get this up and
running<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:55.560> may<00:03:55.709> be<00:03:55.739> worth<00:03:55.979> doing<00:03:56.340> this<00:03:56.430> if

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
running so it may be worth doing this if

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.129 
running so it may be worth doing this if
you've<00:03:56.699> got<00:03:56.819> a<00:03:56.849> lot<00:03:57.030> more<00:03:57.060> repair<00:03:57.629> for<00:03:57.780> profit

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
you've got a lot more repair for profit

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.930 
you've got a lot more repair for profit
it<00:03:58.260> might<00:03:58.409> cost<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.220> few<00:03:59.370> pounds<00:03:59.760> if<00:03:59.819> you're

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
it might cost you a few pounds if you're

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.879 
it might cost you a few pounds if you're
going<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.120> get<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> cable<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:01.319> might<00:04:01.590> sometimes

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
going to get a cable it might sometimes

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.469 
going to get a cable it might sometimes
be<00:04:02.190> easier<00:04:02.340> just<00:04:02.699> to<00:04:02.819> sell<00:04:03.060> honest<00:04:03.239> push

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.479 
be easier just to sell honest push

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:05.119 
be easier just to sell honest push
mowers<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:04.199> self-propelled<00:04:04.859> but<00:04:05.010> in

mowers and not self-propelled but in

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.189 
mowers and not self-propelled but in
this<00:04:05.220> case<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.819> managed<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.540> get<00:04:06.659> the<00:04:06.780> cable<00:04:07.169> I

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
this case I managed to get the cable I

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.689 
this case I managed to get the cable I
think<00:04:07.379> it<00:04:07.439> was<00:04:07.530> about<00:04:07.590> six<00:04:07.709> seven<00:04:08.250> quid<00:04:08.489> maybe

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
think it was about six seven quid maybe

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.819 
think it was about six seven quid maybe
a<00:04:08.790> fabric<00:04:09.209> at<00:04:09.389> quite<00:04:09.629> remember<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.199> it<00:04:10.709> took

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
a fabric at quite remember but it took

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.229 
a fabric at quite remember but it took
me<00:04:10.979> about<00:04:11.099> twenty<00:04:11.430> five<00:04:11.579> minutes<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:12.120> do<00:04:12.209> a

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
me about twenty five minutes to do a

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.330 
me about twenty five minutes to do a
little<00:04:12.449> bit<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.780> fiddling<00:04:13.139> about<00:04:13.340> obviously

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
little bit of fiddling about obviously

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.379 
little bit of fiddling about obviously
it<00:04:14.400> takes<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.729> little<00:04:14.819> bit<00:04:14.939> longer<00:04:15.090> when<00:04:15.329> you're

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:15.389 
it takes a little bit longer when you're

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.599 
it takes a little bit longer when you're
tryna<00:04:15.599> film<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.109> it's<00:04:16.650> very<00:04:16.829> difficult<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.459> get

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
tryna film it it's very difficult to get

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.969 
tryna film it it's very difficult to get
in<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.349> once<00:04:19.349> you've<00:04:19.470> done<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.620> a<00:04:19.680> couple<00:04:19.739> of

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
in but once you've done it a couple of

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.199 
in but once you've done it a couple of
times<00:04:20.190> you<00:04:20.370> can<00:04:20.519> actually<00:04:20.579> do<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.030> without

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
times you can actually do this without

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:22.700 
times you can actually do this without
taking<00:04:21.720> there<00:04:21.930> the<00:04:22.049> blade<00:04:22.259> off<00:04:22.470> or<00:04:22.560> anything

taking there the blade off or anything
like<00:04:23.009> that<00:04:23.070> and<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.000> actually<00:04:24.120> set<00:04:24.449> the

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
like that and you can actually set the

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.089 
like that and you can actually set the
spring<00:04:24.780> off<00:04:24.900> of<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.139> near<00:04:25.409> side<00:04:25.680> as<00:04:25.889> well

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
spring off of this near side as well

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.409 
spring off of this near side as well
there's<00:04:26.699> one<00:04:26.849> there<00:04:27.060> which<00:04:27.210> is<00:04:27.270> quite

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
there's one there which is quite

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.350 
there's one there which is quite
difficult<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.960> get<00:04:28.169> back<00:04:28.349> on<00:04:28.530> so<00:04:28.889> it's<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:30.090> I

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
difficult to get back on so it's a I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.879 
difficult to get back on so it's a I
think<00:04:30.810> it's<00:04:30.960> worth<00:04:31.139> doing<00:04:31.320> if<00:04:31.530> you<00:04:31.620> can<00:04:31.650> get

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
think it's worth doing if you can get

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.310 
think it's worth doing if you can get
the<00:04:32.039> the<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.510> cable<00:04:33.510> cheap<00:04:33.810> enough<00:04:34.050> if<00:04:34.229> you

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
the the the cable cheap enough if you

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.780 
the the the cable cheap enough if you
can<00:04:34.409> get<00:04:34.529> one<00:04:34.650> for<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.919> price<00:04:35.159> it's<00:04:35.400> worth

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
can get one for that price it's worth
