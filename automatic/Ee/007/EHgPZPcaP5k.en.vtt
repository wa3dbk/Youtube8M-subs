00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
Hebrew and so we're actually going to go

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
Hebrew and so we're actually going to go
through<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> few<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> these<00:00:38.190> translations<00:00:39.090> here

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
through a few of these translations here

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
through a few of these translations here
just<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.230> look<00:00:40.440> at<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:41.340> we're<00:00:41.550> missing<00:00:41.700> when

the face of the waters

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.460 
the face of the waters

and so you can see in our English

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.940 
and so you can see in our English
translations<00:04:07.430> we're<00:04:08.060> missing<00:04:08.599> these<00:04:09.470> direct

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
translations we're missing these direct

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.879

let<00:04:17.570> me<00:04:17.630> go<00:04:17.780> ahead<00:04:17.870> and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.689 

and<00:04:33.530> so<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:33.860> is<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.099> final<00:04:34.280> translation

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699

divinely transform the sky waters and

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:42.520 
divinely transform the sky waters and
the<00:04:40.250> land<00:04:40.490> the<00:04:40.819> land<00:04:41.060> was<00:04:41.360> chaotic<00:04:41.840> emptiness

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
the land the land was chaotic emptiness

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.070 
the land the land was chaotic emptiness
and<00:04:42.740> darkness<00:04:43.520> was<00:04:43.939> covering<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.479> face<00:04:44.719> of

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
and darkness was covering the face of

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.040 
and darkness was covering the face of
chaotic<00:04:45.439> waters<00:04:46.009> and<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:47.000> wind<00:04:47.210> of<00:04:47.389> God<00:04:47.419> blew

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
chaotic waters and the wind of God blew

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.749 
chaotic waters and the wind of God blew
upon<00:04:48.439> the<00:04:48.590> face<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:48.860> the<00:04:49.069> waters

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
upon the face of the waters

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:52.450 
upon the face of the waters
thence<00:04:50.419> God<00:04:50.689> said<00:04:51.080> let<00:04:51.379> light<00:04:51.409> exist<00:04:52.189> and

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
thence God said let light exist and

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.289 
thence God said let light exist and
light<00:04:53.289> existed
