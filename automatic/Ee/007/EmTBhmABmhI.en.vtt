a miscellaneous fantasy collection maybe
for<00:01:32.040> some<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> fantasy<00:01:32.820> cards<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.240> they

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
for some of the fantasy cards that they

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
for some of the fantasy cards that they
didn't<00:01:33.659> put<00:01:33.810> into<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> fantasy<00:01:34.560> collection<00:01:35.250> in

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
didn't put into a fantasy collection in

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.609 
didn't put into a fantasy collection in
which<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.210> haven't<00:01:36.570> been<00:01:36.689> saving<00:01:37.110> any<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.439> those

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
which I haven't been saving any of those

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.859 
which I haven't been saving any of those
I<00:01:37.970> thought<00:01:38.970> for<00:01:39.210> sure<00:01:39.240> they<00:01:39.479> would<00:01:39.630> make<00:01:39.840> a

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
I thought for sure they would make a

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
I thought for sure they would make a
play<00:01:40.170> book<00:01:40.409> collection<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.100> they<00:01:41.250> did<00:01:41.460> last

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
play book collection as they did last

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
play book collection as they did last
year<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.720> we<00:01:42.840> have<00:01:42.960> yet<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
year but we have yet to see that

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
year but we have yet to see that
collection<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.399> I'm<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.820> sure<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.000> they

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
collection so I'm not for sure if they

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270 
collection so I'm not for sure if they
will<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> went<00:01:46.290> back<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.530> completed<00:01:47.159> the

you put him in your lineup he shows up

you put him in your lineup he shows up
on<00:02:32.670> the<00:02:32.790> depth<00:02:33.030> chart<00:02:33.120> as<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> 95<00:02:34.109> overall<00:02:34.560> which

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
on the depth chart as a 95 overall which

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.759 
on the depth chart as a 95 overall which
really<00:02:35.670> doesn't<00:02:35.909> make<00:02:36.120> any<00:02:36.359> sense<00:02:36.769> they

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
really doesn't make any sense they

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.679 
really doesn't make any sense they
bumped<00:02:38.129> his<00:02:38.220> speed<00:02:38.519> in<00:02:38.790> man<00:02:39.030> coverage<00:02:39.269> that's

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
bumped his speed in man coverage that's

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.869 
bumped his speed in man coverage that's
up<00:02:40.019> but<00:02:40.439> again<00:02:40.739> it's<00:02:40.950> not<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.129> significant

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
up but again it's not a significant

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.849 
up but again it's not a significant
change<00:02:42.150> from<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.480> gold<00:02:42.720> card<00:02:43.079> so<00:02:43.769> I'm

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
change from the gold card so I'm

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.559 
change from the gold card so I'm
guessing<00:02:44.069> his<00:02:44.370> overall<00:02:44.849> was<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:45.269> supposed

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
guessing his overall was really supposed

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.710 
guessing his overall was really supposed
to<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.870> actually<00:02:46.200> a<00:02:46.470> 95<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.329> shown<00:02:48.359> in

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to be actually a 95 as it is shown in

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.300 
to be actually a 95 as it is shown in
the<00:02:48.810> depth<00:02:49.049> chart<00:02:49.139> and<00:02:49.530> they<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.920> screwed<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
the depth chart and they just screwed it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.520 
the depth chart and they just screwed it
up<00:02:50.430> they<00:02:51.090> also<00:02:51.299> made<00:02:51.659> the<00:02:51.690> new<00:02:51.959> first<00:02:52.230> drop

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
was almost afraid of not going ahead and

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.240 
was almost afraid of not going ahead and
completing<00:05:31.870> each<00:05:32.020> team<00:05:32.349> collection<00:05:32.830> now<00:05:33.009> why

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
completing each team collection now why

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.939 
completing each team collection now why

all these cards are available because as

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:37.409 
all these cards are available because as

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
would pull a fast one and eliminate the

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.409 
would pull a fast one and eliminate the
gold<00:05:47.710> premium<00:05:47.979> packs<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:48.789> replace<00:05:49.180> them<00:05:49.360> with

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
gold premium packs and replace them with

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.689 
gold premium packs and replace them with
