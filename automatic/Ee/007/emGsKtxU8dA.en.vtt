a lot of single that kind of exercises
and<00:00:13.820> things<00:00:14.150> where<00:00:15.430> you<00:00:16.430> know<00:00:16.550> you're<00:00:16.730> using

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:16.940 
and things where you know you're using

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.970 
and things where you know you're using
their<00:00:17.150> combinations<00:00:17.690> different<00:00:17.780> fingers<00:00:18.320> now

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
their combinations different fingers now

their combinations different fingers now
let's<00:00:19.160> look<00:00:19.280> at<00:00:19.430> more<00:00:19.970> specific<00:00:20.480> type<00:00:20.660> of

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
let's look at more specific type of

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:22.919 
let's look at more specific type of
techniques<00:00:21.380> and<00:00:21.650> things<00:00:21.769> that<00:00:21.890> we<00:00:22.039> can<00:00:22.220> do

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:22.929 
techniques and things that we can do

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.829 
techniques and things that we can do
double<00:00:23.929> stops<00:00:24.460> or<00:00:25.460> basically<00:00:26.000> we<00:00:26.570> harmonize

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:26.839 
double stops or basically we harmonize

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:30.700 
double stops or basically we harmonize
major<00:00:27.410> scales<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.220> minor<00:00:28.339> scales<00:00:28.759> and<00:00:29.560> we<00:00:30.560> use

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
major scales and minor scales and we use

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:40.990 
major scales and minor scales and we use
the<00:00:30.890> music<00:00:31.099> quite<00:00:31.519> a<00:00:31.550> bit<00:00:38.950> and<00:00:39.950> to<00:00:40.640> get<00:00:40.820> that

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
the music quite a bit and to get that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.270 
the music quite a bit and to get that
technique<00:00:41.480> just<00:00:42.020> practicing<00:00:42.649> them<00:00:42.829> as<00:00:42.980> major

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
technique just practicing them as major

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.139 
technique just practicing them as major
scales<00:00:43.699> or<00:00:44.449> scales<00:00:44.930> themselves<00:00:45.680> and<00:00:46.059> what<00:00:47.059> I'm

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
scales or scales themselves and what I'm

going to do is you know before I start

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.700 
going to do is you know before I start
showing<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:49.190> this<00:00:50.079> I'll<00:00:51.079> let<00:00:51.199> you<00:00:51.320> know<00:00:51.469> that

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
showing you this I'll let you know that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.319 
showing you this I'll let you know that
the<00:00:51.890> top<00:00:52.129> two<00:00:52.370> strings<00:00:52.430> to<00:00:52.910> be<00:00:53.059> in<00:00:53.210> the<00:00:53.270> e

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
the top two strings to be in the e

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.910 
the top two strings to be in the e
string<00:00:53.750> I'm<00:00:53.870> going<00:00:53.899> to<00:00:54.079> use<00:00:54.170> them<00:00:54.320> on<00:00:54.440> my<00:00:54.620> right

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
string I'm going to use them on my right

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.970 
string I'm going to use them on my right
hand<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.340> going<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.579> climb<00:00:55.879> them<00:00:56.239> with<00:00:56.510> the

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
hand is going to climb them with the

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:07.690 
hand is going to climb them with the
second<00:00:57.980> and<00:00:58.070> third<00:00:58.219> finger<00:01:06.490> that's<00:01:07.490> pretty

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
second and third finger that's pretty

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.160 
second and third finger that's pretty
much<00:01:07.790> the<00:01:07.940> technique<00:01:08.360> I'm<00:01:08.509> going<00:01:08.540> to<00:01:08.689> use<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
much the technique I'm going to use to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.039 
much the technique I'm going to use to
kind<00:01:09.619> of<00:01:09.710> go<00:01:09.830> through<00:01:09.890> some<00:01:10.100> of<00:01:10.280> this<00:01:10.430> stuff

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
kind of go through some of this stuff

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.910 
kind of go through some of this stuff
let's<00:01:12.049> take<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.259> scale<00:01:12.650> and<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:14.060> major<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.920> if

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
let's take a scale and a major and if

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.190 
let's take a scale and a major and if
you<00:01:16.070> look<00:01:16.250> at<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.000> e<00:01:17.030> note<00:01:17.390> starting<00:01:17.869> on<00:01:18.049> the

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
you look at the e note starting on the

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.359 
you look at the e note starting on the
fifth<00:01:19.009> fret<00:01:19.189> on<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.520> second<00:01:20.390> string<00:01:21.369> that's

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
fifth fret on the second string that's

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.399 
fifth fret on the second string that's
going<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.670> be<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.850> root<00:01:23.060> note<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.049> I'm<00:01:24.290> going

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
going to be the root note and I'm going

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.270 
going to be the root note and I'm going
to<00:01:24.470> harmonize<00:01:24.890> this<00:01:25.220> in<00:01:25.579> thirds<00:01:27.100> which<00:01:28.100> will

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
to harmonize this in thirds which will

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.760 
to harmonize this in thirds which will
be<00:01:28.369> major<00:01:28.579> thirds<00:01:28.909> and<00:01:29.060> minor<00:01:29.270> thirds

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.380 

so<00:01:33.770> what<00:01:33.950> I'm<00:01:34.040> doing<00:01:34.370> is<00:01:34.520> I'm<00:01:34.670> playing<00:01:34.850> -<00:01:35.060> inna

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
so what I'm doing is I'm playing - inna

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.760 
so what I'm doing is I'm playing - inna
my<00:01:35.780> second<00:01:36.200> finger<00:01:36.730> playing<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:38.170> G<00:01:39.170> sharpener

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
my second finger playing the G sharpener

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.990 
my second finger playing the G sharpener
with<00:01:40.160> my<00:01:40.340> first<00:01:40.580> finger<00:01:41.620> and<00:01:42.790> this<00:01:43.790> is

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
with my first finger and this is

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.730 
with my first finger and this is
something<00:01:44.300> that's<00:01:44.450> important<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:44.960> know<00:01:45.140> to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
something that's important to know to

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.120 
something that's important to know to
just<00:01:46.400> make<00:01:46.580> a<00:01:46.610> little<00:01:46.700> mental<00:01:47.090> note<00:01:47.240> about

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
just make a little mental note about

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.500 
just make a little mental note about
that's<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.280> major<00:01:49.490> shape<00:01:49.880> on<00:01:50.090> those<00:01:50.240> two

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
that's a major shape on those two

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.810 
that's a major shape on those two
there's<00:01:51.110> two<00:01:51.170> strings<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:52.040> mean<00:01:52.220> I<00:01:52.250> just<00:01:52.370> you

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
there's two strings I mean I just you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.880 
there's two strings I mean I just you
just<00:01:53.750> kind<00:01:53.990> of<00:01:54.020> put<00:01:54.290> commit<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.680> to<00:01:54.860> memory

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
just kind of put commit that to memory

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.950 
just kind of put commit that to memory
that<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.640> major<00:01:55.850> every<00:01:56.540> time<00:01:56.750> you<00:01:56.810> have<00:01:56.930> a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
that is major every time you have a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.880 
that is major every time you have a
major<00:01:57.230> kind<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.650> shake<00:01:59.380> the<00:02:00.380> major<00:02:00.590> sound

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
major kind of shake the major sound

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.250 
major kind of shake the major sound
looking<00:02:01.430> for<00:02:01.640> it<00:02:01.730> there's<00:02:02.510> a<00:02:02.570> minor<00:02:02.900> sound

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
looking for it there's a minor sound

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:11.680 
looking for it there's a minor sound
it's<00:02:03.470> going<00:02:03.620> to<00:02:03.680> be<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:09.170> major<00:02:09.440> is<00:02:09.679> like<00:02:10.690> you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
it's going to be the major is like you

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.660 
it's going to be the major is like you
know<00:02:11.840> one<00:02:12.110> fret<00:02:12.410> difference<00:02:18.430> all<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.550> but

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
know one fret difference all right but

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.480 
know one fret difference all right but
let's<00:02:19.820> go<00:02:19.970> over<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> a<00:02:20.660> major<00:02:20.900> scale<00:02:21.400> what<00:02:22.400> I'm

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
let's go over the a major scale what I'm

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.770 
let's go over the a major scale what I'm
gonna<00:02:22.610> do<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:23.120> on<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> play<00:02:23.540> eeen<00:02:24.850> right<00:02:26.230> sure

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
G sharp

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:41.440 
G sharp
than<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:32.950> B<00:02:35.140> C<00:02:36.140> sharp<00:02:37.480> d<00:02:38.480> sharp<00:02:38.510> e<00:02:40.150> so<00:02:41.150> I'm<00:02:41.209> going

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
than a B C sharp d sharp e so I'm going

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:49.089 
than a B C sharp d sharp e so I'm going
up<00:02:41.540> a<00:02:41.659> whole<00:02:41.840> octave<00:02:42.079> there<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:48.099> now

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
up a whole octave there and now

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.809 
up a whole octave there and now
basically<00:02:50.030> that's<00:02:50.569> what<00:02:51.109> to<00:02:51.829> me<00:02:51.980> partially<00:02:52.670> is

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
basically that's what to me partially is

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.459 
basically that's what to me partially is
one<00:02:53.030> way<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.209> double<00:02:53.870> stopping<00:02:54.230> kind<00:02:54.409> of

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:54.469 
one way that double stopping kind of

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:56.259 
one way that double stopping kind of
came<00:02:54.620> about<00:02:54.889> is<00:02:55.099> reharmonization<00:02:55.639> in<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
came about is reharmonization in the

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.420 
came about is reharmonization in the
major<00:02:56.450> scale<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.049> what<00:02:57.620> we're<00:02:57.739> going<00:02:57.859> to<00:02:57.889> do<00:02:58.099> is

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
major scale so what we're going to do is

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.709 
major scale so what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:58.549> going<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.700> take<00:02:58.849> our<00:02:58.969> first<00:02:59.150> finger<00:02:59.599> and

00:02:59.709 --> 00:02:59.719 
we're going to take our first finger and

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.660 
we're going to take our first finger and
start<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:00.109> G<00:03:00.230> sharp<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:01.129> at<00:03:01.280> this<00:03:01.400> point

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
start on the G sharp now at this point

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.160 
start on the G sharp now at this point
we're<00:03:01.849> actually<00:03:01.969> still<00:03:02.420> playing<00:03:02.719> the<00:03:02.870> E<00:03:02.900> major

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
we're actually still playing the E major

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.520 
we're actually still playing the E major
scale<00:03:03.349> of<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.220> neck<00:03:05.109> now<00:03:06.109> I'm<00:03:06.169> going<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.409> play

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
scale of the neck now I'm going to play

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
scale of the neck now I'm going to play
two<00:03:06.709> parts<00:03:07.099> you're<00:03:08.090> going<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.269> play<00:03:08.359> the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
two parts you're going to play the

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.209 
two parts you're going to play the
energy<00:03:09.019> shot<00:03:14.439> what<00:03:15.439> I've<00:03:15.530> done<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.829> I've<00:03:15.980> moved

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:16.219 
energy shot what I've done is I've moved

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.030 
energy shot what I've done is I've moved
my<00:03:16.310> G<00:03:16.579> sharp<00:03:16.879> to<00:03:16.969> a<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.049> my<00:03:18.200> third<00:03:18.439> finger<00:03:18.709> to

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
my G sharp to a and my third finger to

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:31.590 
my G sharp to a and my third finger to
that's<00:03:19.700> going<00:03:21.250> there<00:03:22.250> we<00:03:22.400> go<00:03:22.609> G<00:03:22.909> sharp<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.419> be

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.700 

then<00:03:32.600> we're<00:03:32.690> going<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.840> go<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.610> ain't<00:03:34.610> no<00:03:35.710> to

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
stuff you know Marty Robbins so this is

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.790 
stuff you know Marty Robbins so this is
a<00:04:04.459> East<00:04:05.060> Gale<00:04:07.600> continuing<00:04:08.600> on<00:04:08.720> up<00:04:08.750> we're<00:04:09.709> going

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
a East Gale continuing on up we're going

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.030 
a East Gale continuing on up we're going
to<00:04:09.860> go<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.190> B<00:04:10.370> note<00:04:10.610> twelfth<00:04:11.180> fret<00:04:11.950> and<00:04:12.950> we

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
to go to the B note twelfth fret and we

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.880 
to go to the B note twelfth fret and we
really<00:04:13.220> go<00:04:13.310> to<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.489> D<00:04:13.640> sharp<00:04:14.200> at<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.260> 11th<00:04:15.770> on

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
really go to the D sharp at the 11th on

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:18.819 
really go to the D sharp at the 11th on
the<00:04:15.980> high<00:04:16.130> E<00:04:16.160> string<00:04:17.380> then<00:04:18.380> we<00:04:18.470> really<00:04:18.620> go<00:04:18.769> to

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
the high E string then we really go to

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.090 
the high E string then we really go to
the<00:04:19.010> c-sharp<00:04:19.549> never<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.060> third<00:04:20.269> finger<00:04:20.570> and

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
the c-sharp never the third finger and

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.380 
the c-sharp never the third finger and
then<00:04:22.100> my<00:04:22.250> first<00:04:22.430> remember<00:04:22.790> play<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.150> root

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
then my first remember play the root

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
then my first remember play the root
note<00:04:23.600> eat<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.650> top<00:04:24.860> string<00:04:26.290> then<00:04:27.290> we're

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
note eat on the top string then we're

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.460 
note eat on the top string then we're
going<00:04:27.530> to<00:04:27.590> move<00:04:27.710> that<00:04:27.890> shape<00:04:28.130> up<00:04:28.400> and<00:04:29.470> that's

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
going to move that shape up and that's

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.450 
going to move that shape up and that's
going<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.710> be<00:04:30.860> D<00:04:31.190> sharp<00:04:31.600> and<00:04:32.600> F<00:04:32.780> sharp<00:04:33.310> back<00:04:34.310> to

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
going to be D sharp and F sharp back to

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:57.890 
going to be D sharp and F sharp back to
E

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.210 

and<00:04:58.900> so<00:04:59.020> that's<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.319> good<00:04:59.440> exercise<00:04:59.889> in<00:05:00.099> those

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
and so that's a good exercise in those

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.279 
and so that's a good exercise in those
two<00:05:00.430> streams<00:05:00.699> kind<00:05:00.970> of<00:05:01.030> practice<00:05:01.509> going

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
two streams kind of practice going

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:05.339 
two streams kind of practice going
through<00:05:02.650> them<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:04.720> know<00:05:04.840> they're<00:05:04.990> kind<00:05:05.289> of

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
through them you know they're kind of

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:14.670 
through them you know they're kind of
nibble<00:05:05.620> stop<00:05:07.710> okay<00:05:12.569> and<00:05:13.569> then<00:05:14.289> I<00:05:14.319> get<00:05:14.650> some

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
nibble stop okay and then I get some

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.390 
nibble stop okay and then I get some
other<00:05:14.949> exercise<00:05:15.460> to<00:05:15.669> kind<00:05:15.849> of<00:05:15.880> use<00:05:16.060> that<00:05:17.400> it's

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
other exercise to kind of use that it's

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.890 
other exercise to kind of use that it's
a<00:05:18.490> practice<00:05:18.849> kind<00:05:19.060> like<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> my<00:05:19.389> practice<00:05:19.780> of

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
a practice kind like you my practice of

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:41.010 
a practice kind like you my practice of
scale<00:05:20.139> using<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.470> sequence<00:05:39.569> I'm<00:05:40.569> doing<00:05:40.840> there

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
scale using the sequence I'm doing there

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.610 
scale using the sequence I'm doing there
is<00:05:41.050> I'm<00:05:41.169> going<00:05:41.620> up<00:05:42.159> three<00:05:44.460> going<00:05:45.460> back<00:05:45.909> one

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
is I'm going up three going back one

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.499 
is I'm going up three going back one
three<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:51.370> should<00:05:51.520> be<00:05:51.639> like<00:05:51.820> a<00:05:51.849> sequence<00:05:52.360> of

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
three it should be like a sequence of

00:05:52.509 --> 00:06:08.700 
three it should be like a sequence of
third

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.620 

now<00:06:09.710> just<00:06:09.980> but<00:06:10.130> half<00:06:10.340> step<00:06:10.640> slide<00:06:11.330> either<00:06:13.630> make

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:14.630 
now just but half step slide either make

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:23.680 
now just but half step slide either make
it<00:06:14.660> sound<00:06:14.870> kind<00:06:15.050> of<00:06:15.170> cool<00:06:22.270> and<00:06:23.270> that's<00:06:23.360> just

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
it sound kind of cool and that's just

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.840 
it sound kind of cool and that's just
kind<00:06:23.900> of<00:06:24.020> just<00:06:24.950> giving<00:06:25.190> it<00:06:25.280> more<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.760> know

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:25.850 
kind of just giving it more you know

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.010 
kind of just giving it more you know
instead<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.150> just<00:06:26.240> sounding<00:06:26.600> like<00:06:26.690> the<00:06:26.780> major

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
instead of just sounding like the major

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.310 
instead of just sounding like the major
scale<00:06:31.240> it<00:06:32.240> just<00:06:32.420> makes<00:06:32.600> it<00:06:32.690> sound<00:06:32.870> more<00:06:32.990> like

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
scale it just makes it sound more like

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.740 
scale it just makes it sound more like
you<00:06:34.220> know<00:06:34.250> kind<00:06:34.850> of<00:06:34.910> musical<00:06:35.720> you<00:06:35.930> know<00:06:36.050> so<00:06:37.750> so

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.750 
you know kind of musical you know so so

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:45.460 
you know kind of musical you know so so
I'm<00:06:38.810> going<00:06:39.020> from<00:06:39.140> E<00:06:39.440> to<00:06:42.190> a<00:06:43.750> note<00:06:44.750> in<00:06:45.230> the<00:06:45.350> F

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
I'm going from E to a note in the F

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.310
