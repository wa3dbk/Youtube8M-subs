00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.381
 The pressure cooker Scarlett SL-1529 is a justifiable choice if 

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:09.680
 find it difficult to choose from the total mass of pressure cookers! 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.130
 They are all similar to each other, and yet there is a difference (the number 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.920
 automatic programs, and so on). 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.109
 In Scarlett - ten automatic programs (in it you can cook 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.109
 almost anything you want). 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.599
 For each program provides automatic cooking time. 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 For example! 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.369
 “Rice” - 12 minutes, “baking” - 30 minutes, “soup / porridge” - 18 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.369
 minutes (this is all clear). 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.260
 There is a program "own recipe", here you can cook 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.290
 any products, and set your own cooking time 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.690
 (creative cooking, so to speak). 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.821
 For cooking in the program "double boiler", you need 

00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.260
 use a special grid that goes to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 complete set. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.100
 This program has three operating modes: for vegetables (8 minutes), 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.720
 for meat (15 minutes) and for fish (10 minutes). 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.860
 To select the mode "vegetables", click on the button "double boiler" 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.930
 once. 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.190
 To choose the "meat" - twice. 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.870
 "Fish" - three times. 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.100
 After 8 flashes the program will start working. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.780
 When the dish was ready, before opening the lid, 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 pressure must be carefully relieved. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.500
 There is a regulator on the lid; 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
 "Open". 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.790
 I say - carefully, because it will go very 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 hot steam and you can get burned. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.640
 After cooking, the pressure cooker automatically 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.220
 switches to the “temperature maintenance” mode, the maximum 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.140
 time in this mode is 24 hours (at 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.140
 60 ° C). 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.729
 There is a function "heated dishes", so that you can 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 warm up already prepared food at any time 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.790
 (automatic warm-up time - 10 minutes). 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.790
 Included is everything you need to use a pressure cooker. 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.690
 There is an instruction, which describes in detail the rules of use, 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.290
 and most importantly - a recipe book for a pressure cooker 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.810
 (with illustrations) will not remain indifferent 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.130
 even the most gourmet! 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.703
 Thanks to hermetic construction, during cooking 

00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.210
 foods keep taste and nutritious healthy 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.210
 substances. 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.170
 That is why everything cooked in a pressure cooker is very useful. 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.310
 for good health! 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.930
 I will demonstrate ease of use in action! 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.729
 Today we will cook "chicken stew in lemon with sauce 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.960
 Indian Curry. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.090
 Sounds impressive! 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.990
 To prepare the dishes will require: chicken fillet, 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.190
 tomatoes, onions, lemon, olive oil, 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.300
 lettuce, curry sauce ... 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.170
 Cut the fillet into cubes. 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.530
 Cut the onion. 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.290
 Lemon triangles. 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.950
 Finely cut the tomatoes. 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.780
 Put the food in the bowl pressure cooker, add the sauce 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.370
 curry, mix the whole thing. 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:36.110
 Turn on the "Meat" mode. 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.099
 The smell is already hinting that "Indian stewed chicken" 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.099
 is ready. 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:42.590
 We lower the pressure, remove the cover. 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.920
 The dish is served on a plate lined with lettuce. 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.491
 And now the crucial moment has come, I try what 

00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:52.160
 we made it! 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.600
 Yummy! 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.020
 Frankly, I am very impressed with Indian cuisine! 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.770
 It will be necessary to read more about Indian cuisine, it will come in handy. 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.080
 in future reviews. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.110
 And now the competition! 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.349

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.950
