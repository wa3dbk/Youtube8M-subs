00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.869 
that was going on I'm going to show you
guys<00:00:09.730> thought<00:00:10.570> a<00:00:10.600> little<00:00:11.290> ways<00:00:11.380> armor<00:00:11.680> this<00:00:12.670> is

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:12.879 
guys thought a little ways armor this is

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.010 
guys thought a little ways armor this is
the<00:00:13.059> efficient<00:00:13.480> right<00:00:13.600> here<00:00:13.750> that<00:00:13.869> you<00:00:13.930> have

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.020 
the efficient right here that you have

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.890 
the efficient right here that you have
to<00:00:14.080> do<00:00:14.260> get<00:00:14.709> it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
to do get it

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.170 
to do get it
so<00:00:16.470> once<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.860> talk<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.250> whoever<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.029> gotta

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
so once you talk to whoever you gotta

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.210 
so once you talk to whoever you gotta
talk<00:00:18.390> to<00:00:18.420> and<00:00:18.900> run<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.350> cave<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:20.040> is<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
talk to and run to the cave this is the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.609 
talk to and run to the cave this is the
key<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.520> you'll<00:00:20.670> end<00:00:20.760> up<00:00:20.880> in<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:22.470> get

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
key that you'll end up in and to get

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.050 
key that you'll end up in and to get
this<00:00:22.740> mission<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.490> just<00:00:23.610> gotta<00:00:23.910> go

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
this mission you basically just gotta go

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.310 
this mission you basically just gotta go
to<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.300> Thieves<00:00:24.720> Guild<00:00:24.860> fishing<00:00:26.630> with<00:00:27.630> pegs

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
and the other guys I guess I forgot his

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.580 
and the other guys I guess I forgot his
name<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.770> her<00:00:33.079> Delvin<00:00:34.079> or<00:00:34.290> something<00:00:34.530> like

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
name but her Delvin or something like

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.750 
name but her Delvin or something like
that<00:00:34.649> whatever<00:00:34.950> his<00:00:35.130> name<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
that whatever his name is

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.310 
that whatever his name is
you<00:00:36.300> guys<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.660> keep<00:00:36.809> filling<00:00:37.050> their

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you guys have to keep filling their

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.830 
you guys have to keep filling their
missions<00:00:37.620> over<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> over<00:00:38.370> until<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.570> do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
missions over and over until you do

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.560 
missions over and over until you do
Lazar<00:00:40.170> Kaganovich<00:00:40.290> ins<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.239> windhelm<00:00:42.329> once

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
Lazar Kaganovich ins in windhelm once

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.360 
Lazar Kaganovich ins in windhelm once
you<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> for<00:00:43.170> five<00:00:43.559> missions<00:00:43.980> I<00:00:44.070> think<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you do that for five missions I think it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.029 
you do that for five missions I think it
is<00:00:44.489> they'll<00:00:45.239> get<00:00:45.450> this<00:00:45.630> mission<00:00:46.130> and<00:00:47.130> I<00:00:49.039> kept

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
is they'll get this mission and I kept

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
is they'll get this mission and I kept
doing<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.339> same<00:00:50.550> mission<00:00:50.910> over<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:51.390> over

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
doing the same mission over and over

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.079 
doing the same mission over and over
which<00:00:51.780> probably<00:00:52.079> still<00:00:52.410> bid<00:00:52.620> because<00:00:52.769> I<00:00:53.399> kept

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
which probably still bid because I kept

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.729 
which probably still bid because I kept
give<00:00:54.269> me<00:00:54.420> stupid<00:00:54.690> towns<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> didn't

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
give me stupid towns that I didn't

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.540 
give me stupid towns that I didn't
really<00:00:55.890> wanna<00:00:56.100> go<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:58.050> kept<00:00:59.010> giving<00:00:59.160> me<00:00:59.339> like

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
really wanna go to I kept giving me like

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.110 
really wanna go to I kept giving me like
solitude<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.629> stuff<00:01:00.839> like<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.550> but<00:01:02.550> uh<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.089> I

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
solitude and stuff like that but uh so I

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.540 
solitude and stuff like that but uh so I
suggest<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.830> mix<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:04.980> up<00:01:05.100> with<00:01:05.309> what

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
suggest you just mix it up with what

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.710 
suggest you just mix it up with what
missions<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.950> but<00:01:07.950> basically<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.909> cave

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
missions you do but basically this cave

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
missions you do but basically this cave
is<00:01:09.960> pretty<00:01:10.200> much<00:01:10.320> really<00:01:10.950> easy<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.370> get

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
is pretty much really easy to get

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.330 
is pretty much really easy to get
through<00:01:11.730> if<00:01:12.060> you're<00:01:12.270> Sneaky's<00:01:12.659> high<00:01:12.840> enough

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
through if you're Sneaky's high enough

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.830 
through if you're Sneaky's high enough
but<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> low<00:01:14.970> level<00:01:15.150> snake<00:01:15.540> then

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
but if you're a low level snake then

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.880 
but if you're a low level snake then
it's<00:01:16.710> probably<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.340> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.610> harder<00:01:17.970> for

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
it's probably a little bit harder for

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
it's probably a little bit harder for
you<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.920> do<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.650> uh<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:23.400> sneakers<00:01:23.760> out<00:01:23.880> a

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
you to do but uh my sneakers out a

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.480 
you to do but uh my sneakers out a
hundred<00:01:24.120> so<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:25.500> much<00:01:25.650> gonna<00:01:25.800> be<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.190> walk

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
hundred so pretty much gonna be a walk

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.070 
hundred so pretty much gonna be a walk
through<00:01:26.760> just<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.330> show<00:01:27.480> you<00:01:27.540> how<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
through just to show you how to get to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.460 
through just to show you how to get to
where<00:01:28.230> you<00:01:28.290> got<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:28.500> get<00:01:28.620> to<00:01:28.770> at<00:01:29.730> the<00:01:29.970> beginning

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
where you got to get to at the beginning

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.840 
where you got to get to at the beginning
there's<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> fork<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.310> doesn't<00:01:32.550> really<00:01:32.640> matter

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there's a fork it doesn't really matter

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.630 
there's a fork it doesn't really matter
which<00:01:32.970> where<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.270> go<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.410> snake<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.400> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
which where you go if your snake is not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
which where you go if your snake is not
high<00:01:35.880> enough<00:01:35.910> it<00:01:36.510> really<00:01:36.840> doesn't<00:01:37.110> matter<00:01:37.200> if

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
high enough it really doesn't matter if

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
high enough it really doesn't matter if
you<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.190> high<00:01:38.340> sneak<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.970> right<00:01:39.270> side<00:01:39.600> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
you have a high sneak the right side of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.350 
you have a high sneak the right side of
LV<00:01:40.340> easier<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.430> go<00:01:41.550> through<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:42.180> there's

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
LV easier to go through because there's

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.160 
LV easier to go through because there's
a<00:01:42.420> couple<00:01:44.030> couple<00:01:45.030> thieves<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.630> here<00:01:45.840> then

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a couple couple thieves over here then

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.960 
a couple couple thieves over here then
you<00:01:46.200> run<00:01:46.410> into<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.710> right<00:01:47.400> side<00:01:47.610> doesn't<00:01:47.880> have

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
you run into the right side doesn't have

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.060 
you run into the right side doesn't have
these<00:01:48.090> thieves<00:01:48.330> but<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.440> doesn't<00:01:49.770> matter

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
these thieves but it doesn't matter

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.380 
these thieves but it doesn't matter
suppose<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:51.380> have<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.440> my<00:01:53.370> sneaks<00:01:53.610> out<00:01:53.670> 100<00:01:54.150> so

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
suppose I have the my sneaks out 100 so

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.860 
suppose I have the my sneaks out 100 so
I<00:01:54.660> have<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.640> overpowered<00:01:56.640> sneak<00:01:57.390> perk<00:01:57.660> or

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
I have that overpowered sneak perk or

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.020 
I have that overpowered sneak perk or
you<00:01:58.020> could<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.280> completely<00:01:59.280> overpower

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
you could just completely overpower

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.940 
you could just completely overpower
whoever<00:02:00.360> you're<00:02:00.510> fighting<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.650> this<00:02:04.650> is<00:02:04.800> all<00:02:04.920> I

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
whoever you're fighting so this is all I
