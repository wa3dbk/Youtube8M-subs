00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
because I just blow so much most is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
because I just blow so much most is
abusive<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.500> all<00:00:34.500> right<00:00:34.680> so<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.040> got

probably<00:00:43.530> an<00:00:43.590> easier<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> do<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
probably an easier way to do it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.450 
probably an easier way to do it
I<00:00:44.430> don't<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.879> I'm<00:00:45.390> not<00:00:45.570> sure<00:00:46.160> that's<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.370> way

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
I don't know I'm not sure that's the way

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
I don't know I'm not sure that's the way
I<00:00:47.489> did<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> though<00:00:47.969> oh<00:00:48.149> well<00:00:48.510> there's<00:00:48.719> one

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989

Ellen's<00:00:49.320> pretty<00:00:49.620> easy<00:00:49.890> that<00:00:50.100> ran<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.640> middle

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.810 
Ellen's pretty easy that ran the middle
of<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.239> ramp<00:00:52.190> one<00:00:53.190> thing<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.370> probably<00:00:53.610> should

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
of that ramp one thing I probably should

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.389 
of that ramp one thing I probably should

here<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.490> can<00:01:50.490> jump<00:01:50.700> off<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> wave<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.330> get<00:01:51.450> this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
here you can jump off a wave to get this

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.190 
here you can jump off a wave to get this
one<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:52.230> I<00:01:52.260> chose<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:52.980> do<00:01:53.190> be<00:01:53.490> lazy<00:01:54.020> jump<00:01:55.020> onto

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
one what I chose to do be lazy jump onto

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.820 
one what I chose to do be lazy jump onto
the<00:01:55.410> side<00:01:55.740> thing<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:57.060> just<00:01:57.270> kind<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.140> hop<00:01:58.500> over

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
the side thing and just kind of hop over

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.320 
the side thing and just kind of hop over
to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.390> hidden<00:02:00.390> package<00:02:01.550> it's<00:02:02.550> not<00:02:02.700> very<00:02:03.030> well

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
to the hidden package it's not very well

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.510 
to the hidden package it's not very well
ya<00:02:03.900> know<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.110> had<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> try<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.830> couple<00:02:05.100> times<00:02:05.280> but

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
ya know I had to try a couple times but

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.610 
ya know I had to try a couple times but
I<00:02:05.580> got<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.910> eventually<00:02:06.090> there<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.630> go<00:02:06.840> yeah

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
I got it eventually there you go yeah

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.470 
I got it eventually there you go yeah
and<00:02:09.200> then<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:11.100> got<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.610> up<00:02:11.640> there<00:02:12.030> for<00:02:12.420> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
and then you got to be up there for a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.440 
and then you got to be up there for a
couple<00:02:13.280> alright<00:02:14.280> like<00:02:14.850> one<00:02:15.030> or<00:02:15.150> two<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> think

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
couple alright like one or two I think

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.260 
couple alright like one or two I think

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
yeah this one you jumped out got one and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.040 
yeah this one you jumped out got one and
there's<00:02:19.080> tears<00:02:19.820> to<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.120> stick<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> right

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
there's tears to just stick to the right

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.570 
there's tears to just stick to the right
side<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.470> that<00:02:22.590> it'll<00:02:22.860> be<00:02:22.920> fine

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.360 

yeah<00:02:29.260> there's<00:02:30.260> no<00:02:30.410> differences<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.160> laps

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
yeah there's no differences in the laps

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.240 
yeah there's no differences in the laps
in<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:31.700> map<00:02:31.940> so<00:02:33.070> pretty<00:02:34.070> easy

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
in this map so pretty easy

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.750 
in this map so pretty easy
straightforward<00:02:34.970> or<00:02:35.930> how<00:02:36.080> spot<00:02:36.410> now<00:02:36.740> what<00:02:37.310> how

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
straightforward or how spot now what how

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.870 
straightforward or how spot now what how
many<00:02:38.680> numbers<00:02:39.680> I<00:02:39.950> don't<00:02:40.160> really<00:02:40.430> hope<00:02:40.580> oh

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
many numbers I don't really hope oh

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.440 
many numbers I don't really hope oh
there's<00:02:41.750> your<00:02:41.870> time<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> big<00:02:43.010> deal<00:02:43.160> just

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
there's your time on not a big deal just

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.230 
there's your time on not a big deal just
keep<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.570> the<00:02:44.690> right<00:02:44.810> of<00:02:44.990> that<00:02:45.050> tunnel<00:02:46.240> this

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
keep to the right of that tunnel this

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.290 
keep to the right of that tunnel this
was<00:02:47.590> not<00:02:48.590> hard<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.070> find<00:02:49.340> them<00:02:49.520> all<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.850> at<00:02:50.120> all

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
was not hard to find them all on at all

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.390 
was not hard to find them all on at all
like<00:02:50.630> this<00:02:50.810> was<00:02:51.110> probably<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.770> easiest<00:02:51.800> map

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
like this was probably the easiest map

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.390 
like this was probably the easiest map
to<00:02:52.580> get<00:02:52.700> them<00:02:52.850> all<00:02:53.000> yeah<00:02:53.840> there<00:02:54.710> you<00:02:54.800> go<00:02:54.890> see

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
to get them all yeah there you go see

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.520 
to get them all yeah there you go see
now<00:02:55.520> they<00:02:55.640> go<00:02:55.790> yeah<00:02:56.300> maybe<00:02:57.020> I'll<00:02:57.200> put<00:02:57.320> a<00:02:57.350> little

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
now they go yeah maybe I'll put a little

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.520 
now they go yeah maybe I'll put a little
music<00:02:57.620> flipping<00:02:58.040> right<00:02:58.160> here<00:02:58.310> no<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> want<00:02:58.940> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
music flipping right here no you want I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.920 
music flipping right here no you want I
