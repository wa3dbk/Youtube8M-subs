fib SUV so if you guys want different
ones<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.280> spawn<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:19.820> drive<00:01:20.090> away<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.600> then

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
ones to spawn just drive away and then

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.480 
ones to spawn just drive away and then
drive<00:01:20.930> back<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.470> then<00:01:21.830> different<00:01:22.159> one<00:01:22.250> should

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
drive back and then different one should

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.640 
drive back and then different one should
respond<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.270> this<00:01:23.750> is<00:01:23.900> basically<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.320> hundred

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
respond and this is basically a hundred

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.560 
respond and this is basically a hundred
percent<00:01:24.770> confirmed<00:01:25.400> spawn<00:01:25.790> location<00:01:26.330> for

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
percent confirmed spawn location for

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.149 
percent confirmed spawn location for
these<00:01:26.720> vehicles<00:01:26.990> as<00:01:27.409> long<00:01:27.650> as<00:01:27.799> it's<00:01:27.979> ten

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
