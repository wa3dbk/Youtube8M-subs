test Kindle now if you were with me on
the<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.320> segment<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.100> saw<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.909> pull

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the first segment you saw I had to pull

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.170 
the first segment you saw I had to pull
to<00:01:51.420> insert<00:01:52.020> an<00:01:52.229> image<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.799> my<00:01:53.159> map<00:01:53.430> into<00:01:54.000> that

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to insert an image of my map into that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.020 
to insert an image of my map into that
file<00:01:54.479> before<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:54.960> saved<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> so<00:01:55.729> we<00:01:56.729> need<00:01:56.909> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
file before we saved it so we need to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.010 
file before we saved it so we need to
have<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.450> same<00:01:58.079> file<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.430> folder

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
have that same file in this folder

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.389 
have that same file in this folder
having<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.350> document<00:02:01.799> isn't<00:02:02.040> enough

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
having it in the document isn't enough

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.539 
having it in the document isn't enough
so<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.689> hit<00:02:03.899> here<00:02:04.140> add<00:02:04.549> available

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
so we here we hit here add available

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.180 
so we here we hit here add available
actions<00:02:05.729> add<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.149> file<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.170> it<00:02:07.649> lets<00:02:07.829> us<00:02:07.950> look

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
actions add a file and it lets us look

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.880 
actions add a file and it lets us look
for<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
for it

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.680 
for it
so<00:02:10.890> we<00:02:11.130> go<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.370> our<00:02:11.580> folder<00:02:12.150> where<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.360> had
