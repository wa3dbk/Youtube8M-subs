like a hell of a drop down there so what
at<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.910> moment<00:00:35.150> what<00:00:35.540> I'm<00:00:35.629> doing<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:36.170> I'm

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
at the moment what I'm doing is I'm

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.979 
at the moment what I'm doing is I'm
pretending<00:00:36.800> I'm<00:00:37.309> not<00:00:37.370> nervous<00:00:37.790> about<00:00:38.480> this<00:00:38.809> at

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 
all so I think it looks better for my

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.119 
all so I think it looks better for my
profile<00:00:41.239> if<00:00:41.629> I'm<00:00:41.840> looking<00:00:41.989> cocky<00:00:42.440> I'm<00:00:42.890> not

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
profile if I'm looking cocky I'm not

nervous I am actually quite terrified of

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:47.049 
nervous I am actually quite terrified of
it<00:00:45.860> low<00:00:46.010> because<00:00:46.220> it's<00:00:46.550> quite<00:00:46.820> high<00:00:47.030> enough

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
it low because it's quite high enough
