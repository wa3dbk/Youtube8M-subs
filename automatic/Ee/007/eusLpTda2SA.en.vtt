get<00:02:29.070> our<00:02:29.160> merit<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.460> do<00:02:29.910> that<00:02:30.090> okay<00:02:30.750> now<00:02:31.050> we've

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
get our merit to do that okay now we've

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.410 
get our merit to do that okay now we've
got<00:02:31.440> Barney<00:02:32.220> Barney<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.910> bunny<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.210> believe

got Barney Barney the bunny I believe
he's<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.600> second<00:02:34.260> slowest<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:36.140> does<00:02:37.140> the

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
he's the second slowest but does the

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.680 
he's the second slowest but does the
most<00:02:37.670> yeah<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:38.730> doesn't<00:02:38.880> even<00:02:39.030> last<00:02:39.270> now<00:02:39.450> she's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
most yeah he doesn't even last now she's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
most yeah he doesn't even last now she's
quicker<00:02:39.960> than<00:02:40.260> Freddy<00:02:40.500> they're<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.860> in<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
quicker than Freddy they're not in that

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.150 
quicker than Freddy they're not in that
case<00:02:41.340> because<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.670> quicker<00:02:41.910> they<00:02:42.150> are<00:02:42.270> the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
case because the quicker they are the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.130 
case because the quicker they are the
the<00:02:44.160> well<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:45.420> accession<00:02:45.630> I'm<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> fear

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
the well the accession I'm the fear

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.650 
the well the accession I'm the fear
least<00:02:46.350> ones<00:02:46.680> they're<00:02:47.520> stronger<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.360> stronger

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
least ones they're stronger the stronger

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.540 
least ones they're stronger the stronger
the<00:02:49.110> slowly<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.070> quicker<00:02:50.280> they<00:02:50.430> are

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
the slowly are so the quicker they are

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.640 
the slowly are so the quicker they are
the<00:02:50.700> less<00:02:50.850> damage<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.570> they<00:02:51.660> go<00:02:51.810> he's<00:02:52.440> dead

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the less damage that they go he's dead

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.620 
the less damage that they go he's dead
six<00:02:52.950> hearts<00:02:53.250> there<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.610> he's<00:02:53.790> slightly

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
six hearts there so he's slightly

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.470 
six hearts there so he's slightly
quicker<00:02:54.930> than<00:02:55.230> Freddy<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.910> does<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.240> little
