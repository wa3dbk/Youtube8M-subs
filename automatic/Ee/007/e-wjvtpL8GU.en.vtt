success rate so far alright so those
were<00:01:59.729> ton<00:02:00.000> right<00:02:00.240> there<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> notice

were ton right there and you notice
there's<00:02:01.320> different<00:02:01.590> levels<00:02:01.619> on<00:02:02.070> these<00:02:02.280> so

there's different levels on these so
some<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> these<00:02:02.880> it's<00:02:03.509> actually<00:02:03.900> worth<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.440> to

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
some of these it's actually worth it to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.609 
some of these it's actually worth it to
buy<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:06.330> more<00:02:06.720> because<00:02:07.050> they<00:02:07.200> turn

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
buy for a little more because they turn

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.139 
buy for a little more because they turn
into<00:02:07.800> other<00:02:08.039> things<00:02:08.100> like<00:02:08.550> these<00:02:08.670> turn<00:02:08.910> into

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
into other things like these turn into

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
into other things like these turn into
platinum<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.720> believe<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.320> as<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.160> see

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
platinum I believe and as you can see

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.710 
platinum I believe and as you can see
there's<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.520> huge<00:02:11.850> gap<00:02:11.910> there<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.570> whole

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
there's a huge gap there of a whole

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.290 
there's a huge gap there of a whole
silver<00:02:13.200> so<00:02:13.350> I'm<00:02:13.410> going<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.560> buy<00:02:13.739> that<00:02:14.209> that's<00:02:15.209> a

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
good way to tell if it's worth it you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.460 
good way to tell if it's worth it you
can<00:02:17.310> look<00:02:17.430> at<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.640> gap<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.270> large<00:02:18.900> right<00:02:19.200> here

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
can look at the gap I large right here

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.460 
can look at the gap I large right here
there's<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.739> 12<00:02:20.640> half<00:02:20.910> silver<00:02:21.480> gap<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.380> i'm

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
there's a 12 half silver gap so i'm

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.400 
there's a 12 half silver gap so i'm
going<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:22.650> buy<00:02:22.800> for<00:02:22.860> these<00:02:24.170> basically<00:02:25.170> getting

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
going to buy for these basically getting

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.250 
going to buy for these basically getting
them<00:02:25.590> for<00:02:25.709> like<00:02:25.830> half<00:02:26.010> price<00:02:26.430> i<00:02:26.810> go<00:02:27.810> back<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
them for like half price i go back to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.140 
them for like half price i go back to
this<00:02:28.410> not<00:02:28.830> as<00:02:29.010> much<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.400> gap<00:02:29.580> there<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:30.060> i

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
this not as much of a gap there and i

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.660 
this not as much of a gap there and i
can<00:02:30.330> go<00:02:30.480> for<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.250> don't<00:02:32.430> know<00:02:32.550> what

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
can go for it if you don't know what

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.100 
can go for it if you don't know what
you're<00:02:32.820> doing<00:02:33.150> that's<00:02:33.300> that's<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.750> good<00:02:33.959> way<00:02:34.080> to

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you're doing that's that's a good way to

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.800 
you're doing that's that's a good way to
get<00:02:34.320> started<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:34.980> look<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.459> gaps<00:02:35.820> these

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
get started is look at the gaps these

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
get started is look at the gaps these
are<00:02:36.959> low<00:02:37.080> level<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:37.980> under<00:02:38.370> 70<00:02:38.910> copper<00:02:40.250> i'm

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
are low level so under 70 copper i'm

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.350 
are low level so under 70 copper i'm
going<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.550> place<00:02:41.850> 25<00:02:42.690> by<00:02:43.110> order<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:43.739> steady

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
going to place 25 by order and steady

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.270 
going to place 25 by order and steady
alright<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.690> i<00:02:45.989> think<00:02:46.110> that's<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.560> for<00:02:46.620> warren

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
alright so i think that's it for warren

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.270 
alright so i think that's it for warren
let<00:02:47.430> me<00:02:47.519> let<00:02:47.880> me<00:02:47.970> just<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.410> level<00:02:49.410> 70<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.070> 80

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
let me let me just do level 70 to 80

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.900 
let me let me just do level 70 to 80
which<00:02:50.580> is<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.760> good<00:02:50.970> chance<00:02:51.209> for<00:02:52.280> Rick<00:02:53.280> outcome

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
which is a good chance for Rick outcome

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.479 
which is a good chance for Rick outcome
or<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:54.930> it's<00:02:55.049> not<00:02:55.230> called<00:02:55.560> Warren<00:02:55.950> I'm<00:02:56.220> trying

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
or but it's not called Warren I'm trying

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.759 
or but it's not called Warren I'm trying
to<00:02:56.549> member<00:02:56.730> what<00:02:56.850> it's<00:02:56.970> called<00:02:57.500> they<00:02:58.500> look<00:02:58.650> at

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
to member what it's called they look at

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.500 
to member what it's called they look at
the<00:02:58.860> most<00:02:59.070> expensive<00:02:59.850> items<00:03:01.040> sent<00:03:02.040> its

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the most expensive items sent its

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.970 
the most expensive items sent its
sentinels<00:03:03.510> is<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.140> it<00:03:04.320> are<00:03:04.500> they<00:03:04.709> always

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
sentinels is that it are they always

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.950 
sentinels is that it are they always
heavy<00:03:05.370> now

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
heavy now

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.650 
heavy now
made<00:03:07.960> to<00:03:08.110> play<00:03:08.290> around<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.920> but<00:03:09.660> we

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
made to play around with this but we

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.930 
made to play around with this but we
look<00:03:10.840> real<00:03:11.050> quick<00:03:11.350> looking<00:03:12.340> for<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.580> heavies

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
look real quick looking for the heavies

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.820 
look real quick looking for the heavies
here's<00:03:13.270> a<00:03:13.360> heavy<00:03:14.070> this<00:03:15.070> is<00:03:15.250> 70<00:03:15.730> copper<00:03:16.830> that's

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
here's a heavy this is 70 copper that's

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.470 
here's a heavy this is 70 copper that's
a<00:03:17.950> pretty<00:03:18.130> good<00:03:18.280> deal<00:03:18.460> i'm<00:03:18.610> gonna<00:03:18.790> buy<00:03:18.940> 70

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
copper and again the nice part on what

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.310 
copper and again the nice part on what
i'm<00:03:24.700> doing<00:03:24.970> is<00:03:25.000> i'm<00:03:25.120> using<00:03:25.420> a<00:03:25.480> salvage<00:03:25.960> o<00:03:26.110> matic

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
i'm doing is i'm using a salvage o matic

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.430 
i'm doing is i'm using a salvage o matic
i<00:03:26.680> believe<00:03:27.370> it's<00:03:27.490> 800<00:03:28.030> gems<00:03:28.270> and<00:03:28.570> if<00:03:29.080> it's

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
i believe it's 800 gems and if it's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.110 
i believe it's 800 gems and if it's
better<00:03:29.830> that<00:03:30.130> even<00:03:30.820> though<00:03:30.880> it's<00:03:31.000> more

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
better that even though it's more

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.260 
better that even though it's more
expensive<00:03:31.330> than<00:03:32.160> crude<00:03:33.160> salvage<00:03:33.730> kits<00:03:34.000> it's

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
usually it's a pretty good indicator

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:07.590 
usually it's a pretty good indicator
that<00:06:03.810> it's<00:06:04.140> worth<00:06:04.650> salvaging

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.900 

I've<00:06:08.230> got<00:06:08.410> a<00:06:08.440> lot<00:06:08.680> of<00:06:08.710> the<00:06:08.920> tables<00:06:09.370> memorized

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
for what things turn into I would start

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:19.910 
for what things turn into I would start
off<00:06:12.490> with<00:06:12.670> this<00:06:12.820> method<00:06:13.060> though
