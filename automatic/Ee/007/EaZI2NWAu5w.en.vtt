00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.050
 and let stand 10 minutes will take 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.810
 at least one large package of kat kit 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.509

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.980
 dry ingredients to mix them I 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.620

 mixed we add the toilet look 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.710
 we prepare molds for cupcakes 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.630
 the recipes come out 24 for help from a 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.600
 ice cream spoon we are throwing the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.240
 half of the spoon to each mold we throw 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.920
 inside a piece of kitkat and we go back to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.920
 cover with the other half of the spoon 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.880
 and kat kit inside will be covered 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.880
 with the mixture 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.090
 we put the tray with the oven 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.830
 preheated to 180 degrees and will be 20 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.990
 minutes 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.760
 we let it cool completely before 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.040
 start decorating them 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.700
 while they cool we prepare the toilet 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.710
 nutella cream 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 we are mixing the butter of that 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.670
 it should be at room temperature 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.220
 we add the icing sugar that although it is already 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.100
 very thin I pass it through the colander 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.130
 we add the nutella 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.130
 the vanilla extract we talk about all 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.259
 Last we add 1 to 3 teaspoons of 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.270
 cream until you get the desired thickness 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.009
 ready now we go to decorate it we can 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.500
 put chocolate or 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.120
 chopped almonds in a sleeve we place 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
 the battle cream and in another with a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.140
 smaller mouthpiece 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.099
 we take nutella we start with the mater 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.330
 cream throwing a trickle on the edge 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.819
 we went through the crimes of chocolate or 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.170
 the almonds and we finished filling 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.170
 with vÃ¡ter cream 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.920
 we decorate with a trickle of nutella what 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.440
 we have ready I have placed a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.569
 piece of kitkat on one side and one 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.230
 queen flag on the other side of 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.150
 Princess 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.519
 this is the result is so 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.790
 incredibly good part of the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.330
 sponge cake is super fluffy 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.760

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.040
 let's eat almonds 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.930
 not to store them in the refrigerator 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.930
 they will keep well at room temperature 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.830
