00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.619 

which<00:06:02.590> works<00:06:02.860> pretty<00:06:03.310> nice<00:06:03.520> for<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.419> backpack

up<00:06:05.110> that<00:06:05.440> way<00:06:05.560> you<00:06:05.590> have<00:06:05.770> spacing<00:06:06.400> back<00:06:07.169> it's

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
up that way you have spacing back it's

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.809 
up that way you have spacing back it's
really<00:06:08.470> a<00:06:08.500> non-issue<00:06:08.770> here<00:06:09.280> with<00:06:09.430> this<00:06:09.550> mount

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819

really a non-issue here with this mount
at<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.300> moment<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:13.830> that's<00:06:14.830> about<00:06:15.129> it<00:06:15.190> that's

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
at the moment but that's about it that's

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.200 
at the moment but that's about it that's
all<00:06:15.759> I<00:06:15.819> can<00:06:16.000> say<00:06:16.180> on<00:06:16.210> this<00:06:17.699> the<00:06:18.699> 30<00:06:18.940> pound

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 
all I can say on this the 30 pound

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.550 
all I can say on this the 30 pound
magnet<00:06:19.659> I<00:06:19.889> suppose<00:06:20.889> a<00:06:21.150> an<00:06:22.150> antenna<00:06:22.599> magnet<00:06:23.110> for

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
magnet I suppose a an antenna magnet for

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.040 
magnet I suppose a an antenna magnet for
a<00:06:23.590> citizen<00:06:24.159> span<00:06:24.370> radio<00:06:24.759> would<00:06:25.000> work<00:06:25.210> also<00:06:25.539> and

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
a citizen span radio would work also and

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.080 
a citizen span radio would work also and
there's<00:06:26.740> some<00:06:26.919> places<00:06:27.159> cell<00:06:27.520> magnets<00:06:27.970> for

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
there's some places cell magnets for

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.879 
there's some places cell magnets for

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340 
floor what their weight rating is I

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.510 
floor what their weight rating is I
really<00:06:33.759> don't<00:06:33.940> know<00:06:34.150> but<00:06:34.900> this<00:06:35.110> seems<00:06:35.319> to<00:06:35.469> work

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
really don't know but this seems to work

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.969 
really don't know but this seems to work
very<00:06:36.520> very<00:06:36.819> nicely<00:06:37.530> well<00:06:38.530> that's<00:06:38.710> all<00:06:38.860> I<00:06:38.919> have

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
very very nicely well that's all I have

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.879
