contour now what really really drew me

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.020 
contour now what really really drew me
to<00:00:43.530> this<00:00:43.649> process<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.460> place<00:00:44.700> was

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
to this process in the first place was

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.790 
to this process in the first place was
the<00:00:45.180> fact<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.629> contour<00:00:46.110> color<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.590> more

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the fact that the contour color is more

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.650 
the fact that the contour color is more
of<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.980> cool-toned<00:00:47.250> contour<00:00:48.120> instead<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
of a cool-toned contour instead of a

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.229 
of a cool-toned contour instead of a
warm<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.590> bronzy<00:00:50.219> tone<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.940> lot<00:00:51.210> of

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
warm like bronzy tone which a lot of

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
warm like bronzy tone which a lot of
them<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> have<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.129> have<00:00:53.250> used<00:00:53.520> seems<00:00:54.420> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
them that I have and have used seems to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
them that I have and have used seems to
be<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.899> should<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.500> brought<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:55.890> but

contour<00:01:01.230> stick<00:01:01.469> i<00:01:01.590> think<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.859> what<00:01:02.010> it's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
contour stick i think is what it's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.820 
contour stick i think is what it's
called<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.229> really<00:01:04.229> it

performs really really well but the
color<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:06.990> very<00:01:07.350> warm<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.090> pigmentation

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
color is very warm but the pigmentation

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.590 
color is very warm but the pigmentation
of<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.650> stick<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:11.820> nice<00:01:12.150> it's

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
happens when you use the contour side

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.830 
happens when you use the contour side
specifically<00:02:59.340> it<00:03:00.120> might<00:03:00.270> just<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:00.570> be<00:03:00.630> as

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840

easy<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.620> tell<00:03:01.950> on<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.660> highlighter<00:03:03.660> side<00:03:03.930> but

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
easy to tell on the highlighter side but

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.040 
easy to tell on the highlighter side but
you<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.290> definitely<00:03:04.470> tell<00:03:04.710> on<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:06.050> contour

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
you can definitely tell on the contour

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.140 
you can definitely tell on the contour
site<00:03:07.200> is<00:03:07.350> when<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:08.250> it<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.460> your<00:03:08.640> face<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
on your face and you know just

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.850 
on your face and you know just
completely<00:03:27.930> hit<00:03:28.170> your<00:03:28.320> face<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.740> are

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
completely hit your face and you are

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.890 
completely hit your face and you are
good<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.370> go<00:03:29.520> it<00:03:29.760> never<00:03:30.030> has<00:03:30.270> any<00:03:30.510> kind<00:03:30.780> of

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
good to go it never has any kind of

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.530 
good to go it never has any kind of
foundation<00:03:31.830> residue<00:03:32.190> on<00:03:32.220> it<00:03:32.430> um<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.300> that's

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
foundation residue on it um so that's

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.210 
foundation residue on it um so that's
why<00:03:33.690> I<00:03:33.720> don't<00:03:34.020> love<00:03:34.230> this<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.770> because<00:03:34.980> it's

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
why I don't love this just because it's

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.980 
why I don't love this just because it's
I<00:03:35.430> don't<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.150> there's<00:03:36.390> you<00:03:36.600> can<00:03:36.840> really

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
I don't think there's you can really

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.710 
I don't think there's you can really
barely<00:03:37.260> tell<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.830> I<00:03:38.160> did<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.850> they<00:03:39.510> did<00:03:39.540> it

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
barely tell that I I did and they did it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.990 
barely tell that I I did and they did it
a<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:39.990> bit<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.430> and<00:03:41.430> I<00:03:41.550> did<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.820> actually

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
a little bit there and I did it actually

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.090 
a little bit there and I did it actually
I<00:03:42.210> went<00:03:42.390> over<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.780> twice<00:03:43.230> today<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.950> this

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
I went over it twice today for this

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.010 
I went over it twice today for this
video<00:03:44.400> so<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.670> could<00:03:44.790> really<00:03:45.150> kind<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.660> see<00:03:45.900> it

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
video so you could really kind of see it

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.540 
video so you could really kind of see it
and<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.620> just<00:03:46.800> I<00:03:47.010> don't<00:03:47.070> think<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
and I just I don't think the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.520 
and I just I don't think the
pigmentation<00:03:48.000> is<00:03:48.330> there<00:03:48.570> unfortunately<00:03:48.900> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
pigmentation is there unfortunately and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.830 
pigmentation is there unfortunately and
I<00:03:49.860> don't<00:03:50.100> think<00:03:50.280> if<00:03:50.490> I<00:03:50.580> got<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> darker<00:03:51.570> color

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
I don't think if I got a darker color

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.470 
I don't think if I got a darker color
that<00:03:52.080> it<00:03:52.170> would<00:03:52.290> really<00:03:52.440> make<00:03:52.650> any<00:03:52.800> difference

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
that it would really make any difference

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.790 
that it would really make any difference
maybe<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.660> would<00:03:54.870> but<00:03:55.110> it's<00:03:55.290> just<00:03:55.350> because

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
maybe it would but it's just because

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.230 
maybe it would but it's just because
it's<00:03:55.830> picking<00:03:56.280> up<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.520> foundation<00:03:56.940> i<00:03:57.030> think

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
it's picking up the foundation i think

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.820 
it's picking up the foundation i think
is<00:03:57.360> really<00:03:57.690> what<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.930> problem<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.470> with<00:03:58.530> this

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
is really what the problem is with this

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.630 
is really what the problem is with this
product<00:03:59.240> i'll<00:04:00.240> continue<00:04:00.570> to<00:04:00.720> use<00:04:01.020> it<00:04:01.200> until<00:04:01.350> I

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
product i'll continue to use it until I

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.340 
product i'll continue to use it until I
run<00:04:02.640> out<00:04:02.700> of<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.060> but<00:04:03.240> this<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:03.870> definitely<00:04:04.110> not

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
run out of it but this is definitely not

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.900 
run out of it but this is definitely not
something<00:04:04.710> I'm<00:04:04.920> going<00:04:05.070> to<00:04:05.220> be<00:04:05.340> purchasing

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
something I'm going to be purchasing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.180 
something I'm going to be purchasing
again<00:04:06.180> unfortunately<00:04:06.830> because<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.950> like<00:04:08.100> i

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
again unfortunately because it like i

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.370 
again unfortunately because it like i
said<00:04:08.340> it's<00:04:08.490> such<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.120> cool<00:04:09.360> concept<00:04:09.660> i<00:04:10.020> really

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
said it's such a cool concept i really

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.530 
said it's such a cool concept i really
really<00:04:10.500> like<00:04:10.830> this<00:04:10.860> idea<00:04:11.270> maybe<00:04:12.270> if<00:04:12.420> they

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
really like this idea maybe if they

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.900 
really like this idea maybe if they
reformulate<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:14.010> future<00:04:14.310> then<00:04:14.850> i

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
reformulate it in the future then i

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.340 
reformulate it in the future then i
would<00:04:15.030> definitely<00:04:15.270> consider<00:04:15.450> purchasing<00:04:16.230> it

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
would definitely consider purchasing it

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.870 
would definitely consider purchasing it
again<00:04:17.660> but<00:04:18.660> i<00:04:18.989> am<00:04:19.440> still<00:04:19.500> on<00:04:19.950> the<00:04:20.220> hunt<00:04:20.370> I<00:04:20.640> think

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
again but i am still on the hunt I think

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.630 
again but i am still on the hunt I think
for<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> really<00:04:21.720> good<00:04:21.750> cool<00:04:22.620> toned<00:04:22.950> contour

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
for a really good cool toned contour

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.250 
for a really good cool toned contour
stick<00:04:23.880> I<00:04:24.000> like<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.720> said<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:24.930> like<00:04:25.110> using

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
stick I like like I said I like using

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.779 
stick I like like I said I like using
the<00:04:25.470> contour<00:04:25.950> cream

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
the contour cream

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.309 
the contour cream
instead<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.879> a<00:04:27.940> powder<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.360> feel<00:04:28.780> for<00:04:29.199> me

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
instead of a powder I feel for me

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.050 
instead of a powder I feel for me
personally<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.979> do<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.340> better<00:04:30.520> job<00:04:30.610> at

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
personally like I do a better job at

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.400 
personally like I do a better job at
contouring<00:04:31.449> when<00:04:31.599> I<00:04:31.629> use<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> cream<00:04:32.050> versus

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
contouring when I use a cream versus

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.950 
contouring when I use a cream versus
powder<00:04:32.759> with<00:04:33.759> the<00:04:33.879> Sonia<00:04:34.150> Kashuk<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.660> think<00:04:34.870> i

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
powder with the Sonia Kashuk I think i

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.860 
powder with the Sonia Kashuk I think i
can<00:04:35.139> get<00:04:35.229> a<00:04:35.289> really<00:04:35.500> nice<00:04:35.849> chisel<00:04:36.849> but<00:04:37.750> it's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
can get a really nice chisel but it's

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.480 
can get a really nice chisel but it's
just<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.110> little<00:04:38.259> too<00:04:38.440> warm<00:04:38.650> for<00:04:38.800> what<00:04:39.310> i'm

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
just a little too warm for what i'm

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.520 
just a little too warm for what i'm
looking<00:04:39.669> for<00:04:39.879> so<00:04:40.330> I'm<00:04:41.169> thinking<00:04:41.500> about

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
looking for so I'm thinking about

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.439 
looking for so I'm thinking about
getting<00:04:41.770> those<00:04:41.979> Smashbox<00:04:42.699> ones<00:04:43.090> and

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
getting those Smashbox ones and

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.909 
getting those Smashbox ones and
everyone's<00:04:43.840> been<00:04:44.050> talking<00:04:44.199> about<00:04:44.470> since<00:04:44.770> I

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
everyone's been talking about since I

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.379 
everyone's been talking about since I
think<00:04:45.099> about<00:04:45.610> the<00:04:45.699> beginning<00:04:46.030> of<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.210> years

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 
think about the beginning of the years

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.149 
think about the beginning of the years
when<00:04:46.569> they<00:04:46.690> came<00:04:46.870> out<00:04:47.050> but<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.770> problem<00:04:48.069> I

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
when they came out but the problem I

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.890 
when they came out but the problem I
have<00:04:48.190> with<00:04:48.310> those<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:48.879> don't<00:04:48.940> really<00:04:49.599> need

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
have with those is I don't really need

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.460 
have with those is I don't really need
this<00:04:50.530> color<00:04:50.949> in<00:04:51.340> the<00:04:52.120> stick<00:04:52.449> and<00:04:52.569> I<00:04:52.930> want<00:04:53.379> to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
this color in the stick and I want to

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.960

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
say you can only buy the smashbox ones

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.659 
say you can only buy the smashbox ones
in<00:04:55.210> the<00:04:55.810> set<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.229> three<00:04:56.259> like<00:04:56.919> the<00:04:57.099> contour

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
in the set of three like the contour

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.969 
in the set of three like the contour
highlight<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.419> bronze<00:04:58.720> I<00:04:59.139> don't<00:04:59.770> know<00:04:59.830> why
