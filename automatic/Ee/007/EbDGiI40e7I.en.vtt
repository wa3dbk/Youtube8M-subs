00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hello and welcome to this news 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.110
 video of the block delivers to change of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.250
 life then as you can see I 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.660
 I am currently in the square 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.460
 red in Moscow 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 it's a little cold 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.090
 take the opportunity to talk to you about a very book 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 interesting called deep survival 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.839
 so unfortunately this book was not 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.130
 translated into french but i found this 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.930
 book so interesting I could not 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.830
 stop me from talking to you about it quickly 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.460
 in fact if a book that analyzes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.010
 people who found themselves in 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.170
 situation really of extreme danger in 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.660
 an accident typically in the mountains that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.750
 have been shipwrecked and who against all 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.760
 waiting have survived and will surrender 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.510
 analyze in a really very 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.590
 interesting 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.910
 what did they do that these 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.079
 people there have survived while 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 others who were with her at the same 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.770
 moment that they lived the max one 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.940
 accident they did not survive and 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.010
 it's very interesting because it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 come back like that in the psychology of 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.460
 survival and we learn lots of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.809
 interesting things that can we 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.399
 serve if one day we end up in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.780
 a situation like this and well beyond 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.059
 it really teaches us a lot of 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 things about human psychology then 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.210
 just a thing for example all stupid that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.230
 we learn this book so we 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.879
 speaks of an accident that takes place in 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.619
 mountain and there was something that 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.540
 will hit them when I read that is that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.770
 the author explains to us that the words 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.960
 finally anyone who climbs 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.790
 in the mountains they have a problem it's up to 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.439
 say that unlike a lot of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.750
 finally extreme sport when we arrive 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.430
 to the goal we finished in the mountains 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.710
 when we arrive at the top of the summit and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.610
 well it's not that the trip 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 is over because after you have to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.060
 redo the path in reverse 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 often he is just as perilous 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.380
 more than when we started it 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.030
 since we are more tired and above all 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.200
 who at this big problem people who 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.610
 are climbing in the mountains is that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.900
 when they got to the top they got 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.820
 this psychological impression that 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.869
 finally they succeeded while he 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.549
 their remains halfway to go 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.380
 which is just as dangerous and who 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.610
 often explain that accidents 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.479
 mountain are on the way to the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.640
 back because people do a lot 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.840
 less attention here is a very book 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 interesting that I recommend you if 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.100
 you do not read English I made one 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.930
