00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.640
 thinking of this gang who follows pirate and 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.310
 such as to say that it's a joão cara that is 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:33.970
 a movement like this presents itself 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:36.340
 landrigan fucking guy is I always had 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.220
 very great affinity with fashion so 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.050
 As with sewing with clothes I always 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.879
 Since I was a child I always had a 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.850
 very large wrapping with the tissue 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.220
 so it's always been something that always 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.839
 Moved a lot with me so I always 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.760
 I'm very moved and I do not see my 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.350
 work as a product as I clothing 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.030
 I see my work as language I 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.059
 I went to the breeder's house was my 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.979
 first process within fashion and there 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.070
 so in the first year I went to introduce 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.110
 a collection in paris soon of face thus 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.190
 I entered my second collection already. 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.340
 I had the invitation to see if it was outside and the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.689
 thing began to mesh and because when 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.210
 I came to present my 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.280
 collections in the important fashion week and 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.570
 they had several stylists 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.460
 I admired it a lot and then I went to see the 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.189
 parts of the game and when I 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.619
 I got into his clothes and he had 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.630
 made a shirt with a machine that is 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.250
 exactly what I had with the design is 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.310
 much like a piece I had 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.280
 I just did it and then I said it. 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.310
 Bitch, there's something that's okay. 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.590
 wrong in that type the guy works with the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 same material that my idea is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.509
 very similar because I have to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.119
 to demean as much my creative friend, right? 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.600
 and then both out and could see that 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.329
 if I started to reverse type use the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.460
 I was ashamed of what I did not 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:04.869
 let me believe that I could do 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.990
 as the subject of my work I could be 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.350
 use my favor what I thought 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.830
 which was what I could not let myself do 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.830
 the work 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.340
 he always says that the Brazilian man 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.520
 that man in general he does not want 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.959
 renewal is he has the limits of it and I 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.410
 I think this is a big lie 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.910
 I think that what is really missing is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.680
 a man has options 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.560
 He wants clothes that will last him. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.830
 either he has one another way of 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.620
 to consume is much more is it will not 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 power or will not ask using this is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.030
 by what I think he will use more 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 time he then the man he has a 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.930
 way to consume very nice 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.330
 pity that it's a public that's spoiled 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.250
 understood by the industry and 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.810
 stylists also because no one wants 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.530
 innovation for man is afraid to innovate 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.120
 huh 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.890
 yes and this question of thinking that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.150
 women can choose for them when they 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.519
 as well 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.010
 It is bizarre that you can not understand the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.380
 individual is a is not a guy in a has not 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.140
 How to understand then, then, because I think 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.130
 bad that she's trying to indoctrinate 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.890
 when I am with the couple begins 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.930
 draw and she starts giving the tips and 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.650
 I get pulled and llamas and what do you think? 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.350
 of this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.720
 that what you think says it has been 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.120
 Who really likes it when the guy feels it. 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.100
 stay a little, my will, he knows 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.910
 all he wants and is not what he is 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.950
 talking and the history of gold is a 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.870
 history in Brazil, nobody yet 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.880
 had done two years ago 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.380
 the mário viana or calls with this 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.930
 telling him that he believed that 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.470
 this was going to be a trend that people 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:52.079
 be uniform in the future in which the 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.990
 people will find a suit that would give 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.550
 an organized and 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.740
 and then we started looking for the 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.460
 search on first clothing 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.770
 war factory worker clothing and it is 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.630
 several cool brands that started 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.540
 work on this issue of uniforms and 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:10.430
 he was mine this is the way and defect 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.370
 now all brands 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.170
 Then tell me about the past seasons. 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.600
 has been fully focused on 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.830
 he said that it would only be incompatible 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:24.860
 spoke in another is from the front of the mirror is 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.930
 true right then I think to follow 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.820
 trends follow brands 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.270
 I think it's all very fanciful. 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.740
 because it is each one to follow the reasoning of the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 another is very fanciful 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.360
 as much as I make collections trying to 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:40.130
 persuading people that this is the 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.210
 way I think the way is very 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.520
 private 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.810
 the clothes will not define you how are you 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.810
 Who's going to set the clothes?
