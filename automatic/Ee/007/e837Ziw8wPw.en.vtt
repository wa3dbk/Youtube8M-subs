I'm<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.110> go<00:02:10.229> under<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.860> loop<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.540> I'm

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
I'm going to go under that loop and I'm

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.730 
I'm going to go under that loop and I'm
going<00:02:12.750> to<00:02:12.780> yarn<00:02:13.140> over

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
going to yarn over

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.940 
going to yarn over
draw<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.490> loop<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.600> then<00:02:16.110> draw<00:02:16.530> that

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
draw that loop out and then draw that

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980 
draw that loop out and then draw that
through<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.640> loop<00:02:17.850> that's<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.510> hook<00:02:18.720> so

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
through the loop that's on my hook so

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
through the loop that's on my hook so
that's<00:02:19.200> joining<00:02:19.770> what<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> single<00:02:20.400> crochet<00:02:20.850> I

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that's joining what the single crochet I

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.870 
that's joining what the single crochet I
mean<00:02:21.690> joining<00:02:22.050> with<00:02:22.140> a<00:02:22.200> slip<00:02:22.500> stitch<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.980> could

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
mean joining with a slip stitch I could

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.510 
mean joining with a slip stitch I could
have<00:02:24.480> also<00:02:24.750> done<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.440> this<00:02:25.710> sometimes<00:02:26.400> I

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
have also done it like this sometimes I

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.640 
have also done it like this sometimes I
do<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.730> like<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.060> I<00:02:27.330> could<00:02:28.020> have<00:02:28.110> put<00:02:28.260> my<00:02:28.380> hook

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
do it like this I could have put my hook

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.640 
do it like this I could have put my hook
in<00:02:28.890> first<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:30.540> i'm<00:02:30.660> only<00:02:30.840> using<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.350> front

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
in first and i'm only using the front

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
in first and i'm only using the front
loop<00:02:31.800> i'm<00:02:32.040> leaving<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.430> back<00:02:32.580> loop<00:02:32.820> alone<00:02:33.120> and

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
loop i'm leaving the back loop alone and

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.920 
loop i'm leaving the back loop alone and
then<00:02:34.230> i<00:02:34.260> could<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.770> picked<00:02:35.160> up<00:02:35.490> my<00:02:36.300> slip<00:02:36.660> nutt

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
then i could have picked up my slip nutt

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.710 
then i could have picked up my slip nutt
i<00:02:37.490> could<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.610> brought<00:02:38.820> that<00:02:38.880> through<00:02:39.480> like

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
i could have brought that through like

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.350 
i could have brought that through like
this<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.380> chained<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.820> that's<00:02:42.030> also

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
this and chained one and that's also

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.680 
this and chained one and that's also
join<00:02:42.930> with<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> slip<00:02:43.260> stitch<00:02:43.670> so<00:02:44.670> anyway<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
join with a slip stitch so anyway to

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.690 
join with a slip stitch so anyway to
make<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:46.170> little<00:02:46.470> loop<00:02:46.680> round<00:02:47.100> right<00:02:47.460> here

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
make the little loop round right here

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.410 
make the little loop round right here
you<00:02:47.850> can<00:02:48.000> see<00:02:48.300> this<00:02:48.630> they're<00:02:49.200> just<00:02:50.060> loops<00:02:51.060> that

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
you can see this they're just loops that

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.570 
you can see this they're just loops that
have<00:02:51.630> been<00:02:51.780> worked<00:02:52.020> into<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.590> front<00:02:53.010> loops<00:02:53.250> of

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
have been worked into the front loops of

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.420 
have been worked into the front loops of
the<00:02:53.730> double<00:02:54.030> crochet<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.320> I'm<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.770> to<00:02:55.800> chain

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
the double crochet so I'm going to chain

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.790 
the double crochet so I'm going to chain
two<00:02:56.880> because<00:02:57.570> my<00:02:57.720> chain<00:02:58.020> 1<00:02:58.260> i'm<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.680> let

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
two because my chain 1 i'm going to let

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.050 
two because my chain 1 i'm going to let
that<00:02:58.860> count<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.610> 1<00:03:01.070> chain<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.550> chain<00:03:02.790> 3

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
that count is 1 chain of the chain 3

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.330 
that count is 1 chain of the chain 3
loop<00:03:03.240> so<00:03:04.020> i've<00:03:04.410> joined<00:03:04.710> with<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> slip<00:03:05.310> stitch

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
loop so i've joined with a slip stitch

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.850 
loop so i've joined with a slip stitch
then<00:03:05.880> i<00:03:05.970> have<00:03:06.150> chain<00:03:06.420> 3<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.050> then<00:03:07.680> i'm<00:03:07.830> just

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
then i have chain 3 and then i'm just

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.040 
then i have chain 3 and then i'm just
going<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> slip<00:03:08.700> stitch<00:03:08.760> in<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> front<00:03:09.780> loop

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
going to slip stitch in the front loop

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.300 
going to slip stitch in the front loop
of<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.890> double<00:03:11.160> crochet<00:03:11.190> like<00:03:11.850> this<00:03:12.300> and

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
of the next double crochet like this and

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.050 
of the next double crochet like this and
then<00:03:14.310> I'm<00:03:14.430> going<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.640> chain<00:03:14.910> 3<00:03:15.270> again<00:03:15.300> and<00:03:17.060> then

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
then I'm going to chain 3 again and then

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.030 
then I'm going to chain 3 again and then
I'm<00:03:18.210> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.510> go<00:03:18.720> into<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.200> next<00:03:19.500> double

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I'm going to go into the next double

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.100 
I'm going to go into the next double
crochet<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.910> loop<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> double<00:03:21.690> crochet

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
crochet the loop of the double crochet

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.550 
crochet the loop of the double crochet
so<00:03:22.950> see<00:03:23.310> right<00:03:23.550> there<00:03:23.790> i<00:03:23.820> have<00:03:23.910> two<00:03:24.270> loops<00:03:24.570> so

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
so see right there i have two loops so

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.480 
so see right there i have two loops so
that<00:03:25.740> i'm<00:03:25.860> going<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.040> chain<00:03:26.310> 3<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:28.040> then<00:03:29.040> i'm

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
that i'm going to chain 3 and then i'm

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.180 
that i'm going to chain 3 and then i'm
going<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:29.820> skip<00:03:30.180> over<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:31.020> group<00:03:31.590> of<00:03:31.830> three

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
going to skip over this group of three

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.240 
going to skip over this group of three
and<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.750> might<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.200> push<00:03:34.440> this<00:03:34.740> group<00:03:35.100> of

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
and you might have to push this group of

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.190 
and you might have to push this group of
three<00:03:35.490> back<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.730> little<00:03:36.060> bit<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.630> expose<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
three back a little bit to expose the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.110 
three back a little bit to expose the
three<00:03:37.710> doubles<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.280> are<00:03:38.400> right<00:03:38.550> here<00:03:38.910> and

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
three doubles that are right here and

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.480 
three doubles that are right here and
then<00:03:39.960> you<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.290> go<00:03:40.530> in<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.770> front<00:03:41.010> loop<00:03:41.250> right

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
then you just go in the front loop right

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.310 
then you just go in the front loop right
here<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:43.260> that<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:44.310> then<00:03:45.240> you<00:03:45.390> chain<00:03:45.750> three

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
here like that and then you chain three

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.190 
here like that and then you chain three
so<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.190> all<00:03:47.400> about<00:03:47.430> chain<00:03:48.420> 3<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.810> slip

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
so it's all about chain 3 and slip

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.390 
so it's all about chain 3 and slip
stitch<00:03:50.210> then<00:03:51.210> you<00:03:51.480> slip<00:03:51.810> stitch<00:03:52.140> their<00:03:52.530> chain

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
stitch then you slip stitch their chain

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.710 
stitch then you slip stitch their chain
3<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:55.490> if<00:03:56.490> you<00:03:56.670> wanted<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.300> be<00:03:57.450> more

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
3 and if you wanted it to be more

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.260 
3 and if you wanted it to be more
roughly<00:03:58.230> you<00:03:58.530> could<00:03:58.740> always<00:03:58.890> do<00:03:59.340> two<00:03:59.790> loops<00:04:00.090> in

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
roughly you could always do two loops in

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.860 
roughly you could always do two loops in
each<00:04:00.390> one<00:04:01.430> or<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.670> could<00:04:02.850> chain<00:04:03.090> four<00:04:03.450> or<00:04:03.600> five

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
each one or you could chain four or five

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.530 
each one or you could chain four or five
to<00:04:04.710> have<00:04:04.860> longer<00:04:05.130> loops<00:04:05.520> okay<00:04:06.240> i'm<00:04:06.360> going<00:04:06.480> to

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
to have longer loops okay i'm going to

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.040 
to have longer loops okay i'm going to
pass<00:04:06.990> over<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:08.570> i'm<00:04:09.570> going<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.810> push

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
pass over this and i'm going to push

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.840 
in with my where I join with a slip
stitch<00:06:01.350> so<00:06:02.310> that's<00:06:02.820> how<00:06:03.330> you<00:06:03.390> add<00:06:04.260> a<00:06:04.320> ruffle<00:06:05.220> to

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
stitch so that's how you add a ruffle to

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.909 
stitch so that's how you add a ruffle to
a<00:06:05.880> granny<00:06:06.240> square<00:06:06.390> or<00:06:07.020> it<00:06:07.169> might<00:06:07.320> be<00:06:07.560> something

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
else but that's the basic idea on how

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.450
