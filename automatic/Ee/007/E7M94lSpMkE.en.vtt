00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.389
 good afternoon today another series 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.959
 will come to mind she is dedicated to the beginning of a special 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.110
 programs 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:20.270
 pure movement that tells about 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.250
 how to restore characteristics 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.240
 car after a long or 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.240
 illiterate who 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.610
 the device we use today 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.750
 called the coupe sea jet kling from 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.489
 plus it is a very simple device 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.550
 Volkswagen's permission for it is available from 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.219
 he has a pump he has a pressure gauge 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.109
 it has a pressure release button and from 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.679
 hoses that are not afraid of aggressive 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:50.989
 liquids 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:53.800
 tool kit today will be required 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.120
 minimum two screwdrivers per maintenance 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.339
 be sure to clean that everything went 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.289
 really clean and cleaning himself 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.040
 grow up 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.960
 cleaning solution called gasoline 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.210
 Intensive Reiniger 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.299
 for engine up to 2 liters 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.770
 just need about a liter and a set 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:17.780
 adapters for connecting to the system 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.280
 before we start work we need 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.400
 warm up first love 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:25.180
 where to drop the possible pressure 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.450
 gas tank for this turn away my mouth and 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.610
 we let out respectively to the guy 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.390
 for clarity 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.390
 as a teach 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.320
 take time 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.720
 naturally about 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.840
 to assess temperate 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.400
 we would you we use to paint 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.230
 here now the thermometer shows exactly 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.700
 degrees that is love completely 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.869
 warmed we can begin 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.399
 it is necessary to determine where we will be 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.390
 supply cleaning solution 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.530
 here's the fuel rail that's it 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.159
 nozzle 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.280
 this return valve is always return 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.840
 from the valve so here it is the return we its 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.599
 we will not connect it just 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:14.620
 plugs but on this fitting we will 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.819
 apply pressure to the instrument second 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.819
 step it competently 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.280
 for this i take out 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.660
 the keeper 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.660
 right on the running 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.870
 at 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.960
 so the installation is connected here feed 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.930
 the return line is muffled and also reliable 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.860
 all fuel lines coming from 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.910
 gas tank and so time to complete the installation 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.490
 for this we take out 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:06.540
 asos take the liquid and pour it inside 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.100
 installation as I said enough 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.030
 liters but better if it is a little bit 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.210
 more to 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.240
 installation lacked air that air 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:21.390
 not strength 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.390
 then hook the pump 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.440
 and start pumping up the pressure 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.570
 we take you into place and start pumping 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.060
 pressure what pressure is it 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.220
 individually for each car but 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.620
 for most modern enough 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.330
 two atmospheres means the first stage 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.270
 flushing engine idle 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.520
 the course of 15 minutes should pass at 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.910
 the minimum possible for this engine 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.910
 strangled 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.210
 we pumped pressure run take care 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.819
 3 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.530
 Is the atmosphere our task to hold 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.180
 flushing at the lowest possible 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.349
 pressure so I relieve pressure 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.349
 while the engine is running less 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:35.349
 east 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.820
 here began the first outages 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:48.680
 engine at this pressure about 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.570
 the atmosphere will be flushing and from 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.570
 of this moment we mark and 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.470
 15 minutes 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.530
 so the device showed on hot 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.530
 engine 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.350
 himself shown 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.969
 that is, on reduced 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.180
 more and more example 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.560
 25 percent 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.560
 we need for the usual pro we 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.970
 engine temperature both was and 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.980
 90 degrees left that is ours 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.980
 measurements are quite legitimate 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:36.410
 so the engine worked for 15 minutes 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.350
 mixes and we choked it for 10 minutes for 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.740
 wetting of pollution obtained on 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:44.810
 quality Russian gasoline and so 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.460
 final washing stage washing on 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.940
 increased pressure at elevated 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.800
 revolutions now raise pressure and 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.270
 we will gas out the engine 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.040
 for 15 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.040
 this procedure will end 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.350
 so we finished the procedure gone 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:14.930
 about 50 minutes we will start the car 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:14.930
 on gasoline and check how everything works 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:37.210
 so we finished all the procedures were burning 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.220
 car back to gasoline 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:41.050
 checked the injection time she turned on 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:44.620
 ten percent less 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:46.870
 what it was before so the car will 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.729
 reap 10 percent 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.129
 please buy nice 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.699
 metals will not go better than rode 

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.699
 kind 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:56.699
 thanks for
