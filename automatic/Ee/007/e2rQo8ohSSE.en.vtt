00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
the big difference comes when you go to

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.530 
the big difference comes when you go to
level<00:01:44.810> three<00:01:45.230> and<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.880> talks<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.330> lot<00:01:47.480> about

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
level three and it talks a lot about

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.560

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
because they're going to be running

00:01:51.440 --> 00:02:05.950 
because they're going to be running
around<00:01:51.620> with<00:01:52.010> this<00:01:52.280> toy<00:02:02.110> and<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:05.420> actually<00:02:05.600> did

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
around with this toy and we actually did

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.020 
around with this toy and we actually did
take<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.380> outside<00:02:06.650> for<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.430> little<00:02:07.700> bit<00:02:07.820> and

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
take this outside for a little bit and

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.940 
take this outside for a little bit and
we<00:02:08.119> left<00:02:08.450> it<00:02:08.600> out<00:02:08.720> there<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.560> can<00:02:09.679> see<00:02:09.830> how

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
we left it out there and you can see how

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.390 
we left it out there and you can see how
the<00:02:10.010> stickers<00:02:10.550> gotten<00:02:10.880> crinkled<00:02:11.360> from<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.750> do

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
and mode 3 it kind of is like you're

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:37.360 
and mode 3 it kind of is like you're
turning<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.190> mower<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.180> love<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:36.370> so
