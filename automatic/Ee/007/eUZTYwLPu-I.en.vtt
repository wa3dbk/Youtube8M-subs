00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.960 
if I'm three months away I will mark
everything<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.569> need<00:03:57.870> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:58.970> during

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
everything that I need to do during

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.119 
everything that I need to do during
those<00:04:00.209> time<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.780> i'll<00:04:00.989> check<00:04:01.019> it<00:04:01.440> off<00:04:01.560> as<00:04:01.769> i<00:04:01.949> go

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
those time and i'll check it off as i go

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.369 
those time and i'll check it off as i go
so<00:04:02.699> this<00:04:02.909> helps<00:04:03.090> me<00:04:03.299> not<00:04:03.540> to<00:04:03.720> overlook<00:04:04.109> any

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379
