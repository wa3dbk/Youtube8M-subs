00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
think he really had a very clear idea of

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.790 
think he really had a very clear idea of
what<00:03:37.790> he<00:03:37.850> wanted<00:03:38.000> you<00:03:38.810> know<00:03:38.930> in<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.440> certain<00:03:39.650> way

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
what he wanted you know in a certain way

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.490 
what he wanted you know in a certain way
and<00:03:40.130> so<00:03:40.610> they<00:03:40.760> already<00:03:41.000> touring<00:03:41.959> all<00:03:42.110> over<00:03:42.140> the

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
and so they already touring all over the

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.650 
and so they already touring all over the
world<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.190> they<00:03:43.340> seen<00:03:43.580> a<00:03:43.610> lot<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:43.910> things<00:03:44.300> best

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
world so they seen a lot of things best

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.390 
world so they seen a lot of things best
practices<00:03:45.260> stuff<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.800> they<00:03:45.920> wanted<00:03:46.370> that

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
practices stuff that they wanted that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.180 
practices stuff that they wanted that
they<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:47.720> were<00:03:48.020> like<00:03:48.230> ah<00:03:48.380> that<00:03:48.530> sucks<00:03:48.980> or

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
they really were like ah that sucks or

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.790 
they really were like ah that sucks or
whatever<00:03:49.459> and<00:03:49.730> so<00:03:50.390> I<00:03:50.420> think<00:03:51.230> that<00:03:51.410> when<00:03:51.680> they

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
whatever and so I think that when they

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.320 
whatever and so I think that when they
designed<00:03:52.040> a<00:03:52.250> place<00:03:52.459> that<00:03:52.640> really<00:03:52.730> had<00:03:53.060> all<00:03:53.270> of

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
designed a place that really had all of

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.259 
designed a place that really had all of
that<00:03:53.720> really<00:03:53.989> really<00:03:54.470> in<00:03:54.590> mind<00:03:54.830> and<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:56.120> know

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
that really really in mind and you know

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.050 
that really really in mind and you know
from<00:03:57.019> my<00:03:57.200> own<00:03:57.230> experience<00:03:57.470> yeah<00:03:58.100> as<00:03:58.370> well<00:03:58.700> you
