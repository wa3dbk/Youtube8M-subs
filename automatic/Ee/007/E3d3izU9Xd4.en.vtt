00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.250
 I think that 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.800
 it's still a blow 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.950
 for 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.950
 we lost already in place for this reason 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.679
 we put ourselves in a catastrophic situation after the match of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.589
 Mexico 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.309
 for other reasons 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.309
 and there now permanently a teammate 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.079
 I hurt myself and he too 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.519
 what I mean 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.999
 we are men 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:28.460
 something happened in the locker room 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.779
 it seems that's what's good and bad 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.199
 from what I've seen what has been better in the press this is a 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 sound processing 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.530
 I will not go into details 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.830
 it acts 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.830
 so it's not exactly for those words 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.909
 I stayed with nico 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:49.230
 during a workout 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.440
 d 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.830
 that hurts me 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.160
 to leave us because he m they love the France team 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.350
 despite what will be done 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.480
 from right to left 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.490
 it must be that it was he who took time in Iran 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.680
 so if we're here it's thanks to him too 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.689
 and I am I am really touching my hair 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.090
 I really have 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.580
 I wonder how this newspaper could 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.540
 published these words because I 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.540
 we announced this morning but I had not read they are really miller 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.870
 kids stop 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.600
 I think of 1 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.920
 a child walking past a kiosk 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.620
 and who drinks his tests and his insults 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.640
 I mean there the newspaper must be happy anyway because he did 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.860
 a rollover that even someone who is not looking 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.760
 who is interested in football 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.140
 he walks past 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.140
 denounce those insults of irina shayk the newspaper anyway 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.960
 me it makes me I'm really touched I'm really touched 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.570
 because 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.330
 after the draw of Mexico 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.810
 I was not expecting this result at all 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.110
 we were already important 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 in a big problem 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.980
 and here we add to it, I really feel this way 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.350
 we forget to talk football every time we are in 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 I am in France team 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.160
 we always talk about 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.760
 it is such an opinion 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.720
 and I tell you the problem it's not anelka two points of the team's 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.810
 France is not anelka 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.730
 it is the traitor who is among us 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.449
 what to say 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.359
 how did this thing come out 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.579
 in the press 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:14.879
 what I had us players and staff 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.329
 this is the question that must be asked if it is this traitor that must be 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.519
 eliminate 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.519
 scrap the problem of the team of France 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:23.859
 you have an idea a game idea 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.719
 I live in this business 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.719
 Yes of course 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.379
 but I'm not in danger but not until I find the words and 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:33.009
 ill 

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:36.599
 the words were said the words were said about the place of the bridges 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.499
 years in insults in any country colonization already there is 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:43.439
 a few small dots but it does not say it's like that 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.509
 I do not say it does its job 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.099
 these lands are job insults like that in the newspapers 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.390
 no but I wonder why not the strongest team and his lot of 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.209
 annoyances like that in a journal my feeling is that from the beginning 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.169
 of the competition 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.139
 the president of the gap of everything that happens without this team of France 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.499
 which makes sense the press 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:02.809
 researchers and the hands of the state since it was the slat that is 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.269
 the case in the midfield happens but not over east in addition to 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.050
 guide her 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.149
 she says what's going on in the locker room at half-time 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.729
 she wanted to defend the job is in full in anyway not so 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:14.550
 it is he who goes beyond this problem 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.710
 I personally consider the press was small in all categories 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.859
 of the competition 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.659
 a logic that is knowing what is happening clearly this team 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.389
 is able to reverse the pressure and this for the purpose when you want 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:26.259
 I agree 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.489
 there is no problem he said we are catastrophic we are impostors 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:30.389
 All that you want 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.379
 but that the press wrote that words like that before 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.650
 we are more in European football and the ugly khaki a clash between the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.620
 sex of their well played djokovic who has class and feet but he was misleading 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 what sobs
