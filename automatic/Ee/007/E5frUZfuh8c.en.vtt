 green reflections is almost a band with gods 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.550
 brown reflections because these 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.070

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.380
 brushes 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.200
 I chose the three brushes that I think 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:44.020
 the three can be useful to all 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.120
 master the master brushes as far as 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.130
 it's about the eyes and I took 2 39 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.290
 that the one with which I apply seems to be the 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.330
 color on the eyelid then taken 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.459
 the 2 19 that the pen brush that 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.959
 need for the areas where we want to go 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.540
 more precise then maybe the corner 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.540
 outside or lower lashes and then 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.430
 I got the 2 24 which is great either 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.860

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.510
