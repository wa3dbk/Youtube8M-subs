00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:08.330
 Halli hello and welcome to 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.500
 a new skin preview of ecclesia 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.980
 In this video we look at the new one 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.800
 skip agreed arms and the tortured 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 Weapons are there with the halt 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.520
 an edding story about the battle 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.380
 Lionstone will get us such a weapon 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.420
 you just need in weapons ticket 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.460
 and you should have a black lion 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
 You can contact weapons specialists 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.960
 choose them yourself if you 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.570
 because the weapons look at you 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.969
 I want to show your character here 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.090
 actually only the skins like them then 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.770
 also look so the models or the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 Weapons themselves could be said without 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.030
 my character 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.210
 They actually look very nice 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.739
 stop only so violet steely color before 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 very much with energy and lines 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:58.410
 you could say if you influence 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.500
 Look at lines and talk about energy 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.930
 Find threads or light violet energy 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.450
 how to see it as you see it 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.979
 actually cool and needs her 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.740
 not necessarily an arms ticket 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.299
 but of course you can do this too 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.689
 then probably in the neck post for 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.549
 Buy many hundreds of gold 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.200
 it will cost you over the moment 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.840
 because of this living history 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 Only one gun ticket later will you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.220
 probably shoot up again 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:29.869
 The normal weapons ticket price of 5000 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.820
 tickets per so only two small warning 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.220
 yes the designs are very interesting 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.380
 more often they either stop 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.930
 plants and flowers still somehow 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.640
 for example, like this mace 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.270
 or you really have these lines 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.610
 also obviously looking forward to it 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.909
 the pistols rifles and had 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.950
 slingshot designs and died there 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.740
 actually you have too 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.590
 rather with such energy core designs as well 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 lines like stop at the focus completely normal 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.369
 viewed or even on the shiver that now 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.020
 actually land 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.640
 and would have a similar design 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.840
 actually the sign of the same 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.239
 only the victory will come 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.069
 not different from the interesting ones 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.440
 Shield it again from the front and 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.099
 actually looks from behind and the 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.280
 vaulting outwards for the front 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.989
 actually rather low then you have 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.970
 here also the short bow itself 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.549
 already more different from 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.989
 longbow this time what actually nice 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:36.670
 is and yes from the bar I already have 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.379
 spoken of the sword becomes children 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.830
 again, look great again too big 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:43.510
 so know the usual but where we 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.090
 are already there and so slowly 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.030
 click through what do you think of this 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.549
 skins would have your interest in mind who that 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.799
 again what of you for us because we 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.049
 we have with the martinstag skins 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.700
 pass kings had discussed but you 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.010
 again like your opinion too 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.720
 let those skins because I read the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.549
 like I will gladly of you 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.319
 a little bit the torch to inspire 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.500
 example, they are very pretty with 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.670
 this bright purple purple 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.870
 flame so my favorit of hire 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.630
 everyone you can today too 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.430
 so call favorites 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.870
 The cliq is supposed to be nice, but now 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.579
 not so great i'm really the one 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.700
 torch is pretty much the best and 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.920
 So the wholesale sword the designs this 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.730
 the coolest out being the city butt 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.730
 also has something with his staircase- like 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.250
 or step like design template if 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 one say and this reference to the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.150
 plant at least I think that later 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.069
 is pretty much the worst 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.750
 I rather looks nice but he watches 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.000
 Unfortunately, explain 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.040
 I mean as compared to the character 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.109
 himself does not help him now either 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.169
 great continues but the thing sees 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:57.549
 but quite short and small against it 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:59.590
 then the trident are huge off so 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.870
 that it's always interesting 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.919
 to be able to compare 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.560
 my problem is that the game 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:07.510
 probably just too short 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.590
 but it starts well when we are now 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.239
 at the end the whole price 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.730
 Compare as I said standard prices 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.160
 in wassen ticket form while for the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.630
 Most skins are five tickets for the 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.540
 current skins are actually 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.940
 always a gun ticket and then 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.850
 you have still a few exceptions such as eg 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.520
 Display weapons cost only three instead 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.110
 five and seven office costs 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.880
 five so much more expensive 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.620
 well I hope you have the video 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.000
 like your opinion please 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 asked again write to them 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840
 comments I read that again and again 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.180
 like and I wish you otherwise 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.280
 a pleasant week with 2 and knew 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.930
 Good luck with the luton and maybe at 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.070
 an arms ticket as an interest in it 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.070
 has until then 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:14.089
 No
