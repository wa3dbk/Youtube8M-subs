detective all go get her legacy and so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.510 
detective all go get her legacy and so
we<00:01:41.640> thought<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:41.960> their<00:01:42.979> moon<00:01:43.979> acting<00:01:44.280> was

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
we thought that their moon acting was

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.490 
we thought that their moon acting was
really<00:01:44.549> good<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.509> figured<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.470> would

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
really good so we figured that we would

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
really good so we figured that we would
take<00:01:46.799> renekton<00:01:47.640> away<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.659> figured<00:01:48.930> they

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
take renekton away and we figured they

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
take renekton away and we figured they
were<00:01:49.200> uncomfortable<00:01:49.770> with<00:01:49.829> Shen<00:01:50.220> so<00:01:50.759> we

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
were uncomfortable with Shen so we

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.719 
were uncomfortable with Shen so we
prepared<00:01:51.450> for<00:01:51.750> their<00:01:52.049> banish<00:01:52.439> n<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.490> said

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
