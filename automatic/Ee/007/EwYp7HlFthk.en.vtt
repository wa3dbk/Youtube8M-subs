do a double spring jump I think I'm
about<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.100> do

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
about to do

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.300 
about to do
you<00:02:08.360> almost<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.380> spring<00:02:10.709> joke<00:02:10.890> cap<00:02:11.130> just

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
you almost do a spring joke cap just

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.309 
you almost do a spring joke cap just
catch<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> sled<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.600> do<00:02:12.750> another<00:02:12.780> one

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
catch the sled and then do another one

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
catch the sled and then do another one
and<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.400> buddies<00:02:14.580> falling<00:02:14.970> up

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and then have your buddies falling up

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850 
and then have your buddies falling up
there<00:02:15.270> and<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.230> want<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.440> move<00:02:16.530> back<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
there and then you want to move back a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.140 
there and then you want to move back a
little<00:02:17.040> bit<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.550> don't<00:02:17.700> hit<00:02:17.819> your<00:02:17.940> head

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
little bit so you don't hit your head

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.730 
little bit so you don't hit your head
and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.690> just<00:02:18.840> double<00:02:19.020> jump<00:02:19.380> up<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.650> next

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
and then just double jump up to the next

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.490 
and then just double jump up to the next
part<00:02:20.190> this<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.209> where<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.690> gets<00:02:21.840> kind<00:02:22.290> of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
part this is where it gets kind of

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.640 
part this is where it gets kind of
tricky<00:02:22.770> because<00:02:23.580> you<00:02:23.970> need<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> do<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.650> head

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
tricky because you need to do a head

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.770 
tricky because you need to do a head
jump<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.280> got<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:26.489> go<00:02:26.580> way<00:02:27.150> on<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.630> edge

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
jump but you got to go way on the edge

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.470 
jump but you got to go way on the edge
and<00:02:28.170> sometimes<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:29.010> fall<00:02:29.220> down<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.760> I<00:02:29.790> suggest

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
and sometimes you fall down so I suggest

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.790 
and sometimes you fall down so I suggest
being<00:02:30.660> very<00:02:31.050> careful<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.770> this<00:02:32.010> part<00:02:32.750> so<00:02:33.800> yeah

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
being very careful on this part so yeah

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.290 
being very careful on this part so yeah
just<00:02:34.980> double<00:02:35.310> jump<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.640> buddy<00:02:35.819> up<00:02:36.000> make<00:02:36.270> sure

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
just double jump your buddy up make sure

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.660 
just double jump your buddy up make sure
he's<00:02:36.690> running<00:02:37.200> forwards<00:02:37.709> after<00:02:38.130> he<00:02:38.280> gets<00:02:38.459> that

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
he's running forwards after he gets that

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.509 
he's running forwards after he gets that
second<00:02:39.150> jump<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.830> yeah<00:02:40.830> he's<00:02:41.040> gonna<00:02:41.220> get<00:02:41.400> on

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
second jump and yeah he's gonna get on

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.759 
second jump and yeah he's gonna get on
top<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.019> you're<00:02:43.019> gonna<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.410> kill<00:02:43.620> yourself

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
top and you're gonna go kill yourself

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.580 
top and you're gonna go kill yourself
and<00:02:44.250> spawn<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:44.940> there<00:02:45.209> yeah<00:02:46.019> there's<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.350> little

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
and spawn up there yeah there's a little

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.979 
and spawn up there yeah there's a little
surprise<00:02:46.709> later<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.640> video

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989
