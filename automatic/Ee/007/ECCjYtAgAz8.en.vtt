did<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.450> off<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> pretty<00:00:40.050> slow<00:00:40.469> start<00:00:40.890> but

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
did get off to a pretty slow start but

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.040 
did get off to a pretty slow start but
they<00:00:41.250> did<00:00:41.430> turn<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> around<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.300> lately<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
they did turn it around here lately I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.479 
they did turn it around here lately I
think<00:00:43.410> they're<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.649> a<00:00:43.680> five-game<00:00:44.070> winning

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
think they're on a five-game winning

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.639 
think they're on a five-game winning
streak<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.500> just

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
streak which is good I think they just

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.860 
streak which is good I think they just
need<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.100> Kessler<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.670> burrows<00:00:48.180> into<00:00:48.600> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
need to get Kessler and burrows into it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.510 
need to get Kessler and burrows into it
more<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> they'll<00:00:49.980> turn<00:00:50.190> their<00:00:50.219> season

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
more and they'll turn their season

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.150 
more and they'll turn their season
around<00:00:50.730> real<00:00:51.059> quick<00:00:51.379> megavideo<00:00:52.379> watching

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
around real quick megavideo watching

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.279 
around real quick megavideo watching
asked<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.120> think<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> jackets<00:00:55.020> will<00:00:55.140> make

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
asked do you think the jackets will make

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.170 
asked do you think the jackets will make
any<00:00:55.469> big<00:00:55.680> trades<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> trade<00:00:56.579> deadline<00:00:56.610> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
any big trades at the trade deadline I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.970 
any big trades at the trade deadline I
think<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.809> depends<00:00:58.230> on<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:58.500> they<00:00:58.649> finish

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
think it just depends on how they finish

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.099 
think it just depends on how they finish
up<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.309> season<00:00:59.340> they<00:01:00.180> did<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.600> points<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
up the season they did get points in

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
up the season they did get points in
five<00:01:01.320> straight<00:01:01.559> games<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.489> but

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
five straight games which is good but

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149 
five straight games which is good but
they'll<00:01:03.840> definitely<00:01:04.049> need<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.530> keep<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.920> up

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
they'll definitely need to keep that up

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
they'll definitely need to keep that up
if<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.760> don't<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> have<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.540> make<00:01:06.659> any

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
if they don't want to have to make any

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.929 
if they don't want to have to make any

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
Mac see more one he said do you think

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.280 
Mac see more one he said do you think
that<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> jacket<00:01:12.330> should<00:01:12.510> trade<00:01:12.840> Rick<00:01:13.049> Nash

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
that the jacket should trade Rick Nash

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.690 
that the jacket should trade Rick Nash
and<00:01:13.590> what<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.040> about<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.430> Kings

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and what do you think about the Kings

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
and what do you think about the Kings
and<00:01:15.000> do<00:01:15.450> you<00:01:15.509> think<00:01:15.750> they'll<00:01:15.900> make<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
and do you think they'll make the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
and do you think they'll make the
playoffs<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.430> lie<00:01:17.549> when<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
playoffs not going to lie when the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.820 
playoffs not going to lie when the
jackets<00:01:18.270> got<00:01:18.450> off<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> terrible<00:01:19.170> start<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
jackets got off to that terrible start I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.190 
jackets got off to that terrible start I
did<00:01:20.189> think<00:01:20.790> about<00:01:20.939> trading<00:01:21.509> Rick<00:01:21.659> Nash<00:01:21.869> quite

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
did think about trading Rick Nash quite

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.230 
did think about trading Rick Nash quite
a<00:01:22.229> bit<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:23.070> didn't<00:01:23.369> really<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:23.939> those

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
a bit he didn't really do much those

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.480 
a bit he didn't really do much those
first<00:01:24.540> games<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.530> he<00:01:25.710> started<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.189> turn<00:01:26.340> it

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
first games but he started to turn it

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149 
first games but he started to turn it
around<00:01:26.610> here<00:01:27.030> lately<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:28.110> think<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.619> long

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
around here lately and I think as long

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.980 
around here lately and I think as long
as<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.430> keeps<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.000> he's<00:01:30.390> definitely<00:01:30.960> not

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
as he keeps it up he's definitely not

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.109 
as he keeps it up he's definitely not
going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.530> traded<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.700> done<00:01:32.909> so

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
going to be traded he's just done so

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.640 
going to be traded he's just done so
