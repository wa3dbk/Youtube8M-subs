all the way down the hair not too much

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.700 
all the way down the hair not too much
tension<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.090> where<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.420> would<00:01:39.570> cause<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
tension to where you would cause the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.039 
tension to where you would cause the
hair<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.370> break<00:01:41.760> or<00:01:42.060> anything<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:42.990> just

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
hair to break or anything but just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.320 
hair to break or anything but just
enough<00:01:43.560> tension<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.880> go<00:01:45.060> completely

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
enough tension just to go completely

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.190 
enough tension just to go completely
down<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.770> will<00:01:46.920> get<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> smooth

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
down to here and you will get a smooth

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.330 
down to here and you will get a smooth
straight<00:01:49.200> shiny<00:01:49.950> finish<00:01:50.810> up<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.500> stroke<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
straight shiny finish up one stroke of

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.430 
straight shiny finish up one stroke of
the<00:01:53.760> thermal<00:01:54.360> iron<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.900> it's<00:01:55.170> done<00:01:55.409> properly

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
the thermal iron if it's done properly

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.460 
the thermal iron if it's done properly
and<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.549> would<00:01:56.700> save<00:01:56.940> time<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.170> will<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.440> a

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
and it would save time and it will be a

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.890 
and it would save time and it will be a
lot<00:01:58.740> healthier<00:01:59.040> as<00:01:59.490> opposed<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.090> continue<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
lot healthier as opposed to continue to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.190 
lot healthier as opposed to continue to
restock<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.619> hair<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.280> get<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.580> same<00:02:02.790> finish

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
restock the hair to get the same finish

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.600 
restock the hair to get the same finish
okay<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.770> what<00:02:04.979> we're<00:02:05.159> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.369> do<00:02:05.490> we're
