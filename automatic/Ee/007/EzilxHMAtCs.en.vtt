pretty close to the hardware store we'll
take<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.630> look<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.109> one<00:00:19.350> on<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.619> bottom<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
take a look at this one on the bottom I

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.590 
take a look at this one on the bottom I
figured<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.800> would<00:00:22.949> grab<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:24.330> some

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.410 
don't know when it was made now Chris
actually<00:01:24.830> pointed<00:01:25.490> out<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.880> me<00:01:26.000> that<00:01:26.180> this<00:01:26.360> is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
actually pointed out to me that this is

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.570 
actually pointed out to me that this is
a<00:01:26.600> hotel<00:01:27.170> set<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:33.009> this<00:01:34.009> one's<00:01:34.340> from<00:01:35.020> 2004<00:01:36.020> and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
a hotel set and this one's from 2004 and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.490 
a hotel set and this one's from 2004 and
he<00:01:37.580> might<00:01:37.790> have<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.210> friend<00:01:38.659> who<00:01:38.899> wants<00:01:39.320> us<00:01:39.440> for

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
he might have a friend who wants us for

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.710 
he might have a friend who wants us for
video<00:01:40.130> games<00:01:40.490> or<00:01:40.850> something<00:01:40.880> because<00:01:41.540> it's

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
video games or something because it's

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:48.130 
video games or something because it's
got<00:01:41.930> composite<00:01:42.649> inputs<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.570> doesn't<00:01:47.960> have

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
got composite inputs so it doesn't have

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.370 
got composite inputs so it doesn't have
an<00:01:48.290> F<00:01:48.440> connector<00:01:49.070> just<00:01:49.100> has<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.720> coaxial<00:01:50.720> RCA

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
an F connector just has a coaxial RCA

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.870 
an F connector just has a coaxial RCA
and<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.490> guess<00:01:52.729> there's<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.920> card<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.130> goes<00:01:55.580> in

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
and I guess there's a card that goes in

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.690 
and I guess there's a card that goes in
here<00:01:56.830> for<00:01:58.990> interfacing<00:01:59.990> it<00:02:00.110> with<00:02:00.289> the<00:02:00.410> hotel

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.219 

video<00:02:04.700> system<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:07.269> it<00:02:08.269> seems<00:02:08.539> like<00:02:08.750> if<00:02:08.929> you<00:02:09.050> go

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
video system and it seems like if you go

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.960 
video system and it seems like if you go
out<00:02:09.410> on<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.649> Monday<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.610> look<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
out on a Monday and just look on the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.030 
out on a Monday and just look on the
curb<00:02:11.300> at<00:02:11.570> least<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.989> this<00:02:12.110> area<00:02:12.170> you'll<00:02:12.830> always

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
curb at least in this area you'll always

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.340 
curb at least in this area you'll always
just<00:02:13.190> find<00:02:13.670> two<00:02:13.970> or<00:02:14.060> three<00:02:14.300> sets<00:02:14.540> without<00:02:15.019> even

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
just find two or three sets without even

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.410 
just find two or three sets without even
looking<00:02:15.769> nobody<00:02:16.730> wants<00:02:17.239> these<00:02:17.500> CRT<00:02:18.500> sets<00:02:19.420> just

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
looking nobody wants these CRT sets just

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.780 
looking nobody wants these CRT sets just
nobody<00:02:21.049> wants<00:02:21.590> these<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.370> figure<00:02:25.700> I'll

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
nobody wants these so I figure I'll

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.009 
nobody wants these so I figure I'll
bring<00:02:25.970> them<00:02:26.090> home<00:02:26.299> and<00:02:28.269> have<00:02:29.269> fun<00:02:29.600> with<00:02:29.810> them

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
bring them home and have fun with them

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.210 
bring them home and have fun with them
find<00:02:30.950> a<00:02:31.070> creative<00:02:31.340> way<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.880> make<00:02:32.829> them<00:02:33.829> into<00:02:34.100> an

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
find a creative way to make them into an

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.090 
find a creative way to make them into an
entertainment<00:02:34.519> item<00:02:35.590> let's<00:02:36.590> plug<00:02:36.829> them<00:02:37.010> in
