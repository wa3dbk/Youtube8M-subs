00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:05.840 
okay well this is a problem that I ran

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.249 
okay well this is a problem that I ran
into<00:00:06.020> at<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.500> very<00:00:06.710> easy<00:00:07.009> solution<00:00:08.259> what's

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
into at the very easy solution what's

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.589 
into at the very easy solution what's
going<00:00:09.499> on<00:00:09.620> here<00:00:10.070> is<00:00:10.219> that<00:00:10.429> I<00:00:10.849> bought<00:00:11.120> a<00:00:11.150> used

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
going on here is that I bought a used

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.409 
going on here is that I bought a used
guitar<00:00:11.780> over<00:00:12.320> the<00:00:12.410> internet<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.389> when<00:00:14.389> I

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
guitar over the internet and when I

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.460 
guitar over the internet and when I
received<00:00:14.929> it<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:16.100> frets<00:00:16.550> on<00:00:16.970> its<00:00:17.210> had<00:00:17.630> little

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
received it the frets on its had little

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.980 
received it the frets on its had little
grooves<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.460> frets<00:00:19.730> are<00:00:19.910> doesn't<00:00:20.870> have<00:00:20.960> a

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
grooves so the frets are doesn't have a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.950 
grooves so the frets are doesn't have a
lot<00:00:21.140> of<00:00:21.170> downward<00:00:21.800> wear<00:00:22.070> but<00:00:22.490> the<00:00:22.820> the<00:00:23.540> strings

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
lot of downward wear but the the strings

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.130 
lot of downward wear but the the strings
for<00:00:24.260> whatever<00:00:24.440> reason<00:00:25.040> I<00:00:25.430> had<00:00:25.640> just<00:00:25.790> made

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
for whatever reason I had just made

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.290 
for whatever reason I had just made
terrible<00:00:27.140> marks<00:00:27.740> all<00:00:27.950> over<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:28.520> frets<00:00:29.000> and

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
terrible marks all over the frets and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.319 
terrible marks all over the frets and
you<00:00:30.140> could<00:00:30.289> feel<00:00:30.470> it<00:00:30.530> so<00:00:31.370> for<00:00:31.820> example<00:00:32.210> you

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
you could feel it so for example you

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.340 
you could feel it so for example you
probably<00:00:32.480> hear<00:00:32.780> this<00:00:34.780> if<00:00:35.780> my<00:00:35.810> fingernails

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
probably hear this if my fingernails

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.260 
probably hear this if my fingernails
scraping<00:00:36.680> on<00:00:36.980> the<00:00:37.010> on<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.640> grooves<00:00:37.940> where<00:00:38.150> the

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
scraping on the on the grooves where the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.330 
scraping on the on the grooves where the
string<00:00:38.540> strings<00:00:39.140> made<00:00:39.380> it<00:00:41.110> it's<00:00:42.110> like<00:00:42.230> them<00:00:42.440> on

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
string strings made it it's like them on

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.010 
string strings made it it's like them on
every<00:00:43.730> fret<00:00:44.060> and<00:00:44.210> my<00:00:44.360> fingernail<00:00:44.720> actually

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
every fret and my fingernail actually

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.010 
every fret and my fingernail actually
catches<00:00:45.670> on<00:00:46.670> every<00:00:47.210> fret<00:00:47.540> it's<00:00:47.899> awful<00:00:48.320> so<00:00:50.020> what

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
catches on every fret it's awful so what

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.690 
catches on every fret it's awful so what
I've<00:00:51.140> done<00:00:51.320> here<00:00:51.770> got<00:00:52.130> some<00:00:52.280> painters<00:00:52.640> tape

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
I've done here got some painters tape

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:59.049 
I've done here got some painters tape
and<00:00:54.489> 220<00:00:56.170> grain<00:00:57.170> grit<00:00:57.620> sandpaper<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.790> could

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
and 220 grain grit sandpaper you could

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.709 
and 220 grain grit sandpaper you could
probably<00:00:59.239> use<00:01:00.670> less<00:01:01.670> grain<00:01:01.969> than<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.360> you

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
probably use less grain than that you

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.039 
probably use less grain than that you
know<00:01:03.250> less<00:01:04.250> grain<00:01:04.460> would<00:01:04.610> be<00:01:04.729> like<00:01:05.239> 400<00:01:05.900> or

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
know less grain would be like 400 or

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.640 
know less grain would be like 400 or
whatever<00:01:06.530> but<00:01:07.190> 220<00:01:07.850> is<00:01:09.250> fine<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.049> all<00:01:12.049> I've

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
whatever but 220 is fine and all I've

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.100 
whatever but 220 is fine and all I've
done<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.280> turned<00:01:13.610> out<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.880> be<00:01:13.909> really<00:01:14.780> easy

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
done and it turned out to be really easy

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.010 
done and it turned out to be really easy
and<00:01:15.380> safe<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:16.070> I<00:01:16.280> put<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:16.700> painters<00:01:17.030> tape<00:01:17.060> down

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
and safe is I put the painters tape down

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.590 
and safe is I put the painters tape down
like<00:01:18.380> like<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:20.500> then<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.560> take<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.600> 220

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
like like this and then I take the 220

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.960 
like like this and then I take the 220
grain<00:01:23.840> grit<00:01:24.260> sandpaper<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.479> just<00:01:26.560> gently

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
grain grit sandpaper and just gently

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.300 
grain grit sandpaper and just gently
sand<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.180> edge<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:29.570> frets<00:01:29.900> like<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.950> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
sand the edge of the frets like that and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.800 
sand the edge of the frets like that and
it<00:01:32.060> actually<00:01:32.270> sent<00:01:33.200> out<00:01:33.470> all<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.710> all<00:01:34.189> little

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
it actually sent out all the all little

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.410 
it actually sent out all the all little
grooves<00:01:35.810> in<00:01:36.200> the<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.619> the<00:01:36.770> frets<00:01:37.100> so<00:01:37.430> now<00:01:38.180> I've

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
grooves in the in the frets so now I've

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.240 
grooves in the in the frets so now I've
these<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.290> frets<00:01:39.560> that<00:01:39.740> I've<00:01:39.890> done<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:42.250> they

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
these the frets that I've done and they

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.289 
these the frets that I've done and they
were<00:01:43.310> completely<00:01:43.640> smooth<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.430> I<00:01:46.460> didn't<00:01:46.909> it

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
were completely smooth so I didn't it

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.289 
were completely smooth so I didn't it
didn't<00:01:47.570> sand<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:47.960> frets<00:01:48.250> downward<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:49.580> like

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
didn't sand the frets downward like like

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.850 
didn't sand the frets downward like like
we're<00:01:50.509> strings<00:01:50.810> where<00:01:51.110> where<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:51.590> threats

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
we're strings where where the threats

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.280 
we're strings where where the threats
over<00:01:52.159> time<00:01:52.400> that<00:01:53.060> just<00:01:53.240> polished<00:01:53.869> him<00:01:53.990> up<00:01:54.080> and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
over time that just polished him up and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.819 
over time that just polished him up and
made<00:01:54.380> him<00:01:54.409> smooth<00:01:54.710> again<00:01:55.540> so<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:57.560> actually<00:01:57.680> a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
made him smooth again so it's actually a

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.580 
made him smooth again so it's actually a
terrific<00:01:58.430> solution<00:01:58.729> cheap<00:01:59.299> solution<00:01:59.600> but<00:02:00.470> in

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
terrific solution cheap solution but in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.410 
terrific solution cheap solution but in
it<00:02:00.740> to<00:02:00.829> pay<00:02:01.040> anybody<00:02:01.250> to<00:02:01.610> do<00:02:01.759> this<00:02:01.939> or<00:02:02.240> reef

read it or return the guitar and

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.910 
read it or return the guitar and
