because any oil brand so that we can get
more<00:00:21.380> performance<00:00:21.560> by<00:00:21.890> using<00:00:21.920> their<00:00:22.340> brand

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
more performance by using their brand

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.340 
more performance by using their brand
than<00:00:23.090> other<00:00:23.350> performance-oriented

of oil and we're gonna do a couple of
runs<00:00:32.660> just<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:33.080> see<00:00:33.260> exactly<00:00:33.650> what<00:00:33.890> sort<00:00:34.040> of

runs just to see exactly what sort of

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.590 
runs just to see exactly what sort of
horsepower<00:00:34.460> we're<00:00:34.640> making<00:00:34.970> they<00:00:35.360> were<00:00:35.420> gonna

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
horsepower we're making they were gonna

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.869 
horsepower we're making they were gonna
switch<00:00:35.930> out<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:36.260> oil<00:00:36.440> pop<00:00:36.920> in<00:00:37.040> any<00:00:37.340> ice<00:00:37.550> oil

switch out the oil pop in any ice oil
brand<00:00:38.120> and<00:00:38.449> see<00:00:38.600> if<00:00:38.690> we<00:00:38.780> can<00:00:38.900> get<00:00:39.020> in<00:00:39.110> the

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
brand and see if we can get in the

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.320 
brand and see if we can get in the
increase<00:00:39.530> in<00:00:39.739> horsepower<00:00:39.910> just<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.030> make<00:00:41.180> it

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
increase in horsepower just to make it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.520 
increase in horsepower just to make it
legit<00:00:41.660> we've<00:00:41.809> stripped<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.080> whole<00:00:42.260> bunch<00:00:42.440> of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
is a lifeline of a motor so what you

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.680 
is a lifeline of a motor so what you
picked<00:01:23.980> makes<00:01:24.700> a<00:01:24.820> big<00:01:24.970> difference<00:01:25.300> in<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:25.480> car

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
picked makes a big difference in the car

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.420 
picked makes a big difference in the car
and<00:01:26.200> it's<00:01:26.320> been<00:01:26.500> modified<00:01:26.710> it<00:01:27.100> does<00:01:27.220> have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
and it's been modified it does have

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.520 
and it's been modified it does have
exhausts<00:01:28.000> what<00:01:28.600> would<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.750> be<00:01:28.990> Nathan<00:01:29.320> power

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
exhausts what would that be Nathan power

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.680 
exhausts what would that be Nathan power
wise<00:01:29.830> out<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.820> this<00:01:30.940> car<00:01:31.210> we're<00:01:31.420> probably

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
wise out of this car we're probably

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.830 
wise out of this car we're probably
looking<00:01:31.960> at<00:01:32.170> about<00:01:32.380> 275<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:33.310> 280<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:33.940> gotta<00:01:34.630> say

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.449 
with your second run with the same oil
in<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.150> see<00:02:15.140> what<00:02:15.290> we<00:02:15.410> get<00:02:15.560> get<00:02:15.860> an<00:02:15.950> average<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
in it see what we get get an average and

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:17.920 
in it see what we get get an average and
then<00:02:16.580> we'll<00:02:16.730> switch<00:02:17.090> up<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.450> oil<00:02:17.690> and<00:02:17.750> see

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
then we'll switch up the oil and see

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.030 
then we'll switch up the oil and see
what<00:02:18.050> we<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.230> get

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.280 

we<00:02:24.400> have<00:02:24.519> gone<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:24.879> about<00:02:25.390> two<00:02:25.720> horses<00:02:25.989> and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
we have gone up about two horses and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.030 
we have gone up about two horses and
we've<00:02:26.590> gone<00:02:26.920> up<00:02:27.689> one<00:02:28.689> foot<00:02:29.200> pound<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.560> tools<00:02:29.769> so

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
we've gone up one foot pound of tools so

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.619 
we've gone up one foot pound of tools so
let's<00:02:30.489> switch<00:02:30.760> out<00:02:30.939> the<00:02:31.060> oil<00:02:31.209> and<00:02:31.420> see<00:02:31.540> if

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:31.629 
let's switch out the oil and see if

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:39.780 
let's switch out the oil and see if
there's<00:02:31.810> gonna<00:02:31.900> be<00:02:31.989> any<00:02:32.110> game

protecting<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.299> competitive<00:02:40.780> bram<00:02:40.989> we've

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
protecting the competitive bram we've

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.410 
protecting the competitive bram we've
got<00:02:41.260> about<00:02:41.470> 270<00:02:42.340> horsepower<00:02:42.459> out<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.269> and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
got about 270 horsepower out of it and

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.970 
got about 270 horsepower out of it and
now<00:02:43.720> we've<00:02:43.959> switched<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:44.409> up<00:02:44.530> for<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.739> fully

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
now we've switched it up for the fully

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.420 
now we've switched it up for the fully
synthetic<00:02:45.400> anyhow<00:02:46.150> brand<00:02:46.480> it's<00:02:46.689> a<00:02:46.890> 0w<00:02:47.890> 50

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
synthetic anyhow brand it's a 0w 50

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:54.830 
synthetic anyhow brand it's a 0w 50
let's<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.790> how<00:02:48.939> it<00:02:49.090> goes

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.220 

it's<00:02:55.020> like<00:02:55.170> pretty<00:02:55.680> much<00:02:55.709> safe<00:02:56.270> g73<00:02:57.270> yeah<00:02:57.959> so

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
it's like pretty much safe g73 yeah so

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.150 
it's like pretty much safe g73 yeah so
three<00:02:58.530> horsepower<00:02:58.800> on<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> first<00:02:59.370> run<00:02:59.640> with

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
three horsepower on the first run with

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.350 
three horsepower on the first run with
239<00:03:02.160> foot<00:03:02.520> baths<00:03:02.700> at<00:03:02.849> all<00:03:03.030> so<00:03:03.180> that's

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
239 foot baths at all so that's

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.120 
239 foot baths at all so that's
increases<00:03:03.870> across<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.200> board<00:03:04.470> wow<00:03:04.890> that's

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
increases across the board wow that's

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.309 
increases across the board wow that's
very<00:03:05.489> impressive<00:03:05.790> I<00:03:06.150> mean<00:03:06.300> I've<00:03:06.390> never<00:03:06.480> smoked

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
very impressive I mean I've never smoked

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.930 
very impressive I mean I've never smoked
that's<00:03:07.830> our<00:03:08.010> first<00:03:08.190> run<00:03:09.890> yeah<00:03:10.890> already<00:03:11.670> that's

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
that's our first run yeah already that's

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:20.670 
that's our first run yeah already that's

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
2:30 late so just by switching got the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.080 
2:30 late so just by switching got the
oil<00:03:45.459> there<00:03:46.420> you<00:03:46.510> go<00:03:46.659> three<00:03:47.019> horsepower<00:03:47.319> and

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
oil there you go three horsepower and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.780 
oil there you go three horsepower and
good<00:03:49.090> talk<00:03:50.109> yeah<00:03:50.409> very<00:03:50.829> very<00:03:51.129> impressive<00:03:51.519> I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
good talk yeah very very impressive I

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.890 
good talk yeah very very impressive I

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
mean I never would have thought we would

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.099 
mean I never would have thought we would
gain<00:03:53.859> anything<00:03:54.489> just<00:03:54.700> by<00:03:54.790> changing<00:03:55.000> oil<00:03:55.299> well

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
gain anything just by changing oil well

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.500 
gain anything just by changing oil well
it<00:03:56.230> surprised<00:03:56.560> me<00:03:56.590> slowly

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
it surprised me slowly

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.530 
it surprised me slowly
