00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240 

here<00:00:00.780> are<00:00:00.840> four<00:00:00.960> chords<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.589> I<00:00:01.770> stumbled

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
here are four chords that I stumbled

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.619 
here are four chords that I stumbled
across<00:00:02.310> today<00:00:02.730> during<00:00:02.939> one<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.360> lessons

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
across today during one of my lessons

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.010 
across today during one of my lessons
it's<00:00:04.100> just<00:00:05.100> four<00:00:05.310> major<00:00:05.580> chords<00:00:06.089> starting<00:00:06.779> on

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
it's just four major chords starting on

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:16.120 
it's just four major chords starting on
a<00:00:07.049> going<00:00:08.040> to<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:09.290> vintage<00:00:10.290> E<00:00:11.360> and<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.750> D

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.940 

such<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.310> an<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.820> root<00:00:18.060> position<00:00:18.090> C<00:00:18.950> in

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
such as an a in root position C in

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.590 
such as an a in root position C in
second<00:00:20.280> inversion<00:00:20.370> that<00:00:21.030> is<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.180> key<00:00:21.360> change

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
second inversion that is a key change

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.170 
second inversion that is a key change
that<00:00:21.780> obviously<00:00:22.230> because<00:00:22.530> this<00:00:22.740> C<00:00:23.640> sharpen

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
that obviously because this C sharpen

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.350 
that obviously because this C sharpen
and<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.710> C<00:00:25.890> natural<00:00:27.560> G<00:00:29.510> and<00:00:30.510> D<00:00:30.720> now

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
and this has the C natural G and D now

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.940 
and this has the C natural G and D now
what<00:00:33.360> key<00:00:33.540> are<00:00:33.570> we<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.050> we<00:00:34.379> could<00:00:34.739> say

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
what key are we really in we could say

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.970 
what key are we really in we could say
we're<00:00:35.190> largely<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.970> key<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.300> G<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:37.410> for

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we're largely in the key of G for for

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.160 
we're largely in the key of G for for
that<00:00:38.040> progression<00:00:38.489> where<00:00:38.910> we've<00:00:39.030> got<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that progression where we've got the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.680 
that progression where we've got the
last<00:00:40.379> three<00:00:40.590> chords<00:00:40.800> C<00:00:41.100> G<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.760> D<00:00:41.940> all<00:00:42.480> come

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
last three chords C G and D all come

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.140 
last three chords C G and D all come
from<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.989> key<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.379> G<00:00:43.739> major<00:00:43.920> but<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.970> first

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
from the key of G major but the first

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.660 
from the key of G major but the first
chord<00:00:45.449> is<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.650> major<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.220> obviously

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
chord is in a major so that's obviously

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.490 
chord is in a major so that's obviously
not<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.060> key<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> G<00:00:48.540> it's<00:00:49.050> from<00:00:49.260> something

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
not in the key of G it's from something

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.030 
not in the key of G it's from something
else<00:00:49.770> perhaps<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:51.090> from<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> key<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> D<00:00:52.050> or

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
else perhaps it's from the key of D or

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100 
else perhaps it's from the key of D or
from<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> key<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.820> doesn't<00:00:54.750> really<00:00:54.870> matter

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
from the key of a doesn't really matter

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.620 
from the key of a doesn't really matter
it's<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:56.730> were<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> key<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.180> G<00:00:57.390> for<00:00:57.570> the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:57.630 
it's if we were in the key of G for the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:58.910 
it's if we were in the key of G for the
entire<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.110> we<00:00:58.200> would<00:00:58.350> start<00:00:58.590> off<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
entire thing we would start off with a

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.799 
entire thing we would start off with a
minor<00:01:00.350> that<00:01:01.350> would<00:01:01.469> be<00:01:01.590> more<00:01:01.770> conventional

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
minor that would be more conventional

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
minor that would be more conventional
just<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> give<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.170> bit<00:01:04.350> of<00:01:04.440> an<00:01:04.559> edge<00:01:05.330> we're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
just to give it a bit of an edge we're

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.320 
just to give it a bit of an edge we're
starting<00:01:06.660> on<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:07.200> major<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.009> here<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.190> go

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:22.130 

you

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.510 

not<00:01:23.140> using<00:01:23.439> too<00:01:23.560> much<00:01:23.740> metal<00:01:29.130> gives<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.340> more

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
not using too much metal gives it more

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.190 
not using too much metal gives it more
of<00:01:30.670> a<00:01:30.759> funky<00:01:31.299> feel<00:01:31.539> if<00:01:31.750> you<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:31.990> use<00:01:32.079> too

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
of a funky feel if you don't use too

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:44.280 
of a funky feel if you don't use too
much<00:01:32.229> pedal

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.610 

that's<00:01:45.290> octaves

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.560 

you

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.690 

and<00:01:52.080> we<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.470> swap<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:52.920> first<00:01:53.190> cord<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
and we can swap that first cord for a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:26.970 
and we can swap that first cord for a
mine

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:41.880 

let's<00:02:27.970> go<00:02:28.090> back<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.590> lively<00:02:29.590> version

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.320 

we<00:02:42.890> could<00:02:43.010> even<00:02:43.129> put<00:02:43.220> in<00:02:43.430> some<00:02:43.670> some<00:02:43.940> bluesy

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 
we could even put in some some bluesy

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.610 
we could even put in some some bluesy
bits

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:04.480 

you

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:20.020 

so<00:03:05.490> I'm<00:03:05.550> just<00:03:05.730> crushing<00:03:06.150> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:31.630 

oh<00:03:20.710> right<00:03:21.770> naked<00:03:22.280> either

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.500 

you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.380 

I<00:03:35.890> know<00:03:36.890> I'm<00:03:37.280> going<00:03:37.459> too<00:03:37.640> fast<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:38.060> most<00:03:38.239> of

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
I know I'm going too fast and most of

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:56.710 
I know I'm going too fast and most of
you<00:03:38.510> but<00:03:38.720> I'm<00:03:38.930> just<00:03:39.019> having<00:03:39.409> fun

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:18.830 

you

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.840 

enjoy
