I<00:00:00.450> will<00:00:01.439> show<00:00:01.680> you<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.890> quick<00:00:02.280> example<00:00:02.310> we'll

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
I will show you a quick example we'll

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.730 
I will show you a quick example we'll
close<00:00:03.240> out<00:00:03.480> those<00:00:03.689> scenes<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.200> create<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.529> new

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
close out those scenes and create a new

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.970 
close out those scenes and create a new
scene<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.580> which<00:00:05.790> I'll<00:00:06.029> just<00:00:06.480> create<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.020> figure

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
scene in which I'll just create a figure

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.820 
scene in which I'll just create a figure
mesh<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.820> I'll<00:00:09.420> turn<00:00:09.809> this<00:00:10.019> one<00:00:10.200> into<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
mesh and I'll turn this one into a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.490 
mesh and I'll turn this one into a
beauty<00:00:11.130> bottom<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.690> disputed<00:00:12.690> volume<00:00:13.019> as<00:00:13.290> you

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
beauty bottom and disputed volume as you

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
beauty bottom and disputed volume as you
know<00:00:13.830> we'll<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.670> default<00:00:15.000> very<00:00:15.299> few

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
know we'll have a default very few

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.300 
know we'll have a default very few
particles<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.199> viewport<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.859> go<00:00:17.039> here

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
particles in the viewport I can go here

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.730 
particles in the viewport I can go here
to<00:00:17.340> about<00:00:17.640> 10<00:00:18.140> centimeters<00:00:19.140> so<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
to about 10 centimeters so this is a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.370 
to about 10 centimeters so this is a
very<00:00:20.039> very<00:00:20.310> rough<00:00:21.080> representation<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
very very rough representation of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.179 
very very rough representation of the
actual<00:00:22.710> figure<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.930> if<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.140> wanted<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.890> produce

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
actual figure and if I wanted to produce

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.070 
actual figure and if I wanted to produce
more<00:00:26.490> particles<00:00:27.000> obviously<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
more particles obviously I can and the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.200 
more particles obviously I can and the
trend<00:00:28.320> offender<00:00:28.710> could<00:00:28.890> happen<00:00:29.220> but<00:00:29.730> what<00:00:30.090> I'm

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
trend offender could happen but what I'm

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
trend offender could happen but what I'm
going<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.660> now<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.050> add<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> cricketer<00:00:31.920> back

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
going to do now is add a cricketer back

and<00:00:47.969> you'll<00:00:48.180> see<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.260> we're<00:00:49.469> getting<00:00:49.559> random

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and you'll see that we're getting random

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.819 
and you'll see that we're getting random
particles<00:00:50.789> distributed<00:00:51.600> in<00:00:52.020> each<00:00:52.230> box<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
particles distributed in each box so

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.560 
particles distributed in each box so
where<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.340> have<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.520> particle<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
where we have a particle around the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.630 
where we have a particle around the
particles<00:00:55.140> would<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.710> ten<00:00:55.949> centimeters

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
particles would in ten centimeters

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
particles would in ten centimeters
receive<00:00:57.270> new<00:00:57.449> particles<00:00:57.930> here<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.890> without

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
receive new particles here this without

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.939 
receive new particles here this without
them<00:00:59.699> here<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.079> then<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> can

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
them here it's with them and then I can

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.149 
them here it's with them and then I can
continue<00:01:02.430> increasing<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.660> number<00:01:04.049> of

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
continue increasing the number of

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
continue increasing the number of
particles<00:01:05.159> per<00:01:05.220> box<00:01:05.489> row<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> make<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> more

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
particles per box row and make it more

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.500 
particles per box row and make it more
solid<00:01:06.900> at<00:01:07.530> some<00:01:07.830> point<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.580> here<00:01:09.000> about

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
solid at some point when I'm here about

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.160 
solid at some point when I'm here about
10<00:01:09.840> particles<00:01:10.170> per<00:01:10.470> box<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
10 particles per box so I get the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.330 
10 particles per box so I get the
relatively<00:01:13.740> solid<00:01:14.250> look<00:01:14.670> from<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.360> data<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
relatively solid look from the data that

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.740 
relatively solid look from the data that
really<00:01:17.340> low<00:01:17.640> resolution<00:01:18.150> data<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.600> get

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
really low resolution data that I get

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.630 
really low resolution data that I get
there<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.650> also<00:01:19.799> increase<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.189> number<00:01:20.610> of

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
there I can also increase the number of

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.760 
there I can also increase the number of
subdivisions<00:01:20.850> that<00:01:21.270> will<00:01:21.570> create<00:01:21.810> some<00:01:22.259> boxes

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
subdivisions that will create some boxes

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.820 
subdivisions that will create some boxes
and<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.100> fuel<00:01:23.369> oil<00:01:23.840> particles<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.680> order

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and and fuel oil particles and in order

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.289 
and and fuel oil particles and in order
to<00:01:25.860> visualize<00:01:26.310> what's<00:01:26.580> happening<00:01:26.640> I'm<00:01:27.119> going

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to visualize what's happening I'm going

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.149 
to visualize what's happening I'm going
to<00:01:27.450> copy<00:01:27.720> after<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.920> subdivision<00:01:31.040> after<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
to copy after the subdivision after a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.149 
to copy after the subdivision after a
population<00:01:32.790> I'll<00:01:33.090> move<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.200> behind<00:01:34.920> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
population I'll move this behind and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.330 
population I'll move this behind and
I'll<00:01:35.820> switch<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.860> copy<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
I'll switch it from the copy from

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'll switch it from the copy from
normals

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
normals

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.030 
normals
into<00:01:39.990> colors<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.460> will<00:01:41.640> visualize<00:01:43.040> what

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
into colors and this will visualize what

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.789 
into colors and this will visualize what
is<00:01:44.189> actually<00:01:44.579> happening<00:01:45.060> when<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.229> populate

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
is actually happening when we populate

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.190 
is actually happening when we populate
new<00:01:46.979> particles<00:01:47.520> new<00:01:48.329> normals<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:49.020> being

it looks like I'm almost like we created
metal<00:01:57.750> balls<00:01:57.960> around<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.439> original

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
metal balls around the original

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.959 
metal balls around the original
particles<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.689> then<00:02:00.689> we<00:02:01.610> calculate<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> Dom

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
particles and then we calculate the Dom

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
particles and then we calculate the Dom
also<00:02:03.360> approximately<00:02:03.869> from<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.500> surface<00:02:04.829> of

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
also approximately from the surface of

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.399 
also approximately from the surface of
this<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.369> block<00:02:06.119> measure<00:02:06.450> on<00:02:06.600> we<00:02:07.079> don't<00:02:07.290> really

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
this a block measure on we don't really

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.779 
this a block measure on we don't really
create<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.770> block<00:02:07.950> mesh<00:02:08.160> but<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.580> data

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
create a block mesh but the data

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
create a block mesh but the data
structure<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.660> very<00:02:09.720> similar<00:02:09.899> were<00:02:10.289> create<00:02:10.500> a

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
structure is very similar were create a

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.960 
structure is very similar were create a
group<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> particles<00:02:11.610> there

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
group of the particles there

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.550 
group of the particles there
figure<00:02:12.480> out

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
figure out

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
figure out
they<00:02:13.770> affect<00:02:13.890> based<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.580> this<00:02:14.730> radius<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.540> this

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
they affect based in this radius so this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.559 
they affect based in this radius so this
value<00:02:16.020> here<00:02:16.190> defines<00:02:17.190> both<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.790> size<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
value here defines both the size of the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.280 
value here defines both the size of the
grid<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:19.770> now<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.690> size<00:02:21.690> of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.930> grid<00:02:22.110> is

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
grid right now the size of the grid is

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
grid right now the size of the grid is
10<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:22.739> it's<00:02:22.890> subdivided<00:02:23.310> one<00:02:23.489> so<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.760> five

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
10 but it's subdivided one so it's five

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.839 
10 but it's subdivided one so it's five
centimeters<00:02:24.209> grid<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.770> each<00:02:26.430> one<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
centimeters grid and in each one of

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.270 
centimeters grid and in each one of
those<00:02:27.000> boxes<00:02:27.690> we<00:02:28.140> are<00:02:28.290> sitting<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:29.069> my

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
those boxes we are sitting one on my

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.650 
those boxes we are sitting one on my
particles<00:02:29.760> in<00:02:29.819> this<00:02:29.910> case<00:02:30.150> 10<00:02:30.360> particles

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
particles in this case 10 particles

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.290 
particles in this case 10 particles
which<00:02:31.349> will<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.800> within<00:02:32.010> 10<00:02:32.370> centimeters<00:02:33.030> from

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
which will be within 10 centimeters from

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.040 
which will be within 10 centimeters from
original<00:02:34.290> particle<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:35.239> we<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.390> also<00:02:36.540> fall

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
original particle and we can also fall

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.250 
original particle and we can also fall
off<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.739> density<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.790> distance<00:02:39.209> so<00:02:40.110> it's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
off the density of the distance so it's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.280 
off the density of the distance so it's
linearly<00:02:40.650> falling<00:02:41.099> off<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.610> slowly<00:02:42.290> fading

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
linearly falling off and slowly fading

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.500 
linearly falling off and slowly fading
as<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:44.310> particles<00:02:44.730> are<00:02:44.849> moving<00:02:44.970> away<00:02:45.150> from

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
as the particles are moving away from

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.740 
as the particles are moving away from
their<00:02:45.690> source<00:02:45.959> particle<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:47.600> with<00:02:48.600> this

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
their source particle and with this

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.610 
their source particle and with this
method<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.200> can<00:02:49.500> create<00:02:50.330> as<00:02:51.380> shown<00:02:52.380> during

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
method you can create as shown during

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.710 
method you can create as shown during
the<00:02:52.950> anyb<00:02:53.640> timer<00:02:53.850> for<00:02:54.060> example<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.569> take

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
the anyb timer for example you can take

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.479 
the anyb timer for example you can take
a<00:02:54.780> fluid<00:02:55.170> simulation<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.950> increase<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
a fluid simulation and increase the

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.580 
a fluid simulation and increase the
number<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.760> particles<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:57.590> effectively

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
number of particles there effectively

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.050 
number of particles there effectively
and<00:02:58.920> create<00:02:59.250> something<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.610> looks<00:02:59.940> like

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
and create something that looks like

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.780 
and create something that looks like
this<00:03:00.390> fluid<00:03:00.660> simulation<00:03:01.459> the<00:03:02.459> other<00:03:02.580> thing

this fluid simulation the other thing

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.370 
this fluid simulation the other thing
that<00:03:02.819> we<00:03:03.060> can<00:03:03.239> do<00:03:03.420> is<00:03:03.540> if<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:03.930> remember<00:03:04.440> the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
that we can do is if you remember the

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.979 
that we can do is if you remember the
Pieta<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.530> that<00:03:07.830> we<00:03:07.950> were<00:03:08.069> looking<00:03:08.190> at<00:03:08.459> here

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
Pieta know that we were looking at here

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.890 
Pieta know that we were looking at here

because<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.540> had<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:30.930> subdivision<00:03:31.500> here

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
because I had one subdivision here

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
because I had one subdivision here
around<00:03:32.730> each<00:03:32.970> particle<00:03:33.180> right<00:03:33.720> now<00:03:33.930> we<00:03:33.989> are

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
around each particle right now we are

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.440 
around each particle right now we are
creating<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> radius<00:03:35.130> of<00:03:35.340> 10<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:35.880> we're

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
creating a radius of 10 and we're

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.740 
creating a radius of 10 and we're
putting<00:03:36.840> particles<00:03:37.410> wrong<00:03:37.829> if<00:03:38.579> I<00:03:38.790> go<00:03:38.970> down<00:03:39.269> to

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
putting particles wrong if I go down to

putting particles wrong if I go down to
the<00:03:39.870> radius<00:03:40.319> of<00:03:40.470> 1<00:03:42.739> around<00:03:43.739> each<00:03:43.920> particle<00:03:44.130> to

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
the radius of 1 around each particle to

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:45.800 
the radius of 1 around each particle to
take<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.790> little<00:03:45.030> bit<00:03:45.150> longer<00:03:45.359> because<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
take a little bit longer because the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.020 
take a little bit longer because the
grid<00:03:46.079> got<00:03:46.350> much<00:03:46.590> more<00:03:46.769> dense<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.280> had<00:03:47.430> to<00:03:47.549> in

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
grid got much more dense I had to in

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.879 
grid got much more dense I had to in
memory<00:03:48.450> created<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.079> much<00:03:49.200> bigger<00:03:49.410> grid<00:03:49.709> and

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:49.889 
memory created a much bigger grid and

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.740 
memory created a much bigger grid and
now<00:03:50.250> around<00:03:50.519> each<00:03:50.790> one<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.359> original

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
now around each one of the original

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.140 
now around each one of the original
particles<00:03:52.260> which<00:03:52.500> are<00:03:52.680> shown<00:03:52.980> as<00:03:53.190> velocities

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
particles which are shown as velocities

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.090

particle stage rocks also we have big of
knobs<00:04:25.530> we<00:04:26.250> are<00:04:26.310> now<00:04:26.430> creating<00:04:27.000> much

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540

Speirs<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.710> when<00:04:29.160> they<00:04:29.310> come<00:04:29.520> together<00:04:29.730> they

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
Speirs and when they come together they

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.090 
Speirs and when they come together they
start<00:04:30.660> merging<00:04:30.990> instead<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.650> overlapping

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
start merging instead of overlapping

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.740 
start merging instead of overlapping
they<00:04:32.640> don't<00:04:32.820> have<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.150> plication<00:04:33.510> of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
they don't have the plication of

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.120 
they don't have the plication of

other<00:04:35.250> they<00:04:35.850> much<00:04:36.630> just<00:04:37.110> like<00:04:37.460> metaball<00:04:38.460> would

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
other they much just like metaball would

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.710 
other they much just like metaball would
do<00:04:39.860> so<00:04:40.860> this<00:04:41.040> is<00:04:41.250> the<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.820> general<00:04:42.120> principle

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
do so this is the the general principle

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.570 
do so this is the the general principle
of<00:04:42.840> how<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.200> Republican<00:04:43.980> actually<00:04:44.370> works

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
of how the Republican actually works

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.410 
of how the Republican actually works
receiving<00:04:45.120> your<00:04:45.210> particles<00:04:45.780> on<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.050> grape<00:04:46.530> and

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
receiving your particles on a grape and

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.210 
receiving your particles on a grape and
distributing<00:04:48.420> all<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.660> data<00:04:48.840> you<00:04:49.410> saw<00:04:49.890> when<00:04:50.190> I

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
distributing all the data you saw when I

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.310 
distributing all the data you saw when I
was<00:04:50.430> showing<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.820> velocities<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.930> are<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
was showing the velocities that are the

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.230 
was showing the velocities that are the
actual<00:04:52.530> velocities<00:04:53.130> survived<00:04:53.700> the<00:04:53.820> process

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
actual velocities survived the process

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.540 
actual velocities survived the process
in<00:04:54.420> any<00:04:54.960> channel<00:04:55.440> if<00:04:55.650> I<00:04:55.740> had<00:04:55.920> colors<00:04:56.370> for

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
in any channel if I had colors for

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.220 
in any channel if I had colors for
example<00:04:56.610> underneath<00:04:57.650> and<00:04:58.650> I<00:04:58.740> wanted<00:04:59.100> to<00:05:00.230> for

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
example underneath and I wanted to for

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.020 
example underneath and I wanted to for
example<00:05:01.260> colorized<00:05:01.980> by<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.220> velocity<00:05:02.580> and

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
example colorized by the velocity and

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.550 
example colorized by the velocity and
then<00:05:03.210> propagate<00:05:03.720> that<00:05:03.900> color<00:05:04.200> through<00:05:04.530> the

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
then propagate that color through the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.010 
then propagate that color through the
particles<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.340> can<00:05:05.520> do<00:05:05.670> that

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
particles I can do that

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.700 
particles I can do that
so<00:05:07.590> I<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.250> have<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:09.480> tell<00:05:09.690> it<00:05:09.840> that<00:05:09.870> I<00:05:10.530> will

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
so I just have to to tell it that I will

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.020 
so I just have to to tell it that I will
be<00:05:10.830> using<00:05:10.950> that<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:11.310> last<00:05:11.520> year<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.850> color

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
be using that the last year the color

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.350 
many particles are creating and in what
works<00:05:55.110> all<00:05:55.350> space<00:05:55.680> and<00:05:55.980> that<00:05:56.670> means<00:05:56.970> each

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
works all space and that means each

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.940 
works all space and that means each
particle<00:05:57.780> will<00:05:57.960> get<00:05:58.140> a<00:05:58.200> fraction<00:05:58.710> of<00:05:58.860> the

00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:58.950 
particle will get a fraction of the

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.250 
particle will get a fraction of the
density<00:05:59.340> of<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.520> original<00:05:59.880> particle<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.690> if

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
density of the original particle and if

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.590 
density of the original particle and if
the<00:06:01.620> form<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.980> his<00:06:02.160> own<00:06:02.370> it<00:06:02.670> were<00:06:02.940> also<00:06:03.090> fall

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
the form of his own it were also fall

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.440 
the form of his own it were also fall
off<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:03.960> density<00:06:04.440> or<00:06:04.470> the<00:06:04.950> distance<00:06:05.280> so<00:06:06.270> it's

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
off the density or the distance so it's

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.650 
off the density or the distance so it's
actually<00:06:06.900> dealing<00:06:07.080> with<00:06:07.370> distributing<00:06:08.370> the

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
actually dealing with distributing the

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.630 
actually dealing with distributing the
wealth<00:06:09.660> of<00:06:09.990> density<00:06:10.590> of<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:11.250> original

wealth of density of the original

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.190 
wealth of density of the original
particle<00:06:11.880> system<00:06:12.270> stood<00:06:12.450> in<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.600> bottle<00:06:12.930> to<00:06:13.170> the

particle system stood in a bottle to the
new<00:06:13.380> particles<00:06:14.870> correctly<00:06:15.870> and<00:06:16.230> it<00:06:16.620> looks

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
new particles correctly and it looks

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.940 
new particles correctly and it looks
always<00:06:17.340> very<00:06:17.820> small
