could have sang with him and maybe he's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
could have sang with him and maybe he's
not<00:03:49.590> as<00:03:49.740> good<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.370> maybe<00:03:50.520> that<00:03:50.730> would<00:03:50.820> have

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
not as good so maybe that would have

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.030 
not as good so maybe that would have
been<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.060> better<00:03:51.330> strategy<00:03:51.690> but<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.770> was<00:03:52.860> still

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
been a better strategy but it was still

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.100 
been a better strategy but it was still
fun<00:03:53.250> that's<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> whatever<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.630> get<00:03:54.810> back
