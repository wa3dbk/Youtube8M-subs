what's going on right now we're just
going<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.440> at<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> hardware<00:00:13.950> outside

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
going to look at the hardware outside

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
going to look at the hardware outside
aspects<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:16.160> they're<00:00:17.160> very<00:00:17.340> similar<00:00:17.789> as

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
aspects of it they're very similar as

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.260 
aspects of it they're very similar as
you<00:00:18.779> can<00:00:18.930> see<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.500> Nexus<00:00:19.949> 7<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.460> actually<00:00:21.060> not

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
you can see the Nexus 7 is actually not

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.060 
you can see the Nexus 7 is actually not
as<00:00:21.449> wide<00:00:23.660> it's<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> little<00:00:25.050> bit<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.590> length<00:00:25.800> of

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
as wide it's a little bit the length of

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.300 
as wide it's a little bit the length of
it<00:00:26.279> all<00:00:26.789> depends<00:00:27.330> because<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.740> blackberry<00:00:29.220> is

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
it all depends because the blackberry is

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.339 
it all depends because the blackberry is
designed<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.880> be<00:00:30.000> looked<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.689> way<00:00:30.929> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
regards to nexus 7 since that's newer if

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.260 
regards to nexus 7 since that's newer if
we<00:00:41.969> line<00:00:42.180> these<00:00:42.420> up<00:00:43.070> the<00:00:44.070> nexus<00:00:44.399> 7<00:00:44.760> actually

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we line these up the nexus 7 actually

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.900 
we line these up the nexus 7 actually
protrudes<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.079> length<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.430> little

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
protrudes the length of it is a little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.270 
protrudes the length of it is a little
bit<00:00:48.180> wider<00:00:48.450> but<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.980> it's

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
bit wider but we can see it's

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.279 
bit wider but we can see it's
significant<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.570> width<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
significant the width of it

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.810 
significant the width of it
significantly<00:00:52.949> shorter<00:00:55.340> see<00:00:56.340> if<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.579> can't

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
significantly shorter see if we can't

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
significantly shorter see if we can't
try<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> get<00:00:59.300> right<00:01:00.300> there<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.809> about<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
try to get right there it's about the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.520 
try to get right there it's about the
same<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.219> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.600> blackberry

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
same but as you can see the blackberry

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.320 
same but as you can see the blackberry
here<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> very<00:01:06.799> rectangular<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> square

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
here is very rectangular a lot of square

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.350 
here is very rectangular a lot of square
edges<00:01:09.840> except<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> corners<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.790> even<00:01:12.060> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
edges except for the corners but even in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.200 
edges except for the corners but even in
the<00:01:12.479> back<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:13.320> very<00:01:13.530> rectangular<00:01:14.220> whereas

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the back it's very rectangular whereas

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.800 
the back it's very rectangular whereas
the<00:01:15.570> Nexus<00:01:16.259> 7<00:01:16.710> has<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:17.280> rounded<00:01:17.970> edges<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
the Nexus 7 has these rounded edges and

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.850 
the Nexus 7 has these rounded edges and
I<00:01:20.330> have<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.479> give<00:01:21.600> credit<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.200> nexus<00:01:22.560> 7

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
I have to give credit to the nexus 7

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.310 
I have to give credit to the nexus 7
because<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.280> easier<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.939> pick<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because it's easier to pick up this is a

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.170 
because it's easier to pick up this is a
little<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:25.920> harder<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.520> mean<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:26.909> give<00:01:27.060> you

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
little bit harder I mean they give you

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.480 
little bit harder I mean they give you
enough<00:01:27.450> room<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.020> grab<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.290> but<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:29.460> just

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
enough room to grab it but this is just

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
enough room to grab it but this is just
easier<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> pick<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.570> putting<00:01:30.990> your<00:01:31.140> fingers

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
easier to pick up putting your fingers

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.359 
easier to pick up putting your fingers
around<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:32.100> edge<00:01:34.490> obviously<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.360> screen<00:01:36.810> on

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
around that edge obviously the screen on

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.050 
around that edge obviously the screen on
here<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:39.360> lower<00:01:39.570> resolution<00:01:40.640> then<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
here is a lower resolution then the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.499 
here is a lower resolution then the
nexus<00:01:42.750> 7<00:01:43.170> screen<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:45.470> let's<00:01:47.119> let's<00:01:48.119> get<00:01:48.390> up

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
nexus 7 screen is so let's let's get up

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.420 
nexus 7 screen is so let's let's get up
to<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> home<00:01:49.049> screen<00:01:50.180> I'll<00:01:51.180> open<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.659> actor

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
to a home screen I'll open up the actor

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.810 
to a home screen I'll open up the actor
so<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.670> more<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:54.060> line<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.799> nexus<00:01:56.130> 7<00:01:56.460> screen

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
so it's more in line the nexus 7 screen

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.719 
so it's more in line the nexus 7 screen
is<00:01:57.119> an<00:01:57.450> HD<00:01:57.810> screen<00:01:58.399> 1280<00:01:59.399> x<00:01:59.850> 800<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.540> believe<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
is an HD screen 1280 x 800 I believe and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.760 
is an HD screen 1280 x 800 I believe and
this<00:02:02.729> is<00:02:03.590> 1060<00:02:04.590> x<00:02:04.740> 600<00:02:05.280> maybe<00:02:05.729> oh<00:02:06.380> I'll<00:02:07.380> put<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
this is 1060 x 600 maybe oh I'll put it

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.660 
this is 1060 x 600 maybe oh I'll put it
in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.330> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.750> video<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.770> exact<00:02:11.099> stats<00:02:11.459> of

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
in the in the video the exact stats of

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.570 
in the in the video the exact stats of
that

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
that

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.400 
that
so<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:13.210> screen<00:02:13.420> on<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.750> Nexus<00:02:14.050> 7<00:02:14.320> is

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
so the screen on the Nexus 7 is

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.160 
so the screen on the Nexus 7 is
definitely<00:02:14.890> better<00:02:15.660> there's<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.750> 3<00:02:16.990> megapixel

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
definitely better there's a 3 megapixel

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.400 
definitely better there's a 3 megapixel
front<00:02:17.860> camera<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.940> blackberry<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:20.230> 1

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
front camera on the blackberry and a 1

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.800 
front camera on the blackberry and a 1
point<00:02:20.590> 2<00:02:20.800> megapixel<00:02:21.460> on<00:02:21.580> this<00:02:21.790> one<00:02:21.970> however

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
point 2 megapixel on this one however

actually<00:02:29.170> better<00:02:29.440> video<00:02:29.830> quality<00:02:30.010> than<00:02:30.490> the

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
actually better video quality than the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.200 
actually better video quality than the
ipad<00:02:31.060> so<00:02:31.900> I'll<00:02:32.350> give<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.560> credit<00:02:32.950> on<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.210> the

ipad so I'll give it credit on that the
blackberry<00:02:34.690> does<00:02:34.900> come<00:02:35.200> with<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.190> back<00:02:36.400> facing

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
blackberry does come with a back facing

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.910 
blackberry does come with a back facing
camera<00:02:37.410> um<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:40.120> has<00:02:40.300> a<00:02:40.330> very<00:02:40.600> matte<00:02:41.290> feeling

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
camera um this has a very matte feeling

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.310 
camera um this has a very matte feeling
to<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.510> whereas<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.590> more<00:02:44.830> rubbery<00:02:45.220> and<00:02:46.320> I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
to it whereas this is more rubbery and I

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.680 
to it whereas this is more rubbery and I
have<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.620> say<00:02:47.650> the<00:02:48.420> blackberry<00:02:49.420> playbook

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
have to say the blackberry playbook

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.110 
have to say the blackberry playbook
actually<00:02:50.410> feels<00:02:50.740> like<00:02:50.950> it's<00:02:51.130> built<00:02:51.400> better<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
actually feels like it's built better it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.230 
actually feels like it's built better it
feels<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:53.680> feels<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:54.580> BlackBerry<00:02:55.060> PlayBook

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
feels it feels the BlackBerry PlayBook

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.660 
feels it feels the BlackBerry PlayBook
is<00:02:55.600> definitely<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.260> think<00:02:56.470> built<00:02:57.070> better<00:02:57.280> than

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
is definitely I think built better than

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.600 
is definitely I think built better than
the<00:02:57.880> ipad<00:02:58.560> even<00:02:59.560> without<00:02:59.860> having<00:03:00.340> like<00:03:00.490> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the ipad even without having like a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.600 
the ipad even without having like a
metal<00:03:00.940> casing<00:03:01.450> but<00:03:02.290> it<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.860> it's<00:03:03.160> sturdy

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
metal casing but it just it's sturdy

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.800 
metal casing but it just it's sturdy
where<00:03:04.540> is<00:03:04.720> this<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:06.550> feels<00:03:06.760> good<00:03:07.150> but<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.510> still

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
where is this it feels good but it still

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.699 
where is this it feels good but it still
feels<00:03:08.230> almost<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.700> cheaper<00:03:10.120> quality

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
feels almost like a cheaper quality

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.050 
feels almost like a cheaper quality
which<00:03:11.709> I<00:03:11.830> mean<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.250> two<00:03:12.459> hundred<00:03:12.490> dollars

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
which I mean it is two hundred dollars

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.690 
which I mean it is two hundred dollars
compared<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.780> well<00:03:14.470> now<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:15.040> 200<00:03:15.550> but<00:03:15.670> I

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
compared to well now this is 200 but I

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.830 
compared to well now this is 200 but I
think<00:03:15.940> it<00:03:16.030> started<00:03:16.209> out<00:03:16.390> at<00:03:16.540> four<00:03:16.780> hunter<00:03:17.519> but

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
think it started out at four hunter but

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.210 
think it started out at four hunter but
this<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.110> feels<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.500> little<00:03:20.650> cheaper<00:03:21.100> than

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
this just feels a little cheaper than

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.400 
this just feels a little cheaper than
the<00:03:21.280> blackberry<00:03:21.580> playbook<00:03:22.120> so<00:03:22.989> I<00:03:23.019> have<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
the blackberry playbook so I have to

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.470 
the blackberry playbook so I have to
give<00:03:23.530> it<00:03:23.650> that<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:24.880> blackberry<00:03:25.300> playbook

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
give it that the blackberry playbook

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.240 
give it that the blackberry playbook
comes<00:03:25.930> with<00:03:26.080> a<00:03:26.110> 1<00:03:26.560> gigahertz<00:03:26.890> dual-core

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
comes with a 1 gigahertz dual-core

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.430 
comes with a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.330> is<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.480> 1.2<00:03:29.110> gigahertz

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
processor this is a 1.2 gigahertz

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.430 
processor this is a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core<00:03:30.030> processor<00:03:31.030> both<00:03:31.810> have<00:03:32.019> a<00:03:32.050> gig<00:03:32.290> of

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
quad-core processor both have a gig of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.160 
quad-core processor both have a gig of
ram<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.730> they're<00:03:34.120> pretty<00:03:34.330> close<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.959> one's

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
ram so they're pretty close this one's

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.130 
ram so they're pretty close this one's
when<00:03:35.739> it<00:03:35.860> comes<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:37.239> software<00:03:37.720> features

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
when it comes to the software features

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.250 
when it comes to the software features
of<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.709> runs<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.130> lot<00:03:39.250> better<00:03:39.630> i<00:03:40.630> think

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
of this this runs a lot better i think

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.190 
of this this runs a lot better i think
the<00:03:41.670> PlayBook<00:03:42.670> has<00:03:43.360> a<00:03:43.390> few<00:03:43.750> better<00:03:43.930> features

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the PlayBook has a few better features

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.380 
the PlayBook has a few better features
like<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.310> guess<00:03:45.519> if<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.820> like<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.209> take

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
like I guess if you like to take

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.660 
like I guess if you like to take
pictures<00:03:46.630> with<00:03:46.989> your<00:03:47.230> tablet<00:03:48.190> with<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.459> back

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
pictures with your tablet with that back

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.390 
pictures with your tablet with that back
facing<00:03:49.120> camera<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.720> don't<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.800> don't<00:03:50.830> really<00:03:51.220> see

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
facing camera I don't I don't really see

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.940 
facing camera I don't I don't really see
the<00:03:51.430> reason<00:03:51.880> for<00:03:52.209> it<00:03:52.739> so<00:03:55.230> there's<00:03:56.230> odds<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
the reason for it so there's odds and

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.850 
the reason for it so there's odds and
ends<00:03:57.250> but<00:03:57.750> that's<00:03:58.750> just<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.110> first<00:03:59.140> hardware

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
ends but that's just the first hardware

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.570 
ends but that's just the first hardware
