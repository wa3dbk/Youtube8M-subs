around this sewing machine so that it

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.969 
around this sewing machine so that it
should<00:04:39.490> be<00:04:39.970> cut<00:04:40.210> to<00:04:40.690> fit<00:04:40.930> perfectly<00:04:41.470> and<00:04:41.830> just

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
should be cut to fit perfectly and just

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.350 
should be cut to fit perfectly and just
get<00:04:42.160> your<00:04:42.250> folds<00:04:42.610> going<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:42.940> right<00:04:43.060> way

adhesives<00:05:07.060> on<00:05:07.210> this<00:05:07.389> piece<00:05:07.990> here<00:05:08.610> that's

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
adhesives on this piece here that's

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.159 
adhesives on this piece here that's
gonna<00:05:09.820> be<00:05:10.000> hard<00:05:10.180> to<00:05:10.270> do<00:05:10.419> with<00:05:10.570> my<00:05:10.690> tape<00:05:10.960> runner

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
gonna be hard to do with my tape runner

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.510 
gonna be hard to do with my tape runner
now<00:05:11.349> so<00:05:11.560> I'm<00:05:11.620> just<00:05:11.770> gonna<00:05:11.889> use<00:05:12.099> a<00:05:12.130> little<00:05:12.220> bit

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
now so I'm just gonna use a little bit

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.570 
now so I'm just gonna use a little bit
of<00:05:12.580> liquid<00:05:13.000> glue<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:14.340> so<00:05:15.340> then<00:05:15.460> I'll<00:05:15.550> just

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
of liquid glue on that so then I'll just

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.779 
of liquid glue on that so then I'll just
take<00:05:15.849> my<00:05:15.909> in<00:05:16.180> front<00:05:16.419> of<00:05:16.509> my<00:05:17.520> sewing<00:05:18.520> machine

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
take my in front of my sewing machine

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:22.830 
take my in front of my sewing machine
and<00:05:18.909> just<00:05:19.470> wrap<00:05:20.470> that<00:05:20.500> around<00:05:21.659> actually<00:05:22.659> I

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
and just wrap that around actually I

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.210 
and just wrap that around actually I
guess<00:05:23.020> this<00:05:23.169> is<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.349> back<00:05:23.680> of<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:23.919> sewing

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
guess this is the back of the sewing

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.659 
guess this is the back of the sewing
machine

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
machine

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:29.310 
machine
technically<00:05:27.479> wrap<00:05:28.479> that<00:05:28.659> around<00:05:28.690> and<00:05:29.169> just

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
technically wrap that around and just

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.820 
technically wrap that around and just
glue<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:29.949> right<00:05:30.220> down<00:05:30.750> yeah<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.050> then<00:05:32.349> we'll

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
glue that right down yeah and then we'll

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.230 
glue that right down yeah and then we'll
stand<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.250> up<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.520> you're<00:05:33.699> looking<00:05:34.030> at<00:05:34.150> the

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
stand it up and you're looking at the

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.120 
stand it up and you're looking at the
front<00:05:34.419> of<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.659> sewing<00:05:34.900> machine<00:05:35.259> there<00:05:35.530> and

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
front of the sewing machine there and

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.920 
front of the sewing machine there and
the<00:05:36.400> little<00:05:36.639> top<00:05:37.120> just<00:05:37.449> tucks<00:05:37.870> in<00:05:38.250> like<00:05:39.250> that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
the little top just tucks in like that

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.779 
the little top just tucks in like that
okay<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:40.960> the<00:05:41.320> last<00:05:41.349> few<00:05:41.770> steps<00:05:42.130> you<00:05:42.400> have<00:05:42.430> to

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
okay so the last few steps you have to
