tempo<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.670> can<00:01:34.940> subdivide<00:01:35.300> into<00:01:35.810> sixteenth

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
tempo I can subdivide into sixteenth

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.320 
tempo I can subdivide into sixteenth
notes<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.670> the<00:01:37.820> tempo<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.420> this<00:01:40.210> but<00:01:41.210> I'm

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
notes so the tempo is this but I'm

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.400 
notes so the tempo is this but I'm
hearing<00:01:41.800> hesitant<00:01:42.800> it<00:01:43.390> doesn't<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:45.200> I<00:01:45.229> can

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
hearing hesitant it doesn't it so I can

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.130 
hearing hesitant it doesn't it so I can
take<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.710> cord<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.130> then<00:01:46.940> hit<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.540> rest<00:01:47.840> in

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
take the cord and then hit the rest in

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.779 
take the cord and then hit the rest in
time<00:01:53.710> notice<00:01:54.710> I'm<00:01:54.800> using<00:01:54.890> the<00:01:55.130> volume<00:01:55.280> knob<00:01:55.580> to

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
time notice I'm using the volume knob to

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.400 
time notice I'm using the volume knob to
turn<00:01:55.940> off<00:01:56.119> the<00:01:56.330> rhythm<00:01:56.810> especially<00:01:57.020> with

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
turn off the rhythm especially with

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.380 
turn off the rhythm especially with
metal<00:01:57.770> guitar<00:01:58.070> tone<00:01:58.250> because<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.610> can<00:01:59.060> be<00:01:59.180> very

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
metal guitar tone because it can be very

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:09.109 
metal guitar tone because it can be very
loud<00:01:59.570> and<00:01:59.869> noisy
