but<00:05:12.260> oh<00:05:12.670> well<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:15.850> think<00:05:17.170> these<00:05:18.170> guys<00:05:18.530> you<00:05:18.830> can't

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
but oh well I think these guys you can't

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.260 
but oh well I think these guys you can't
really<00:05:21.130> counter<00:05:22.130> attack<00:05:22.370> them<00:05:22.610> you<00:05:22.910> can<00:05:23.090> only

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
really counter attack them you can only

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.380 
really counter attack them you can only
you<00:05:23.630> can<00:05:23.860> disarm<00:05:24.860> them<00:05:25.220> or<00:05:25.490> counter<00:05:26.030> the<00:05:26.150> song

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
you can disarm them or counter the song

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.920 
you can disarm them or counter the song
which<00:05:27.490> then<00:05:28.490> you<00:05:28.640> can<00:05:28.880> start<00:05:29.180> doing<00:05:29.390> a<00:05:29.570> combo

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
which then you can start doing a combo

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.530 
which then you can start doing a combo
about<00:05:30.380> only<00:05:30.890> sometimes<00:05:31.370> does<00:05:31.910> it<00:05:32.030> work<00:05:32.210> on

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
about only sometimes does it work on

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.950 
about only sometimes does it work on
like<00:05:33.080> joining<00:05:33.800> a<00:05:34.010> killstreak<00:05:34.910> but<00:05:35.630> i'm<00:05:35.780> not

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
like joining a killstreak but i'm not

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.410 
like joining a killstreak but i'm not
sure<00:05:36.230> but<00:05:36.640> just<00:05:37.640> sometimes<00:05:37.910> it<00:05:38.240> works

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
sure but just sometimes it works

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.260 
sure but just sometimes it works
sometimes<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:38.900> doesn't<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:40.820> can<00:05:41.030> dodge

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
sometimes it doesn't and you can dodge

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.390 
sometimes it doesn't and you can dodge
when<00:05:41.840> it's<00:05:42.020> got<00:05:42.440> that<00:05:42.680> yellow<00:05:43.070> marker<00:05:43.550> on<00:05:45.400> but

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
when it's got that yellow marker on but

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.700 
when it's got that yellow marker on but
you<00:05:46.970> can't<00:05:47.240> really<00:05:47.390> it's<00:05:47.900> not<00:05:48.020> necessarily<00:05:48.680> a

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
you can't really it's not necessarily a

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.810 
you can't really it's not necessarily a
sign<00:05:48.770> of<00:05:49.160> Dodge<00:05:49.340> button<00:05:49.790> you<00:05:50.540> basically<00:05:51.820> get

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:52.820 
sign of Dodge button you basically get

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.760 
sign of Dodge button you basically get
in<00:05:53.000> touch<00:05:53.210> about<00:05:53.360> not<00:05:53.870> when<00:05:54.140> it<00:05:54.260> basically

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
in touch about not when it basically

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:58.240 
in touch about not when it basically
tells<00:05:55.070> you<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.490> you<00:05:56.060> can<00:05:56.270> only<00:05:56.420> do<00:05:56.690> it<00:05:57.250> so

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
tells you to you can only do it so

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.760 
tells you to you can only do it so
