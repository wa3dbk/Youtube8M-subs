the<00:04:07.810> bottom<00:04:08.140> is<00:04:08.320> a<00:04:08.590> 16<00:04:09.400> gauge<00:04:09.670> okay<00:04:10.630> which<00:04:11.350> is<00:04:11.680> a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
the bottom is a 16 gauge okay which is a

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.729 
the bottom is a 16 gauge okay which is a
step<00:04:12.459> down<00:04:12.610> from<00:04:12.700> the<00:04:12.880> 14<00:04:13.209> I<00:04:13.360> chose<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:14.049> 16<00:04:14.560> as

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
step down from the 14 I chose the 16 as

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.760 
step down from the 14 I chose the 16 as
a<00:04:14.769> second<00:04:15.370> because<00:04:16.090> I<00:04:16.630> didn't<00:04:16.959> want<00:04:17.200> to<00:04:17.320> 14

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
a second because I didn't want to 14

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.839 
a second because I didn't want to 14
gauges<00:04:18.039> to<00:04:18.070> be<00:04:18.220> on<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.370> map<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.580> just<00:04:18.609> thought

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:18.849 
gauges to be on the map I just thought

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.349 
gauges to be on the map I just thought
it<00:04:19.000> would<00:04:19.090> take<00:04:19.239> up<00:04:19.330> too<00:04:19.359> much<00:04:19.479> space

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
it would take up too much space

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.020 
it would take up too much space
so<00:04:20.599> that's<00:04:20.930> why<00:04:21.319> I<00:04:21.349> have<00:04:21.919> different<00:04:22.729> gauges

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
so that's why I have different gauges

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.649 
so that's why I have different gauges
and<00:04:23.800> or<00:04:24.800> as<00:04:25.009> tongues<00:04:25.550> goes<00:04:26.120> you<00:04:26.300> can<00:04:26.479> actually

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
and or as tongues goes you can actually

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.990 
and or as tongues goes you can actually
use<00:04:27.500> or<00:04:28.099> have<00:04:28.969> different<00:04:29.180> types<00:04:29.629> of

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
use or have different types of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.820 
use or have different types of
placements<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.719> doesn't<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.229> to<00:04:33.409> be<00:04:33.530> down

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
placements it doesn't have to be down

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.170 
placements it doesn't have to be down
the<00:04:33.949> center<00:04:34.189> like<00:04:34.400> mine<00:04:34.550> that's<00:04:34.759> just<00:04:35.000> what<00:04:35.150> I
