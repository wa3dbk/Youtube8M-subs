00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.160 
doing I got in the arrow one of them
broke<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:27.409> started<00:01:28.409> floating<00:01:28.679> around<00:01:33.170> I'm

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
broke and started floating around I'm

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.080 
broke and started floating around I'm
still<00:01:34.590> every<00:01:35.009> night<00:01:35.479> hey<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.689> was<00:01:37.340> on<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
still every night hey this was on and

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.990 
still every night hey this was on and
these<00:01:39.600> uh<00:01:40.100> rolls<00:01:42.709> me<00:01:43.709> biggest<00:01:44.189> concern<00:01:44.700> is

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
these uh rolls me biggest concern is

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.120 
these uh rolls me biggest concern is
this<00:01:45.240> year<00:01:46.009> because<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.310> slider<00:01:47.729> damaged

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
this year because that slider damaged

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.440 
this year because that slider damaged
came<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.610> started<00:01:51.299> floating<00:01:51.569> around<00:01:53.450> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
came in here started floating around and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.169 
came in here started floating around and
one<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:54.959> yep<00:01:55.200> I'm<00:01:56.009> guessing<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.880> it's

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
one this yep I'm guessing that it's

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.679 
one this yep I'm guessing that it's
going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.569> unevenly<00:01:58.140> weighted<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
going to be unevenly weighted and with

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.180 
going to be unevenly weighted and with
it<00:02:00.840> being<00:02:01.079> unweighted<00:02:02.750> like<00:02:03.750> not<00:02:03.989> balanced

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.360 

what<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.369> kind<00:02:08.579> of<00:02:08.640> eventual<00:02:09.239> he<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.630> is<00:02:10.370> trying

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
what is kind of eventual he do is trying

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.309 
what is kind of eventual he do is trying
for<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.030> these<00:02:12.150> orders<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.930> he<00:02:13.049> was

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
for in one of these orders and he was

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:21.690 
for in one of these orders and he was
like<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.500> seems<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:13.980> was<00:02:14.069> informed<00:02:14.400> one

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.390 

maybe<00:02:22.700> their<00:02:22.970> ivory<00:02:24.010> yeah<00:02:25.010> oh<00:02:25.040> yeah<00:02:27.340> these<00:02:28.340> are
