here<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.429> demonstrate<00:00:02.899> the

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
here I'm going to demonstrate the

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.380 
here I'm going to demonstrate the
blowing<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.620> Christmas<00:00:05.339> ball<00:00:05.580> ornament<00:00:06.210> in

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
blowing of Christmas ball ornament in

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.140 
blowing of Christmas ball ornament in
under<00:00:06.930> three<00:00:07.259> minutes<00:00:07.470> using<00:00:08.460> my<00:00:08.639> small

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
under three minutes using my small

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.830 
under three minutes using my small
electric<00:00:09.840> furnace<00:00:10.230> design<00:00:10.679> first<00:00:11.670> I'll<00:00:11.940> film

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
electric furnace design first I'll film

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.410 
electric furnace design first I'll film
it<00:00:13.019> complete<00:00:13.650> from<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.280> distance<00:00:14.730> showing<00:00:15.210> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
it complete from a distance showing the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.019 
it complete from a distance showing the
whole<00:00:15.690> process<00:00:16.320> and<00:00:16.590> then<00:00:17.190> I'll<00:00:17.369> zoom<00:00:17.670> in<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
whole process and then I'll zoom in and

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:54.620 
whole process and then I'll zoom in and
show<00:00:18.270> each<00:00:18.570> stage<00:00:18.990> separately

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.990 

because<00:00:55.380> of<00:00:55.560> the<00:00:55.710> way<00:00:56.220> the<00:00:56.370> gathering<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.790> done

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
because of the way the gathering is done

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.260 
because of the way the gathering is done
from<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.329> furnace<00:00:57.720> I<00:00:58.130> can<00:00:59.130> hold<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.120> down

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
from the furnace I can hold it down

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.090 
from the furnace I can hold it down
through<00:01:00.540> both<00:01:00.750> here<00:01:01.140> yeah<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:01.920> I'm

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
through both here yeah right here I'm

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.219 
through both here yeah right here I'm
beginning<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.520> feel<00:01:02.820> heat<00:01:03.150> so<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.989> amazing

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
beginning to feel heat so it's amazing

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
beginning to feel heat so it's amazing
how<00:01:04.559> cool<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> blow<00:01:05.220> pipes<00:01:05.519> stay

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 

if<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.600> little<00:01:30.750> bit<00:01:31.080> soft<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.280> give<00:01:32.490> it

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
if it's a little bit soft I just give it

00:01:32.640 --> 00:02:01.969 
if it's a little bit soft I just give it
a<00:01:32.700> minute<00:01:32.880> or<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:33.300> before<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.500> start<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:35.040> inflate

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.550 

if<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.520> winds<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.970> not<00:02:03.030> being<00:02:03.420> round<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.409> can

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
if it winds up not being round you can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.109 
if it winds up not being round you can
flow<00:02:04.830> in<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> down<00:02:05.280> direction<00:02:05.310> which

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
flow in the down direction which

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:14.000 
flow in the down direction which
inflates<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.720> downward<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:12.590> if<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.739> becomes

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
inflates it downward and if it becomes

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.650 
inflates it downward and if it becomes
too<00:02:14.190> elongated<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.780> flow<00:02:15.989> up<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:17.660> that

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
too elongated you can flow up and that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.510 
too elongated you can flow up and that
will<00:02:18.720> bring<00:02:18.989> it<00:02:19.050> back<00:02:19.170> down<00:02:19.709> again<00:02:19.770> into<00:02:20.489> a

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
will bring it back down again into a

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.350 
will bring it back down again into a
circle<00:02:24.890> but<00:02:25.890> there's<00:02:26.069> no<00:02:26.340> need<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.819> ever<00:02:27.000> touch

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
circle but there's no need to ever touch

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.540 
circle but there's no need to ever touch
the<00:02:27.600> outside<00:02:27.750> of<00:02:28.200> this<00:02:28.380> while<00:02:28.830> inflating<00:02:29.430> it

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
the outside of this while inflating it

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.110 
the outside of this while inflating it
with<00:02:30.000> any<00:02:30.180> kind<00:02:30.420> of<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.690> block<00:02:30.989> or<00:02:31.290> tool<00:02:32.120> because

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
with any kind of a block or tool because

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.300 
with any kind of a block or tool because
gravity<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:33.870> rotation<00:02:34.590> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.069> get<00:02:35.280> a

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
gravity and rotation you can get a

00:02:35.310 --> 00:03:10.849 
gravity and rotation you can get a
perfect<00:02:35.880> circle<00:02:36.269> almost<00:02:36.600> every<00:02:36.840> time

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.589 

the<00:03:11.859> first<00:03:12.099> thing<00:03:12.310> I<00:03:12.400> do<00:03:12.459> is<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.879> placement<00:03:13.209> of

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
the first thing I do is the placement of

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.490 
the first thing I do is the placement of
the<00:03:13.810> colors<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.370> furnace<00:03:16.290> while<00:03:17.290> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
the colors in the furnace while the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.399 
the colors in the furnace while the
colors<00:03:18.280> are<00:03:18.489> melting<00:03:18.939> I<00:03:19.120> take<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.200> first

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
colors are melting I take the first

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.940 
colors are melting I take the first
gather<00:03:20.829> a<00:03:21.780> square<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.810> glass<00:03:23.200> about<00:03:23.650> an<00:03:23.799> inch

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
gather a square of glass about an inch

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.429 
gather a square of glass about an inch
and<00:03:24.159> a<00:03:24.189> half<00:03:24.219> square<00:03:24.909> and<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.989> would<00:03:26.139> be<00:03:26.230> used

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
and a half square and this would be used

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:35.640 
and a half square and this would be used
to<00:03:26.590> color<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.099> entire<00:03:27.459> gather<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.200> while<00:03:35.469> it's

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
to color the entire gather so while it's

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:54.100 
to color the entire gather so while it's
melting<00:03:35.859> I'll<00:03:36.310> take<00:03:36.939> the<00:03:37.120> first<00:03:37.329> gather

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.620 

as<00:03:54.170> I<00:03:54.830> start<00:03:55.100> to<00:03:55.220> blow<00:03:55.430> the<00:03:55.640> bubble<00:03:55.970> I<00:03:56.060> cool<00:03:56.390> the

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
as I start to blow the bubble I cool the

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.780 
as I start to blow the bubble I cool the
sides<00:03:56.930> of<00:03:57.170> the<00:03:57.260> bubble<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.830> way<00:03:58.490> the

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
sides of the bubble and that way the

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.610 
sides of the bubble and that way the
pressure<00:03:59.030> elongates<00:03:59.930> through<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.350> soft

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
pressure elongates through the soft

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.410 
pressure elongates through the soft
glass<00:04:00.980> at<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.370> end<00:04:03.040> there<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.340> it's<00:04:04.490> it's

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
glass at the end there so it's it's

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.350 
glass at the end there so it's it's
fully<00:04:05.750> inflated<00:04:06.410> now<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.890> hold<00:04:07.670> my<00:04:07.820> thumb<00:04:08.120> up

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
fully inflated now and hold my thumb up

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.660 
fully inflated now and hold my thumb up
here<00:04:08.570> for<00:04:08.810> comparison<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.740> it's<00:04:10.250> about<00:04:10.490> the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
here for comparison so it's about the

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.990 
here for comparison so it's about the
diameter<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.210> a<00:04:11.390> wine<00:04:11.600> cork<00:04:12.020> and<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:13.370> entire

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
diameter of a wine cork and the entire

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.910 
diameter of a wine cork and the entire
length<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:14.780> gather<00:04:14.990> on<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.410> rod<00:04:15.620> is

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
length of the gather on the rod is

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.620 
length of the gather on the rod is
probably<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.370> length<00:04:16.549> of<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.760> wine<00:04:16.970> cork<00:04:17.359> but

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
probably the length of the wine cork but

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.120 
probably the length of the wine cork but
of<00:04:17.750> course<00:04:17.989> only<00:04:18.140> half<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.799> is<00:04:18.980> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
of course only half of that is the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.030 
of course only half of that is the
usable<00:04:19.579> area<00:04:20.079> now<00:04:21.079> I'll<00:04:21.230> go<00:04:21.350> in<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.709> pick<00:04:21.920> up

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
usable area now I'll go in and pick up

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.130 
usable area now I'll go in and pick up
the<00:04:22.190> colors<00:04:22.520> and<00:04:22.760> take<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.210> second<00:04:23.570> gather

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.570 

now<00:04:27.140> it's<00:04:27.320> a<00:04:27.410> little<00:04:27.650> looks<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:27.950> little<00:04:28.040> bit<00:04:28.280> big

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
now it's a little looks a little bit big

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.460 
now it's a little looks a little bit big
so<00:04:28.880> what<00:04:29.030> I'll<00:04:29.150> do<00:04:29.360> is<00:04:29.390> I'll<00:04:29.720> plunge<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.230> down<00:04:30.440> a

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
so what I'll do is I'll plunge it down a

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.040 
so what I'll do is I'll plunge it down a
little<00:04:30.890> deeper<00:04:31.310> than<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.550> need<00:04:31.820> to<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:32.720> ensure

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
little deeper than I need to to ensure

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:42.180 
little deeper than I need to to ensure
that<00:04:33.080> I<00:04:33.290> take<00:04:33.620> all<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.160> color<00:04:34.370> out<00:04:34.460> of<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.700> pot

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.220 

stage<00:04:43.190> I'll<00:04:43.430> show<00:04:43.700> is<00:04:44.000> the<00:04:44.390> plunging<00:04:44.960> in<00:04:45.080> the

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
stage I'll show is the plunging in the

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:48.010 
stage I'll show is the plunging in the
optic<00:04:45.620> mold<00:04:46.120> immediately<00:04:47.120> after<00:04:47.480> the<00:04:47.600> second

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
optic mold immediately after the second

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:55.330 
optic mold immediately after the second
gathers<00:04:48.410> being<00:04:48.710> marvered<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.310> little<00:04:49.580> bit<00:04:54.340> see

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
gathers being marvered a little bit see

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.100 
gathers being marvered a little bit see
there<00:04:55.520> is<00:04:55.610> a<00:04:55.640> small<00:04:56.360> amount<00:04:56.840> of<00:04:56.960> adjustment

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
there is a small amount of adjustment

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:12.159 
there is a small amount of adjustment
you<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.650> make<00:04:58.010> while<00:04:58.490> pressing<00:04:59.200> to<00:05:00.200> center<00:05:00.620> it

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.129 

the<00:05:13.169> smaller<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:14.070> diameter<00:05:14.730> is<00:05:14.910> at<00:05:15.870> the

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
the smaller that diameter is at the

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.189 
the smaller that diameter is at the
beginning<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:17.490> better<00:05:17.729> because<00:05:18.270> it<00:05:18.720> makes<00:05:19.020> a

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
beginning the better because it makes a

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.320 
beginning the better because it makes a
much<00:05:19.380> smaller<00:05:19.830> hole<00:05:20.220> you<00:05:20.460> have<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.760> cover<00:05:20.970> with

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
much smaller hole you have to cover with

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:53.989 
much smaller hole you have to cover with
the<00:05:21.510> cow

00:05:53.989 --> 00:05:53.999 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:56.329 

by<00:05:54.539> rotating<00:05:55.019> it<00:05:55.259> while<00:05:55.409> blowing<00:05:55.739> it's<00:05:56.099> easy

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
by rotating it while blowing it's easy

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:58.850 
by rotating it while blowing it's easy
to<00:05:56.639> get<00:05:56.909> it<00:05:57.059> fairly<00:05:57.449> well<00:05:57.599> centered<00:05:58.199> on<00:05:58.589> the

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
to get it fairly well centered on the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.819 
to get it fairly well centered on the
pipe<00:05:59.719> even<00:06:00.719> if<00:06:00.809> the<00:06:00.959> gathers<00:06:01.349> a<00:06:01.379> little<00:06:01.649> bit

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:01.829 
pipe even if the gathers a little bit

00:06:01.829 --> 00:06:30.659 
pipe even if the gathers a little bit
lopsided

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:33.249 

so<00:06:31.669> I<00:06:31.699> press<00:06:31.969> it<00:06:32.120> down<00:06:32.270> to<00:06:32.330> cover<00:06:32.719> the<00:06:32.900> entire

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259 
so I press it down to cover the entire

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:38.700 
so I press it down to cover the entire
hole<00:06:34.539> move<00:06:35.539> it<00:06:35.689> over<00:06:35.900> to<00:06:36.050> one<00:06:36.169> side<00:06:37.419> lift<00:06:38.419> up

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
hole move it over to one side lift up

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.420 
hole move it over to one side lift up
and<00:06:39.710> cut<00:06:40.340> it<00:06:40.460> off<00:06:41.229> and<00:06:42.229> then<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.770> very<00:06:43.159> carefully

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
and cut it off and then I very carefully

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.529 
and cut it off and then I very carefully
take<00:06:43.879> that<00:06:44.150> piece<00:06:44.590> curl<00:06:45.590> it<00:06:45.800> over<00:06:46.069> and<00:06:46.389> jam<00:06:47.389> it

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:47.539 
take that piece curl it over and jam it

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:51.279 
take that piece curl it over and jam it
down<00:06:47.569> into<00:06:47.930> the<00:06:48.139> hot<00:06:48.349> glass<00:06:48.979> and<00:06:49.930> then<00:06:50.930> I<00:06:50.960> lift

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.289 
down into the hot glass and then I lift

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:53.230 
down into the hot glass and then I lift
the<00:06:51.439> entire<00:06:51.770> thing<00:06:52.069> up<00:06:52.219> from<00:06:52.639> the<00:06:52.939> scissor

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 
the entire thing up from the scissor

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.980 
the entire thing up from the scissor
blade<00:06:53.479> and<00:06:53.810> put<00:06:54.259> it<00:06:54.349> in<00:06:54.409> the<00:06:54.499> annealer<00:06:55.900> so<00:06:56.900> it

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
blade and put it in the annealer so it

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.290 
blade and put it in the annealer so it
takes<00:06:57.169> me<00:06:57.289> about<00:06:57.349> four<00:06:57.770> hours<00:06:57.949> a<00:06:58.159> day<00:06:58.310> to<00:06:59.090> make
