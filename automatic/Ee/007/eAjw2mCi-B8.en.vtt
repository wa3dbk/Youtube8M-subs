00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
we go here turn the key once turn the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.990 
we go here turn the key once turn the
key<00:01:21.310> twice

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
key twice

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
codes appear there you go 1 1 / 5 13 517

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.290 
codes appear there you go 1 1 / 5 13 517
1<00:01:31.540> 5<00:01:31.840> 2<00:01:32.140> then<00:01:32.830> when<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.100> goes<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:33.250> 0<00:01:33.640> 0<00:01:33.909> 0<00:01:34.060> like
