00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.190
 I general of the flying squadron 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.379
 independent I bow I am always at 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.210
 his complete order service 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.210
 make yourself comfortable overall 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.820
 we know he suffered a defeat 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:21.510
 how spectacular general is not as it is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.970
 our area went very well due 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.660
 his I lost two manipulators of shadows is 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.400
 in the leg 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:33.149
 the rest has always been a great one 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.710
 fighter the great and general logos 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.050
 who cared so much about being the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.570
 first of the class as step chapters 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.140
 but if you look at it, it's not left either 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.500
 the shadow of the hero of the past 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.050
 you talked too much logos yes 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.600
 sir for what concerns the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.059
 other brats too have become 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 strong true certain gentleman is the new 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.170
 power amplifier was designed 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 to defeat them but they have occurred 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.210
 some side effects on mine 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.949
 men 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.809
 besides the boys in front of a force 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.890
 superior have managed to increase the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.070
 their 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.870
 I'm afraid I've disappointed you sir already 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.760
 decides to punish him I have to punish him like that 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:22.340
 great will be a bad example that everything 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:25.460
 the army 6 maybe you're right logos and 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.170
 now that you take a break 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.850
 give yourself some time to ponder 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.670
 your next move 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.300
 go and think about your future 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.300
 agree 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.120
 general hate his fan of wind 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.160
 in the last mission he demoralized 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.810
 all the army of the dear not real e 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.970
 since the responsibility is his 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.610
 the squadron's command will be given 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.380
 independent donor will be shipped to the 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.310
 continent taken a garrison of 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.890
 unplug what not put me aside 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:02.050
 well this will further facilitate the 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.530
 my plan the days of glory are over 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.530
 the eyes 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.060
 [Music] 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.290
 what do you say about it? 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.290
 that we are on the right path 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.129
 [Music] 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:48.750
 [Music] 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.759
 thank you so much raw 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.759
 [Music] 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:17.199
 [Music] 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.879
 maya that hurt 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.910
 is you then considering that they are the 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.200
 extra 7 the thing goes as planned 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.110
 by this I mean that it will not be 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.950
 it is not at all easy to dissolve the riddle 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:05.930
 I understand but you are thinking of nothing 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.520
 but I can assure you that you have everything 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.050
 my admiration thank you show but 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.780
 the truth is that I do all this alone 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.790
 because I believe he does not deserve praise for 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.340
 something that comes naturally to me though 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.230
 you believe he didn't say it's easy no 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.709
 it's true but you don't engage when you hold 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.709
 to something 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.210
 sure or at least I try 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.220
 now there is no talk 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.770
 time to lose go to wake up the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.260
 others please want to succeed I will have 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:48.390
 need everyone's help 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:51.519
 then i 'm running well, we're all here now 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.519
 [Music] 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.930
 what are copies of the exact extra 7 ea 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.420
 apparently they seem to have already been translated 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.700
 first chapter and defending warrior 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.740
 the west emerges from the forest unfolds 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.310
 with a serene eye and finally comes out to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.620
 discovered 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.690
 a light shines in the hour of silence 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.670
 crimson and from the guardian of the sky 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.400
 a new shadow is born which indicates the 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:16.140
 street what it means and weird the 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.710
 mine looks like a fairy tale or something of 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.530
 gender 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.950
 I only have a long list of numbers and 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:24.360
 I have drawings as you can see ho 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.610
 did my best to translate 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.200
 the extra 7 in our language 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.000
 and while I was transcribing them I tried to 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:33.270
 understand the hidden meaning between the 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.980
 But there are lines that failed 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.660
 what we need is hidden in one of these 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.080
 texts just find the reading key 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.700
 and the mystery is solved so please 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.070
 make every effort to see what 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.280
 is behind those pages and if you find out 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:49.170
 something fit themes immediately agree 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.850
 but rowe giola really think that 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.230
 we will understand what you don't have 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.840
 could you understand 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:56.580
 but of course keep in mind one thing 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.350
 document in your hand contains 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.300
 information about your shadow 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:02.040
 that you obviously know a lot 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.310
 better than me so there should be 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.170
 simpler to perceive strength boys 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:08.790
 let's get down to it if we don't understand the 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.540
 meaning of the text we will never be able to 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:14.220
 defeat neither in their good 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.290
 let's get to work we don't lose any more 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.730
 last time a commission charged 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:28.560
 wait if you want I'll give you a hand with the 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:31.050
 text already weighs like a boulder on it 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.180
 stuff and then send us to get it 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.340
 by not complaining, everyone is his task 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.610
 and this is not worse than others 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:42.510
 you say because it is the lightest basket 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:44.780
 has an idea how about making one 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.780
 deviation 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.680
 we spend hours in one 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.270
 dusty library sometimes it takes 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:56.390
 a break 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.390
 [Music] 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.250
 great idea is funny when we were at 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.040
 home we did all the things 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:08.810
 days but now they become important is 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.730
 absolutely true 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.380
 who could imagine that it would go 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:16.610
 to end up like this the first time we have 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:19.700
 met area you still remember that 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:22.900
 day I just wanted to protect the 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.900
 others nothing more
