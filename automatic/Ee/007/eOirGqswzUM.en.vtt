very crappy design of a balsa wood case
and<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:52.560> i'm<00:01:52.649> going<00:01:52.859> to<00:01:52.950> do<00:01:53.130> is<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.460> power<00:01:53.640> up

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
and what i'm going to do is to power up

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.649 
and what i'm going to do is to power up
the<00:01:53.909> camera<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> USB<00:01:54.929> port<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:56.570> here<00:01:57.570> we

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the camera of the USB port and here we

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.239 
the camera of the USB port and here we
go<00:02:00.289> then<00:02:01.289> we<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.649> immediately<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:02.249 
go then we see immediately the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.590 
go then we see immediately the
stereoscopic<00:02:03.649> output<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.679> this<00:02:04.890> camera<00:02:05.249> i<00:02:05.600> can

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
stereoscopic output of this camera i can

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.389 
stereoscopic output of this camera i can
turn<00:02:06.749> it<00:02:06.929> and<00:02:07.020> move<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.289> a<00:02:07.409> little<00:02:07.439> bit<00:02:07.740> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
turn it and move it a little bit and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.330 
turn it and move it a little bit and
what<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.910> see<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.509> typical<00:02:09.979> display<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.220> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
what you see is the typical display of a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.250 
what you see is the typical display of a
stereoscopic<00:02:11.910> video<00:02:12.360> stream<00:02:12.720> vision<00:02:13.080> and

stereoscopic video stream vision and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.380 
stereoscopic video stream vision and
standard<00:02:13.650> definition<00:02:14.190> so<00:02:14.730> this<00:02:15.030> is<00:02:15.180> something

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
standard definition so this is something

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.770 
standard definition so this is something
you<00:02:15.630> can<00:02:15.840> directly
