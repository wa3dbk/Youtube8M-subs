00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.330
 ah 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.579
 Hello everyone and I know that this video 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.589
 it will be a surprise to many but it had 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.930
 than doing this video as it says 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.629
 title is an opinion video would already be 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.129
 my second video giving an opinion 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.930
 criticism about the current situation of 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.059
 nintendo in this case I will talk about 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.339
 some games and some errors that do not 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.250
 They have forgiveness but we will go in thoroughly 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:07.479
 on the subject I'll start talking to one of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.299
 his most recent games yoshi's island 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.190
 unfortunate I have not played it and I do not 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.990
 I will play nor will I buy it 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.390
 unfortunate that a game that you spend a 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.580
 name I would say legendary then in his 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.979
 first delivery for the snes the game 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.960
 reached an incredible popularity and made 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.810
 that I did have a very strong personality 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.030
 defined both the criticisms and the 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.520
 players everyone has said that it is 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.770
 a mediocre game a bad game and the worst 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.140
 everything turns out to be like the garbage of 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.090
 new super mario bros 2 a game that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.130
 spends the name of a good saga and the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.440
 result is nothing more than a game without 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.490
 innovation an incomplete game and a 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.490
 game that is not worth it 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.580
 let's start with a very serious problem that 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.550
 it has become a fashion in nintendo 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.320
 the problem with names that fashion or 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.420
 whatever you want to call him he has adapted 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.310
 nintendo to put silly names and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.470
 simple to his games is very recent 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.630
 since in the Danish era and snes what 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.850
 that was abundant was creativity so much in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.160
 the video game on the cover and on the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.380
 name of this yes they were very simple in 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.510
 many cases but this trend of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.630
 put more than recycled names started 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.030
 some time ago in bs and willy but we did not 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.190
 let's go far back remember in this 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.530
 current generation pathetic cases 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.390
 like the new super mario bros and many 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.000
 titles that lead to the end of the name 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.650
 a 3d the problem is that the name 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.780
 It affects a lot when buying a 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.360
 video game and it will be your first time in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.340
 saga and cases like new super mario bros 2 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.350
 or triple luke kirby you're left a lot 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.030
 what to think 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.040
 Nintendo tried to put a video game 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.110
 of celta of new legend of zelda una 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 aberration more than remarkable and not to mention 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.310
 of games of the saga mario kart that 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 lately they have very simple names 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.060
 two of these are only accompanied by a 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.010
 number and already 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.230
 although of course the name is not a 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.510
 quality indicator since titles like 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.340
 super mario 3d land and 3 the words are 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.950
 games that do not have a title 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.200
 impressive or very striking 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.180
 now going on to another problem to 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.250
 Nintendo really likes the issue of 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.130
 feedbacks and for those who do not know what is 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.410
 that this is something like you play and you 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.680
 you say if you liked it or if you wasted your 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.780
 money and tell us how we could improve in 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.910
 yoshi's island there is an option that you 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.530
 allows you to share data on how to use the 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.120
 game and be able to share said 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.120
 information with nintendo and their 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.549
 developers is not the first time 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.239
 happens from programs as simple as 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.830
 pass letters to complete games 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 with some he has pronounced about 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.030
 this topic and says that he likes the idea and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.099
 that could also be implemented in 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.920
 various height games like zelda and 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.660
 mario among others I think if you 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.549
 They ask you to share data on how 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.319
 you use a program is to see what 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.450
 they can improve and they should rule out 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.990
 but unfortunately this has not had 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.750
 any use 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.880
 many fans say that yoshi's island is 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.220
 a scourge that is a simple remake of a 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.680
 previous game between complaints and claims 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.510
 Nintendo is deaf but still 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.930
 They ask you to give them your signature and which other 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.940
 personal use data go geniuses for 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.950
 end with this point I would like 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.560
 remind the number of times 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.780
 fans have not only asked but begged for 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.610
 a greater is more three of a try and 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.860
 reggio and they say that this does not influence 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.720
 your projects go do not believe it's a 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.340
 stupidity ask the users 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.650
 feedback instead of making a game 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.580
 complete this remains opinion of each one 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.580
 and one of you 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.259
 to finish I would like to touch a topic 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.210
 that the truth I do not understand how it is 

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:39.280
 possible that nintendo wants to sell its 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.380
 consoles for the novelty that they are and for 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 the unique capabilities that they possess do not 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.120
 exploit these qualities I will put two 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.940
 cases of which more annoyances have 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.449
 caused pokemon and pokemon x and donkey kong 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.699
 tropical freezer so many believe that 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:57.250
 these games explode or exploit the 

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.900
 capabilities of both consoles but not to 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.590
 Nintendo was worth it and they decided to do 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.060
 products so to speak half 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.889
 while in wind people 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.840
 they expect the gamepad to be a 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.910
 unique and innovative experience 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.070
 Nintendo decides to make games in which 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.690
 the use of the gamepad is null or nonexistent 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.210
 wiki started and donkey kong country 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.400
 tropical fred are clear examples of 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.350
 this error the latter does not use the 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.180
 gamepad because it worries nintendo 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.760
 that people do not spend a lot on 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.770
 electric power go nonsense here not 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.599
 I will give more comments since it is obvious 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.479
 the lack of seriousness they have in this 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.849
 case happening to the new deliveries of 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.560
 pokemon for 3ds here the situation is 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:37.330
 similar while in the first 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.460
 3ds years of life 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.470
 nintendo sold the consoles as a 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.479
 innovative machine that reproduces the effect 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.520
 in three dimensions without glasses or glasses 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.930
 specials today this is a 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.509
 quality that has been subtracted 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.849
 importance so much so that there are games that 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:54.009
 use the 3d as a mere complement as 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.229
 an unnecessary addition I remember that in 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:58.719
 games like super mario 3d land and the 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.699
 Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.009
 effect was very appreciable and in certain 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.990
 necessary measure to be able to play but 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.639
 in pokemon for 3ds you can only 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.409
 enjoy the effect in certain 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.409
 occasions go another nonsense 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.850
 to finish I would like to say that if 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.800
 Nintendo is in such a bad situation is 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.630
 because they have looked for it with a 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.000
 catalog so scarce in wii and wii with 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.310
 bad distribution of games in 3ds 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.100
 the current situation is disastrous but 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.900
 they wanted me this way 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.180
 I would like to apologize for my little 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:33.520
 activity I've been very busy with 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:35.560
 studies and those things and thank you for 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.540
 have seen the video I hope they have 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.220
 I would like them to leave their 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.010
 opinions on the subject in the 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.510
 comments see us until the next 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.510
 I hope you have a good day
