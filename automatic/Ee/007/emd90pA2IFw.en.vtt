00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.670
 there are very good today is a meditation 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:06.380
 to make a news video a 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.970
 little bit short that to the point and things 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.320
 and generally layers in the channel that goes to 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.249
 happen in the future of the channel 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.860
 all this in this video if you are interested 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:14.299
 my channel we are fine the method I am 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.320
 seen in my absence is not that I have 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:21.770
 year but it's not that I've left 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.510
 youtube vale simply do not feel like 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.220
 of doing minecraft itself because I was 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.260
 a little bit bored is with exams and 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.490
 I did not leave my firm in cafes and 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.770
 I was recording was because it's a bit 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.150
 forced to upload content and I do not want 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.579
 make a minimum effort so I prefer 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.810
 calm down a little step day time now 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.270
 I have a little more desire for minecraft 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.980
 I will explain why and all this and nothing 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.360
 and been making videos also for 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.950
 that you all know that I have a good channel 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.140
 people will be people who do not know 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.000
 a secondary channel with the secondary in 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 its channel that has to do with 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.510
 technology that I'll leave here a link 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.100
 what is called win found cloud is worth things 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.320
 about windows with very interesting that 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.420
 may interest people who used mobile 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.950
 with windows phone and good this month 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.239
 the channel focusing on a lot and I have almost 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.190
 2,000 followers I have several 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.930
 collaborations and you see that in the channel 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.070
 there is much better content like greater 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.320
 quality 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.090
 in real gaming how is this and now 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.890
 that comes in summer and good new things 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.780
 I want to do new things, it's worth first 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.640
 he does from his rival seven shots this 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.800
 but it has left him at least made of 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.440
 I'm already loyal manila I'm not interested 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.970
 saying tribal vanilla does not appeal to me anymore 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.330
 I've been almost four years when minecraft 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.580
 I am 99 have as an expert such a mother 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.400
 but I know a lot about the game and I 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.720
 can play to climb bar manila and the 45 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 hours to play more and grace to have the 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.340
 house built the diamonds and no longer not 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.840
 you'll leave what you're going to do good since 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.520
 you're bored so much playing you understand me 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.009
 those that I do not like that but I 'm 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.600
 boring that's why he gets me a new series 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.220
 next week about Tuesday or 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 always the new series the most 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.700
 observers during the video is 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.590
 great that the series is going but you will see it in 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.630
 his moment when the series arrives he goes to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 be a very cool series and a series that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.990
 I do not suppose that it will not travel half 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.850
 because it will follow what promises promises 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.950
 many will like me very much 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.869
 liked it a lot because it's a series of 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.600
 obligations that you have or if you do not already 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.280
 you will see in your life 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 that on the one hand and on the other hand I want 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.540
 start some new game but I know that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.090
 my channel as is minecraft the new ones 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.560
 ovens have a lot 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 adaptation for the mere fact that there 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.740
 people who do not see but equally to me 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.390
 like for example I want to start that val 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.920
 space program is a video game that is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.660
 Many people will know what it is like to 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.860
 that you are a space agency and 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.500
 you have to do it that is an evolution 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.170
 of space means lives throwing 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.050
 account for space because a satellite in 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 orbit then you will find some catch 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.950
 samples then send missions 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.510
 manned as well as NASA 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.180
 the states to the European special people 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.820
 well, but that is super technical that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 super that you must leave older people to 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.210
 understand them because they are serious 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.980
 do calculations and from this also of 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.260
 teach your the rockets that you are going to do 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.270
 the orbits you and this much physics of 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.980
 Much science I like a lot I come 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.120
 to play a little said for a bit has to 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.460
 know if I can try it for the channel 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.900
 because it's very interesting the game I think 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.900
 at the speed program there will be people who over 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.780
 what is it and nothing those are the news that 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.730
 the tour is growing in Reston I get tired 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.560
 0 for the mere fact that I have so many 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.550
 to the people that I already said in their 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.950
 moment that is that I have so many 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.450
 tutorials everything minecraft speaks 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.890
 with rest is already on my channel 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.560
 Well, if we are going to look for topics of 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.150
 reproduction with more than 70 mechanisms and 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.740
 between this in theoretical mechanisms of 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.540
 minecraft and banking tutors I have more 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.970
 of 100 videos plus half of 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.730
 channels of tutorial sounds and to 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.750
 hospital I do not like that topic so much 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.040
 the mere fact of that possible that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.170
 era and now another thing that you're not going to 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:33.260
 getting or will not control but 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.580
 I do not feel like it anymore and so that's 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.010
 next week will start new series 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.750
 and there will be news and I'm good but 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.070

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.260
 share on social networks comments 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.880

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.290
