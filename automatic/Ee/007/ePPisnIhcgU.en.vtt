00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.490
 and that's the friends it's creepy and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.359
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.189
 new video 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.829
 and as you can see we are 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.739
 on fifa 14 for a player review of 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.930
 risk to the team of the weak so I hope 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.800
 that this kind of videos will please you because 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.390
 that I decided to make you 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.070
 maybe not every week and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.510
 anyway from time to time because that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.970
 can be interesting videos 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.570
 and then as I wanted to start 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.940
 with with a boost on fifa 14 I 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.290
 thank lucas who had me lighthouse who 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.390
 had kindly lent me the boost 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.070
 so I test it so I can 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.539
 to make a short video with so 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.890
 every now and then like this every week 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.969
 maybe maybe no milk all 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.559
 the weeks I will present you a 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.300
 booth player that will please me from the team 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.039
 and I hope you'll like it 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.670
 and will touch passes you're past 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.800
 to statins game 2 isco so in addition I 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.450
 had it apply a card that puts your 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.200
 motor style which frankly it was a 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 whew 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.350
 so there's 99 of 94 of control 71 of 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.140
 social center of 192 of the 93 facts of 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.080
 dribbles 80 finishing it to branch 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.850
 very very nice stats ja I think 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 you can read if you're interested 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.570
 if enough to break so he has three 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.360
 stars on the wrong foot three stars in 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.900
 technical gesture in acceleration 83 in 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.979
 agility 91 years 9 august he has 90 if I 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.570
 not deceive us frankly made of 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.590
 breaks if you want to see them well 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.350
 all the stats 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.299
 so here I put you some actions 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.189
 game with disco not necessarily goals 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.259
 or something like that but some 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.210
 action styles where he gets to make a 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.060
 decisive pass where it can be decisive 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.579
 where he gets the ball or so yes he 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.380
 makes a very beautiful pass so 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.829
 frankly I test them I believe that 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.409
 I played five games with him and that 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.109
 was enough for for for same 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.459
 girl was offering me one to make me a 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.060
 own clean own opinion excuse me 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.650
 I have a little buggy 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.140
 so that was enough to give me an opinion 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.730
 I found that he was really very 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.680
 very good especially on kicks 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.940
 stopped watching it makes beautiful 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080
 corner 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.879
 I have not had the opportunity to draw 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.080
 free kicks with with cisco 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.370
 unfortunately not what I would have 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.680
 still liked to see since at 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.599
 more than 90 indeed if I'm wrong 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.920
 of free kick so it can really be 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.730
 not bad if you have a free kick to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.310
 the entrance to the surface 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:39.140
 it can be really dangerous for 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.989
 the opponent therefore ice frankly and 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.920
 moss and he's really tip top 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.360
 fortunately they did not put mg 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.090
 because about 14 football whenever he 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.170
 boost it put in mg and frankly 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.549
 it was a little anything because 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.560
 that there was really no place in 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.989
 mg while in the Scottish accent I 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.250
 find that he is really very very good 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.470
 look there he gets it all 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.790
 balloons that the guards that the 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.660
 guardians there I am really good at 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.579
 actions and he's a very offensive player 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.379
 even if he returns to pick up the balloon 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:07.760
 midfielder without problem it's a 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.750
 very offensive player that I appreciate 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.049
 a lot and its price its 85 thousand credit 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.329
 on ps3 just about and on xbox 360 15th 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.799
 80000 is to prepare to look at the leaf 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:20.359
 is a festival unfortunately the 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.819
 hit does not come in so yeah that to 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.989
 pretty much the same prices while his 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.130
 map st I believe they cut in 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.690
 the fifty thousand forty thousand 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.010
 fifty thousand so not play so 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.470
 frankly it is really not expensive 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.470
 sweetly you know barely thirty thousand 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.639
 more expensive than the base card 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.739
 so it's really if you have them 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:39.200
 credits I know that everyone starts 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.700
 can not afford but excuse me for 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.099
 the green computer I know they're going 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.299
 can not afford but if you have them 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.599
 means frankly I invite you to the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.849
 test 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.069
 he is a good player he is very complete 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.989
 and he is not at all reindeer he is 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.709
 not at all the year we just miss one 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.989
 little physics 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.459
 it's really a pity to keep it still 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:56.510
 a crossbar yeah he's him 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.150
 just lacks a little physics it's 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.620
 pity they are not very big 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.269
 because they are not too big and 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.669
 that he has not a little more physics 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.799
 be a little beefier because otherwise 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.760
 he would be really very very strong and 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.750
 then 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.040
 and then here are two actions 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.299
 if I'm wrong then that's it 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.530
 of the left foot it is very good of the 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.269
 bad foot even though he has only three 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.010
 stars game if I'm wrong excuseez 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 me it is very good both feet 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.400
 and then it's a pretty complete player 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.250
 for joints and words it's frankly 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.169
 one and tip top and I recommend it 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.370
 if you are going to credit obviously and 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:30.080
 there she even wanted to try a chisel 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.940
 his parents very unfortunately so 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.970
 the positives as I lÃ© 10 and 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.250
 the passes the shots the strikes and that's 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.169
 the price since it is not very expensive 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.370
 compared to the base map this is a 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.500
 comparison against the base map 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.449
 it's not for example in relation to the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.120
 credit you have since the game well 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.610
 go out and the negative points that can 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.020
 find at escosse ice kopa or that's 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.760
 that he has only three stars in action 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.289
 technique for 90 of dribbling is 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.490
 shame it's a shame he frankly 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.500
 could he could fit 4 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.300
 stars for 90 dream it's okay 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.560
 and then another negative point of course 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.180
 it's his physique it's not very 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.320
 big but frankly that makes it a 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.340
 very good player anyway 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.080
 invite to buy if you have them 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.430
 credits I hope accident this video
