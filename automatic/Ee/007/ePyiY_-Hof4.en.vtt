watching ivillage.com so there's been a

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.100 
watching ivillage.com so there's been a
bit<00:00:08.160> of<00:00:08.280> debate<00:00:08.549> about<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:09.179> finale<00:00:09.749> being

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
bit of debate about the finale being

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.319 
bit of debate about the finale being
drama-free<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:11.759> what<00:00:11.910> do<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.059> have<00:00:12.179> to

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:12.329 
drama-free and so what do you have to

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:14.480 
drama-free and so what do you have to
say<00:00:12.480> about<00:00:12.599> that<00:00:12.900> well<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.919> think<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.400> was

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
say about that well I think it was

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.460 
say about that well I think it was
actually<00:00:14.639> nice<00:00:14.999> to<00:00:15.059> end<00:00:15.449> on<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.900> positive<00:00:15.990> note

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
actually nice to end on a positive note

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.460 
actually nice to end on a positive note
I<00:00:17.370> think<00:00:17.700> the<00:00:18.120> season<00:00:18.660> has<00:00:18.870> been<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.080> kind<00:00:19.320> of

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
I think the season has been so kind of

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.680 
I think the season has been so kind of
drama<00:00:19.710> packed<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.430> we<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:21.030> know<00:00:21.090> start<00:00:21.210> off

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
drama packed and we you know start off

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.150 
drama packed and we you know start off
with<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.530> terrible<00:00:22.950> tragedy

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
with it you know the terrible tragedy

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.390 
with it you know the terrible tragedy
and<00:00:23.790> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:25.320> broke<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> mold<00:00:26.010> this

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and I think it broke the mold this

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.340 
and I think it broke the mold this
season<00:00:26.940> I<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.630> it's<00:00:27.780> bad<00:00:28.020> thing<00:00:28.260> I

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
season I don't think it's bad thing I

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.590 
season I don't think it's bad thing I
think<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.770> viewers<00:00:29.010> embraced<00:00:29.430> it<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.480> me

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:30.600 
think the viewers embraced it and for me

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.970 
think the viewers embraced it and for me
obviously<00:00:31.020> as<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> mother<00:00:31.380> my<00:00:31.620> daughter's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
obviously as a mother my daughter's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
obviously as a mother my daughter's
wedding<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.610> was<00:00:32.790> just<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.900> see<00:00:34.079> it<00:00:34.170> become

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350

wedding it was just to see it become
flourish<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.310> beautiful<00:00:35.700> thing

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
flourish and it was a beautiful thing

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.300 
flourish and it was a beautiful thing
so<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.600> made<00:00:36.900> it<00:00:36.930> clear<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.560> it<00:00:37.680> was<00:00:37.800> Pandora

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
book Lolita when they talk about the

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.760 
book Lolita when they talk about the
name<00:02:49.480> on<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> tip<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.140> tongue<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.380> looser

name on the tip of the tongue the looser
to<00:02:51.520> me<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> felt<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.239> about<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.230> main<00:02:53.410> Pandora

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
to me I felt that about the main Pandora

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.790 
to me I felt that about the main Pandora
you<00:02:54.580> know<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:55.360> just<00:02:55.630> sound<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.260> good<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.620> me

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
you know it's just sound so good to me

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.610 
you know it's just sound so good to me
and<00:02:57.010> obviously<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.850> legend<00:02:58.269> trouble<00:02:59.140> coming

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
and obviously the legend trouble coming

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.680 
and obviously the legend trouble coming
out<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.830> the<00:02:59.890> box

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
out of the box

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.420 
out of the box
I<00:03:01.750> suppose<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.680> was<00:03:02.739> trouble<00:03:03.040> coming<00:03:03.250> out<00:03:03.340> of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
I suppose it was trouble coming out of

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.700 
I suppose it was trouble coming out of
my<00:03:03.519> box
