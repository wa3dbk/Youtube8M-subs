 I have lived 60 years by your side with you 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.769
 and I have been done like 10 minutes 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.769

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.400
 did you know who polled me the men 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.210
 they turned out to be much more ignorant not 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.200

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:07.220
