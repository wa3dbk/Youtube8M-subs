00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.990 
away that quickly and discovering this
brand<00:02:04.640> new<00:02:04.789> area<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.570> allows<00:02:05.869> us<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:06.110> have<00:02:06.380> more

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
brand new area it allows us to have more

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.669 
brand new area it allows us to have more
experience<00:02:08.000> times<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.840> get<00:02:09.110> away<00:02:09.229> from<00:02:09.380> our

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
experience times and get away from our

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.190 
experience times and get away from our
house<00:02:09.890> much<00:02:10.220> easier<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.660> purpose<00:02:12.019> of<00:02:12.110> the

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
house much easier and the purpose of the

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.500 
house much easier and the purpose of the
two-way<00:02:12.530> door<00:02:12.739> is<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.280> leaves<00:02:13.550> a<00:02:13.880> portal

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
two-way door is that it leaves a portal

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.540 
two-way door is that it leaves a portal
to<00:02:15.110> let<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.380> go<00:02:15.530> back<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.739> your<00:02:16.099> main<00:02:16.280> so<00:02:16.459> if

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
to let you go back to your main so if

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.460 
to let you go back to your main so if
you<00:02:16.610> go<00:02:16.760> here<00:02:17.120> I'll<00:02:17.540> take<00:02:17.780> us<00:02:17.930> back<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.140> where

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
you go here I'll take us back to where

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.009 
you go here I'll take us back to where
we<00:02:18.500> started<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.940> can<00:02:20.060> go<00:02:20.209> back<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.780> make<00:02:20.959> a

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
we started and we can go back and make a

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:22.539 
we started and we can go back and make a
travel<00:02:21.319> back<00:02:21.470> and<00:02:21.500> forth<00:02:21.650> pretty<00:02:21.920> quickly<00:02:22.250> and

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
travel back and forth pretty quickly and

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.759 
travel back and forth pretty quickly and
it's<00:02:23.090> definitely<00:02:23.420> worth<00:02:23.780> getting<00:02:24.440> this

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
it's definitely worth getting this

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:27.130 
it's definitely worth getting this
two-way<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:25.849> of<00:02:26.180> the<00:02:26.569> ability<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.959> go

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
two-way because of the ability to go

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.229 
two-way because of the ability to go
back<00:02:27.319> and<00:02:27.560> forth<00:02:27.799> now<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.760> other<00:02:28.910> hand

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
back and forth now on the other hand

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.640 
back and forth now on the other hand
this<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.750> one-way<00:02:30.080> portal<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.500> I'm

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
this is the one-way portal that I'm

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.370 
this is the one-way portal that I'm
about<00:02:30.829> to<00:02:31.010> go<00:02:31.160> through<00:02:31.190> and<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:32.599> will<00:02:32.810> spawn<00:02:33.110> us

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
about to go through and it will spawn us

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.089 
about to go through and it will spawn us
in<00:02:33.560> a<00:02:33.799> random<00:02:34.220> location<00:02:34.430> as<00:02:35.090> well<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.769> can<00:02:36.920> see

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
in a random location as well you can see

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.890 
in a random location as well you can see
it<00:02:37.220> spawned<00:02:37.549> us<00:02:37.670> here<00:02:38.090> but<00:02:38.299> there<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.630> actually

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
it spawned us here but there is actually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.920 
it spawned us here but there is actually
no<00:02:39.650> door<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.730> go<00:02:40.880> back<00:02:41.150> he's<00:02:41.540> over<00:02:41.750> five

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
no door to go back he's over five

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.080 
no door to go back he's over five
thousand<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:42.620> eight<00:02:42.920> hundred<00:02:43.519> something

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
thousand and eight hundred something

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.559 
thousand and eight hundred something
blocks<00:02:44.989> away<00:02:45.200> and<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:46.640> looks<00:02:46.700> like<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.299> spawned

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
blocks away and it looks like it spawned

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.330 
blocks away and it looks like it spawned
us<00:02:47.720> right<00:02:47.959> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.440> bit<00:02:48.560> outside<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:49.160> some

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
different so this other one is a two-way

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.680 
different so this other one is a two-way
and<00:03:49.829> traveled<00:03:50.250> us<00:03:50.340> 3000<00:03:50.879> blocks<00:03:51.090> away<00:03:51.329> and

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690
