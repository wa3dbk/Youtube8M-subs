00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.609
 kakakakakakakakaka and possibly in the final 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.080
 the presenter is 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.120

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:35.719

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.719
 if we want 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:44.549

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.829
 on the vocal cords 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.619
 not because I was going to 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:59.639
 then nothing 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.789
