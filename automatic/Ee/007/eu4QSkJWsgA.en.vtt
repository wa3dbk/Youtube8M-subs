00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 I am going to review a product today where 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.620
 you 've probably heard of the 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.690
 opi glitter off natural nail basecoat and 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.429
 This ensures that you 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.139
 glitter nail polish much easier of you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 can get nails off without a fuss 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.369
 without soaking without hassle with 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.170
 aluminium foil 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.760
 I use this as a base and then you would 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 your nail polish should be able to come off 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.340
 to pull 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.900
 well i went to test that and i will go to you 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.640
 now show how it works 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.730
 just apply a layer of that open yes 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.480
 flash or on dry and clean nails 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.480
 just a layer 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.270
 as you can see this is white but you have to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.190
 dry it a little later until the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 transparent before you put the glitter one 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.239
 alkane is going to bring me two layers 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.879
 first applying a black lacquer, this is 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 black out of maybelline's color show 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.050
 and over it a glitter varnish of hema 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.070
 and this is the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.070
 23 on top coat liters 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.549
 I just let this dry as 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.619
 normal and then I'll go with you tomorrow 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.670
 see how I can get it off by 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.909
 basecoat 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.409
 ok we are a while further I am going now 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.850
 trying to pick them up 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.770
 what i really do it like me too 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.710
 gelnagellak take off I just put 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.670
 my nail under an edge and then 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.670
 tried to subtract 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.520
 well look that is really very easy 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.520
 you see how it releases 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:34.380
 so 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.200
 there it goes it can just be one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.409
 push it off 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.729
 some pieces you have to pull the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.140
 ends is slightly more difficult 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.140
 no I really, it's very easy 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.229
 easiest is to have such a cuticle 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.229
 pull it loose 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.409
 then you can pick it up in no time 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.729
 some small pieces are going well 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.440
 more difficult and then you just have to 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.960
 concentrate on more or just a moment 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.030
 nail polish remover get over it are 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 little finger is very easy 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.210
 it also depends a bit on how 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.080
 how thick you have applied your varnish 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.149
 thicker 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.610
 easier to pull off your wall 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.660
 those little leftovers that I still have 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.630
 I just take away with a little 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.769
 there are no nail polish remover 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.739
 glitters more on just a bit 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.230
 nail polish remover so and this is it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.540
 left over and my nails are not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.190
 see damaged only a little dry 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.209
 from what I just got nail polish remover 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.739
 used 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.959
 otherwise nothing wrong so that 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.850
 this is how easy it works 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.790
 so i read it very much 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.840
 also differs per nail type how to get one 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.730
 locker off 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.470
 if you have very weak bendable nails 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.630
 yourself then the locker comes more 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.160
 pieces though you have some stronger, harder ones 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.410
 nails then you can make it the more you have one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
 piece subtraction also differs how thick 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.459
 you apply the paint I have it myself 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:53.100
 tried a few times with a very thick one 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.720
 layer lay as you imagine the two layers 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.310
 click two layers of a color 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.900
 and a top coat then you get too much 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.820
 easier in a layer off way 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.590
 used thinner layers or less 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.329
 long and it also doesn't work with all 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.579
 glitter lacquers that's how I tried it 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.739
 natural white set of opium lacquers 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.269
 my eyes are but also glitter paints 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.250
 you are such a thin layer of make 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.299
 it works less well it still works 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.440
 always 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.090
 it's still easier to 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.940
 then remove when you are not team 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.140
 used basecoat but it still works 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.690
 less good so you can do it the best 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.430
 use in combination with more intense ones 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 glitter polish so I'm painting something 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.970
 work a little less well and ordinary 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.739
 lacquering ordinary nail polish does not work 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.780
 really come along you really need a thing 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.519
 use more intense glitter varnish 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.220
 yes what you should pay attention to is that you 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.450
 let paint dry the base so it is 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.400
 first white leaves him completely 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.410
 become transparent and then apply 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.500
 you do n't need anything else 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.330
 to think about 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.920
 actually you do n't have to 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.800
 no b is buy to use because 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.670
 this is all your basecoat and yes it works 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.530
 just fine 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.090
 I notice that I own one much faster 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.200
 glitter polish suit now to apply 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.390
 because it's just easier to 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.390
 removing it is just working fast 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.610
 a bottle costs 1425 and then you really have 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.410
 a large bottle of 15 milliliters 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.480
 Here you do a long time but you 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.620
 just about a little needed at a time 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.000
 here you will have a lot of fun 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.870
 make sure you close well every time 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.870
 turns shut 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.459
 Suppose you screw it in there varnish 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.620
 always comes scrub it clean and 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.930
 close your bottle properly so that you know for sure 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.430
 that your locke remains airtight 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.810
 yes i am very excited it works 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.940
 very very good so it depends a lot 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.470
 little bit off your nail type and type 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.150
 paint that you use so pay attention to that 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.500
 bit up and don't be with this air 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.540
 if it doesn't work because it's one 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.640
 little bit figuring out which one you like best 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.440
 lover who open yes this is a bit 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.990
 a mouthful but also years of natural nail 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.580
 basecoat tangles ralphie legal base coat 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.560

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.240
