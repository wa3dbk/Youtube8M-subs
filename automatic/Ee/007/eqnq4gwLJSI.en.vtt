thing<00:04:01.350> if<00:04:01.830> you<00:04:01.980> just<00:04:02.010> blast<00:04:02.400> through<00:04:02.610> the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
thing if you just blast through the

areas without exploring well you're

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:05.600 
areas without exploring well you're
probably<00:04:04.980> going<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.250> miss<00:04:05.400> something

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
probably going to miss something

on<00:04:07.590> obviously<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.400> won't<00:04:08.460> be<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.700> failure

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
on obviously it won't be a failure

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.570 
on obviously it won't be a failure
status<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.810> cannot<00:04:10.080> progress<00:04:10.380> but<00:04:11.010> it

you didn't take the time to actually
explore<00:04:16.799> which<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.100> definitely<00:04:17.250> something
