and<00:00:32.460> even<00:00:33.000> other<00:00:33.620> women<00:00:34.620> were<00:00:35.040> kind<00:00:35.399> of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
and even other women were kind of

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310 
and even other women were kind of
opposed<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> found<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
opposed to it and I found that

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.660 
opposed to it and I found that
interesting<00:00:37.680> because<00:00:37.800> me<00:00:38.040> myself<00:00:38.070> when<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
interesting because me myself when I

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
interesting because me myself when I
watched<00:00:38.850> through<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.270> kind<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.600> get<00:00:39.780> angry<00:00:40.079> but

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
watched through I kind of get angry but

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.500 
watched through I kind of get angry but
I<00:00:40.290> didn't<00:00:40.710> really<00:00:40.890> understand<00:00:41.340> why<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
I didn't really understand why that is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.100 
I didn't really understand why that is
so<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.170> spent<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> lot<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> time<00:00:44.430> analyzing<00:00:45.120> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
so I spent a lot of time analyzing and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.830 
so I spent a lot of time analyzing and
thinking<00:00:46.460> why<00:00:47.460> would<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:48.059> make<00:00:48.239> me<00:00:48.270> angry<00:00:48.600> I

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
thinking why would that make me angry I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.389 
thinking why would that make me angry I
mean<00:00:49.110> she's<00:00:49.350> looking<00:00:49.590> out<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.890> me<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.100> other

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
mean she's looking out for me and other

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.090 
mean she's looking out for me and other
women<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.120> understand<00:00:51.829> where<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
women I don't understand where the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.840 
women I don't understand where the
negative<00:00:53.460> reaction<00:00:53.730> comes<00:00:54.210> from<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.280> I<00:00:56.280> think

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
negative reaction comes from and I think

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.229 
negative reaction comes from and I think
there's<00:00:57.840> such<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.190> negative<00:00:59.190> backlash<00:00:59.460> because

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there's such a negative backlash because

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
there's such a negative backlash because
of<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.469> implications<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.420> reasons

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
of the implications of the reasons

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890 
of the implications of the reasons
behind<00:01:05.510> the<00:01:06.510> things

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
behind the things

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.080 
behind the things
Anita's<00:01:07.320> saying<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.680> happening<00:01:08.010> up<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.400> think

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
Anita's saying are happening up I think

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.390 
Anita's saying are happening up I think
she<00:01:09.420> spot-on<00:01:09.930> about<00:01:10.560> talking<00:01:11.100> about<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
she spot-on about talking about the

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.100 
she spot-on about talking about the
symptom<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.850> characterizing<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> symptom

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
symptom and characterizing the symptom

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.719 
symptom and characterizing the symptom
because<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.010> very<00:01:14.189> few<00:01:14.369> female

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
because there are very few female

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.060 
because there are very few female
characters<00:01:15.270> very<00:01:15.810> few<00:01:16.020> female<00:01:16.380> protagonists

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
characters very few female protagonists

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.320 
characters very few female protagonists
and<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> ones<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.030> usually

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and the ones are there are usually

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
and the ones are there are usually
underdeveloped<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> weak<00:01:19.380> that's<00:01:19.770> true<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
underdeveloped and weak that's true I

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.039 
underdeveloped and weak that's true I
think<00:01:20.939> she's<00:01:21.060> spot-on<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:22.020> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
think she's spot-on with that but I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.670 
think she's spot-on with that but I
think<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:23.070> problem<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.990> implications

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
think the problem is the implications

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
think the problem is the implications
she's<00:01:25.920> making<00:01:26.340> are<00:01:26.460> very<00:01:26.850> very<00:01:27.150> harsh<00:01:27.450> because

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
she's making are very very harsh because

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.510 
she's making are very very harsh because
she's<00:01:28.080> implying<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.710> game<00:01:28.890> developers

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
she's implying that the game developers

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
she's implying that the game developers
are<00:01:29.759> sexist<00:01:30.210> themselves<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> they<00:01:31.079> think

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
are sexist themselves that they think

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
are sexist themselves that they think
less<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.460> women<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.210> think<00:01:33.270> women<00:01:33.930> are

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
less of women that they think women are

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.370 
less of women that they think women are
less<00:01:34.259> capable<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.780> by<00:01:36.780> using<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> term

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
less capable and by using the term

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.399 
less capable and by using the term
misogyny<00:01:38.040> she's<00:01:38.820> implying<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.960> even

just not have the social skills to do it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.890 
just not have the social skills to do it
yet<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.490> don't<00:02:20.520> communicate<00:02:21.180> themselves

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
very well but I don't think any other

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.320 
very well but I don't think any other
game<00:02:23.970> developers<00:02:24.530> really<00:02:25.530> hate<00:02:25.860> women<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:26.550> why

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
game developers really hate women so why

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.080 
game developers really hate women so why
is<00:02:27.390> there<00:02:27.900> such<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.620> low<00:02:29.310> representation<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
is there such a low representation of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.400 
is there such a low representation of
women<00:02:30.240> in<00:02:30.510> video<00:02:30.600> games<00:02:30.990> well<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> personally

women in video games well I personally

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.640 
women in video games well I personally
believe<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.790> because<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.780> very

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
believe that it's because there are very

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.610 
believe that it's because there are very
few<00:02:34.980> female<00:02:35.370> game<00:02:35.640> developers<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.560> why<00:02:37.560> is

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
few female game developers and why is

number and the only conclusion left is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.979 
number and the only conclusion left is
that<00:03:46.860> simply<00:03:47.400> women<00:03:47.910> are<00:03:48.060> not<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.510> drawn<00:03:48.780> to

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
that simply women are not as drawn to

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.820 
that simply women are not as drawn to
game<00:03:49.170> development<00:03:49.560> as<00:03:49.920> men<00:03:50.130> are<00:03:50.160> and<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:51.830> don't

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
game development as men are and I don't

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.410 
game development as men are and I don't
think<00:03:53.010> there's<00:03:53.250> any<00:03:53.370> magical<00:03:53.970> barrier<00:03:54.360> I

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
think there's any magical barrier I

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.660 
think there's any magical barrier I
think<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.170> biological<00:03:55.890> some<00:03:56.370> jobs

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
they're very talented people who are

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.719 
they're very talented people who are
doing<00:05:35.380> their<00:05:35.500> own<00:05:35.530> thing<00:05:35.889> on<00:05:36.130> their<00:05:36.340> own<00:05:36.460> time

doing their own thing on their own time
I'm<00:05:36.970> not<00:05:37.210> really<00:05:37.389> sure<00:05:37.690> why<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:39.280> bigger<00:05:39.550> game

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:39.849 
I'm not really sure why the bigger game

companies<00:05:40.389> attract<00:05:41.490> sort<00:05:42.490> of<00:05:42.610> less<00:05:42.910> creative

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570

writers<00:05:43.990> it<00:05:44.199> doesn't<00:05:44.440> make<00:05:44.650> much<00:05:44.949> sense<00:05:44.979> but

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
writers it doesn't make much sense but

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.900 
writers it doesn't make much sense but
that<00:05:46.599> seems<00:05:47.020> to<00:05:47.080> be<00:05:47.169> how<00:05:47.380> it<00:05:47.530> is<00:05:47.789> but<00:05:48.789> I<00:05:48.820> think

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
that seems to be how it is but I think

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.550 
that seems to be how it is but I think
inherently<00:05:49.449> people<00:05:49.840> are<00:05:49.960> good<00:05:50.139> and<00:05:50.320> no<00:05:50.440> one

inherently people are good and no one
hates<00:05:50.979> women<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.639> the<00:05:51.729> ones<00:05:51.910> trying<00:05:52.240> there
