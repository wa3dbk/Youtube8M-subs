00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you can train and possibly make even

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
you can train and possibly make even
more<00:00:50.670> coins<00:00:51.030> then<00:00:51.300> rebind<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> few<00:00:52.379> our

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
more coins then rebind back in a few our

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
more coins then rebind back in a few our
players<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.219> by<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> completely<00:00:54.059> different

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
players or by a completely different

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
players or by a completely different
plan<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.289> could<00:00:55.500> make<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.649> even<00:00:55.860> more

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
plan and that could make you even more

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
plan and that could make you even more
profit<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> risk

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
profit but if you do that it is a risk

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.470 
profit but if you do that it is a risk
so<00:00:59.070> it's<00:00:59.550> whether<00:00:59.850> you<00:00:59.940> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.359> the

so it's whether you want to take the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.150 
so it's whether you want to take the
risk<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.870> our<00:01:01.050> let's<00:01:01.530> go<00:01:01.649> into<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> next

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
probably won't be worth much let's go

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.229 
probably won't be worth much let's go
