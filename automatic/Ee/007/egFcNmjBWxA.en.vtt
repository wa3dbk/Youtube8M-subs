00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello guys I'm a leisure fighter and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.450
 Today I want to talk to you about the game call of 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.550
 duty ghosts if you have not played it 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.639
 let me tell you that it turned out to be a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.009
 Reverend fuck fuck call of duty 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 ghosts is really disappointing 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:17.490
 It turns out that the campaign is short and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.590
 too much guided the multiplayer does not 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.230
 presents innovations and technically not 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.170
 take advantage of the new consoles by 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.539
 example the campaign mode we will find the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 typical walk through an endless hallway 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.019
 full of enemies 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 we will also live all situations and 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.670
 we will visit the locations more 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.739
 typical within the game there will be moments 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.250
 of staying unconscious characters 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.600
 dead scenes of turret and rattle 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 persecutions and all the things that already 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.760
 we know nothing that we have not seen a thousand and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.610
 One times call of duty voices plus 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.680
 limited in its playability with an advance 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.210
 that depends on the situations 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.940
 peliculeras that await us doing 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.829
 that we find a something short 45 hours 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.170
 of game that is also little 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.210
 Replayable because objectives are eliminated 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.640
 secondary and emerging missions 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.200
 with secrets as the only incentive 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.750
 to play again 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
 now the multiplayer mode well then 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.219
 today I bought the game I thought it was 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.649
 was going to look more like modern warfare 3 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.189
 that the call of duty black ops 2 and go 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.140
 disappointment first they have removed demolition 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.569
 and they have put a mode called search and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.759
 rescue an authentic shit and more 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:28.619
 chorra game modes that have put have 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.079
 removed demolition and search and destroy 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.090
 to put those shits though this 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.520
 Last one is already available in the lists 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.649
 of multiplayer playing second 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.630
 good to the only thing you can play that 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.490
 already know is to the duel by teams and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.439
 a domain is that people will 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.049
 appears on your base just that the team 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.090
 advance a little we go that or you play with a 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.220
 whole team or you eat a shit if 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.380
 you play alone and the others advance because 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.479
 the enemies start to appear for you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.020
 behind they have done a shit like that of 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.789
 every year since modern warfare 3 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.950
 good to play with the team is more 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.989
 or less well but how you play alone you 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.179
 You fuck remove demolition and search and 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:09.060
 destroy what is left to this online 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:11.310
 well everyone has their tastes and I hope 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.079
 do not start insulting because maybe 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.690
 that looks like shit to others 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.150
 it may seem good 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.130
 the truth is that seeing the shits that 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.170
 they have cast us in recent years I do not 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.510
 surprise but coming from infinity ward 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.820
 I expected something more similar to modern 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.950
 warfare 3 and it turns out that the only thing 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.160
 they look like it's in the graphics that are 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.020
 same is to say two years ago if 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.480
 we make a comparison between the call 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.030
 of duty for example call of duty world 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.130
 at war the call of duty 4 was excellent 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 is the best and most realistic game of 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.930
 war the modern warfare 2 is fun 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.210
 the call of duty black ops' 1 is good the 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.550
 modern warfare 3 was a shit call 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.650
 of duty black ops' 2 regularly fuck 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.600
 and the ghosts to say since I look 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.940
 multiplayer videos I already thought 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.370
 a sincerity sincerely graphics are 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.740
 those look that those of the call of duty black 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.810
 ops' one at least knew color in this 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.040
 the colors are very muted and graphics 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.900
 0 improvable 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.750
 this game did not paint also from 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.370
 before because the reserves do not 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.280
 they came not far from the call of 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.620
 duty black ops' 2 second there was not much 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.500
 ip before they took out a trailer and the world 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.690
 whole was revolutionized call of duty was 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.470
 characterized by frantic fighting 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.870
 on foot without 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.030
 in a too big map the races 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.120
 they are replaced by pitched battles of 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.310
 sniper that's not fun in 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.560
 the graphics at least the proposal of 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.930
 activision works at 60 images per 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.760
 second always constant although the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.610
 resolution varies depending on the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.770
 machine that we use playstation 4 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.500
 allows call of duty boss to work 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.770
 Native 1080p while in xbox one 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.440
 we will settle for 720p rescale 2 to 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.060
 1080p which translates into more teeth 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.180
 of saw and lower definition of 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.770
 distant elements I will put an image for 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.370
 look at the saw teeth in the 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.370
 Xbox One 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.590
 and in conclusion we expected much more from 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.900
 what we have obtained with call of duty 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.180
 ghosts on the one hand your campaign results 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.250
 short and too guided by another the 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.930
 Multiplayer options make up 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.670
 with copying the usual scheme of the 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.709
 series by adding touches on the 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.110
 customization but with a selection 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.480
 of inappropriate maps the rest of 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.940
 modes are somewhat insufficient and for 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.330
 more technically we are facing a title 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:33.740
 of old generation raised of laps 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.740
 goodbye leave your comment
