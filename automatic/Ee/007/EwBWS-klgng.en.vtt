Jordan<00:01:27.710> well<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:29.070> believe<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.640> this<00:01:29.909> could<00:01:30.119> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
Jordan well I believe that this could be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.999 
Jordan well I believe that this could be
very<00:01:30.240> interesting<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:31.259> think<00:01:31.320> we're<00:01:31.650> gonna<00:01:31.740> see

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009

very interesting I think we're gonna see
until<00:01:32.310> but<00:01:32.670> until<00:01:33.270> Cena<00:01:33.509> comes<00:01:33.750> back<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.200> think

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
until but until Cena comes back I think

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.440

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
in the first place as far as what they

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.180

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
and you know I think creative is
