00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.910
 danut box 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.090
 Well, the box is basically normal 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.200
 packed packed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.420
 nothing crumpled everything is okay so 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.520
 gaming characteristics wired 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.950
 backlit keyboard 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.550
 software to create 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.370
 macros 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.620
 Macro is who knows 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.680
 programmable soft keys 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.460
 here's an adjustable other reliable 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 guys design is so systemic 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 requirements windows xp vista 7 8 usb and 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:16.610
 Basically, here is such a thing so 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 let's for professional players 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.939
 Let's see whether it is worth buying at all such 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.310
 keyboard 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.439
 let's say instead of the same rater well or 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.930
 bloody 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:33.750
 so let's see what we have inside 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:37.159
 so simple but i have already opened just now 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.159
 first look at the box 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 let's uncover and so a row inside us 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.329
 inside we have these two black 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.659
 cosmos not to keep it 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.759
 she they kept the keyboard shorter here and 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.869
 keyboards was here that the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:04.600
 sachets but it is possible in the firebox so further that 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.000
 there was a driver driver by the way 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.560
 definitely need just without 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.769
 These keyboard drivers are simply not 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 go and manual with warranty 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:22.269
 coupon what here we have the characteristics and 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.750
 support chilean principle all box 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.349
 also 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.239
 but now ahead u randomly now 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.170
 let's go to the keyboard itself and here it is 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:36.459
 that I went out and became 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 blink guys noticed such here they are 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.670
 and illumination at night looks generally fly away 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.190
 at night and everything is visible and let's get started 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 just here we have lights and get down 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.500
 to the highlight itself how is it at all 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.780
 regulated here are the keys 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:03:01.209
 let me show you m1 m2 m3 and mrm one 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.850
 In short, itâ€™s about how much 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:08.680
 time m1 and doing that she is so extinguished a and 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:15.069
 caught fire here click on m2 race all 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:17.620
 she helped and that's all she caught fire yes 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:20.109
 all she caught fire she burns she will 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.450
 tyre gareth but if you are idle for a long time 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:27.419
 it just goes out click on any 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:32.019
 button it lights on guys here 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:35.260
 these buttons are the same jade 2g 3g 45 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.620
 they can be programmed well 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.739
 comments can be made as in any case. 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.269
 secondary buttons and so on 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.389
 further guys what what what else 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:51.940
 unique there is a backlight spider here too 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:57.370
 that's glittering so let's take another 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:04:01.359
 parties look so guys oh so 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.030
 rezinochki is not to slip but 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.370
 true well here they are principle 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.530
 but they do not have rezinochek but a tooth due to 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:13.449
 the fact that they are bigger and this is also a plus 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.400
 the next gaming wired keyboard is 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:21.759
 it says here but everything else 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.470
 more cons Now that's the way these so 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:28.509
 here are these lights where well we are like a scrub 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:33.520
 it is but they are dull and a bit 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:37.000
 so this is now a minus of course further 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.210
 Plastics to the touch are generally nice 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.759
 and 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.449
 compared to cheap keyboards 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:46.960
 very nice to touch guys nice and 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:49.270
 principle, what else is possible about 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.900
 this keyboard say about your button 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.180
 multimedia turn the sound off 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.270
 add play pause 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.520
 and rewind the song escape settings 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:06.729
 prince clinton as usual in principle 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:10.779
 so principle 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.270
 how can we even tell her guys i'm washing 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:15.129
 This keyboard here I have a rag 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.270
 which can be bought in any 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:24.279
 computer store sold there lo 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:27.039
 And here such a means of course so and 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:33.849
 and dreary but reliable so easy 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:36.900
 sprinkle once and every button every 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.979
 wash button wash sink and so on 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.729
 better not to wash 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:45.819
 just before you go to counter 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.639
 wash your hands and everything is like this 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:53.069
 keyboard I like it very much everyone 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:56.710
 I advise you to buy lights too cool 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:06:00.460
