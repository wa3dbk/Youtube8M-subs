here now so they're just not all the
same<00:00:51.570> just<00:00:52.399> in<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.760> pile<00:00:53.969> though<00:00:54.180> you<00:00:54.239> can

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
way you can get a multitude of things on

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
way you can get a multitude of things on
your<00:00:59.190> knife<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.640> one<00:00:59.879> loading<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.809> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
your knife in one loading so you just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.319 
your knife in one loading so you just
cut<00:01:01.199> across<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.680> get<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.100> roll<00:01:02.329> what

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
cut across and get a little roll what

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.969 
cut across and get a little roll what
will<00:01:03.480> appear<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:05.280> maybe<00:01:06.229> maybe<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
will appear and maybe maybe there's a

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.100 
will appear and maybe maybe there's a
little<00:01:08.250> light<00:01:08.430> playing<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.720> through<00:01:09.960> there

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
little light playing right through there

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
little light playing right through there
and<00:01:10.229> sort<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.530> singing<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.250> think<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:11.850> sort

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and sort of singing I think you can sort

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.929 
and sort of singing I think you can sort
of<00:01:12.090> Bend<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> over<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.100> rock<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.760> sort

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
of Bend that over so that rock just sort

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.260 
of Bend that over so that rock just sort
of<00:01:15.000> hangs<00:01:15.330> over<00:01:15.720> there

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
of hangs over there

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.570 
of hangs over there
there<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.360> comes<00:01:18.750> maybe<00:01:19.229> there's<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.590> all<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
there it comes maybe there's a all the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.990 
there it comes maybe there's a all the
way<00:01:20.610> over<00:01:21.979> barely<00:01:22.979> barely<00:01:23.460> touching<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
way over barely barely touching the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.870 
way over barely barely touching the
canvas<00:01:26.270> there<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.799> in<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> shadow<00:01:29.340> part<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
canvas there and in the shadow part of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940 
canvas there and in the shadow part of
it<00:01:30.000> there's<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.299> very<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.720> color<00:01:31.049> very

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
it there's a very little color very

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.730 
it there's a very little color very
little<00:01:32.400> color<00:01:33.200> only<00:01:34.200> out<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.380> here<00:01:34.530> where<00:01:34.680> you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
little color only out of here where you

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.030 
little color only out of here where you
think<00:01:34.979> light<00:01:35.310> would<00:01:35.549> strike<00:01:36.650> want<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> keep<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
think light would strike want to keep it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.100 
think light would strike want to keep it
quite<00:01:38.280> darker<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> does<00:01:39.630> not<00:01:39.780> lose<00:01:40.049> his

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
quite darker so it does not lose his

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.789 
quite darker so it does not lose his
effectiveness<00:01:42.049> just<00:01:43.049> begin<00:01:43.320> thinking<00:01:43.619> about

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
effectiveness just begin thinking about

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.310 
effectiveness just begin thinking about
rocks<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.850> stones<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.540> how<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:45.930> would<00:01:46.049> set

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
rocks and stones and how they would set

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.990 
rocks and stones and how they would set
in<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:48.320> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.530> actually<00:01:49.799> just<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.790> about

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
in here you can actually just just about

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
in here you can actually just just about
sculpt<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.659> meteor<00:01:51.930> as<00:01:52.890> you're<00:01:53.070> doing<00:01:53.369> these

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
and some air just barely touch it and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.750 
and some air just barely touch it and
begin<00:02:20.900> pulling<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.739> paint<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.190> little<00:02:22.459> bit

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
begin pulling that paint a little bit

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.440 
begin pulling that paint a little bit
just<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.600> little<00:02:24.819> dere<00:02:25.819> see<00:02:27.940> barely<00:02:28.940> barely

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
just a little dere see barely barely

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.210 
just a little dere see barely barely
touching<00:02:29.989> but<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.500> have<00:02:30.680> to<00:02:30.830> follow<00:02:31.010> those

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
touching but you have to follow those

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.080 
touching but you have to follow those
angles<00:02:31.700> in<00:02:31.850> there<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.700> follow<00:02:34.910> those

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
angles in there I have to follow those

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.590 
angles in there I have to follow those
angle<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.050> doesn't<00:02:36.350> work<00:02:36.470> out<00:02:36.709> right

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
angle so it just doesn't work out right

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.270 
angle so it just doesn't work out right
but<00:02:38.600> this<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:38.900> one<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.200> easiest<00:02:39.680> nicest

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
but this is one of the easiest nicest

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.229 
but this is one of the easiest nicest
ways<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:41.030> making<00:02:41.420> large<00:02:41.690> effective<00:02:42.530> stones<00:02:43.239> if

ways of making large effective stones if

ways of making large effective stones if
people<00:02:44.570> really<00:02:44.900> think<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.230> work<00:02:45.440> for<00:02:45.650> long

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
people really think you work for long

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.940 
people really think you work for long
periods<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.430> time<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.970> at<00:02:47.959> home<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.769> set

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
periods of time and at home you can set

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.490 
periods of time and at home you can set
an<00:02:49.220> ad<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:49.880> blend<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:50.780> ahead<00:02:50.989> and<00:02:51.230> blend

an ad and blend and ahead and blend
until<00:02:51.709> you<00:02:51.890> get<00:02:52.040> it<00:02:52.130> exactly<00:02:52.700> the<00:02:52.910> way<00:02:53.000> you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
until you get it exactly the way you

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.710 
until you get it exactly the way you
want<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:53.890> but<00:02:54.890> with<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:55.880> large<00:02:56.180> brush<00:02:56.480> here

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
want it but with this large brush here

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.290 
want it but with this large brush here
it<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.050> the<00:02:57.140> most<00:02:57.290> gentle<00:02:57.650> touch<00:02:58.069> if<00:02:58.370> that

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
it is the most gentle touch if that

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.140 
it is the most gentle touch if that
gentle<00:03:00.010> like<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.040> whisper<00:03:01.519> floating<00:03:01.910> over

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
gentle like a whisper floating over

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.699 
gentle like a whisper floating over
there

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
there

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.620 
there
and<00:03:03.709> we<00:03:03.800> tapped<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.730> brush<00:03:05.000> into<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.239> least

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
and we tapped that brush into the least

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.680 
and we tapped that brush into the least
little<00:03:06.110> touch<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.560> titanium<00:03:07.130> white<00:03:07.690> leastly

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
little touch of titanium white leastly

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.060 
little touch of titanium white leastly
touch<00:03:09.079> just<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.470> corner<00:03:09.860> top<00:03:10.850> corner<00:03:12.070> top

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
touch just the corner top corner top

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.220 
touch just the corner top corner top
corner<00:03:13.579> and<00:03:13.760> we<00:03:14.030> can<00:03:14.180> create<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.600> illusion<00:03:14.900> of

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
corner and we can create the illusion of

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.660 
corner and we can create the illusion of
the<00:03:15.709> mist<00:03:16.090> right<00:03:17.090> there<00:03:17.980> these<00:03:18.980> little<00:03:19.040> bit<00:03:19.549> of

the mist right there these little bit of

the mist right there these little bit of
titanium<00:03:20.209> white<00:03:20.450> though<00:03:20.660> it's<00:03:21.530> like<00:03:21.709> making<00:03:22.010> a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
titanium white though it's like making a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.329 
titanium white though it's like making a
little<00:03:22.190> cloud<00:03:22.579> down<00:03:22.850> at<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> bottom
