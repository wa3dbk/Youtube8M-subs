00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.250
 the hats can be used in 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.170
 any season is just a matter of 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.610
 look for the car and perfect there they go 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.610
 four fun options 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.029
 This is the first look is ideal for a 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.190
 hot day we are wearing a hat 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.290
 very large the pattern that it has is 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.060
 tribal type and this combination of 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.400
 colors is very common but there is also 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.930
 in beige it is and also coffee shades looks 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.900

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:35.450
 Very large exportable size very light 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.579
 and it looks really cute with this product is 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.110
 white I did not want to go and stamped and 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.140
 much less is it smart but it does have 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.809
 texture that lace I'm using a 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.700
 maxifalda the truth is that it has spring 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.800
 so you can use it perfectly to 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.230
 I like the waist or the hip 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.940
 cuts to circulation in the body 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.219
 arona watch I can use the hip and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.440
 that he is divine duty that yes when 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.300
 I use crop tops I always try to use 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.789
 garments that reach the waist 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.699
 the shoes I'm wearing sandals 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.340
 very flirty in golden tone I like 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.590
 so much that they come to the top style 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.800
 Greek that make me flirtatious yes very 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.180
 fun finally the bag this bag 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.860
 leads to have another color completely 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.360
 different you have to do color contrast 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.280
 and have fun with our looks there is no 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.720
 that opting for the predictable has a 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.500
 divine size ideal for 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.500
 necessary 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.820
 and this second light is going to be for the cold 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.460
 let's give cold and heat options 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.710
 let's start with a hat is very 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.260
 typical now for autumn winter the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.600
 color is gray there is in white on red 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.240
 in green any autumnal color is 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.980
 perfect I really like the design is 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.510
 completely round and falls 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.090
 it's okay if it's not for suddenly the 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.100
 eye or part of the face looks very cute 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.110
 I have to use much higher 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.240
 I'm wearing it with a ribbon sweater 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.150
 black could also be white I like 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.570
 also the color that is how that came 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.940
 intense red burnt I like very much 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.460
 I'm throwing a sack over 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.400
 vest is long long I like it because 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:23.820
 It is hot and has no hairs we have seen 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.140
 this tendency of fringes and hairs this is 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.350
 a very nice option also for 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.290
 autumn-winter some leggings I wanted that 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.030
 they were shiny the fabric is lycra it 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 fit very well to the legs is the 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.380
 black color the most combinable of all 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.210
 the boots 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.370
 you could also use some 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.960
 booties would be very cute too but 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.630
 I want to show you this look with boots 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.360
 highs have something heel are very 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 comfortable to walk and finally a 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.160
 hand bag this bag I like a lot 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.230
 has fringes what we were talking about is 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.380
 synthetic leather and it looks divine with this 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.380
 look 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.030
 and this is a much more casual look what 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.310
 They can also use a 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.410
 hat this hat we have seen 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.210
 A lot of haunting on the beach in color 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.040
 white but the truth is that I wanted to opt 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.470
 another color and see that father is 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.870
 now in black the face covers a little 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.300
 It looks very chic and I wanted to combine it with 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.850
 a shirt the shirt is ready 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.070
 completely if they are fixed is great is 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.320
 much bigger than my size do not look 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.420
 incredible they look like messed up 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.280
 but at the same time very very parents is 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.380
 saying some jeans are skinny jeans 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.870
 but you could use the ones that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.120
 accommodate them remember that there 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.560
 Flared cut straight cut boot there 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.500
 an enchantment if they have a few 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.850
 details for washed washed helps if 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.230
 you do not find broken you can 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.500
 do it also at home and they look 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.840
 incredible I'm wearing some tennis like 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.180
 option could also use some flags 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.730
 monkeys or moccasins Boris style 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.890
 these are good options 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.530
 love because they have applications are 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.180
 of synthetic leather and they look divine and 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.709
 I wanted to combine them with one more bag or 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.269
 less style 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.009
 also these same applications of 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.280
 skulls and it looks amazing in this 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:25.280
 world 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.040
 and this look is also for winter 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.400
 a lot more girls and you can go too 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.110
 more in the afternoon is a hat these 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.120
 typical that we talked now 15 that 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.370
 they were another color in black is the most 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.500
 combinable is a divine option has 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.450
 some letters out there the truth is that 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.160
 there are different applications including 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.450
 pins that we made last time we can 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.300
 put them in a hat and they look 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.830
 incredible I wanted to make a dress this 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.810
 dress is made of leather has many 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.430
 applications I 've also seen many 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.890

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.170
 material some wings belts much more 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.550
 loose open in a seek your favor 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.150
 and I also like it to be completely 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.890
 straight that looks in those applications and 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.720
 I'm going to take advantage of those colors that 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.690
 there are in them to use meshes that 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.880
 go together these meshes are in 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.100
 red I did not want that they contrasted a 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.310
 bit that other wonders could 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.980
 use you black white purple 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.900
 also green roses and electric blue 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.450
 so they can see that there is a lot of variety 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.910

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.680

 even above the knee and that is given 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.590
 just a little skin or a little bit of 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.060
 mesh 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.340
 but I wanted on this occasion to use 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.250
 booties and that were also very 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.080
