what we're looking at here is a built-up
shower<00:00:05.060> dam<00:00:05.479> that<00:00:06.050> the<00:00:06.380> carpenter<00:00:07.010> used<00:00:07.550> a<00:00:07.960> few

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
shower dam that the carpenter used a few

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.890 
shower dam that the carpenter used a few
two-by-fours<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:10.190> nailed<00:00:10.700> them<00:00:10.970> together<00:00:11.180> to

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
two-by-fours and nailed them together to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.040 
two-by-fours and nailed them together to
make<00:00:12.260> a<00:00:12.740> curb<00:00:13.280> or<00:00:13.520> a<00:00:13.850> shower<00:00:14.150> dam<00:00:14.510> something<00:00:14.960> to

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.050 
make a curb or a shower dam something to

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.909 
make a curb or a shower dam something to
keep<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.350> water<00:00:15.590> in<00:00:16.000> the<00:00:17.000> shower<00:00:17.589> now<00:00:18.589> there

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:18.919 
keep the water in the shower now there

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:21.609 
keep the water in the shower now there
are<00:00:19.070> building<00:00:19.519> codes<00:00:19.820> for<00:00:20.449> that<00:00:20.619> would

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
are building codes for that would

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:23.950 
are building codes for that would
specify<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.159> height<00:00:22.490> of<00:00:22.789> the<00:00:23.150> shower<00:00:23.449> dams<00:00:23.779> I

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
specify the height of the shower dams I

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.450 
specify the height of the shower dams I
believe<00:00:24.259> it's<00:00:24.439> three<00:00:24.679> inches<00:00:24.859> above<00:00:25.400> the

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
believe it's three inches above the

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.460 
believe it's three inches above the
drain<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.269> would<00:00:26.509> need<00:00:26.689> to<00:00:26.779> check<00:00:26.989> that<00:00:27.050> out

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
drain you would need to check that out

do<00:00:27.919> not<00:00:28.449> quote<00:00:29.449> me<00:00:29.509> on<00:00:29.749> that<00:00:30.310> however<00:00:31.310> I

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
do not quote me on that however I

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.100 
do not quote me on that however I
usually<00:00:32.060> like<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:32.329> make<00:00:32.390> the<00:00:32.599> shower<00:00:32.810> down<00:00:33.079> a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
usually like to make the shower down a

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.560 
usually like to make the shower down a
little<00:00:33.440> higher<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.130> is<00:00:34.310> 3<00:00:34.580> 2<00:00:34.790> by<00:00:34.970> 4<00:00:35.240> plates

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
little higher this is 3 2 by 4 plates

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.200 
little higher this is 3 2 by 4 plates
giving<00:00:36.080> it<00:00:36.170> a<00:00:36.320> four<00:00:36.620> and<00:00:36.740> a<00:00:36.770> half<00:00:36.800> inch<00:00:37.190> dam<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
giving it a four and a half inch dam it

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.510 
giving it a four and a half inch dam it
might<00:00:38.540> finish<00:00:38.960> off<00:00:39.170> at<00:00:39.380> about<00:00:39.590> 5<00:00:39.860> inches<00:00:40.280> but<00:00:40.430> I

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
might finish off at about 5 inches but I

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.760 
might finish off at about 5 inches but I
like<00:00:40.670> to<00:00:40.790> have<00:00:40.880> it<00:00:41.000> a<00:00:41.120> little<00:00:41.150> higher<00:00:41.870> just<00:00:42.530> in

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
like to have it a little higher just in

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.520 
like to have it a little higher just in
case<00:00:43.120> however<00:00:44.120> the<00:00:44.630> point<00:00:44.840> I'd<00:00:45.020> like<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.230> make

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
case however the point I'd like to make

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.890 
case however the point I'd like to make
here<00:00:45.860> is<00:00:45.980> this<00:00:46.580> shower<00:00:46.850> dam<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:47.390> used<00:00:47.690> with

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:47.900 
here is this shower dam was used with

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.140 
here is this shower dam was used with
regular<00:00:48.140> construction<00:00:48.620> standard<00:00:49.460> lumber<00:00:49.940> and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
regular construction standard lumber and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.310 
regular construction standard lumber and
it<00:00:51.050> was<00:00:51.260> nailed<00:00:51.560> together<00:00:52.690> however<00:00:53.690> there<00:00:54.110> is

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
it was nailed together however there is

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.770 
it was nailed together however there is
another<00:00:54.560> way<00:00:55.400> and<00:00:55.790> again<00:00:56.300> this<00:00:56.480> isn't

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
another way and again this isn't

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.870 
another way and again this isn't
something<00:00:57.110> you<00:00:57.500> have<00:00:57.830> to<00:00:58.070> do<00:00:58.220> this<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.640> just

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
something you have to do this is just

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.180 
something you have to do this is just
something<00:00:59.270> I<00:00:59.390> like<00:00:59.690> to<00:00:59.900> do<00:01:00.079> if<00:01:00.290> I<00:01:00.710> have<00:01:00.980> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
something I like to do if I have the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.730 
something I like to do if I have the
extra<00:01:01.520> materials<00:01:02.150> and<00:01:02.450> that<00:01:03.079> would<00:01:03.230> be<00:01:03.380> to<00:01:03.530> use

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
extra materials and that would be to use

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.300 
extra materials and that would be to use
treated<00:01:04.280> lumber<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.879> screws<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.920> screws

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
treated lumber and screws the screws

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.060 
treated lumber and screws the screws
will<00:01:07.790> hold<00:01:07.820> a<00:01:08.690> lot<00:01:08.990> better<00:01:09.320> than<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:09.800> nails

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
will hold a lot better than the nails

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.250 
will hold a lot better than the nails
will<00:01:10.400> what<00:01:10.760> happens<00:01:11.180> sometimes<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.140> the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
will what happens sometimes is that the

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.190 
will what happens sometimes is that the
wood<00:01:12.500> will<00:01:12.830> swell<00:01:13.220> up<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.700> gets<00:01:13.909> wet<00:01:14.200> because

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
wood will swell up it gets wet because

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.570 
wood will swell up it gets wet because
of<00:01:15.290> a<00:01:15.470> leak<00:01:15.680> in<00:01:15.950> the<00:01:16.130> shower<00:01:16.370> pan<00:01:16.940> and<00:01:18.580> starts

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
of a leak in the shower pan and starts

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.780 
of a leak in the shower pan and starts
to<00:01:19.729> swell<00:01:20.000> up<00:01:20.320> forcing<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.920> nails<00:01:22.250> apart

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
to swell up forcing the nails apart

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.080 
to swell up forcing the nails apart
easier<00:01:23.330> than<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:23.990> screws<00:01:24.830> so<00:01:25.580> this<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:25.970> just

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
easier than the screws so this is just

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.120 
easier than the screws so this is just
something<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.570> seen<00:01:26.900> when<00:01:27.409> I<00:01:27.440> was<00:01:27.680> tearing

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
something I seen when I was tearing

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.350 
something I seen when I was tearing
apart<00:01:28.600> showers<00:01:29.600> in<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:29.960> past<00:01:30.370> and<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:32.060> kind<00:01:32.270> of

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
apart showers in the past and it kind of

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.680 
apart showers in the past and it kind of
got<00:01:32.479> me<00:01:32.659> thinking<00:01:33.020> about<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.530> way<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.330> do<00:01:35.330> it<00:01:35.540> a

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
got me thinking about a way to do it a

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.600 
got me thinking about a way to do it a
little<00:01:35.930> better<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:36.770> again<00:01:37.100> I'm<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:37.280> throwing

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
little better so again I'm just throwing

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.570 
little better so again I'm just throwing
that<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:37.909> there<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:39.110> bottom<00:01:39.650> line<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.310> this

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
that out there the bottom line is this

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.420 
that out there the bottom line is this
wood<00:01:40.909> should<00:01:41.240> not<00:01:41.479> get<00:01:41.810> wet<00:01:42.170> anyway<00:01:42.440> if<00:01:43.190> it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
wood should not get wet anyway if it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.430 
wood should not get wet anyway if it
gets<00:01:43.670> wet<00:01:43.940> I<00:01:44.119> don't<00:01:44.360> care<00:01:44.540> if<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:44.750> treated<00:01:45.200> or

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
gets wet I don't care if it's treated or

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.080 
gets wet I don't care if it's treated or
if<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:45.650> regular<00:01:46.010> construction<00:01:46.310> standard

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
if it's regular construction standard

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.770 
if it's regular construction standard
wood<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:48.200> could<00:01:48.920> end<00:01:49.250> up<00:01:49.610> having<00:01:49.850> problems<00:01:50.600> in

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
wood it could end up having problems in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.870 
wood it could end up having problems in
the<00:01:50.900> future<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.619> more<00:01:51.979> than<00:01:52.159> likely<00:01:52.190> it<00:01:52.610> will

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
the future and more than likely it will

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.210 
the future and more than likely it will
let's<00:01:53.360> face<00:01:53.630> it<00:01:53.659> so<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.890> can<00:01:55.070> use

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
let's face it so you can use

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.130 
let's face it so you can use
construction<00:01:55.640> standard<00:01:56.180> lumber<00:01:56.510> if<00:01:56.840> you<00:01:56.990> got

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
construction standard lumber if you got

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.140 
construction standard lumber if you got
some<00:01:57.350> extra<00:01:57.470> pieces<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.220> treated<00:01:59.000> lumber

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
some extra pieces of treated lumber

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.640 
some extra pieces of treated lumber
laying<00:01:59.510> around<00:01:59.659> go<00:02:00.110> ahead<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.260> throw<00:02:00.530> them

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
laying around go ahead and throw them

recommend<00:02:06.229> using<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.590> screws<00:02:07.010> instead<00:02:07.640> of
