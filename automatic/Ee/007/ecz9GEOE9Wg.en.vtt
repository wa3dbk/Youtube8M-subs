welcome<00:00:14.139> back<00:00:14.290> to<00:00:14.470> the<00:00:14.740> cosmic<00:00:15.190> classroom

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
welcome back to the cosmic classroom

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.630 
welcome back to the cosmic classroom
let's<00:00:16.480> now<00:00:16.720> talk<00:00:16.779> about<00:00:17.349> the<00:00:17.470> life<00:00:17.739> of<00:00:18.070> stars

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
let's now talk about the life of stars

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.499 
let's now talk about the life of stars
that<00:00:19.409> leaving<00:00:20.409> live<00:00:20.949> in<00:00:21.099> pairs<00:00:21.429> double<00:00:22.179> stars

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
that leaving live in pairs double stars

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.040 
that leaving live in pairs double stars
alright<00:00:23.230> or<00:00:23.829> a<00:00:23.859> binary<00:00:24.399> system<00:00:24.970> so<00:00:25.839> what

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
alright or a binary system so what

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.429 
alright or a binary system so what
happens<00:00:26.529> to<00:00:26.769> a<00:00:27.249> white<00:00:27.699> dwarf<00:00:27.880> it<00:00:28.479> dies<00:00:28.749> and

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
happens to a white dwarf it dies and

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.559 
happens to a white dwarf it dies and
then<00:00:29.589> what<00:00:29.919> you<00:00:30.460> know<00:00:30.579> it<00:00:30.699> becomes<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.149> it's<00:00:31.449> a

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:31.569 
then what you know it becomes a it's a

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:33.000 
then what you know it becomes a it's a
white<00:00:31.749> dwarf<00:00:31.899> and<00:00:32.200> then<00:00:32.290> what<00:00:32.439> happens<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:32.980> it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
white dwarf and then what happens to it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.350 
white dwarf and then what happens to it
so<00:00:33.160> they<00:00:33.310> just<00:00:33.520> sit<00:00:33.820> there<00:00:35.460> well<00:00:36.460> if<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.180> white

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
so they just sit there well if the white

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.110 
so they just sit there well if the white
dwarf<00:00:37.720> is<00:00:37.870> isolated<00:00:38.740> yes<00:00:39.250> it<00:00:39.520> will<00:00:39.670> just<00:00:39.910> sit

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
dwarf is isolated yes it will just sit

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.660 
dwarf is isolated yes it will just sit
there<00:00:40.360> you<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.080> cool<00:00:41.440> down<00:00:41.470> and<00:00:42.220> it<00:00:42.520> will

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
there you to cool down and it will

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.640 
there you to cool down and it will
eventually<00:00:43.120> become<00:00:43.270> a<00:00:43.450> black<00:00:43.840> dwarf<00:00:44.140> that<00:00:44.530> we

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
eventually become a black dwarf that we

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.390 
eventually become a black dwarf that we
cannot<00:00:45.010> see<00:00:45.430> any<00:00:45.700> more<00:00:46.380> now<00:00:47.380> if<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:48.190> white

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
cannot see any more now if the white

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.930 
cannot see any more now if the white
dwarf<00:00:48.580> has<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.200> companion<00:00:50.200> in<00:00:50.740> life<00:00:50.770> is<00:00:51.460> much

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
dwarf has a companion in life is much

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.610 
dwarf has a companion in life is much
more<00:00:52.420> interesting<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:55.510> things<00:00:56.140> happen

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
more interesting and more things happen

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.120 
more interesting and more things happen
so<00:00:57.400> let's<00:00:58.030> look<00:00:58.239> for<00:00:58.480> example<00:00:59.020> at<00:00:59.230> serious<00:00:59.860> and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
so let's look for example at serious and

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.090 
so let's look for example at serious and
it's<00:01:00.250> white<00:01:00.550> dwarf<00:01:00.970> companion<00:01:01.739> so<00:01:02.739> it's<00:01:02.950> a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
it's white dwarf companion so it's a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.219 
it's white dwarf companion so it's a
little<00:01:03.430> thing<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.910> is<00:01:04.119> white<00:01:04.329> wolf<00:01:04.659> near<00:01:05.019> this

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
little thing it is white wolf near this

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.300 
little thing it is white wolf near this
big<00:01:05.590> star<00:01:06.340> series<00:01:07.259> but<00:01:08.259> this<00:01:08.409> white<00:01:08.710> dwarf<00:01:09.069> is

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
big star series but this white dwarf is

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.849 
big star series but this white dwarf is
really<00:01:09.850> important<00:01:10.659> in<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.049> life<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.740> the

00:01:11.849 --> 00:01:11.859 
really important in the life of the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:15.389 
really important in the life of the
system<00:01:12.609> right<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.749> companionship<00:01:14.469> is<00:01:14.890> really

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
system right the companionship is really

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.080 
system right the companionship is really
important<00:01:15.969> so<00:01:16.859> if<00:01:17.859> you<00:01:18.009> have<00:01:18.159> a<00:01:18.189> system<00:01:18.789> on

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
important so if you have a system on

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.239 
important so if you have a system on
which<00:01:19.149> one<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.259> stars<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.770> already<00:01:21.130> a

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
which one of the stars is already a

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:24.480 
which one of the stars is already a
white<00:01:21.460> dwarf<00:01:21.609> and<00:01:22.499> there<00:01:23.499> is<00:01:23.590> another<00:01:23.619> star<00:01:24.249> so

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
white dwarf and there is another star so

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.669 
white dwarf and there is another star so
there<00:01:24.639> are<00:01:24.700> two<00:01:24.880> stars<00:01:25.240> let's<00:01:26.200> say<00:01:26.350> this<00:01:26.499> is

00:01:26.669 --> 00:01:26.679 
there are two stars let's say this is

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:28.309 
there are two stars let's say this is
the<00:01:26.710> white<00:01:26.979> dwarf<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.639> this<00:01:27.789> is<00:01:27.939> another

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
the white dwarf and this is another

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.169 
the white dwarf and this is another
regular<00:01:29.319> main-sequence<00:01:29.889> star<00:01:30.369> and<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
regular main-sequence star and the

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:32.969 
regular main-sequence star and the
orbiting<00:01:31.780> each<00:01:31.810> other<00:01:32.109> and<00:01:32.380> they<00:01:32.530> are<00:01:32.619> happy

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
orbiting each other and they are happy

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.410 
orbiting each other and they are happy
with<00:01:33.130> their<00:01:33.189> life<00:01:33.579> together<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:35.619> eventually

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
with their life together but eventually

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.999 
with their life together but eventually
this<00:01:37.420> star<00:01:37.749> here<00:01:37.959> that<00:01:38.139> is<00:01:38.289> the<00:01:38.469> main<00:01:38.679> sequence

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
this star here that is the main sequence

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.359 
this star here that is the main sequence
will<00:01:39.429> also<00:01:39.880> die<00:01:40.119> and<00:01:40.539> as<00:01:41.259> it<00:01:41.439> dies<00:01:41.679> as<00:01:42.159> all

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
will also die and as it dies as all

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.629 
will also die and as it dies as all
stars<00:01:42.969> die<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:44.380> expand<00:01:45.039> they<00:01:45.279> become<00:01:45.609> one

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
stars die they expand they become one

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:49.019 
stars die they expand they become one
big<00:01:46.329> thing<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.279> star<00:01:48.579> starts<00:01:48.939> to

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:49.029 
big thing when this star starts to

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:53.340 
big thing when this star starts to
expand<00:01:49.569> its<00:01:49.950> surface<00:01:50.950> gets<00:01:51.399> close<00:01:51.939> enough<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
expand its surface gets close enough to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.379 
expand its surface gets close enough to
the<00:01:53.499> white<00:01:53.709> dwarf<00:01:53.859> that<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:54.969> white<00:01:55.179> dwarf

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
the white dwarf that the white dwarf

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.779 
the white dwarf that the white dwarf
starts<00:01:55.929> to<00:01:56.109> steal<00:01:56.619> material<00:01:56.889> from<00:01:57.579> the

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
starts to steal material from the

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.059 
starts to steal material from the
surface<00:01:57.819> of<00:01:58.389> this<00:01:58.599> star<00:01:58.929> and<00:01:59.679> that's<00:01:59.859> what

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
surface of this star and that's what

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.149 
surface of this star and that's what
this<00:02:00.219> drawing<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.969> showing<00:02:01.509> you<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.979> the

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
this drawing is showing you that the

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.569 
this drawing is showing you that the
white<00:02:03.429> dwarf<00:02:03.639> companion<00:02:05.429> stealing<00:02:06.429> material

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:06.579 
white dwarf companion stealing material

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.130 
white dwarf companion stealing material
and<00:02:07.530> forming<00:02:08.530> an<00:02:08.619> external<00:02:09.280> layer<00:02:09.610> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and forming an external layer of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.870 
and forming an external layer of
hydrogen<00:02:11.140> around<00:02:11.500> it<00:02:11.740> well<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.550> white<00:02:12.730> dwarf

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
hydrogen around it well the white dwarf

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.770 
hydrogen around it well the white dwarf
is<00:02:13.240> really

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
is really

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.740 
is really
hot<00:02:13.900> right<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.470> core<00:02:14.890> of<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.280> star<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:16.600> as

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
hot right it's the core of a star so as

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.860 
hot right it's the core of a star so as
the<00:02:16.900> hydrogen<00:02:17.470> heats<00:02:17.890> there<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:19.240> it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
the hydrogen heats there and it

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.320 
the hydrogen heats there and it
accumulates<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.650> little<00:02:20.890> bit<00:02:21.010> there<00:02:21.190> The<00:02:21.640> Star

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
accumulates a little bit there The Star

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.260 
accumulates a little bit there The Star
comes<00:02:22.690> back<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.890> life<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.520> touch<00:02:24.760> fusing

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
comes back to life it's touch fusing

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.540 
comes back to life it's touch fusing
hydrogen<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:25.840> helium<00:02:25.990> again<00:02:26.650> so<00:02:27.370> the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
hydrogen into helium again so the

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.490

life there's fusion happening again the
star<00:02:32.230> will<00:02:32.380> shine<00:02:32.410> brightly<00:02:33.160> again<00:02:33.459> and<00:02:34.450> it

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
star will shine brightly again and it

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.690

all around when the star explode it also

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.330

affects the neighboring star the one
that<00:04:00.489> was<00:04:00.670> its<00:04:00.850> partner<00:04:01.390> it<00:04:01.930> also<00:04:02.140> blows<00:04:02.560> that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
that was its partner it also blows that

parts<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.940> star<00:04:13.299> will<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.840> blown<00:04:14.290> away

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
parts of that star will be blown away

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.250 
parts of that star will be blown away
right<00:04:15.340> because<00:04:15.730> of<00:04:15.760> so<00:04:16.150> much<00:04:16.419> energy<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.140> that

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.779 
right because of so much energy in that
explosion<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:18.870> we<00:04:19.870> call<00:04:20.140> supernova<00:04:20.950> with<00:04:21.579> this

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
are two stars in the supernova that

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.510 
are two stars in the supernova that
explodes<00:04:55.330> when<00:04:56.080> there<00:04:56.290> is<00:04:56.410> a<00:04:56.440> one<00:04:56.740> big<00:04:57.130> massive

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
explodes when there is a one big massive

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.790 
explodes when there is a one big massive
star<00:04:58.060> exploding<00:04:58.690> it's<00:04:58.900> one<00:04:59.260> big<00:04:59.500> massive

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
star exploding it's one big massive

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.500 
star exploding it's one big massive
start<00:05:00.220> exploding<00:05:00.550> that's<00:05:01.180> called<00:05:01.450> a

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
start exploding that's called a

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.740 
start exploding that's called a
supernova<00:05:01.840> type<00:05:02.230> 2<00:05:03.150> so<00:05:04.150> if<00:05:04.210> you're<00:05:04.330> trying<00:05:04.600> to

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
supernova type 2 so if you're trying to

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.570 
supernova type 2 so if you're trying to
use<00:05:05.020> that<00:05:05.230> to<00:05:05.410> memorize<00:05:05.830> do<00:05:06.160> the<00:05:06.310> reverse

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
use that to memorize do the reverse

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.520 
use that to memorize do the reverse
right<00:05:06.910> if<00:05:07.120> there<00:05:07.420> are<00:05:07.480> two<00:05:07.660> stars<00:05:07.990> it's<00:05:08.290> super

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
right if there are two stars it's super

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.110 
right if there are two stars it's super
number<00:05:08.770> one<00:05:08.950> if<00:05:09.310> there<00:05:09.520> is<00:05:09.580> one<00:05:09.820> star

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
number one if there is one star

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.050 
number one if there is one star
supernova<00:05:10.510> type<00:05:10.870> 2<00:05:11.080> I<00:05:11.490> won't<00:05:12.490> go<00:05:12.670> on<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:12.910> why

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
supernova type 2 I won't go on the why

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.880 
supernova type 2 I won't go on the why
the<00:05:13.090> why<00:05:13.480> it<00:05:13.540> has<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:13.870> do<00:05:13.960> with<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.200> lines<00:05:14.470> the

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
the why it has to do with the lines the

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.590 
the why it has to do with the lines the
way<00:05:15.010> they<00:05:15.130> will<00:05:15.220> classify<00:05:15.460> before<00:05:16.180> we<00:05:16.420> knew

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
way they will classify before we knew

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.370 
way they will classify before we knew
what<00:05:16.630> they<00:05:16.990> were<00:05:17.050> but<00:05:17.980> that's<00:05:18.190> what<00:05:18.400> it<00:05:18.430> is<00:05:19.380> so

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
what they were but that's what it is so

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.030 
what they were but that's what it is so
I<00:05:20.770> had<00:05:21.160> a<00:05:21.190> lot<00:05:21.280> of<00:05:21.460> questions<00:05:22.000> about<00:05:22.770> why<00:05:23.770> just

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
I had a lot of questions about why just

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.980 
I had a lot of questions about why just
binary<00:05:24.280> systems<00:05:25.060> is<00:05:25.300> it<00:05:25.420> possible<00:05:25.840> to<00:05:25.960> have

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
binary systems is it possible to have

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.920 
binary systems is it possible to have
three<00:05:26.680> or<00:05:27.040> multiple<00:05:27.520> stellar<00:05:27.790> systems<00:05:28.420> and

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
three or multiple stellar systems and

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.300 
three or multiple stellar systems and
yes<00:05:29.470> we<00:05:29.740> can<00:05:29.950> have<00:05:30.220> multiple<00:05:30.430> stellar<00:05:30.940> systems

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
yes we can have multiple stellar systems

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.650 
yes we can have multiple stellar systems
in<00:05:33.310> fact<00:05:33.670> there<00:05:33.880> are<00:05:33.910> a<00:05:34.000> lot<00:05:34.150> of<00:05:34.180> multiple

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
in fact there are a lot of multiple

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.510 
in fact there are a lot of multiple
stellar<00:05:34.900> systems<00:05:35.440> in<00:05:35.680> fact<00:05:36.010> there<00:05:36.190> are<00:05:36.220> more

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
stellar systems in fact there are more

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.270 
stellar systems in fact there are more
more<00:05:36.790> more<00:05:37.440> systems<00:05:38.440> with<00:05:38.620> more<00:05:38.920> than<00:05:39.070> one

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
more more systems with more than one

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.250 
more more systems with more than one
start<00:05:39.610> then<00:05:39.820> systems<00:05:40.300> with<00:05:40.450> just<00:05:40.690> one<00:05:40.930> star

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:41.260 
start then systems with just one star

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.360 
start then systems with just one star
out<00:05:41.950> there<00:05:42.010> alright<00:05:43.050> so<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.440> star<00:05:44.770> like<00:05:44.920> the<00:05:45.130> Sun

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
out there alright so a star like the Sun

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.720 
out there alright so a star like the Sun
it's<00:05:45.640> less<00:05:46.060> common<00:05:46.870> then<00:05:47.650> stars<00:05:48.100> that<00:05:48.430> leave

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
it's less common then stars that leave

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.230 
it's less common then stars that leave
with<00:05:49.450> partners<00:05:49.990> with<00:05:50.710> other<00:05:50.860> stars<00:05:51.250> so<00:05:52.060> there

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
with partners with other stars so there

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.330 
with partners with other stars so there
are<00:05:52.270> lots<00:05:52.510> of<00:05:52.720> those<00:05:52.900> out<00:05:53.140> there<00:05:53.170> I<00:05:53.710> have<00:05:54.160> two

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
are lots of those out there I have two

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.940 
are lots of those out there I have two
examples<00:05:54.940> here<00:05:55.090> one<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:56.440> must<00:05:56.620> be<00:05:56.710> very

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
examples here one that you must be very

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.560 
examples here one that you must be very
fact<00:05:57.280> that<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.490> may<00:05:57.610> be<00:05:57.670> very<00:05:57.790> familiar<00:05:58.210> with

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
fact that you may be very familiar with

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:02.040 
fact that you may be very familiar with
its<00:05:59.200> Polaris<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.250> North<00:06:00.430> Star<00:06:00.840> it's<00:06:01.840> not

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
its Polaris the North Star it's not

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.260 
its Polaris the North Star it's not
really<00:06:02.260> one<00:06:02.560> star<00:06:02.890> it's<00:06:03.130> three<00:06:03.670> as<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:03.970> can

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
really one star it's three as you can

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.630 
really one star it's three as you can
see<00:06:04.510> with<00:06:05.290> your<00:06:05.410> naked<00:06:05.470> eye<00:06:06.010> it's<00:06:06.310> impossible

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640 
see with your naked eye it's impossible

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.880 
see with your naked eye it's impossible
to<00:06:07.030> see<00:06:07.330> because<00:06:07.540> their<00:06:07.870> companions<00:06:08.440> are<00:06:08.590> very

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:08.890 
to see because their companions are very

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.300 
to see because their companions are very
bright<00:06:09.790> very<00:06:09.970> diem<00:06:10.900> and<00:06:11.200> very<00:06:11.620> close<00:06:11.980> to<00:06:12.280> the

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
bright very diem and very close to the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.090 
bright very diem and very close to the
main<00:06:12.580> star<00:06:12.970> but<00:06:13.630> it's<00:06:13.810> actually<00:06:13.960> a<00:06:14.320> system<00:06:14.950> of

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
main star but it's actually a system of

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.940 
main star but it's actually a system of
three<00:06:15.280> stars<00:06:15.670> bellaire<00:06:16.600> is<00:06:16.750> a<00:06:16.960> polar<00:06:17.380> is<00:06:17.620> a<00:06:17.740> B

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
three stars bellaire is a polar is a B

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.140 
three stars bellaire is a polar is a B
and<00:06:18.190> polaris<00:06:18.700> be<00:06:19.140> right<00:06:20.140> and<00:06:21.040> here<00:06:21.550> is<00:06:21.670> just<00:06:22.000> a

stars<00:06:30.370> here<00:06:30.640> and<00:06:30.820> this<00:06:31.420> little<00:06:31.840> star<00:06:32.260> is

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:32.590 
stars here and this little star is

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.510 
stars here and this little star is
orbiting<00:06:33.550> this<00:06:33.880> one<00:06:34.810> almost<00:06:35.680> like<00:06:36.040> a<00:06:36.070> moon

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 
orbiting this one almost like a moon

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.760 
orbiting this one almost like a moon
orbiting<00:06:36.850> a<00:06:37.060> planet<00:06:37.090> except<00:06:37.960> that<00:06:38.140> it's<00:06:38.320> that

orbiting a planet except that it's that

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.559 
orbiting a planet except that it's that
they<00:06:38.950> are<00:06:39.070> two<00:06:39.280> stars

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
they are two stars

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:43.369 
they are two stars
those<00:06:40.779> two<00:06:41.050> stars<00:06:41.409> are<00:06:41.800> orbiting<00:06:42.189> each<00:06:42.399> other

those two stars are orbiting each other

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:47.389 
those two stars are orbiting each other
and<00:06:44.379> you<00:06:44.499> may<00:06:44.619> have<00:06:45.629> many<00:06:46.629> stars<00:06:47.050> together

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:47.399 
and you may have many stars together

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:50.639 
and you may have many stars together
right<00:06:48.399> when<00:06:49.029> a<00:06:49.059> supernova<00:06:49.509> happens<00:06:50.229> all<00:06:50.589> the

or three they will just be sent away if

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.639 
or three they will just be sent away if
most<00:06:58.300> of<00:06:58.539> them<00:06:58.719> will<00:06:58.869> be<00:06:58.990> close<00:06:59.259> enough<00:06:59.469> to

00:06:59.639 --> 00:06:59.649 
most of them will be close enough to

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.829 
most of them will be close enough to
supernova<00:07:00.490> that<00:07:00.669> they<00:07:01.179> won't<00:07:01.389> be<00:07:01.539> able<00:07:01.659> to

supernova that they won't be able to

supernova that they won't be able to
survive<00:07:02.229> they'll<00:07:02.619> really<00:07:02.830> just<00:07:03.129> be<00:07:03.429> sent<00:07:03.759> away
