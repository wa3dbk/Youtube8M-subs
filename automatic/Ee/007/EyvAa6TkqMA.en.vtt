 So we have the caps with the important ones 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.929
 micro nutrients more because I find 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.050
 here still blueberry brought mushrooms 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.590

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.819
 Example open fetched paprika tomatoes 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.850
 Here are a few grapes and state 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.220
 Zucchini so what I have stated 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.930
 When I became a vegan you can 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.780
 really look that you are extremely many 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.580
 Vegetables extremely many fruits can 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.870
 mix everything up and mine 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.670
 lunch is always like that 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.440
 for my carbohydrates with lunch 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.660
 For example, I have quinoa then 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.239
 I for example as it for example 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.130
 rice or quinoa and I always have 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.370
 lots of vegetables for example tomato 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.170
 cucumber mushrooms corn kidney beans there are 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.400
 still a few wise with it is so 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.380
 really important if you are vegan 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.090
 it really wants to be extremely much 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.090
 vegetables and extremely many fruits a day 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.650
 so that you get everything in, yes 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.660
 otherwise, of course, it is also important, yes, of course 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.190
 so say something to the diet 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.350
 So for me personally is also 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.600
 just so important that I get these things 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.769
 all because I just remember how 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.049
 I can do much better if I can 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.700
 everyone has that means for me too 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.079
 a meal just incomplete if 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.400
 I somehow just got rice and one 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.950
 little broccoli that's just too easy for me 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.959
 Little does not want a solid shell with vegetables 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.579
 I want to mean of mine in between 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.709
 next fruits taste fruits 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.810
 in between always and that's it too 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.549
 what keeps you alive that its 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.930
 real foods do not know death 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.640
 not a total bullshit 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.079
 But here, too, for example, at the lidl 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.209
 had to look where it is in the 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.170
 origin because now often easy 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.640
 mass instead of class 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.290
 that means we have watery 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.510
 food hardly ever 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 That is why micronutrients are there too 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.870
 please be careful now was here 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.610
 have the purchased let's see how it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.180
 you do not immediately taste something 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.530
 But that is by and large that is 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.990
 actually only vegetables and fruits 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.320
 so I'll recommend what I recommend to you 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.760
 can 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.650
 for the people a bit now 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.940
 have like the bit to have sex 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.400
 and maybe not right now 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.170
 amstetten are like that 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.480
 dry fruits tastes really cool 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.070
 for example, there are these cranberries 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.750
 then these dates and so there's 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.130
 right four everything tastes right 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.520
 masters can also video over it again 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.200
 do 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.090
 for snacks and stuff and looks otherwise 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.070
 definitely is very important even if you 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.350
 not vegan if you are your turkey or 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.690
 what I am what really looks like that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.940
 here many vegetables and many fruits on 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.880
 day it is just damn important for 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:29.150
 your micronutrient needs it and that 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.710
