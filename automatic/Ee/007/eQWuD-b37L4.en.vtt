virtualization product in Windows
virtual<00:00:26.099> pc<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.660> found<00:00:28.230> that<00:00:28.349> when<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> went

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
virtual pc but found that when I went

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.330 
virtual pc but found that when I went
out<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:30.199> basically<00:00:31.199> download<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.980> play<00:00:32.130> with

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
out to basically download and play with

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.760 
out to basically download and play with
windows<00:00:32.700> 8<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.480> initially<00:00:34.140> didn't<00:00:34.440> run<00:00:34.620> in

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
windows 8 it initially didn't run in

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.590 
windows 8 it initially didn't run in
there<00:00:34.890> virtualization<00:00:35.460> environment<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.360> that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
there virtualization environment so that

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
there virtualization environment so that
got<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.050> looking<00:00:37.380> at<00:00:37.500> virtual<00:00:37.829> box<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.520> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
got me looking at virtual box and when I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.729 
got me looking at virtual box and when I
found<00:00:38.790> out<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.059> how<00:00:39.570> flexible<00:00:40.050> virtual<00:00:40.500> box

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
found out that how flexible virtual box

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.400 
found out that how flexible virtual box
is<00:00:41.010> in<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.760> aspect<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.780> only<00:00:42.899> runs<00:00:43.230> on

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
is in the aspect of it not only runs on

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.400 
is in the aspect of it not only runs on
Windows<00:00:43.829> but<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> runs<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.579> OS<00:00:44.760> X<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.450> runs<00:00:46.110> on

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
Windows but it runs on OS X it runs on

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.220 
Windows but it runs on OS X it runs on
other<00:00:46.920> operating<00:00:47.460> systems<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:48.570> linux<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
other operating systems in linux and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.069 
other operating systems in linux and
unix<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.710> it's<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.309> great<00:00:50.489> cross<00:00:51.030> platform<00:00:51.750> tool

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
unix so it's a great cross platform tool

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.069 
unix so it's a great cross platform tool
for<00:00:52.350> virtualization<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.360> i<00:00:54.360> highly

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
for virtualization and i highly

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.810 
for virtualization and i highly
recommend<00:00:55.649> my<00:00:55.770> students<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> i'm

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.119 
sure that your if your machine is older
that<00:02:05.610> your<00:02:05.759> BIOS<00:02:06.469> virtualization<00:02:07.469> is<00:02:07.829> turned

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
that your BIOS virtualization is turned

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.520 
that your BIOS virtualization is turned
on<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:08.489> pretty<00:02:08.759> sure<00:02:08.940> that's<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.330> the

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
on I'm pretty sure that's in the

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.809 
on I'm pretty sure that's in the
processor<00:02:10.530> section<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:11.039> your<00:02:11.160> bias<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.670> go

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
processor section of your bias so go

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.940 
processor section of your bias so go
check<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.090> out<00:02:12.270> alright<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:13.410> let's<00:02:13.620> go<00:02:13.739> ahead

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
check that out alright so let's go ahead

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.100 
check that out alright so let's go ahead
and<00:02:14.099> do<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.550> install<00:02:14.940> I've<00:02:15.540> gone<00:02:15.780> ahead<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
and do the install I've gone ahead and

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
and do the install I've gone ahead and
fired<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.680> from<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:16.950> download<00:02:17.010> so<00:02:17.580> I'll<00:02:17.760> get

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
fired it up from my download so I'll get

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.300 
fired it up from my download so I'll get
rid<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.599> I'll<00:02:18.870> say<00:02:19.140> run<00:02:19.410> it's

couple security warnings here so we'll

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.870 
couple security warnings here so we'll
look<00:02:53.220> for<00:02:53.459> those<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:56.250> copying<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.760> new

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.870 
environment when i'm done i can just
tell<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:12.930> don't<00:04:13.320> save<00:04:13.590> the<00:04:13.800> changes<00:04:14.220> and<00:04:14.370> get

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
tell it don't save the changes and get

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.759 
tell it don't save the changes and get
back<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.210> that<00:04:15.240> brand<00:04:15.720> new<00:04:15.840> virtual<00:04:16.140> machine<00:04:16.350> i

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
back to that brand new virtual machine i

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.280 
back to that brand new virtual machine i
had<00:04:16.980> when<00:04:17.519> i<00:04:17.549> started<00:04:18.090> before<00:04:18.330> playing<00:04:19.020> with

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
had when i started before playing with

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.880 
had when i started before playing with
it<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:19.620> there's<00:04:19.799> windows<00:04:20.190> seven<00:04:20.760> I<00:04:21.570> run<00:04:22.109> 64-bit

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
it so there's windows seven I run 64-bit

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.800 
it so there's windows seven I run 64-bit
so<00:04:23.220> i'm<00:04:23.310> going<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> say<00:04:23.610> windows<00:04:23.910> 7<00:04:24.240> 64-bit

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
so i'm going to say windows 7 64-bit

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.120 
so i'm going to say windows 7 64-bit
next<00:04:25.610> now<00:04:26.610> i<00:04:26.640> can<00:04:26.820> choose<00:04:27.030> as<00:04:27.210> much<00:04:27.600> memory<00:04:27.840> as

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
next now i can choose as much memory as

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.740 
next now i can choose as much memory as
i<00:04:29.130> want<00:04:29.400> since<00:04:29.700> i've<00:04:29.850> got<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.120> machine<00:04:30.510> with

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
i want since i've got a machine with

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.200 
i want since i've got a machine with
eight<00:04:31.050> gigs<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.560> memory<00:04:31.710> i'm<00:04:31.980> going<00:04:32.190> to<00:04:32.250> jack

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
eight gigs of memory i'm going to jack

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.750 
eight gigs of memory i'm going to jack
that<00:04:33.450> up<00:04:33.600> to<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> gig<00:04:34.320> remember<00:04:35.130> that<00:04:35.250> memory<00:04:35.669> is

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that up to a gig remember that memory is

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.180 
that up to a gig remember that memory is
statically<00:04:36.690> allocated<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.500> virtual<00:04:37.830> machines

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
statically allocated to virtual machines

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.010 
statically allocated to virtual machines
so<00:04:38.430> when<00:04:38.580> I<00:04:38.610> fire<00:04:38.970> up<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.210> virtual<00:04:39.690> machine

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so when I fire up that virtual machine

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.900 
so when I fire up that virtual machine
that<00:04:40.560> whole<00:04:40.860> gig<00:04:41.100> of<00:04:41.220> memory<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.790> be

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
that whole gig of memory is going to be

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.240 
that whole gig of memory is going to be
used<00:04:42.270> for<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:43.169> more<00:04:43.380> member<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.830> the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
used for it the more member you have the

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.100 
used for it the more member you have the
faster<00:04:44.640> the<00:04:44.730> virtual<00:04:45.030> machines<00:04:45.390> run<00:04:45.690> the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
faster the virtual machines run the

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.450 
faster the virtual machines run the
better<00:04:46.290> performance<00:04:46.890> you're<00:04:47.040> going<00:04:47.190> to<00:04:47.250> see

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
better performance you're going to see

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.760 
better performance you're going to see
next<00:04:49.580> startup<00:04:50.580> disk<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.300> if<00:04:51.600> i<00:04:51.840> have<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:52.200> virtual

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
next startup disk so if i have a virtual

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.070 
next startup disk so if i have a virtual
machine<00:04:53.070> i<00:04:53.100> can<00:04:53.400> create<00:04:53.640> a<00:04:53.730> shell<00:04:54.030> and

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
machine i can create a shell and

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.560 
machine i can create a shell and
reference<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.500> another<00:04:56.300> virtual<00:04:57.300> hard

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
reference it to another virtual hard

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.170 
reference it to another virtual hard
drive<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.100> case<00:04:59.340> i'm<00:04:59.520> going<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.790> just<00:04:59.970> say

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
drive in this case i'm going to just say

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.120 
drive in this case i'm going to just say
next<00:05:00.690> as<00:05:00.810> you<00:05:00.960> would<00:05:01.169> for<00:05:01.350> your<00:05:01.500> first<00:05:01.830> machine

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
next as you would for your first machine

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.940 
next as you would for your first machine
now<00:05:03.090> here<00:05:03.390> i<00:05:03.419> need<00:05:03.690> to<00:05:03.810> choose<00:05:04.080> which<00:05:04.410> virtual

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
now here i need to choose which virtual

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.540 
now here i need to choose which virtual
disk<00:05:05.220> to<00:05:06.000> create<00:05:06.510> VDI<00:05:07.440> is<00:05:07.560> the<00:05:07.919> VirtualBox

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
disk to create VDI is the VirtualBox

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.760 
disk to create VDI is the VirtualBox
disk<00:05:08.970> image<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.600> then<00:05:10.080> we<00:05:10.230> have<00:05:10.380> virtual

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
disk image and then we have virtual

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.740 
disk image and then we have virtual
machine<00:05:11.130> disk<00:05:11.160> virtual<00:05:11.910> hard<00:05:12.210> disk<00:05:12.510> which<00:05:12.720> is

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
machine disk virtual hard disk which is

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.780 
machine disk virtual hard disk which is
used<00:05:13.080> by<00:05:13.350> Microsoft's<00:05:14.190> virtualization

what<00:05:18.390> you<00:05:18.510> need<00:05:18.660> to<00:05:18.780> know<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:19.080> if<00:05:19.200> you're<00:05:19.320> going

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
what you need to know is if you're going

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.740 
what you need to know is if you're going
to<00:05:19.500> try<00:05:19.890> to<00:05:19.919> move<00:05:20.250> virtual<00:05:20.760> machines<00:05:21.180> to<00:05:21.480> other

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
to try to move virtual machines to other

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.260 
to try to move virtual machines to other
virtualization<00:05:22.460> platforms<00:05:23.460> you're<00:05:24.060> going<00:05:24.210> to

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
virtualization platforms you're going to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.000 
virtualization platforms you're going to
have<00:05:24.390> to<00:05:24.510> do<00:05:24.630> some<00:05:24.840> research<00:05:25.020> and<00:05:25.440> pick<00:05:25.770> which

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
have to do some research and pick which

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.870 
have to do some research and pick which
one

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
one

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.840 
one
since<00:05:27.000> this<00:05:27.180> platform<00:05:28.100> virtualbox<00:05:29.100> can<00:05:29.730> be

next screen as 20 gigabytes so if I know

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.020 
next screen as 20 gigabytes so if I know
I<00:05:55.320> don't<00:05:55.440> need<00:05:55.830> a<00:05:55.860> file<00:05:56.310> ever<00:05:56.610> going<00:05:56.850> to<00:05:56.910> grow

I don't need a file ever going to grow

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:59.300 
I don't need a file ever going to grow
that<00:05:57.330> big<00:05:57.600> I<00:05:57.870> can<00:05:58.320> go<00:05:58.440> ahead<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.710> reduce<00:05:58.920> that

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
that big I can go ahead and reduce that

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.760 
that big I can go ahead and reduce that
but<00:05:59.550> by<00:05:59.700> saying<00:05:59.970> dynamically<00:06:00.540> allocated<00:06:01.290> it's

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
but by saying dynamically allocated it's

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.920 
but by saying dynamically allocated it's
not<00:06:02.040> going<00:06:02.280> to<00:06:02.370> allocate<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.210> whole<00:06:03.450> 20
