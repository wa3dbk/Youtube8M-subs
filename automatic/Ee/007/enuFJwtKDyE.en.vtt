00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
After asking all around, we were able to locate the meat dog auction market that we heard to be taking place in the woods.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
“Meat Dog” Auction Market.  A secret market where only the dog traders and dog  middleman are allowed in.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Various breeds of dogs are locked up in metal cages.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
You can also see pet dogs in the size of a human arm.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
OO Health Food Center.  
We decided to investigate the process of acquiring dogs to sale at the auction market with a  dog trader who operates a Health Food Center.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Sell your dog!  Sell your dog!
This dog trader drives around villages early  every morning and buys dogs that people bring to him.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Man: This is a dog my brother brought from when he used to work at Jindo.  

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Not knowing why he is being taken there, the dog is struggling to resist getting on the truck.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
However, the dog owner is coldheartedly pushing the dog he was raising into the cage.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And then he gives a small Balbari dog for free as a bonus.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I paid 70,000 Korean won ($66 USD) for them but I can sell the large one for about 100,000 Korean won ($94 USD).  

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I make a profit of 30,000 Korean won ($28 USD) when I sell it at the auction.  That’s good enough for me.  Ha-ha….  And the Balbari was free.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Undercover:  Is Balbari all profit?
Dog trader:  Yes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
At the next village, about 3-4 people are waiting to sell their dogs they have been raising at home to the dog trader.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This time there are small typical pet dogs.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Women:  Buy these 2 dogs.  They are Shih Tzu.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Dog trader:  What do I do with these tiny ones?
Women:  I don’t know.  You can butcher them.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Dog trader:  Are they free or do you want money for them?
Women:  Of course, you need to pay me.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Dog trader:  How much?
Women:   I don’t know.  I will take whatever you offer.  Ha-ha….

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 Auction market is where the dogs sold to the dog traders like these are sold.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.000
“Meat Dog” Auction Market.
In the early morning, this market is crowded with dog traders trying to sell their dogs and the middleman.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
In this location the dog auction takes place every morning for 2 hours.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.000
After selecting the dogs you want the price is negotiated and the dogs are weighed on the scales to finalize the price.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Metal cages are full of dogs all pushed in together.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Among them are the dogs that were presumed to be former pets.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
New born puppies are also traded here.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Among the dogs sold off at auction, we notice a Dalmatian.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Undercover:  Is this a Dalmatian?
Man:  Yes.  It’s a Dalmatian.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Undercover:  How are they used?
Man:  These are all meat dogs.  No one buys dogs here to raise as pet.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
On another truck, there are Cocker Spaniels in the cage.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Undercover:  Aren’t they pedigrees?
Man:  So what if they are pedigrees?  That’s doesn’t matter here.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Undercover:  Where do you sell them to?
Man:  Of course to the dog meat restaurants.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
How do former pets end up in these meat dog auction markets?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We asked the dog trader.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
People abandon pet dogs on the streets when they get sick.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
These abandoned dogs ends up in dog meat market.  No one raises pet dogs to eat.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Debating whether to eat these abandoned former pets that were like part of a family is a contradiction.
