00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:07.360
 he definitely didn't feel superior 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.920
 arrogantly 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.630
 this surely because inter is one 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.050
 very experienced team, a team that has 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.529
 great quality in a single 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:21.909
 team that is very practical 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:24.609
 surely more than us and therefore must 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.589
 also play with personality like 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.779
 demonstrated in the last game here with 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.759
 the same intensity if it is possible and 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.739
 the other question is this 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.200
 the absence of sneijder for example also 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:39.730
 of building is an advantage 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.340
 let's play and 9 is not a question 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.350
 it is not a question if they played and 9 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.260
 yes but unfortunately I fear they play in 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.580
 in short, eleven have us in Cassano, that is, no 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.020
 they have us 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.850
 in short, there is an important player 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.100
 also that they can make up for the absence 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.640
 as a sneijder but so far have not 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.920
 made of extraordinary things 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.290
 cassano not the others 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 you have reminded others that 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.199
 could still replace but I want 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.850
 to say 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:14.229
 inter is not doing great 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:16.149
 things here is one more point we are 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.249
 really unless I am much 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:24.869
 I agree I don't really agree 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:24.869
 they have a point more than us at home that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.049
 pradè will be released yesterday that he is a dreamer 

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:34.450
 is the dream that already to win the 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.289
 third championship in Florence 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.289
 you dream 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.439
 I have to say the truth is not a joke 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:46.280
 it might seem such but hardly 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.140
 I remember my dreams therefore almost never the 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.320
 morning I almost never remember and therefore 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.659
 open eyes from I am very practical 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.170
 ragman but means to cure the values ​​in 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.020
 field 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.229
 in short, in the beginning they are indicative 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.030
 the rankings that after five games 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.729
 there are so many team stories his 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.770
 however, in the long run I believe that history 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.100
 ranking always reflects the trend 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.799
 of the league of values because then yes 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.290
 the strong team also the one who like 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.690
 the juve that despite it has been drawn 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.900
 in difficulty he has not lost and therefore 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.180
 even that is a value as well as winning 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.160
 sometimes even when you don't deserve it 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.540
 and react to moments of euphoria like 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.220
 what we are living now and 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.860
 see how the team reacts yes 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.230
 that too reacts well a value that 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.630
 then brings you points and vice versa 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.109
 having lost in short, the la 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.109
 ranking is real the final one because 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.940
 because in the space of 38 games they happen 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:49.850
 all of these can happen 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.280
 situations it is important to see the 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.359
 team how it reacts because they manage 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.190
 this euphoria and this enthusiasm for i 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.209
 players is not not easy but me 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.950
 I hope you do not underestimate i 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.780
 however, underestimate the game 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.700
 meaning I 'm glad there is the inter 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.280
 because the risk is very much lines but 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.989
 unconsciously and I hope I will have to 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.790
 work on what the team 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.359
 don't lose that concentration 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.459
 necessary for these matches for the 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:22.220
 lindsey primary was one of the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.910
 in short, the team's favorite victims 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.910
 nice 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.900
 for the rest naja striker 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.920
 evidently they are not very good at 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:36.530
 gave him good advice because 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 because in short, not much hope for 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.150
 that tomorrow they are decisive 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.380
 rather than braille because they have a 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.300
 long even in the last games have 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.209
 made of good performances 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.340
 I don't know about cassano, I don't know if 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:52.100
 however, our roads will cross 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.300
 in short, I know quite well no 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.410
 no no this curiosity 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.410
 I tell him with a smile
