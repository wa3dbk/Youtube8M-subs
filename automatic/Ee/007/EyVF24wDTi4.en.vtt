00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
out to 6 per package so I'm going to

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.380 
out to 6 per package so I'm going to
drop<00:02:48.230> this<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.890> if<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.099> were<00:02:49.250> to<00:02:49.340> make<00:02:49.430> all<00:02:49.670> six

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
sake of making one I could put it back

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.930 
sake of making one I could put it back
to<00:04:12.290> knock<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.590> out<00:04:12.739> or<00:04:13.400> I<00:04:13.430> could<00:04:13.610> just<00:04:13.640> shove

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
to knock this out or I could just shove

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:22.840 
to knock this out or I could just shove
it<00:04:14.680> well<00:04:15.680> not<00:04:15.829> shove<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.190> but<00:04:16.340> drop<00:04:16.549> it<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
it well not shove it but drop it and the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.290 
it well not shove it but drop it and the
other<00:04:23.060> side<00:04:23.360> that's<00:04:23.510> nonstick<00:04:24.139> right<00:04:24.620> on<00:04:24.830> top

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
other side that's nonstick right on top

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.939 
other side that's nonstick right on top
now<00:04:26.300> if<00:04:26.540> I<00:04:26.720> were<00:04:26.840> to<00:04:27.020> try<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.410> roll<00:04:27.620> this<00:04:27.770> out

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
now if I were to try and roll this out

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.950 
now if I were to try and roll this out
with<00:04:28.100> my<00:04:28.250> hand<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.940> would<00:04:29.030> be<00:04:29.150> on<00:04:29.270> even<00:04:29.539> if<00:04:29.840> I

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
with my hand it would be on even if I

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.590 
with my hand it would be on even if I
try<00:04:30.169> to<00:04:30.199> use<00:04:30.350> a<00:04:30.470> large<00:04:30.919> rolling<00:04:31.820> pin<00:04:32.090> it<00:04:32.360> may<00:04:32.539> be

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
try to use a large rolling pin it may be

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.439 
try to use a large rolling pin it may be
too<00:04:32.900> big<00:04:33.139> so<00:04:33.800> it's<00:04:34.010> wonderful<00:04:34.340> it's<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:35.120> find<00:04:35.360> a

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
too big so it's wonderful it's to find a

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.210 
too big so it's wonderful it's to find a
size<00:04:35.690> piece<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.410> equipment<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.770> works<00:04:36.979> best

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
size piece of equipment that works best

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.480 
size piece of equipment that works best
for<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.639> and<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.570> this<00:04:39.139> allows<00:04:39.380> me<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.889> just

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
for you and so this allows me to just

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.580 
for you and so this allows me to just
roll<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.090> right<00:04:41.419> where<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.720> want<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.289> put<00:04:42.470> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
roll it right where I want and put the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:50.050 
roll it right where I want and put the
pressure<00:04:44.860> and<00:04:45.860> what<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.310> have<00:04:46.639> here<00:04:46.970> now<00:04:48.789> it's<00:04:49.789> a

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
pressure and what I have here now it's a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.020 
pressure and what I have here now it's a
sandwich<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:51.229> between<00:04:51.820> this<00:04:52.820> meal

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
sandwich in between this meal

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.529 
sandwich in between this meal
replacement<00:04:53.750> it's<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.610> see<00:04:55.789> that<00:04:55.970> and

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
replacement it's you can see that and

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.540 
replacement it's you can see that and
then<00:04:56.990> I'm<00:04:57.199> going<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.380> lay<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.590> down<00:04:57.680> top<00:04:58.310> that

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
then I'm going to lay it down top that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.330 
then I'm going to lay it down top that
in<00:04:58.699> the<00:04:58.789> oven<00:04:58.940> for<00:04:59.630> about<00:05:00.200> ten<00:05:00.740> minutes<00:05:00.950> and

in the oven for about ten minutes and

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.400 
in the oven for about ten minutes and
then<00:05:01.400> we'll<00:05:02.120> show<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.360> how<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.630> go<00:05:02.870> from<00:05:03.080> there

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
then we'll show you how to go from there

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.379 
then we'll show you how to go from there
the<00:05:03.500> let's<00:05:03.740> look<00:05:03.919> at<00:05:04.039> this<00:05:04.190> because<00:05:05.090> I<00:05:05.180> spoke

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
the let's look at this because I spoke

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:07.360 
the let's look at this because I spoke
longer<00:05:05.750> than<00:05:05.900> 30<00:05:06.080> seconds<00:05:06.500> surprise<00:05:07.070> surprise

and you saw we had that earlier the top

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.460 
and you saw we had that earlier the top
just<00:05:17.120> slides<00:05:17.360> right<00:05:17.479> off<00:05:17.900> because<00:05:18.289> it's

happen<00:05:57.830> what<00:05:58.730> we<00:05:58.850> found<00:05:59.060> is<00:05:59.330> if<00:05:59.450> we<00:05:59.570> flip<00:05:59.750> this

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
happen what we found is if we flip this

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.500 
happen what we found is if we flip this
over<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.350> looks<00:06:00.650> nice<00:06:00.890> and<00:06:00.920> crisp<00:06:01.460> in<00:06:01.700> fact<00:06:02.240> if

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
over it looks nice and crisp in fact if

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:04.450 
over it looks nice and crisp in fact if
I<00:06:02.600> were<00:06:02.630> to<00:06:02.870> break<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.350> it<00:06:03.740> is<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:04.130> crisp

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
I were to break it it is that crisp

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.430 
I were to break it it is that crisp
texture<00:06:04.880> that<00:06:05.090> I'm<00:06:05.210> looking<00:06:05.360> for<00:06:05.540> but<00:06:05.900> not

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
texture that I'm looking for but not

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.620 
texture that I'm looking for but not
everywhere<00:06:07.280> see<00:06:07.910> where<00:06:08.060> it's<00:06:08.150> still<00:06:08.360> soft

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
everywhere see where it's still soft

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.690 
everywhere see where it's still soft
here<00:06:08.930> that<00:06:09.230> to<00:06:09.590> me<00:06:09.710> does<00:06:09.890> not<00:06:10.040> constitute<00:06:10.310> a

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
here that to me does not constitute a

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.820 
here that to me does not constitute a
chip<00:06:10.970> so<00:06:11.630> if<00:06:11.690> I<00:06:11.780> wanted<00:06:12.170> I<00:06:12.320> could<00:06:12.350> just<00:06:12.620> break

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
chip so if I wanted I could just break

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.590 
chip so if I wanted I could just break
off<00:06:13.070> the<00:06:13.100> pieces<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.730> are<00:06:13.850> already<00:06:14.150> done<00:06:14.330> and

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:14.600 
off the pieces that are already done and

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.620 
off the pieces that are already done and
then<00:06:15.110> I'm<00:06:15.650> actually<00:06:16.040> because<00:06:16.580> I'm<00:06:16.730> continuing

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
then I'm actually because I'm continuing

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.210 
then I'm actually because I'm continuing
to<00:06:17.720> bake<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.200> make<00:06:18.350> numerous<00:06:18.590> things<00:06:18.950> to

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
to bake and make numerous things to

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.730 
to bake and make numerous things to
maximize<00:06:19.640> my<00:06:19.850> time<00:06:20.090> going<00:06:20.840> to<00:06:21.110> go<00:06:21.320> ahead<00:06:21.440> and

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
maximize my time going to go ahead and

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.680 
maximize my time going to go ahead and
put<00:06:21.860> this<00:06:21.980> the<00:06:22.310> part<00:06:22.550> that's<00:06:22.730> not<00:06:23.000> quite<00:06:23.300> crisp

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
put this the part that's not quite crisp

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.810 
put this the part that's not quite crisp
enough<00:06:23.990> for<00:06:24.200> me<00:06:24.320> to<00:06:24.530> the<00:06:24.650> side<00:06:24.860> but<00:06:25.610> I<00:06:25.640> just

the chips that were not quite crisp

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:56.740 
the chips that were not quite crisp
remember<00:06:55.130> we<00:06:55.280> tore<00:06:55.550> them<00:06:55.700> off<00:06:55.880> and<00:06:56.210> this<00:06:56.690> is

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
remember we tore them off and this is

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:01.730 
texture all the way through so we're

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.060 
texture all the way through so we're
just<00:07:01.760> gonna<00:07:02.000> chop<00:07:02.360> those<00:07:02.630> into<00:07:03.620> pieces

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
just gonna chop those into pieces

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.909 
just gonna chop those into pieces
bite-sized<00:07:04.760> pieces<00:07:05.090> and<00:07:05.570> if<00:07:06.410> you'll<00:07:06.620> notice

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919 
bite-sized pieces and if you'll notice

00:07:06.919 --> 00:07:10.420 
bite-sized pieces and if you'll notice
that<00:07:07.190> this<00:07:07.340> is<00:07:07.400> exactly<00:07:07.610> where<00:07:08.919> one<00:07:09.919> meal
