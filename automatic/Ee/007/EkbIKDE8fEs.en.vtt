just pushed it out of the garage so I

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
just pushed it out of the garage so I
could<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.799> more<00:00:34.979> room<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.250> work<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
could have more room to work on the

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.789 
could have more room to work on the
motor<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:37.260> air<00:00:37.409> conditioned<00:00:39.650> compressor<00:00:40.650> is

suspected the crankshaft bearings here

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.460 
suspected the crankshaft bearings here
are<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.760> getting<00:02:06.150> any<00:02:06.330> oil<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.080> that's<00:02:07.260> what

was<00:02:07.590> making<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.190> noise<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.269> bearings<00:02:10.200> are

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
was making the noise that bearings are

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.520 
was making the noise that bearings are
worn<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.890> this<00:02:11.730> port<00:02:12.150> here<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.810> totally

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
worn out this port here is totally

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.210 
worn out this port here is totally
clogged<00:02:13.890> with

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
clogged with

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.490 
clogged with
one<00:02:16.220> below<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.610> he<00:02:16.730> sees<00:02:17.000> open<00:02:17.570> that<00:02:18.290> one's

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
one below it he sees open that one's

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460

clogged<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:19.310> removed<00:02:20.270> all<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.540> bearings<00:02:21.260> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
clogged I removed all the bearings and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.750 
clogged I removed all the bearings and
caps<00:02:21.800> also<00:02:22.790> film<00:02:23.090> metal<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.890> strainer<00:02:25.370> to

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
caps also film metal in the strainer to

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
caps also film metal in the strainer to
the<00:02:26.480> oil<00:02:26.690> pump<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.500> old<00:02:27.650> pump<00:02:28.150> may<00:02:29.150> have

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
the oil pump so the old pump may have

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.520 
the oil pump so the old pump may have
quit<00:02:30.830> working<00:02:31.100> or<00:02:31.430> become<00:02:31.700> clogged<00:02:32.090> and

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
quit working or become clogged and

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.940 
quit working or become clogged and
that's<00:02:33.530> what<00:02:33.740> burned<00:02:34.580> up<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.060> bearings<00:02:35.950> in

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
that's what burned up the bearings in

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.770 
that's what burned up the bearings in
the<00:02:37.130> sump<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.550> toll<00:02:37.700> pan<00:02:38.090> here<00:02:38.330> is<00:02:38.420> a<00:02:38.450> lot<00:02:38.660> of

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
the sump a toll pan here is a lot of

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.420 
the sump a toll pan here is a lot of
sludge<00:02:39.700> so<00:02:40.700> I'm<00:02:40.850> hoping<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.330> just<00:02:41.600> sludged<00:02:41.960> it

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
sludge so I'm hoping is just sludged it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.010 
sludge so I'm hoping is just sludged it
clogged<00:02:43.430> it<00:02:43.670> up<00:02:43.850> and<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.240> old<00:02:44.420> pump<00:02:44.630> hadn't

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
clogged it up and the old pump hadn't

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.990 
clogged it up and the old pump hadn't
failed<00:02:45.500> but<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:45.950> have<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.280> check<00:02:46.490> that<00:02:46.550> out<00:02:46.730> and

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
failed but I have to check that out and

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.580 
failed but I have to check that out and
there<00:02:47.120> is<00:02:47.240> a<00:02:47.270> little<00:02:47.510> bit<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.810> metal<00:02:48.170> in<00:02:48.350> there

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
there is a little bit of metal in there

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.660 
there is a little bit of metal in there
too<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.190> found<00:02:50.090> what<00:02:50.300> this<00:02:50.830> magnet<00:02:51.830> here's<00:02:52.490> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
too I found what this magnet here's the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.010 
too I found what this magnet here's the
piece<00:02:54.130> piece<00:02:55.130> of<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.490> right<00:02:55.520> there<00:02:55.970> piece<00:02:56.840> of

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
piece piece of it right there piece of

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.170 
piece piece of it right there piece of
bearings<00:02:57.440> as<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:58.370> pulled<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.730> bearings<00:02:59.120> out

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
bearings as I pulled the bearings out

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.780 
bearings as I pulled the bearings out
labeled<00:03:02.180> them<00:03:02.330> they<00:03:02.600> have<00:03:02.810> numbers<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:06.790> that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
labeled them they have numbers on that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.080 
labeled them they have numbers on that
one<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.680> if<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.830> can<00:03:10.010> tell<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.400> that's<00:03:10.880> a

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
one is if you can tell but that's a

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:19.930 
one is if you can tell but that's a
that's<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:12.760> 47<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:17.890> so<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:19.160> labeled<00:03:19.670> them<00:03:19.730> all

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
that's a 47 and so I labeled them all

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.600 
that's a 47 and so I labeled them all
and<00:03:20.680> from<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.890> pulley<00:03:22.610> into<00:03:23.210> the<00:03:23.360> flywheel

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
and from the pulley into the flywheel

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.500 
and from the pulley into the flywheel
you<00:03:25.610> can<00:03:25.820> really<00:03:26.300> look<00:03:26.540> and<00:03:27.550> see<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:29.120> bearings

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
you can really look and see the bearings

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.920 
you can really look and see the bearings
are<00:03:29.660> misshapen<00:03:31.900> they're<00:03:32.900> really<00:03:33.260> worn<00:03:33.530> out

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
are misshapen they're really worn out

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.970 
are misshapen they're really worn out
they<00:03:35.930> just<00:03:36.140> didn't<00:03:36.380> get<00:03:36.470> enough<00:03:36.590> oil

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.559 

we<00:03:41.490> can<00:03:41.670> see<00:03:41.970> there<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:44.700> also<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.420> number

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
we can see there and also the number

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.080 
we can see there and also the number
three<00:03:46.020> one<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.650> looks<00:03:46.950> a<00:03:47.040> lot<00:03:47.190> darker<00:03:47.550> so<00:03:48.000> I'm

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
three one it looks a lot darker so I'm

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.120 
three one it looks a lot darker so I'm
thinking<00:03:48.540> that's<00:03:49.050> the<00:03:49.290> one<00:03:49.440> where<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.830> court

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
thinking that's the one where the court

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.449 
thinking that's the one where the court
was<00:03:50.310> clogged<00:03:50.790> and<00:03:51.260> it<00:03:52.260> didn't<00:03:52.560> receive<00:03:52.890> any

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
was clogged and it didn't receive any

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.930 
was clogged and it didn't receive any
oil<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:55.280> assume<00:03:56.280> that's<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.580> one<00:03:56.730> that<00:03:56.849> was

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
oil and I assume that's the one that was

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.729 
oil and I assume that's the one that was
making<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.390> noise<00:03:57.569> it<00:03:58.050> brought<00:03:58.470> my<00:03:58.620> attention

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
making the noise it brought my attention

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.510 
making the noise it brought my attention
to<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.459> course<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.850> vehicle<00:04:00.300> was<00:04:01.520> you

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
to it of course the vehicle was you

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.130 
to it of course the vehicle was you
could<00:04:02.670> tell<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.060> power<00:04:03.330> was<00:04:03.569> down<00:04:03.600> it<00:04:04.110> was

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
could tell the power was down it was

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.820 
could tell the power was down it was
struggling<00:04:04.920> so<00:04:06.230> it's<00:04:07.230> gotten<00:04:07.590> kind<00:04:07.709> of

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
struggling so it's gotten kind of

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.170 
struggling so it's gotten kind of
blackened<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.650> getting<00:04:10.650> hot<00:04:10.860> I

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
blackened because of getting hot I

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.949 
blackened because of getting hot I
assume<00:04:12.180> when<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.080> Baron<00:04:13.380> failed<00:04:14.209> and<00:04:15.209> let's

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
assume when the Baron failed and let's

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.819 
assume when the Baron failed and let's
see<00:04:16.250> this<00:04:17.250> one<00:04:17.840> just<00:04:18.840> about<00:04:19.019> all<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> Barons

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
see this one just about all the Barons

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.790 
see this one just about all the Barons
were<00:04:20.190> there's<00:04:20.940> only<00:04:21.150> about<00:04:21.329> one<00:04:21.780> set<00:04:22.530> that

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
were there's only about one set that

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.690 
were there's only about one set that
weren't<00:04:23.070> really<00:04:23.600> messed<00:04:24.600> up<00:04:24.979> okay<00:04:25.979> so<00:04:26.490> what

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
weren't really messed up okay so what

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.940 
weren't really messed up okay so what
I'm<00:04:26.790> going<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.940> do<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:29.660> clean<00:04:30.660> everything<00:04:30.950> put

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
I'm going to do is clean everything put

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.600 
I'm going to do is clean everything put
new<00:04:32.130> bearings<00:04:32.810> and<00:04:33.979> I'll<00:04:34.979> probably<00:04:35.250> take

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
new bearings and I'll probably take

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.060 
new bearings and I'll probably take
these<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.690> heads<00:04:36.960> off<00:04:37.260> and<00:04:37.290> go<00:04:37.650> ahead<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:37.919> put

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
these the heads off and go ahead and put

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.430 
these the heads off and go ahead and put
rings<00:04:38.340> on<00:04:38.810> there<00:04:39.810> too

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
rings on there too

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.879 
rings on there too
and<00:04:41.330> also<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.600> have<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:42.840> make<00:04:43.139> sure<00:04:43.440> that<00:04:43.710> that

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
and also I have to make sure that that

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:52.340 
and also I have to make sure that that
oil<00:04:44.190> pump<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.900> working<00:04:48.320> and<00:04:49.320> that's<00:04:50.100> it
