00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that is a electric current in here so

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
that is a electric current in here so
you<00:01:09.540> plug<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.280> let's<00:01:11.280> connect<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.670> to

you plug it in let's connect you to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
you plug it in let's connect you to
Wi-Fi<00:01:12.799> let's<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:15.530> what's<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.799> and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
you can see already we do have lots of
Wi-Fi<00:01:21.210> signals<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:23.490> actually<00:01:24.420> gets<00:01:25.110> Wi-Fi

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
Wi-Fi signals it actually gets Wi-Fi

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
Wi-Fi signals it actually gets Wi-Fi
signals<00:01:26.159> from<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.729> kilometers<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
signals from up to two kilometers is
