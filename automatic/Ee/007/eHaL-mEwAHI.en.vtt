the<00:01:45.140> XP<00:01:46.140> rewards<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> still<00:01:48.030> probably

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the XP rewards but it is still probably

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.929 
the XP rewards but it is still probably
the<00:01:49.110> fastest<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.680> because<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> XP<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.909> still

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
the fastest way because the XP is still

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
the fastest way because the XP is still

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
like me and you're progressing through

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.170 
like me and you're progressing through
hell<00:02:19.350> difficulty<00:02:19.860> you're<00:02:20.340> finding<00:02:20.760> things<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
hell difficulty you're finding things a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.600 
hell difficulty you're finding things a
little<00:02:21.480> bit<00:02:21.690> difficult<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.220> need<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
little bit difficult and you need the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.120 
little bit difficult and you need the
extra<00:02:23.940> bit<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.240> an<00:02:24.360> edge<00:02:24.680> this<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.800> the<00:02:25.920> best

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
extra bit of an edge this is the best

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.330 
extra bit of an edge this is the best
way<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:27.090> gain<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.600> couple<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:28.050> levels<00:02:28.340> very

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
way to gain a couple of levels very

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.570 
way to gain a couple of levels very
quickly<00:02:29.730> now<00:02:30.480> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.930> pure<00:02:31.560> reason<00:02:31.920> why

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
quickly now this is the pure reason why

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.140 
quickly now this is the pure reason why
I<00:02:32.910> did<00:02:33.390> this<00:02:33.630> pretty<00:02:34.560> much<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:35.070> just<00:02:35.460> to<00:02:35.940> get

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
I did this pretty much is just to get

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.880 
I did this pretty much is just to get
that<00:02:36.330> extra<00:02:36.690> bit<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:36.930> an<00:02:37.080> edge<00:02:37.260> because<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.650> was

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
that extra bit of an edge because I was

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.410 
that extra bit of an edge because I was
finding<00:02:38.130> things<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.550> little<00:02:38.700> bit<00:02:38.880> difficult<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
finding things a little bit difficult I

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.740 
finding things a little bit difficult I
don't<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.140> time<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.710> be<00:02:41.580> dying<00:02:42.330> all<00:02:42.720> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
don't have the time to be dying all the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.280 
don't have the time to be dying all the
time<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:43.410> I<00:02:44.210> do<00:02:45.210> have<00:02:45.390> other<00:02:45.570> things<00:02:45.900> to<00:02:46.020> do

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
time I'm I do have other things to do

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.100 
time I'm I do have other things to do
and<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.980> just<00:02:47.160> haven't<00:02:47.340> got<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.640> time<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:48.110> to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
and I just haven't got the time to to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.290 
and I just haven't got the time to to
waste<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.740> needed<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.280> extra<00:02:50.580> few<00:02:51.120> levels

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
waste so I needed the extra few levels

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.050 
waste so I needed the extra few levels
and<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:51.930> was<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.380> best<00:02:52.590> way<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.920> found<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.700> do

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
and this was the best way I found to do

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
the boss even quicker I mean I think get

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.870
