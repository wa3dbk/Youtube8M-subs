00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.960
 hello in this video i will show you 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.029
 how to cook tender alan din yogurt 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.369
 or kefir and with the addition of blueberries or 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.260
 other berries, many novice culinary 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.720
 often have problems with 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.219
 cooking young something and does not burn 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.160
 and remain cheeses inside 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.800
 it's harsh my or just 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.260
 other some unpleasant moments on 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.510
 An example of these pancakes will show you how 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.260
 cook them so that they always 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.780
 pleased 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.420
 So let's start to mix dry 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.110
 ingredients in a separate bowl mix 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.260
 130 grams of wheat flour 1 dining room 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 Spoonful of sugar A pinch of salt 2 teaspoons 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 baking powder 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.989
 he's baking powder and 40 grams 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.479
 cornmeal can also be used 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.780
 and rice or other 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.960
 gluten free flour it facilitates lags 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.760
 they will only be more tender 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 separate mixing of dry ingredients 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.409
 it is very important to cut 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.450
 mixing time is already wet 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.110
 ingredients since the more on 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 prevent the more active 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:31.049
 gluten protein is gluten which makes 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 it is he who is actually responsible for hard 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.240
 pancakes because the more he 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.020
 develop the more we interfere with 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.159
 more than our tougher 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.350
 pancakes and so well mix 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.079
 mix thoroughly so that everything is as you can 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.509
 more evenly distributed here 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.810
 so now we mix wet 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.579
 ingredients it will be 150 milliliters 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:01.429
 milk 2 tablespoons baked 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:04.689
 butter I already have it 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.319
 pre- melted but 250 grams 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.660
 thick yogurt 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.840
 it may also be sour or 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.540
 thick kefir that you like it gives 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.080
 pleasant sourness 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.080
 2 more eggs 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.370
 this 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.349
 and well beat all the important ingredients. 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.840
 together this can be done not in the kitchen 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.379
 combine and not using a mixer but just 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.379
 whisk 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.030
 now when the wet ingredients are good 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.590
 whipped and mother 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.600
 pancake need no longer needed and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.890
 add our dry ingredients and 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.420
 attention interfere with the spatula in any 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.600
 the case is not a mixer in the combine but simply 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.250
 scoop and need to interfere as little as possible 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.080
 only to mix the ingredients again 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.750
 same or because of the same anna breasts who 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.610
 the more we disturb you the more he 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.930
 produced if in the case of bread 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.230
 we need it because the better you are 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.810
 working dough than the stronger 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.550
 will produce dishes so the bread will be 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.340
 air and but 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.010
 elastic fault is elastic flesh with 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.620
 pancakes and pancakes we need to interfere as 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.840
 can even less lumps 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.410
 will be less of a problem than in essence 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.990
 hard pancakes 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.430
 so here you need now 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.700
 faster before the same 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.510
 since the baking powder has already been activated 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.860
 on medium heat 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.660
 good warm flat pan 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.490
 When pan is well heated pour 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.790
 little vegetable oil 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.740
 quite a bit fridge needed 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.530
 bathe in oil should be so much 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.840
 so they just brown 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.800
 best doing this distributing also 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.780
 brush with oil and lay out a big 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.620
 spoon can be wooden or plastic 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:15.480
 who has what small fritters 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.200
 it is very important not to lay out too much 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.020
 and immediately 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.280
 because they do not fry well 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:28.590
 so that the fire was even slightly 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:32.460
 slightly above average or average 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.970
 it all depends on who calorific gas 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:40.880
 as he first lay out varnishes and 

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:44.130
 only then lay out blueberries on top 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:48.290
 not mixing mius dough so fritters will 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.290
 much tidier like this 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.720
 fry fritters on one side until 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.360
 until all over the surface appear 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.060
 small air bubbles uniformly and 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.210
 then gently turn over when 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.479
 in air bubbles appeared throughout 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.699
 surface it says that the dough 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.880
 will not spread and Alodi oil does not 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.340
 lose their shape and when turned 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.110
 Our pancakes are waiting for the second to be baked 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.380
 side don't clap went for fabric 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.680
 we let the air out just waiting and when 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.820
 the boat will already be ready we are looking at 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.180
 the other side is already possible them 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:42.690
 shift to a clean plate like this 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.199
 and do the same with the rest 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:46.080
 dough 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:48.120
 so until the end we get neat 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:51.389
 and beautiful and a logical other side 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.220
 slightly stained with berries but 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.220
 the front side is beautiful and true 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:11.159
 where 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.110
 and 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.610
 but 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.800
 you 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.220
 well here is our tender insanely fragrant 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:31.950
 pancake ready now they can 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.600
 you can enjoy instead of blueberry 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.640
 use black currant 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.200
 and also very initial course smoothly and 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:40.580
 rowan advise to try 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.580
 delicious experiment
