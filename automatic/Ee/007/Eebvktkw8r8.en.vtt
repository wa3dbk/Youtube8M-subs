useful tips for playing the old school

useful tips for playing the old school
server<00:00:07.589> so<00:00:07.830> I'll<00:00:07.919> just<00:00:07.950> get<00:00:08.250> started<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.970> get

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
server so I'll just get started and get

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.790 
server so I'll just get started and get
right<00:00:09.240> into<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.750> first<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.469> if

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
right into it the first one is that if

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.620 
right into it the first one is that if
you<00:00:10.920> load<00:00:11.130> runescape<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.300> old<00:00:12.420> school

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
you load runescape the old school

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.629 
you load runescape the old school
runescape<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.799> web<00:00:14.009> browser<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.610> can

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
runescape in a web browser you can

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.810 
runescape in a web browser you can
actually<00:00:14.940> hop<00:00:15.660> worlds<00:00:16.170> by<00:00:16.710> changing<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> URL

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
actually hop worlds by changing the URL

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.820 
actually hop worlds by changing the URL
so<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.600> change<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.080> number<00:00:19.350> after<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
so you just change the number after the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.560 
so you just change the number after the
word<00:00:20.039> old<00:00:20.220> school<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> it'll<00:00:21.090> load<00:00:21.300> that

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
word old school and it'll load that

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.779 
word old school and it'll load that
world<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:22.830> is<00:00:23.010> really<00:00:23.189> useful<00:00:23.369> for

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
world and this is really useful for

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.509 
world and this is really useful for
worlds<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.269> two<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:24.980> six<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.250> those<00:00:26.369> other

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
worlds like two and six and those other

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.640 
worlds like two and six and those other
ones<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.449> often<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:28.289> really

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
ones that are often really really

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.460 
ones that are often really really
crowded<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.160> hard<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.670> get<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.119> normally<00:00:30.599> so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
crowded and hard to get into normally so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
crowded and hard to get into normally so
you<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.710> change<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> URL<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> that

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
you can just change the URL and that

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can just change the URL and that
works<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.090> well<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.110> next<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.860> tip

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
works really well the next one is a tip

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.160 
works really well the next one is a tip
for<00:00:35.610> when<00:00:35.820> you're<00:00:35.940> actually<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:36.719> worlds

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
for when you're actually in these worlds

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.430 
for when you're actually in these worlds
I<00:00:38.120> find<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.239> really<00:00:39.540> hard<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.960> read<00:00:40.170> all<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I find it really hard to read all the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
I find it really hard to read all the
flashing<00:00:40.920> letters<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.370> everything<00:00:41.730> waiving

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
flashing letters and everything waiving

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.850 
flashing letters and everything waiving
all<00:00:42.360> around<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.809> just<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.170> distracting

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
all around it's just really distracting

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.740 
all around it's just really distracting
but<00:00:44.430> what<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.420> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
but what you can do is to actually just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
but what you can do is to actually just
toggle<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.379> off<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:47.100> options<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.670> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
toggle that off in your options that you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.760 
toggle that off in your options that you
can<00:00:47.820> talk<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.180> chat<00:00:48.510> effects<00:00:48.930> which<00:00:49.500> works

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
can talk about chat effects which works

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
can talk about chat effects which works
incredibly<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:50.430> it's<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.000> great<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
incredibly well it's really great it

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.049 
incredibly well it's really great it
saves<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.410> eye<00:00:52.710> strain<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.219> if<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
saves a lot of eye strain and if you

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.590 
saves a lot of eye strain and if you
want<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.530> little<00:00:55.829> less<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.969> don't<00:00:57.539> know

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
want to have a little less I don't know

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
want to have a little less I don't know
it<00:00:57.719> doesn't<00:00:58.050> help<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.530> lot<00:00:58.739> for<00:00:58.949> trading

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
it doesn't help a lot for trading

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
it doesn't help a lot for trading
because<00:00:59.370> not<00:01:00.359> you<00:01:00.629> don't<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:01.020> what<00:01:01.140> people

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
because not you don't see what people

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.229 
because not you don't see what people
are<00:01:01.410> saying<00:01:01.620> around<00:01:01.980> you<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.000> to

image where you teleport into this and
it<00:02:45.189> probably<00:02:45.639> wasn't<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.120> smartest<00:02:46.269> choice

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
it probably wasn't the smartest choice

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.080 
it probably wasn't the smartest choice
me<00:02:46.959> not<00:02:47.139> to<00:02:47.290> bring<00:02:47.439> a<00:02:47.769> weapon<00:02:48.040> or<00:02:48.669> a<00:02:48.819> good

me not to bring a weapon or a good

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.729 
me not to bring a weapon or a good
weapon<00:02:49.239> because<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.900> skeleton<00:02:50.349> was<00:02:50.500> such<00:02:50.709> a

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
weapon because the skeleton was such a

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.179 
weapon because the skeleton was such a
pain<00:02:51.359> but<00:02:52.359> there<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.019> can<00:02:53.200> make<00:02:53.829> money<00:02:53.980> by

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:54.189 
pain but there you can make money by

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.159 
pain but there you can make money by
buying<00:02:54.370> stuff<00:02:54.730> off<00:02:54.879> with<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.120> shops<00:02:55.359> some<00:02:56.079> of

buying stuff off with the shops some of

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.449 
buying stuff off with the shops some of
the<00:02:56.260> best<00:02:56.409> choices<00:02:56.650> are<00:02:56.919> probably<00:02:57.159> things

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the best choices are probably things

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.729 
the best choices are probably things
like<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.849> magical<00:02:58.629> because<00:02:58.989> not<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.349> whole<00:02:59.590> lot

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
like the magical because not a whole lot

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.890 
like the magical because not a whole lot
of<00:02:59.799> people<00:03:00.099> can<00:03:00.189> get<00:03:00.400> in<00:03:00.519> there<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.879> know<00:03:01.269> Aubrey
