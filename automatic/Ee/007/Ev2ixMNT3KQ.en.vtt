00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.500
 Friday, March 20 we will see a new one 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.210
 solar eclipse as it was understood 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.640
 this phenomenon in antiquity and who has 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.110
 known to predict it first 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.419
 few know that the Milan Polytechnic 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.119
 also a dome for observation 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.160
 astronomical as a better place to 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.020
 talk about the phenomenon that will come tomorrow 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 eclipse of the sun that is the moon that yes 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.940
 interpose these and the sun between us 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920
 phenomena are rare because the plan of the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.110
 litmus earth movement 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.850
 the ecliptic is not the same as that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.280
 of the movement of the moon but it is 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.070
 slightly tilted then the three 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.829
 points of these three celestial objects yes 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.269
 rarely align in the past 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.519
 certainly the great astronomers 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.890
 of antiquity for example the Chinese i 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.319
 Babylonians and even the Maya had 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.329
 perfectly understood 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.670
 what is the physics of? 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.430
 phenomenon that nothing else is but the moon 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.460
 which is interposed between us and the sun but 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.270
 predict the eclipse cycle that occurs 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.979
 call 50 is rather complicated it is 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.530
 so complicated that it is much more 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.000
 reasonable to think that the first ones 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.980
 they really were able to do 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.950
 predictions were scientists 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.300
 Greeks of the mystics in history 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.100
 of astronomy what is the most event 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.270
 interesting connected to an eclipse 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.910
 solar 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.340
 there are various historical events for example 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.440
 the battle of fins but that quotes 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.940
 precisely tito livio which is preceded by a 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.900
 eclipse a battle between the Romans 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.820
 Macedonians 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 there are various clues in the odyssey e 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.260
 in the iliad of testimonies 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.750
 of the eclipse but what I would like to mention 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.010
 as perhaps more interesting is an example 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.140
 which comes from egypt 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.690
 as many know in Egypt there was one 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 real religious revolution with 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.060
 the pharaoh to that nathan that in 1350 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.830
 ahead christ about introduced the 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.980
 monotheism of the solar disk 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.410
 the only god was the solar disk in penn 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.960
 well this lighthouse establishes a new one 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.590
 capital moves away from Thebes yes 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.289
 away 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.030
 from the cairo and founded the capital 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.239
 an unlikely place in the center of Egypt 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.620
 in the middle of the desert called marl 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.930
 most probably the choice of this 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.160
 so strange place so singular it is 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.349
 due to the fact that just in that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.170
 place very little time before it was 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.379
 a total solar eclipse occurred 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.319
 so these crises were interpreted by 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.799
 that born as a signal given by his 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.200
 father that is from the solar disk that indicated 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.200
 the place to found the new capital
