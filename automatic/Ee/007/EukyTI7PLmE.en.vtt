00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.730 
probably see here it's not really Mario
tiny<00:04:20.190> way<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.669> my<00:04:21.000> ipad<00:04:21.660> jailbroken<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.500> got<00:04:22.710> a

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
tiny way that my ipad jailbroken I got a

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.650 
tiny way that my ipad jailbroken I got a
little<00:04:22.919> treat<00:04:23.160> from<00:04:23.370> Sidious<00:04:23.850> making<00:04:24.270> Mario

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
little treat from Sidious making Mario

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:28.850 
little treat from Sidious making Mario
so<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:26.039> it's<00:04:26.280> 99<00:04:26.759> cents<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.650> pretty

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
so I think it's 99 cents and it's pretty

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.680 
so I think it's 99 cents and it's pretty
addicting<00:04:29.009> when<00:04:29.669> you<00:04:29.789> like<00:04:30.030> really<00:04:30.389> start<00:04:30.630> to
