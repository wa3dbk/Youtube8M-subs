00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
well how do you know you never tasted

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.360 
well how do you know you never tasted
their<00:00:32.940> food<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.899> today<00:00:34.200> I'm<00:00:34.350> gonna<00:00:34.500> cover<00:00:35.250> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
their food so today I'm gonna cover a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.209 
their food so today I'm gonna cover a
few<00:00:35.730> points<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.500> how<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> know<00:00:37.680> their<00:00:38.070> food

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
few points about how I know their food

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.860 
few points about how I know their food
tastes<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:38.640> crap<00:00:38.910> without<00:00:39.210> even<00:00:39.420> trying<00:00:39.719> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
tastes like crap without even trying it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.959 
tastes like crap without even trying it
and<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.770> pretty<00:00:41.100> much<00:00:41.250> most<00:00:41.610> people's

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and I know pretty much most people's

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.310 
and I know pretty much most people's
cooking<00:00:42.360> tastes<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:42.719> crap<00:00:42.930> without<00:00:43.050> ever

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cooking tastes like crap without ever

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.810 
cooking tastes like crap without ever
trying<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:45.649> Confucius<00:00:46.649> says<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
trying it so Confucius says that if the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.029 
trying it so Confucius says that if the
food<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.180> not<00:00:48.329> cut<00:00:48.600> correctly<00:00:49.170> or

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
food is not cut correctly or

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.330 
food is not cut correctly or
symmetrically<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.059> size<00:00:51.469> then<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:53.070> will<00:00:53.190> taste

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
symmetrically in size then it will taste

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
symmetrically in size then it will taste
like<00:00:53.550> crap<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.600> cook<00:00:54.750> unevenly

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
like crap because it will cook unevenly

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
like crap because it will cook unevenly
and<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.620> tend<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> agree<00:00:56.219> now<00:00:56.789> most<00:00:56.969> people

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and I tend to agree now most people

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.840 
and I tend to agree now most people
think<00:00:57.239> when<00:00:58.109> he<00:00:58.500> talks<00:00:58.710> about<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.190> means

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
think when he talks about that means

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.729 
think when he talks about that means
every<00:01:00.239> single<00:01:00.539> piece<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.780> everything<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
every single piece of everything in the

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.529 
every single piece of everything in the
bowl<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.489> exact<00:01:02.760> same<00:01:02.940> size<00:01:03.239> that's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
bowl is the exact same size that's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.859 
bowl is the exact same size that's
actually<00:01:03.989> not<00:01:04.080> true<00:01:04.640> optimum<00:01:05.640> size<00:01:06.150> wise<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
actually not true optimum size wise is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually not true optimum size wise is
if<00:01:07.170> you're<00:01:07.320> sauteing<00:01:07.950> or<00:01:08.070> putting<00:01:08.310> everything

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
if you're sauteing or putting everything

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.350 
if you're sauteing or putting everything
together

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
together

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.550 
together
you<00:01:09.720> really<00:01:09.990> need<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.170> have<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> shapes

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
you really need to have all the shapes

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
you really need to have all the shapes
surface<00:01:13.560> area<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.100> volume<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.909> speed<00:01:15.090> of

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
surface area and volume and speed of

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.890 
surface area and volume and speed of
cooking<00:01:15.750> for<00:01:16.200> either<00:01:16.890> protein<00:01:17.900> carbohydrates

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
cooking for either protein carbohydrates

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.530 
cooking for either protein carbohydrates
or<00:01:19.049> sugar<00:01:19.259> content<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.280> cook<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:21.330> same

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
or sugar content to cook at the same

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
or sugar content to cook at the same
time<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:22.950> carrots<00:01:23.610> are<00:01:23.729> harder<00:01:24.030> they

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
time so if carrots are harder they

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
time so if carrots are harder they
should<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.450> cut<00:01:24.630> smaller<00:01:25.020> than<00:01:25.259> something

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
should be cut smaller than something

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
should be cut smaller than something
that<00:01:25.650> softens<00:01:26.520> quickly<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.060> verses<00:01:27.990> like

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
that softens quickly like verses like

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
that softens quickly like verses like
say<00:01:28.320> potatoes<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.460> when<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> cut<00:01:29.820> them<00:01:29.939> all

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
say potatoes so when you cut them all

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.340 
say potatoes so when you cut them all
the<00:01:30.150> same<00:01:30.270> size<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.990> haven't<00:01:31.259> done

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
the same size you actually haven't done

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
the same size you actually haven't done
it<00:01:31.710> correctly<00:01:32.030> unless<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.150> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> cook

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it correctly unless you want to cook

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.890 
it correctly unless you want to cook
them<00:01:33.600> separately<00:01:33.869> then<00:01:34.350> that's<00:01:34.560> okay<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
them separately then that's okay so the

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.620 
them separately then that's okay so the
first<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.439> noticed<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.100> knife<00:01:39.090> work<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
first thing I noticed is knife work and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.530 
first thing I noticed is knife work and
I<00:01:39.979> stressed<00:01:40.979> knife<00:01:41.159> work<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.460> lot<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.850> um

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
I stressed knife work a lot because um

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660 
I stressed knife work a lot because um
if<00:01:42.930> your<00:01:43.200> knife<00:01:43.350> work<00:01:43.590> sucks<00:01:43.950> there's<00:01:44.310> pretty

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
if your knife work sucks there's pretty

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.399 
if your knife work sucks there's pretty
much<00:01:44.850> zero<00:01:44.880> chance<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.630> you're<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> good<00:01:46.200> cook

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
much zero chance that you're a good cook

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.460 
much zero chance that you're a good cook
and<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.240> first<00:01:48.570> thing<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.140> didn't<00:01:49.380> even

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
and so the first thing I didn't even

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.179 
and so the first thing I didn't even
actually<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.369> see<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.450> cooking<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.189> can

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
actually have to see them cooking I can

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
a steel you're in amount of that's

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.289 
a steel you're in amount of that's
the<00:02:17.159> first<00:02:17.430> statement<00:02:17.790> I'm<00:02:17.849> gonna<00:02:18.000> make<00:02:18.150> and

the first statement I'm gonna make and
I'll<00:02:18.360> make<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.540> blanket<00:02:18.900> statement<00:02:18.959> about<00:02:19.349> that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
I'll make a blanket statement about that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
I'll make a blanket statement about that
I'll<00:02:19.860> defend<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.310> all<00:02:20.430> day<00:02:20.610> long<00:02:20.640> number<00:02:21.540> two

I'll defend it all day long number two
if<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.019> don't<00:02:22.170> know<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.560> use<00:02:22.799> a<00:02:23.069> yellow

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
if you don't know how to use a yellow

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.289 
if you don't know how to use a yellow
like<00:02:23.489> Gordon<00:02:23.819> Ramsay

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
like Gordon Ramsay

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.600 
like Gordon Ramsay
that's<00:02:25.200> certainly<00:02:25.349> do<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.799> correctly<00:02:26.220> then

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
that's certainly do it correctly then

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
that's certainly do it correctly then
it's<00:02:27.209> just<00:02:27.540> shameful

it's just shameful

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.710 
it's just shameful
but<00:02:28.890> basically<00:02:29.159> you<00:02:29.700> give<00:02:29.940> somebody<00:02:30.239> a<00:02:30.420> knife

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
don't have to hear you cooking or

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.360 
don't have to hear you cooking or
anything<00:02:52.920> but<00:02:53.489> basically<00:02:54.560> your<00:02:55.560> steel<00:02:55.920> I'm

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
anything but basically your steel I'm

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.550 
anything but basically your steel I'm
left-handed<00:02:56.849> so<00:02:57.239> it<00:02:57.299> looks<00:02:57.480> backwards<00:02:57.900> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
left-handed so it looks backwards and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.740 
left-handed so it looks backwards and
you're<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:58.859> striking<00:02:59.159> smoothly<00:03:00.090> along<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you're just striking smoothly along the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.300 
you're just striking smoothly along the
steel<00:03:01.079> no<00:03:01.859> um<00:03:02.750> if<00:03:03.750> you<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.109> have<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.040> do<00:03:05.129> that

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
steel no um if you don't have to do that

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.330 
steel no um if you don't have to do that
you<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.180> do<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.420> vertically<00:03:06.870> like<00:03:07.049> this<00:03:07.340> it's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you can do it vertically like this it's

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.309 
you can do it vertically like this it's
in<00:03:08.459> the<00:03:08.549> camera<00:03:08.909> but<00:03:09.150> um<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.819> sharpened<00:03:12.629> in

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
in the camera but um so I sharpened in

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.229 
in the camera but um so I sharpened in
between<00:03:13.739> every<00:03:14.069> single<00:03:14.340> cut<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.549> every<00:03:14.970> single

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
between every single cut of every single

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.000 
between every single cut of every single
vegetable<00:03:15.390> or<00:03:15.870> even<00:03:16.349> before<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.680> finish

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
vegetable or even before I finish

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.670 
vegetable or even before I finish
cutting<00:03:17.880> and<00:03:18.150> I'll<00:03:18.209> steal<00:03:18.690> my<00:03:18.900> knife<00:03:19.380> again

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
cutting and I'll steal my knife again

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.800 
cutting and I'll steal my knife again
because<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.980> sharp<00:03:20.370> blade<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> safety<00:03:21.630> blade

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
because a sharp blade is a safety blade

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.370 
because a sharp blade is a safety blade
so<00:03:22.650> um<00:03:23.389> if<00:03:24.389> you<00:03:24.510> don't<00:03:24.630> under<00:03:24.840> you

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
so um if you don't under you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.550 
so um if you don't under you
get<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> nice<00:03:26.519> soft<00:03:26.760> steel<00:03:27.060> usually<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:28.049> thumb<00:03:28.349> up

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
get a nice soft steel usually a thumb up

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.050 
get a nice soft steel usually a thumb up
against<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> rest<00:03:30.829> and<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.549> is<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.849> thumb

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
against the rest and this is the thumb

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.280 
against the rest and this is the thumb
guard<00:03:33.329> so<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.690> don't<00:03:33.900> want<00:03:34.049> your<00:03:34.139> thumb

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
guard so you don't want your thumb

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.680 
guard so you don't want your thumb
passed<00:03:34.590> there<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.950> lose<00:03:35.129> a<00:03:35.160> thumb<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.910> you're

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
passed there you lose a thumb and you're

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.319 
passed there you lose a thumb and you're
striking<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> this<00:03:37.859> actually<00:03:38.280> just<00:03:38.310> homes<00:03:38.970> it

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
striking and this actually just homes it

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.479 
striking and this actually just homes it
smoothes<00:03:39.629> it<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.560> is<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.769> ceramic

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
smoothes it out this is a ceramic

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.050 
smoothes it out this is a ceramic
ceramic<00:03:42.480> steel<00:03:43.470> so<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.250> does<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.699> can<00:03:44.760> see<00:03:44.879> how

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
ceramic steel so it does you can see how

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.729 
ceramic steel so it does you can see how
great<00:03:45.299> it<00:03:45.359> is<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.750> does<00:03:45.959> take<00:03:46.199> a<00:03:46.230> little<00:03:46.590> bit

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
great it is it does take a little bit

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.189 
great it is it does take a little bit
more<00:03:47.069> metal<00:03:47.699> off<00:03:47.760> which<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.299> prefer<00:03:48.569> than<00:03:49.109> a

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
more metal off which I prefer than a

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.990 
more metal off which I prefer than a
traditional<00:03:49.379> steel<00:03:49.949> just<00:03:50.489> because<00:03:50.730> it<00:03:50.879> keeps

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
traditional steel just because it keeps

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.809 
traditional steel just because it keeps
it<00:03:51.269> much<00:03:52.199> sharper<00:03:52.530> yes<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:53.129> will<00:03:53.280> eat<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.519> blade

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
it much sharper yes you will eat a blade

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.909 
it much sharper yes you will eat a blade
but<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.120> don't<00:03:54.269> really<00:03:54.359> care

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
but I don't really care

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.470 
but I don't really care
buy<00:03:55.919> a<00:03:55.949> new<00:03:56.069> not<00:03:56.400> effective<00:03:56.879> 20<00:03:57.090> years<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.419> don't

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
buy a new not effective 20 years I don't

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.110 
buy a new not effective 20 years I don't
care<00:03:57.780> but<00:03:58.260> basically<00:03:58.680> you're<00:03:59.160> striking<00:03:59.519> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
care but basically you're striking the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.689 
care but basically you're striking the
other<00:04:00.299> side<00:04:00.629> and<00:04:01.440> just<00:04:02.010> a<00:04:02.099> couple<00:04:02.220> gentle

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
other side and just a couple gentle

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.900 
other side and just a couple gentle
strokes<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.359> you'll<00:04:03.510> notice<00:04:03.720> the<00:04:03.930> knife<00:04:04.139> is

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
strokes and you'll notice the knife is

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.720 
strokes and you'll notice the knife is
considerably<00:04:05.910> sharper<00:04:06.419> so<00:04:07.139> um<00:04:07.609> with<00:04:08.609> the

considerably sharper so um with the

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.640 
considerably sharper so um with the
steel<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.329> like<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.870> said<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.169> don't<00:04:10.440> actually

in<00:05:42.030> half<00:05:42.060> first<00:05:42.509> because<00:05:42.840> it's<00:05:43.020> just<00:05:43.320> much

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
in half first because it's just much

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.890 
in half first because it's just much
easier<00:05:43.979> to<00:05:44.130> peel<00:05:44.280> for<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.150> shallots<00:05:45.659> I<00:05:45.750> don't

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
easier to peel for the shallots I don't

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.719 
easier to peel for the shallots I don't
do<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.259> normally<00:05:46.620> for<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.919> onions<00:05:47.250> and<00:05:47.400> also

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
do that normally for the onions and also

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:50.300 
do that normally for the onions and also
I'm<00:05:48.449> like<00:05:48.780> Devon<00:05:49.320> I<00:05:49.560> don't<00:05:49.590> actually<00:05:50.130> have

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
I'm like Devon I don't actually have

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.050 
I'm like Devon I don't actually have
that<00:05:50.430> much<00:05:50.849> fingernail<00:05:51.690> to<00:05:51.870> deal<00:05:52.050> with<00:05:52.259> so<00:05:52.590> um

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
that much fingernail to deal with so um

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.730 
that much fingernail to deal with so um
you<00:05:54.060> have<00:05:54.150> to<00:05:54.210> bear<00:05:54.479> with<00:05:54.690> me<00:05:54.900> as<00:05:55.050> a<00:05:55.080> peeling

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
you have to bear with me as a peeling

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.439 
you have to bear with me as a peeling
stuff<00:05:56.009> is<00:05:56.159> always<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.610> most<00:05:56.789> difficult<00:05:57.240> part

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
stuff is always the most difficult part

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.339 
stuff is always the most difficult part
of<00:05:57.539> my<00:05:58.020> cooking<00:05:58.349> I<00:05:58.770> have<00:05:59.639> very<00:05:59.849> very<00:06:00.090> little

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:00.349 
of my cooking I have very very little

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:07.969 
of my cooking I have very very little
fingernail<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:06.110> no<00:06:07.110> kind<00:06:07.409> of<00:06:07.469> use<00:06:07.800> them

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
fingernail so no kind of use them

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:13.090 
fingernail so no kind of use them
anything

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.930 

so<00:06:15.170> but<00:06:16.170> dealing<00:06:16.500> with<00:06:16.620> garlic<00:06:17.070> and<00:06:17.340> as<00:06:17.670> you've

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
so but dealing with garlic and as you've

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.150 
so but dealing with garlic and as you've
seen<00:06:18.150> my<00:06:18.300> videos<00:06:18.660> and<00:06:18.960> dealing<00:06:19.260> with<00:06:19.290> onions

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
seen my videos and dealing with onions

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.460 
seen my videos and dealing with onions
and<00:06:20.460> dealing<00:06:20.820> with<00:06:20.850> shallots<00:06:21.240> is<00:06:21.630> really<00:06:22.140> just

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
and dealing with shallots is really just

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.320 
and dealing with shallots is really just
the<00:06:22.590> heart<00:06:22.800> of<00:06:22.920> cooking<00:06:23.310> because<00:06:23.760> if<00:06:24.150> you

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:24.330 
the heart of cooking because if you

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.940 
the heart of cooking because if you
don't<00:06:24.510> know<00:06:24.660> how<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.930> deal<00:06:25.170> with<00:06:25.200> aromatics<00:06:25.830> or

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
don't know how to deal with aromatics or

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.340 
don't know how to deal with aromatics or
you<00:06:26.070> use<00:06:26.370> no<00:06:26.610> aromatics<00:06:27.210> at<00:06:27.330> all<00:06:27.480> then<00:06:28.170> your

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
you use no aromatics at all then your

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.560 
you use no aromatics at all then your
cooking<00:06:29.250> tastes<00:06:29.460> like<00:06:29.610> crap<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.150> other<00:06:30.360> day<00:06:30.540> I

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
cooking tastes like crap the other day I

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:31.970 
cooking tastes like crap the other day I
was<00:06:30.720> at<00:06:30.870> Whole<00:06:31.050> Foods<00:06:31.080> and<00:06:31.470> this<00:06:31.560> lead<00:06:31.740> goes<00:06:31.950> to

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:31.980 
was at Whole Foods and this lead goes to

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.950 
was at Whole Foods and this lead goes to
oh<00:06:32.100> I<00:06:32.220> love<00:06:32.550> Whole<00:06:32.730> Foods<00:06:32.760> they<00:06:33.180> have<00:06:33.420> pretty

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
oh I love Whole Foods they have pretty

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.720

smashed<00:06:34.200> garlic<00:06:34.500> I'm<00:06:34.920> like<00:06:35.130> yeah<00:06:35.400> but<00:06:35.580> it's

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:35.730 
smashed garlic I'm like yeah but it's

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:37.880

like<00:06:35.880> six<00:06:36.210> times<00:06:36.360> more<00:06:36.510> expensive<00:06:36.750> it's<00:06:37.590> less

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:37.890 
like six times more expensive it's less

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.650 
like six times more expensive it's less
flavorful<00:06:38.310> because<00:06:39.060> the<00:06:39.180> oils<00:06:39.480> have<00:06:39.630> been

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
flavorful because the oils have been

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.680 
flavorful because the oils have been
leaking<00:06:39.990> out<00:06:40.230> into<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.650> savory<00:06:40.980> aroma<00:06:41.370> and<00:06:41.970> so

leaking out into a savory aroma and so
