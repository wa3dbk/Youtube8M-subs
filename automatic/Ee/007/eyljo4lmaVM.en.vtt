often<00:03:19.739> was<00:03:19.949> in<00:03:19.979> a<00:03:20.159> nuclear<00:03:20.579> testing<00:03:21.060> site<00:03:21.120> in

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
often was in a nuclear testing site in

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.599 
often was in a nuclear testing site in
Nevada<00:03:21.720> holding<00:03:22.290> out<00:03:22.530> on<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.769> nuclear<00:03:22.979> bunker

Nevada holding out on a nuclear bunker

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.909 
Nevada holding out on a nuclear bunker
after<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.389> recent<00:03:24.659> nuclear<00:03:25.169> explosion<00:03:25.859> we

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:25.919 
after a recent nuclear explosion we

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.770 
after a recent nuclear explosion we
obviously<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.400> he<00:03:26.790> was<00:03:26.970> he<00:03:27.359> was<00:03:27.509> in<00:03:27.629> the

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
bunker in nuke town like in the map

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.460 
bunker in nuke town like in the map
Newton<00:03:30.120> he<00:03:30.329> was<00:03:30.449> in<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.689> bunker<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.349> was

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
Newton he was in the bunker that was

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.170 
Newton he was in the bunker that was
started<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.769> easter<00:03:32.099> egg<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.819> missiles

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:18.140 
you mean me to put misty obviously back
in<00:04:16.190> Hanford<00:04:17.190> and

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
in Hanford and

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.030 
in Hanford and
then<00:04:18.660> sort<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.199> two<00:04:19.380> are<00:04:19.680> fighting<00:04:19.889> off

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
transit bus by still linger and Russman

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.250 
transit bus by still linger and Russman
and<00:04:25.139> then<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.889> four<00:04:26.130> have<00:04:26.400> to<00:04:26.580> activate

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260 
and then the four have to activate

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.719 
and then the four have to activate
polarization<00:04:28.260> two<00:04:28.350> voices<00:04:28.800> in<00:04:28.979> favor<00:04:29.400> of

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
polarization two voices in favor of

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.540 
polarization two voices in favor of
either<00:04:29.910> Richtofen<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:30.720> Maxis<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.380> then<00:04:32.040> they

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
either Richtofen and Maxis and then they

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
either Richtofen and Maxis and then they
sort<00:04:32.729> of<00:04:32.790> joining<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.270> over<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:34.199> the<00:04:34.500> Shanghai

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
sort of joining it over to the Shanghai

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.670 
sort of joining it over to the Shanghai
skyscraper<00:04:36.570> which<00:04:36.720> we<00:04:36.870> know<00:04:36.990> is<00:04:37.169> dirty<00:04:37.440> rise

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
skyscraper which we know is dirty rise

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.950 
skyscraper which we know is dirty rise
and<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.430> activate<00:04:38.790> another<00:04:39.120> one<00:04:39.419> in<00:04:39.630> either

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
and to activate another one in either

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.990 
and to activate another one in either
one<00:04:40.229> of<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.410> favors<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:40.979> then<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.580> last<00:04:41.760> one

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
one of the favors and then the last one

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.350 
one of the favors and then the last one
is<00:04:42.030> obviously<00:04:42.540> at<00:04:42.919> buried<00:04:43.919> so<00:04:44.430> that's<00:04:45.030> sort<00:04:45.270> of

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
is obviously at buried so that's sort of

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.480 
is obviously at buried so that's sort of
where<00:04:45.570> they<00:04:45.750> end<00:04:46.020> they're<00:04:46.380> stuck<00:04:46.680> in<00:04:46.889> buried
