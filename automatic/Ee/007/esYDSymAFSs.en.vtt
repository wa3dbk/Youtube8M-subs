yeah<00:03:13.019> I'm<00:03:13.380> not<00:03:13.620> sure<00:03:13.769> if<00:03:13.890> it's<00:03:13.980> more<00:03:14.220> harshly

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
yeah I'm not sure if it's more harshly

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.610 
yeah I'm not sure if it's more harshly
or<00:03:14.880> what<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:15.630> it's<00:03:15.750> definitely<00:03:15.989> he<00:03:16.260> loses<00:03:16.530> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
or what but it's definitely he loses the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.830 
or what but it's definitely he loses the
benefit<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.099> doubt<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:18.180> whatever<00:03:18.360> sue<00:03:18.690> has

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
benefit of the doubt so whatever sue has

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.930 
benefit of the doubt so whatever sue has
to<00:03:19.019> say<00:03:19.230> won't<00:03:20.099> really<00:03:20.370> be<00:03:20.459> taken<00:03:20.849> into
