00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.200
 save energy it's a 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.730
 subject that we often mentioned but 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.890
 we thought nothing was possible 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.360
 in an old house 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.520
 when we met the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.440
 advise to the energy info space its 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.240
 first recommendations were to 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.240
 review all our insulation for 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.270
 limit leakage charred walls and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 Windows 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.470
 then the question of ventilation 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.790
 our advisor 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 complement our insulation 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.989
 performant recommended us 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 to install a dual stream vmc 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.100
 this mechanical ventilation system 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.230
 controlled can limit 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 thermal variations and therefore of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.970
 save on heating 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.239
 winter or cool summer house 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.000
 on the one hand the vmc sucks the stale air of 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.579
 the house to evacuate it and recovers its 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.829
 heat of the other he uses this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.000
 heat to warm the incoming air 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.460
 before blowing it into the house a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.950
 simple switch can pass the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 vmc in winter or summer position then is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.340
 came the question of heating 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.930
 we wanted to trade our radiators 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.770
 electric against central heating 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.040
 gas 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.720
 the counselor instead directed us towards 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 the installation of a heat pump 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.369
 the principle is simple a pump 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.479
 installed outside the house and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.150
 a buffer tank 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 inside the pump recovers the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.500
 calories from the outside air 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.210
 the stocks in the balloon that sends them 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.460
 in the radiators for each 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.470
 electric kilowatt hour consumed 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.450
 three are on average rendering in 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.920
 our heating system we have 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.470
 then made the choice of an energy 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.070
 renewable to power our balloon 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 hot water 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.110
 solar panels installed on the 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.939
 roof of the house covers today 70 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.200
 % of our hot water needs for 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.590
 year 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.390
 thanks to our efficient insulation 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 associated with the ventilation system at 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.770
 the use of the heat pump and 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.720
 of the solar water heater we divide by 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.209
 three our energy consumption 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.800
 last year we only spent 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.800
 315 euros for heating 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.980
 to be consistent both indoors and 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.959
 outside garden side 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 we simply install from 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.130
 large water recovery tanks 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.739
 rain connected to the gutters of the house 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.959
 it's up to us to water in large 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.390
 part the garden and enjoy 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.680
 house vegetables in summer without 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 consume tap water
