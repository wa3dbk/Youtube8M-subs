00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
Assassin's Creed 4 you know the way the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.580 
Assassin's Creed 4 you know the way the
ship<00:00:57.360> creaks<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.840> lurchers<00:00:58.020> over<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> waves

ship creaks and lurchers over the waves

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.010 
ship creaks and lurchers over the waves
is<00:00:58.859> really<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.340> done<00:00:59.370> but<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.390> is

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
is really well done but it actually is

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.569 
is really well done but it actually is
very<00:01:01.350> central<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> progression<00:01:02.399> system

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
very central to the progression system

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.490 
very central to the progression system
because<00:01:03.000> as<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.359> play<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.290> buy

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
because as you play you actually buy

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.870 
because as you play you actually buy
upgrades<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:05.159> your<00:01:05.309> ship<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:05.729> also

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
upgrades for your ship and I also

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
upgrades for your ship and I also
thought<00:01:06.119> that<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.420> combat<00:01:06.930> was<00:01:06.960> much<00:01:07.650> more

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
thought that the combat was much more

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
thought that the combat was much more
refined<00:01:08.280> compared<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.939> Assassin's<00:01:09.390> Creed<00:01:09.570> 3

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
refined compared to Assassin's Creed 3

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.539 
refined compared to Assassin's Creed 3
what<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.409> they<00:01:10.560> done<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> refine<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.220> combat

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
what have they done to refine the combat

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
what have they done to refine the combat
it<00:01:11.700> feels<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.119> natural<00:01:12.659> now<00:01:12.900> you're

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
it feels a lot more natural now you're

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
it feels a lot more natural now you're
aiming<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.860> sort<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> connected<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.909> where<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
aiming is sort of connected to where you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.179 
aiming is sort of connected to where you
are<00:01:15.720> looking<00:01:15.900> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> ship<00:01:16.500> so<00:01:16.710> if<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> look

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
are looking on the ship so if you look

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.160 
are looking on the ship so if you look
to<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.759> side<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.540> ship<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.930> will<00:01:19.020> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
to the side of the ship you will be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
to the side of the ship you will be
activating<00:01:19.710> those<00:01:19.830> cannons<00:01:20.280> there's<00:01:20.460> no

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
activating those cannons there's no

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.580 
activating those cannons there's no
longer<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.780> select<00:01:22.049> them<00:01:22.259> from<00:01:22.290> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
longer in need to select them from a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859 
longer in need to select them from a
menu<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.150> gives<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> good

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
menu and it really just gives you a good

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.749 
menu and it really just gives you a good
sense<00:01:25.110> of<00:01:25.380> sort<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> being<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.340> ship<00:01:26.549> as<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
sense of sort of being on the ship as it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
sense of sort of being on the ship as it
moves<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> ocean<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:27.990> fires<00:01:28.350> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
moves through the ocean and fires of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.590 
moves through the ocean and fires of
other<00:01:28.799> targets<00:01:29.340> another<00:01:29.880> impressive<00:01:30.180> feat<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
other targets another impressive feat is

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.319 
other targets another impressive feat is
the<00:01:30.750> simulation<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.680> ocean<00:01:32.329> swelling

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
the simulation of the ocean swelling

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.789 
the simulation of the ocean swelling
waves<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:34.229> deter<00:01:34.590> your

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
waves will actually deter your

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.590 
waves will actually deter your
cannonball<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.909> mindful<00:01:36.360> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
cannonball so you have to be mindful of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.240 
cannonball so you have to be mindful of
them<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> are<00:01:37.200> engaged<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.890> combat<00:01:38.100> with

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
them when you are engaged in combat with

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
them when you are engaged in combat with
other<00:01:38.520> ships<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> of<00:01:39.240> course<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:39.750> use

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
other ships and of course you can use

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.510 
other ships and of course you can use
the<00:01:39.990> same<00:01:40.200> advantage<00:01:40.650> by<00:01:40.829> hiding<00:01:41.070> your<00:01:41.310> ship

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the same advantage by hiding your ship

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520 
the same advantage by hiding your ship
behind<00:01:41.790> swelling<00:01:42.360> waves<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.140> what<00:01:43.259> happens

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
behind swelling waves so what happens

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.840 
behind swelling waves so what happens
when<00:01:43.710> you've<00:01:43.860> blown<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.130> ship<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> smithereens

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
when you've blown a ship to smithereens

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
when you've blown a ship to smithereens
well<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.810> let<00:01:45.930> them<00:01:46.079> sink<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.649> can

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
well you can let them sink or you can

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.200 
well you can let them sink or you can
board<00:01:47.189> them<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.430> that's<00:01:47.670> another<00:01:47.880> one<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
board them and that's another one of the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.179 
board them and that's another one of the
early<00:01:48.479> interesting<00:01:48.990> technical<00:01:49.470> models<00:01:50.009> in

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
early interesting technical models in

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.100 
early interesting technical models in
the<00:01:50.280> game<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:51.299> these<00:01:51.479> two<00:01:51.780> ships

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
the game with these two ships

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.859 
the game with these two ships
intersecting<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.130> becoming<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.909> combat<00:01:54.840> zone

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
intersecting and becoming a combat zone

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.719 
intersecting and becoming a combat zone
essentially<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:55.890> it<00:01:56.040> combines<00:01:56.219> with<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
essentially so it combines with the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.969 
essentially so it combines with the
game's<00:01:57.060> existing<00:01:57.930> freerunning<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.560> combat

you<00:01:59.100> could<00:01:59.250> climb<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> mosque<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.240> can<00:02:00.390> leap

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you could climb the mosque you can leap

to<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> other<00:02:00.990> ship<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> begin<00:02:01.619> fighting

right away with no loading screen it's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.270 
right away with no loading screen it's
pretty<00:02:04.079> impressive<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.979> think<00:02:05.159> it's

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
pretty impressive and I think it's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.940 
pretty impressive and I think it's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
cutscenes they were very open about how

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.110 
cutscenes they were very open about how
I<00:03:02.010> could<00:03:02.250> approach<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.670> toilet<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
I could approach the toilet and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.820 
I could approach the toilet and
assassinating<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:03.959> beneath<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.349> water<00:03:04.530> or

assassinating from beneath the water or
from<00:03:05.129> above<00:03:05.430> now<00:03:06.209> I<00:03:06.269> had<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> few<00:03:06.840> issues<00:03:06.870> with

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
from above now I had a few issues with

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.110 
from above now I had a few issues with
the<00:03:07.409> stealth<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:07.980> Assassin's<00:03:08.400> Creed<00:03:08.580> 3<00:03:08.730> has

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
the stealth in Assassin's Creed 3 has

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.820 
the stealth in Assassin's Creed 3 has
that<00:03:09.330> gotten<00:03:09.510> any<00:03:09.690> better<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.110> black<00:03:10.260> flag<00:03:10.560> I

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
that gotten any better in black flag I

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.470 
that gotten any better in black flag I
think<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.190> overall<00:03:11.489> mission<00:03:11.819> design<00:03:12.090> is

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
think the overall mission design is

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.180 
think the overall mission design is
going<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.810> be<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.200> cognizant<00:03:13.650> of<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.069> way

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
going to be more cognizant of the way

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.619 
going to be more cognizant of the way
stealth<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.760> treated<00:03:15.120> in<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.239> game<00:03:15.420> but<00:03:15.569> i

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
stealth is treated in the game but i

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.170 
stealth is treated in the game but i
think<00:03:15.959> they<00:03:16.170> are<00:03:16.200> still<00:03:16.650> sort<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.489> tied<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
think they are still sort of tied to the

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.670 
think they are still sort of tied to the
technology<00:03:18.690> they<00:03:18.840> have<00:03:18.989> which<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.349> the<00:03:19.500> fact

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
technology they have which is the fact

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.530 
technology they have which is the fact
that<00:03:19.800> it's<00:03:19.980> a<00:03:20.099> freerunning<00:03:20.580> action-adventure

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
that it's a freerunning action-adventure

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.210 
that it's a freerunning action-adventure
game<00:03:21.720> it's<00:03:22.019> still<00:03:22.230> tied<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.650> environment

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
game it's still tied to the environment

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.070 
game it's still tied to the environment
in<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> very<00:03:23.550> binary<00:03:23.819> way<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.239> you<00:03:24.750> are<00:03:24.840> only

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
in a very binary way so you are only

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.990 
in a very binary way so you are only
invisible<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.950> instance<00:03:26.280> if<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.700> are

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
invisible for instance if you are

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.180 
invisible for instance if you are
crouched<00:03:27.360> within<00:03:27.750> a<00:03:27.840> bush<00:03:28.140> but<00:03:28.680> there's<00:03:28.920> no

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
crouched within a bush but there's no

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.039 
crouched within a bush but there's no
Crouch<00:03:29.519> button<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.180> when<00:03:30.420> you<00:03:30.540> transition

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
Crouch button so when you transition

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.479 
Crouch button so when you transition
between<00:03:31.260> bushes<00:03:31.709> you're<00:03:31.920> walking<00:03:32.310> upright

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
between bushes you're walking upright

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.520 
between bushes you're walking upright
between<00:03:33.090> those<00:03:33.269> two<00:03:33.420> points<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.959> you're

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
between those two points and you're

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.380 
between those two points and you're
basically<00:03:35.040> losing<00:03:35.340> self<00:03:35.700> at<00:03:35.819> that<00:03:35.940> point<00:03:36.180> so

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
basically losing self at that point so

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.869 
basically losing self at that point so
it<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.140> workable<00:03:37.709> but<00:03:38.099> it's<00:03:38.250> still<00:03:38.519> far<00:03:38.819> from

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
it is workable but it's still far from

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.089 
it is workable but it's still far from
perfect<00:03:39.299> one<00:03:40.019> day<00:03:40.200> you'll<00:03:40.440> be<00:03:40.500> able<00:03:40.709> to<00:03:40.860> crouch
