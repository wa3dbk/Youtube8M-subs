position he can assume that there's a
base<00:00:46.379> down<00:00:46.620> there<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.010> he<00:00:47.070> doesn't<00:00:47.370> know

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
base down there but he doesn't know

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
base down there but he doesn't know
about<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> layer<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.629> he's<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.440> very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
about the layer so he's going to be very

facility<00:01:10.650> yeah<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.790> corsair<00:01:12.240> river<00:01:12.570> build

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
facility yeah this corsair river build

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.950 
facility yeah this corsair river build
from<00:01:13.560> pure<00:01:13.939> very<00:01:14.939> very<00:01:15.119> risky<00:01:15.420> type<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.750> build

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
from pure very very risky type of build

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.749 
from pure very very risky type of build
but<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.229> could<00:01:16.350> work<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.770> great<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.460> he<00:01:17.610> can

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
but it could work out great if he can

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
but it could work out great if he can
somehow<00:01:18.150> lock<00:01:18.600> down<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:18.900> five<00:01:19.350> o'clock

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
somehow lock down that five o'clock

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.469 
somehow lock down that five o'clock
position<00:01:20.130> maybe<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:20.759> down<00:01:20.909> there<00:01:21.090> with<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.360> of

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
position maybe go down there with all of

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
position maybe go down there with all of
his<00:01:21.570> troops<00:01:21.810> because<00:01:22.080> if<00:01:22.259> he<00:01:22.350> does<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.979> might

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
his troops because if he does you might

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
his troops because if he does you might
be<00:01:23.520> able<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.759> snipe<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.330> lair<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.900> would

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
be able to snipe the lair and that would

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.789 
be able to snipe the lair and that would
be<00:01:25.700> incredibly<00:01:26.700> awesome<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:28.229> pure<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.590> least

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
be incredibly awesome for pure at least

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.370 
be incredibly awesome for pure at least
not<00:01:29.340> for<00:01:29.610> calm<00:01:29.850> couple<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.780> course<00:01:31.110> Sierra's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
going to that location now he's going to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.910 
going to that location now he's going to
get<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.509> full<00:01:33.659> scout<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.140> everything<00:01:34.530> he's

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
going to see that layer there of course

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.780 
going to see that layer there of course
the<00:01:37.680> layer<00:01:37.829> has<00:01:38.009> more<00:01:38.189> hit<00:01:38.340> points<00:01:38.369> than<00:01:38.729> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
the layer has more hit points than a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.890 
the layer has more hit points than a
hatchery<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.180> going<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.450> harder<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.689> take

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900

that<00:01:47.399> comm<00:01:47.610> could<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> calm

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that comm could get down there and calm

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.039 
that comm could get down there and calm
I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.649> calm<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.700> muta<00:01:51.689> lyst<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
I think calm is going for muta lyst I

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260 
I think calm is going for muta lyst I
don't<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.290> anything<00:01:52.500> else<00:01:52.860> out<00:01:53.100> for<00:01:53.520> him<00:01:53.700> say

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
was the exact same trick not exactly the

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.990 
was the exact same trick not exactly the

against<00:02:21.300> pure<00:02:21.570> last<00:02:22.110> season<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.100> let's<00:02:23.910> see

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
against pure last season so let's see

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.380 
against pure last season so let's see
what<00:02:24.240> I<00:02:24.270> can<00:02:24.390> do<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:24.870> season<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.470> Mutis<00:02:26.390> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
what I can do this season with Mutis so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.350 
what I can do this season with Mutis so
pretty<00:02:27.630> sure<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.960> mutants<00:02:28.260> are<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.830> way

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
pretty sure that mutants are on the way

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.520 
pretty sure that mutants are on the way
because<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.570> don't<00:02:30.720> see<00:02:30.840> why<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.140> would<00:02:31.410> have

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
because I don't see why you would have

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.440 
because I don't see why you would have
this<00:02:32.040> mini<00:02:32.340> scourge<00:02:32.670> out<00:02:32.850> unless<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.240> wanted

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
to take that air superiority but pure

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.490 
to take that air superiority but pure
playing<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.120> little<00:02:36.330> bit<00:02:36.600> less<00:02:36.900> risky<00:02:37.320> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
go away with this that shuttle split it

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.830 
go away with this that shuttle split it
away<00:03:11.370> from<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.790> Corsairs<00:03:12.239> that's<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.540> tricky

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
away from the Corsairs that's a tricky

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.270 
away from the Corsairs that's a tricky
little<00:03:12.870> strategy<00:03:13.470> that<00:03:13.650> sometimes<00:03:14.040> works

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
little strategy that sometimes works

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.790 
little strategy that sometimes works
very<00:03:14.640> well<00:03:15.110> because<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.200> cert<00:03:16.380> player<00:03:16.590> will

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
very well because the cert player will

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.560 
very well because the cert player will
see<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.130> all<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.550> Corsairs<00:03:18.000> about<00:03:18.299> it's<00:03:18.450> like

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
see the all the Corsairs about it's like

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.509 
see the all the Corsairs about it's like
oh<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.840> shuttle<00:03:19.110> must<00:03:19.350> be<00:03:19.530> by<00:03:19.799> those<00:03:20.040> Corsairs

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
