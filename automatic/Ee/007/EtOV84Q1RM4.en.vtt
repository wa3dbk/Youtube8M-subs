00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
desperate so I was throwing everything

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.520 
desperate so I was throwing everything
at<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.729> drain<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.149> try<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.390> back<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.810> out

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
at this drain to try to back it out

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.889 
at this drain to try to back it out
one<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.040> those<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.340> wd-40<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.509> got<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.780> say

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
one of those is wd-40 and you got to say

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.310 
one of those is wd-40 and you got to say
why<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.469> wd-40<00:02:05.219> works<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.790> everything<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
why not wd-40 works on everything and

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.120 
why not wd-40 works on everything and
then<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.069> other<00:02:08.520> thing

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
then the other thing

little bit inside the drain kind of

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.460 
little bit inside the drain kind of
where<00:02:56.080> those<00:02:56.200> inside<00:02:56.680> threads<00:02:57.070> are<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:59.380> the

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
you're going to make a cut straight down

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.760 
you're going to make a cut straight down
about<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.250> quarter<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.000> an<00:03:07.180> inch<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:07.570> then<00:03:08.230> back

up a little bit and go back down a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.220 
up a little bit and go back down a
quarter<00:03:14.920> inch<00:03:15.100> until<00:03:15.430> you<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.780> quarter

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
and it doesn't have to be exact so you

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.120 
and it doesn't have to be exact so you
don't<00:03:22.960> really<00:03:23.170> need<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:23.440> be<00:03:23.590> measuring<00:03:24.040> it

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130

optional steps but you know I wanted to
throw<00:03:41.530> everything<00:03:41.860> at<00:03:42.130> it<00:03:42.250> because<00:03:42.400> there's

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
throw everything at it because there's

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.310 
throw everything at it because there's
nothing<00:03:43.150> worse<00:03:43.330> than<00:03:43.360> being<00:03:43.810> stuck<00:03:44.110> on<00:03:44.260> a

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
nothing worse than being stuck on a

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.400 
nothing worse than being stuck on a
project<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.100> took<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.880> wd-40<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.170> just

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
project I took the wd-40 and I just

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.010 
project I took the wd-40 and I just
sprayed<00:03:47.800> it<00:03:48.010> around<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.150> flashing<00:03:49.570> area<00:03:49.870> on

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
sprayed it around the flashing area on

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.590 
sprayed it around the flashing area on
top<00:03:50.230> of<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.470> drain<00:03:50.740> and<00:03:51.060> actually<00:03:52.060> down<00:03:52.270> into

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
top of the drain and actually down into

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.850 
top of the drain and actually down into
the<00:03:52.720> drain<00:03:52.959> hoping<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.500> some<00:03:53.680> of<00:03:53.800> that

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
the drain hoping that some of that

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.250 
the drain hoping that some of that
penetrating<00:03:54.550> pool<00:03:54.760> would<00:03:55.570> get<00:03:55.780> down<00:03:55.930> in<00:03:56.140> the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
penetrating pool would get down in the

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.080 
penetrating pool would get down in the
threads<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.800> help<00:03:57.010> loosen<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.550> up<00:03:57.700> so<00:03:57.940> it

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
threads and help loosen it up so it

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.180 
threads and help loosen it up so it
would<00:03:58.209> back<00:03:58.420> out<00:03:58.690> and<00:03:58.959> then<00:03:59.500> the<00:03:59.620> final<00:04:00.010> thing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
would back out and then the final thing

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.040 
would back out and then the final thing
this<00:04:00.370> was<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:00.580> tip<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.060> saw<00:04:01.270> on<00:04:01.450> one<00:04:01.630> plumbing

drain and what that supposedly does is

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.830 
drain and what that supposedly does is
make<00:04:18.910> sure<00:04:19.140> plumber's<00:04:20.140> putty

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840

under the flashing a little bit more
pliable<00:04:24.740> and<00:04:25.280> will<00:04:26.240> help<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:27.520> drain<00:04:28.520> back<00:04:28.850> out
