Welcometo nishmadhulika.com

00:00:06.935 --> 00:00:11.681
Today we will prepare Poha Cutlets which are very tasty.

00:00:12.036 --> 00:00:18.528
They can be made and had for breakfast or as a light tea time snack.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.531
Ingredients rqeuired:

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.328
Poha (beaten rice) - 1 cup

00:00:27.695 --> 00:00:29.045
Bread slices - 3

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:32.309
Oil - to fry cutlets

00:00:32.661 --> 00:00:35.066
Boiled potatoes - 2

00:00:35.434 --> 00:00:37.195
Flour (maida) - 2 tbsp

00:00:37.484 --> 00:00:40.547
Green coriander - 2 tbsp (finely chopped)

00:00:41.051 --> 00:00:43.861
Ginger - 1" long piece (grated)

00:00:44.054 --> 00:00:46.355
Green chillies - 2 (finely chopped)

00:00:46.541 --> 00:00:49.359
Salt - 3/4 tsp or add to taste

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.544
Red chilly powder - 1/4 tsp

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.183
Black pepper - less than than 1/4 tsp

00:00:56.456 --> 00:01:01.845
First of all, we will soak Poha to begin making Poha Cutlets.

00:01:02.152 --> 00:01:11.756
Put Poha in any strainer and pour water over it.

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:15.020
Water should keep flowing from the strainer, do not block it.

00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:30.331
Leave them aside, soaked for 5 minutes so that they ferment.

00:01:31.811 --> 00:01:36.216
Until then, let us peel the potatoes.

00:01:41.655 --> 00:01:46.655
Mash them properly or you can even grate them.

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:55.110
Prepare flour mix by adding 4-5 tbsp water to 2 tbsp flour.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:03.712
Stir till you get a smooth mix without any lumps.

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:21.662
Add 2-3 pinch salt (half of 1/4 tsp) and black pepper to this flour mix. Mix well.

00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.869
Let us make bread crumbs out of the bread slices.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:35.729
Break the slices and put them in a mixer and grind to make bread crumbs.

00:02:53.937 --> 00:02:59.167
The soaked Poha is also done so put it in mashed potatoes.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:27.827
Add red chilly powder, salt, green chillies, ginger and green coriander.

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:37.345
Mix all the ingredients thoroughly.

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:49.039
The mixture required to make cutlets is ready, so let us make cutlets with it.

00:03:49.384 --> 00:03:56.307
Take some mixture in you hand and give it a round

00:03:56.308 --> 00:04:02.261
or any shape you want(round, ovel, square).

00:04:02.558 --> 00:04:05.534
Here we are making round shaped cutlets.

00:04:08.048 --> 00:04:16.611
These can be directly cooked but if wrapped in bread crumbs then the cutlets become very crispy.

00:04:17.113 --> 00:04:36.416
Dip the cutlet in the flour mix made earlier, then coat it with the bread crumbs.

00:04:36.951 --> 00:04:39.364
Press the cutlets gently with your palm and fingers.

00:04:39.502 --> 00:04:41.288
Keep them on a plate.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:46.068
Similarly make all of the cutlets.

00:04:49.147 --> 00:04:52.099
The cutlets are ready.

00:04:52.412 --> 00:05:03.746
They can be deep fried if you prefer more oil or shallow fried if you prefer less oil.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.901
For now we will shallow fry the cutlets.

00:05:09.223 --> 00:05:10.326
Heat a pan.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:16.391
Pour 2-3 tbsp oil in hot pan.

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:22.089
Once oil is heated, place cutlets in the pan.

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:28.185
Place as many cutlets that can fit in the fan.

00:05:32.574 --> 00:05:35.844
Fry cutlets on a medium flame.

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:38.800
Turn them over when they turn brown on the lower side.

00:05:39.097 --> 00:05:43.660
Cutlets have turned brown on the lower side so we will turn them over.

00:05:47.605 --> 00:05:51.740
Now fry them till the other side turns brown too.

00:05:52.055 --> 00:05:56.713
Cutlets have turned brown on both sides and we will take them out.

00:06:02.478 --> 00:06:04.550
Similarly fry the remaining cutlets.

00:06:17.107 --> 00:06:22.608
Poha Cutlets are ready, they are very delicious and crispy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.294
Whenever you feel like make Poha Cutlets and eat.
