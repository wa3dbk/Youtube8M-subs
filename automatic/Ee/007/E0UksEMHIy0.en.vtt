00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.359
 Doha users some questions explained goal is clear 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.020
 because today I want you January as 2 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.169
 it's about Wolf, Haas, there are these 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.129
 with Laura specifically 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.969
 high percent yesterday did not come out net or the day before yesterday I have 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.189
 read on iPhone Ticker 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.439
 I think somewhere 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.820
 one calls for the case that 1 4 percent four points 1 4 im going that too 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.310
 because otherwise 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.850
 is not possible why 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.290
 in the price 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.590
 to see here first 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 Gundi around in the door puts this 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.590
 the latte 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.250
 that's also the Ergster later on it 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.110
 You can be here first 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.110
 Willow pick the color 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.940
 the black one does not really see what is impossible 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.200
 TLZ of the 20th 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.910
 Percent then there is still here all possible why actually you can do a lot 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.840
 have fun 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.900
 solve red-red 70 pence 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.070
 as a background 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.070
 Qatar heard and changed 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.950
 several times 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.190
 Prüm that is possible you can of course also an iMac upload so 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.900
 a picture 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.570
 you were so afraid of image you are 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 a new central goal could have this courage 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 good around 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.670
 how lives 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.620
 and that's good 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.590
 No and it is so small that it is stupid here 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.590
 August what the procedure was 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.830
 so far 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.080
 not very nice pictures again and how 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.299
 fit well with it 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.299
 Harare 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.420
 if we just this this time she is 20 inches from Dortmund 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.790
 the finish line 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.500
 how far on bring you is we then see percent how it looks when the 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.600
 are here now 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.780
 Of course you can do that 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240
 and around 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.999
 Developers then stands on SC 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.430
 now he is also percent 2 6 kilos Voith Paper 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.449
 «I topic 

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:21.449
 for me JEM would be in photos 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.079
 secured photos 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.299
 and then just click here 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.939
 in Langenhorn 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.789
 the background 

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:35.459
 notwithstanding that I have the second percent iPod I can 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.349
 unfortunately no shirt wallpaper 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:41.009
 we put that is a pity but 

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:44.929
 so is one for an iPhone or products 9 percent is already old 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.069
 that so it is not interesting 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.499
 that's it 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:50.849
 then look the 2 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.279
 in Torgau as a super comment and kept what he did not do 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.129
 is free and what I wanted to say is around as we said we can 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.759
 Developers continue to look forward 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.139
 through more kicker I can then percent at many normal percent 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.139
 from which they give the players free Herolz to you so 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:09.959
 consistently tactician actually mainly there is several times 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.269
 displayed and if there are good free games that are also tweeted 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.169
 so 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.620
 we'll cancel episodes and then you'll see the density of you 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.840
 how are they going to be masters »will be right from the beginning 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.529
