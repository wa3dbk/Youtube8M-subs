you a technique I learned from comrade
Pavel<00:00:07.620> Jocelyn<00:00:08.069> in<00:00:08.220> his<00:00:08.400> book<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.940> naked

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Pavel Jocelyn in his book the naked

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.390 
Pavel Jocelyn in his book the naked
warrior<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.469> technique<00:00:10.800> will<00:00:10.980> help<00:00:11.010> you

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:20.450 
warrior and this technique will help you
increase<00:00:11.820> your<00:00:12.179> push-up<00:00:12.990> repetitions<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:19.460> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
increase your push-up repetitions so the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.890 
increase your push-up repetitions so the
technique<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.880> will<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.180> using<00:00:21.570> today<00:00:21.689> is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
technique we will be using today is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.560 
technique we will be using today is
named<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.619> corkscrew<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.760> corkscrew<00:00:24.390> is

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
named the corkscrew and the corkscrew is

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.980 
named the corkscrew and the corkscrew is
based<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.460> spiral<00:00:26.460> tension<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.210> think<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
based on spiral tension so think of this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
based on spiral tension so think of this
technique<00:00:28.680> as<00:00:29.070> an<00:00:29.279> example<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.970> know<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.179> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
technique as an example you know in a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.900 
technique as an example you know in a
simple<00:00:30.750> karate<00:00:31.080> punch<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.619> way<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.640> arm

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
simple karate punch the way the arm

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.720 
simple karate punch the way the arm
twists<00:00:33.510> through<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.140> shoulder<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:34.770> think<00:00:35.640> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
twists through the shoulder or think of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.389 
twists through the shoulder or think of
how<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.090> used<00:00:36.180> also<00:00:36.750> in<00:00:36.960> rifle<00:00:37.739> firearms<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
how it's used also in rifle firearms you

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.940 
how it's used also in rifle firearms you
know<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> way<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> barrel<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.629> built<00:00:40.530> inside

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
know the way the barrel is built inside

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.110 
know the way the barrel is built inside
the<00:00:41.010> gun<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.239> bullet<00:00:42.629> spins

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
the gun so the bullet spins

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
the gun so the bullet spins
according<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.149> pawel<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:46.020> also<00:00:46.289> use<00:00:46.860> this

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
according to pawel we can also use this

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700 
according to pawel we can also use this
technique<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:48.090> more<00:00:48.420> push-ups<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.350> I'm
