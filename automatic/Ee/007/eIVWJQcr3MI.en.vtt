00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020

gameplay<00:01:28.380> video<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.890> because<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.130> haven't

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
gameplay video just because I haven't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.600

done<00:01:29.610> anything<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.509> Vita<00:01:30.750> or<00:01:31.610> anything

done anything with the Vita or anything
like<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.930> I<00:01:33.960> thought<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.560> it'd<00:01:34.860> be

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
like that so I thought you know it'd be

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.390 
like that so I thought you know it'd be
cool<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:36.500> Jesus<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> get<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
cool just Jesus if I can get out of this

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.109 
cool just Jesus if I can get out of this
one<00:01:38.579> lock<00:01:38.790> area<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.960> sucks<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:41.340> yeah<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
one lock area this sucks but yeah I just

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
one lock area this sucks but yeah I just
thought<00:01:42.240> it'd<00:01:42.390> be<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.600> nice<00:01:43.590> little<00:01:43.619> change<00:01:44.130> of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
thought it'd be a nice little change of

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.960 
thought it'd be a nice little change of
pace<00:01:44.579> from<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.210> big<00:01:45.840> console<00:01:46.590> endeavors

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.349 

so<00:01:50.970> yeah

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.330
