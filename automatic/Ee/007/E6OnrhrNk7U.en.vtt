00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.830
 game for a while 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 You know where to get those who are not here sic 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.080

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.660
 where we pass is cases there are 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:42.930
 starting a game there 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:46.110
 the gates come in here and they will arrive 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.020
 here and they will turn left they will climb the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 running ladders run and turn to the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.680
 left in this yellow and 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.499
 will turn left again in this 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:07.590
 bridge goes right here a wall and the 

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:12.060
 side of it is going to have but one roof 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.899
 Let's see if we'll keep jumping up 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.889

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.069

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:22.409

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.530
 to want but keep jumping that will 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.020
 right by law of the psiu side is a 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.639
 bit difficult but it's worth it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.959

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:51.060
 You fall, you're going to come back from where 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.380

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.600
 duplicate armor or duplicate item 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.880

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:43.789
 the IACC guys come on this stone comes and jumps 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.400

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:50.000
 able to jump and up went up left the 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.860

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:02.960
 to use that blacksmith here well 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.310
 To get google again to get 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.669
 again the chest 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.760
 You'll have to spend two days I 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:14.570
 I advise you to change the city ​​and 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.970
 spend in r 48 hours and then come back 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:20.539
 in town because if you change your 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.310
 48 hours here you will not be able to 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.950
 I think I should do the bugre but finally change 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.060
 city ​​that I think is better then it is 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.530
 This is what I wanted to pass on to you. 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.870
