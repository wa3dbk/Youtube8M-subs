each stack there that way when I'm
training<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.689> collecting<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.770> can<00:02:05.159> just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
training and collecting them I can just

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160 
training and collecting them I can just
keep<00:02:06.000> walking<00:02:06.360> around<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.719> collecting<00:02:07.020> them

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
and when one stack fills up if my

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
and when one stack fills up if my
inventory<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.239> full<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:09.720> not<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.470> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
inventory is full it's not going to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.619 
inventory is full it's not going to
affect<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.250> it's<00:02:11.879> going<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.300> fill<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
affect that it's going to just fill in

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.370 
affect that it's going to just fill in
the<00:02:12.660> next<00:02:12.959> stack

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the next stack

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.570 
the next stack
that's<00:02:13.470> why<00:02:13.590> i<00:02:13.620> like<00:02:13.770> to<00:02:13.860> keep<00:02:13.950> one<00:02:14.160> same<00:02:14.430> with

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that's why i like to keep one same with

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
that's why i like to keep one same with
leaves<00:02:14.790> i<00:02:14.970> would<00:02:15.090> do<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> same<00:02:15.360> thing<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.200> just

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
leaves i would do the same thing it just

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.520 
leaves i would do the same thing it just
saves<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.620> little<00:02:16.800> bit<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> time<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:18.180> um<00:02:18.450> yes<00:02:19.290> you

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
saves a little bit of time so um yes you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.440 
saves a little bit of time so um yes you
collect<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> boxes<00:02:20.340> and<00:02:20.370> then<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.880> can<00:02:21.060> open

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
collect the boxes and then you can open

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.670 
collect the boxes and then you can open
them<00:02:21.570> get<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> development<00:02:22.230> letters<00:02:22.470> and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
them get the development letters and

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.590 
them get the development letters and
then<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.950> best<00:02:23.130> way<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.370> farm<00:02:23.640> leaves<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.090> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
then the best way to farm leaves is just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.620 
then the best way to farm leaves is just
by<00:02:24.750> getting<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.650> pet<00:02:25.950> and<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.970> know<00:02:27.000> killing

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
by getting that pet and you know killing

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.660 
by getting that pet and you know killing
some<00:02:27.870> monsters<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.440> opening<00:02:28.980> up<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.190> shop<00:02:29.220> and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
selling them for between seven to 12 k

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.830 
selling them for between seven to 12 k
I've<00:02:32.670> seen<00:02:32.910> them<00:02:33.090> right<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.420> I'm<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:33.720> very
