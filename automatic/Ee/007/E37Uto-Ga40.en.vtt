00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 greet you dear friends with you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.509
 grumpy and we continue to use 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.820
 contract exchange vks head me somehow on 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.179
 it is that it carries a greater good 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.670
 guns such we pull out i like that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 see the bengal tiger has changed itself for 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.710
 those guns from the last contract but alas I 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.580
 I decided not to write it, but now I 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.590
 I want to try to get myself ak-47 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.109
 the red line I really hope that I 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.189
 lucky contracts really somehow but 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 better go really want the red line 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.370
 Well, in extreme cases, this is a p90 triangle 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.700
 but I don't want a last resort 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.610
 It is ak-47, it looks awesome and I 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.149
 I hope that I will not let the phallus 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.270
 I bought them 10 pieces and in principle, but this is for me 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.480
 cost all bucks and I hope that all 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.460
 I will pay them back but if we are there 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.690
 do not sell normal quality 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.350
 I will write like that ak-47 red line so 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:12.740
 is such a little bit on and it seems so 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.840
 lines let me ok and sends 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:21.450
 logically lucky very much hope that we will 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 will be ak-47 and and yes yes yes ok and quite 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.090
 red line but rather like 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.420
 not bad quality in my little 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 worn he damn finally out of luck 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.380
 again very good yes he seems to be 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.829
 a little worn well, not straight 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 so much scary i leave myself not 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.110
 I will sell it for a long time I wanted it and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.110
