okay<00:03:32.489> shiny<00:03:32.820> shiny<00:03:33.030> oily<00:03:33.269> skin<00:03:33.600> would<00:03:33.750> use

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
okay shiny shiny oily skin would use

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.860 
okay shiny shiny oily skin would use
very<00:03:34.500> often<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.220> most<00:03:35.660> common<00:03:36.660> causes

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
very often one of the most common causes

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.930 
very often one of the most common causes
for<00:03:37.049> consistently<00:03:37.769> oily<00:03:38.070> skin<00:03:38.310> in<00:03:38.400> women<00:03:38.760> is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
for consistently oily skin in women is

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.479 
for consistently oily skin in women is
slightly<00:03:39.750> higher<00:03:40.049> than<00:03:40.079> normal<00:03:40.769> levels<00:03:41.370> of

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
slightly higher than normal levels of

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.150 
slightly higher than normal levels of
androgen<00:03:42.060> hormones<00:03:42.420> okay<00:03:43.380> so<00:03:43.829> things<00:03:44.040> like

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
androgen hormones okay so things like

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.830 
androgen hormones okay so things like
testosterone<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.329> there's<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.600> lot<00:03:45.810> of

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
testosterone and there's a lot of

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.870 
testosterone and there's a lot of
evidence<00:03:46.019> to<00:03:46.410> suggest<00:03:46.560> that<00:03:46.890> high<00:03:47.519> levels<00:03:47.820> of

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
evidence to suggest that high levels of

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.520 
evidence to suggest that high levels of
insulin<00:03:48.299> in<00:03:48.720> our<00:03:48.810> bodies<00:03:49.079> will<00:03:49.200> actually

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
insulin in our bodies will actually

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.860 
insulin in our bodies will actually
cause<00:03:50.280> an<00:03:50.459> increase<00:03:50.730> release<00:03:51.060> in<00:03:51.209> those<00:03:51.360> so

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
cause an increase release in those so

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.840 
cause an increase release in those so
the<00:03:51.989> real<00:03:52.140> key<00:03:52.350> is<00:03:52.560> to<00:03:52.709> move<00:03:52.890> towards<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.310> low<00:03:53.579> GI

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
the real key is to move towards a low GI

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.539 
the real key is to move towards a low GI
diet<00:03:53.910> right<00:03:54.660> okay<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:55.709> that's<00:03:55.890> choosing<00:03:56.280> foods

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
diet right okay so that's choosing foods

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:57.560 
diet right okay so that's choosing foods
that<00:03:56.670> are<00:03:56.790> going<00:03:56.910> to<00:03:56.970> release<00:03:57.209> their<00:03:57.450> energy

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
that are going to release their energy

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.509 
that are going to release their energy
very<00:03:57.959> very<00:03:58.170> slowly<00:03:58.440> so<00:03:58.590> young<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.100> blood<00:03:59.250> sugar

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
very very slowly so young in blood sugar

00:03:59.519 --> 00:03:59.870 
very very slowly so young in blood sugar
spikes

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
spikes

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.400 
spikes
great<00:04:00.180> things<00:04:00.480> like<00:04:00.630> whole<00:04:00.870> grains<00:04:01.110> brown

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410

vegetables and then other nutrients can
be<00:04:07.560> useful<00:04:07.860> too<00:04:08.010> zinc<00:04:08.549> is<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> perfect<00:04:09.150> example

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
be useful too zinc is a perfect example

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.259 
be useful too zinc is a perfect example
would<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.709> take<00:04:10.920> that<00:04:10.950> in<00:04:11.400> food<00:04:11.790> okay<00:04:12.150> would

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
can feel self-conscious

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.170 
can feel self-conscious
so<00:04:42.410> what<00:04:42.770> do<00:04:42.830> we<00:04:42.890> think<00:04:42.980> Wickham<00:04:43.490> appeal<00:04:43.880> or

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
so what do we think Wickham appeal or

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.180 
so what do we think Wickham appeal or
eczema<00:04:44.690> is<00:04:44.840> it's<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:45.800> an<00:04:45.920> inflammatory

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
eczema is it's it's an inflammatory

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.350 
eczema is it's it's an inflammatory
condition<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:46.940> what<00:04:47.030> we<00:04:47.120> call<00:04:47.330> a

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
condition so what we call a

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.360 
condition so what we call a
hypersensitivity<00:04:48.320> reaction<00:04:48.980> where<00:04:49.130> the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
hypersensitivity reaction where the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.490 
hypersensitivity reaction where the
immune<00:04:49.610> system<00:04:49.970> has<00:04:50.000> become<00:04:50.320> sensitized<00:04:51.320> to

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
immune system has become sensitized to

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.350 
immune system has become sensitized to
something<00:04:52.010> and<00:04:52.250> then<00:04:52.580> causes<00:04:52.970> an

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
something and then causes an

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.180 
something and then causes an
inflammatory<00:04:53.600> flare-up<00:04:54.260> so<00:04:54.740> controlling

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
inflammatory flare-up so controlling

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.040 
inflammatory flare-up so controlling
inflammation<00:04:55.430> with<00:04:55.820> diet<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:56.240> possible<00:04:56.720> all

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
inflammation with diet is possible all

to create its own natural

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.620 
to create its own natural
anti-inflammatory<00:05:06.560> compounds<00:05:07.040> okay<00:05:07.970> then

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
anti-inflammatory compounds okay then

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.150 
anti-inflammatory compounds okay then

we've got tomatoes and beetroot here

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.010 
we've got tomatoes and beetroot here
again<00:05:10.550> these<00:05:10.760> are<00:05:10.910> very<00:05:11.090> very<00:05:11.270> high<00:05:11.630> in<00:05:11.900> the

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
again these are very very high in the

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.720 
again these are very very high in the
fat<00:05:12.260> soluble<00:05:12.560> antioxidants<00:05:13.310> we<00:05:13.460> spoke<00:05:13.700> about

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
fat soluble antioxidants we spoke about

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.060 
fat soluble antioxidants we spoke about
earlier<00:05:14.450> helps<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.470> control<00:05:15.800> inflammation

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
earlier helps to control inflammation

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.800 
earlier helps to control inflammation
that<00:05:16.850> means<00:05:17.060> things<00:05:17.240> because<00:05:17.390> I<00:05:17.450> had<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.660> be

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
of omega-3 is the place I had avoiding

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.170 
of omega-3 is the place I had avoiding
things<00:05:23.840> like<00:05:24.050> too<00:05:24.770> much<00:05:24.890> of<00:05:25.010> vegetable<00:05:25.370> oil<00:05:25.580> so

that's got lots of omega-6 in it that

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.430 
that's got lots of omega-6 in it that
can<00:05:27.770> actually<00:05:27.920> make<00:05:28.160> inflammation<00:05:28.850> worse

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440

there's<00:05:49.130> an<00:05:49.220> inflammatory<00:05:49.700> component<00:05:49.970> to<00:05:50.450> it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
there's an inflammatory component to it
