00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.280 
hill so the advantage of these is you
get<00:00:30.789> really<00:00:31.060> accurate<00:00:31.390> distance<00:00:32.019> as<00:00:32.140> you're

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
get really accurate distance as you're

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.259 
get really accurate distance as you're
running<00:00:32.379> and<00:00:32.710> also<00:00:33.280> accurate<00:00:33.760> page<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.180> you

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
running and also accurate page so you

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:36.210

can<00:00:34.330> train<00:00:34.600> to<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> pace<00:00:35.110> for<00:00:35.650> example<00:00:36.040> a

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
can train to a pace for example a

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.950 
can train to a pace for example a
six-minute<00:00:36.699> mile<00:00:36.850> rather<00:00:37.479> than<00:00:37.600> training<00:00:37.780> in

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
six-minute mile rather than training in

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.060 
six-minute mile rather than training in
heart<00:00:38.170> rate<00:00:38.320> zones<00:00:38.530> which<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:38.769> a<00:00:38.800> little<00:00:38.979> bit

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
heart rate zones which is a little bit

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.040 
heart rate zones which is a little bit
more<00:00:39.220> difficult<00:00:39.640> okay<00:00:40.300> so<00:00:40.360> what<00:00:40.629> are<00:00:40.720> the<00:00:40.809> what

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
more difficult okay so what are the what

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.000 
more difficult okay so what are the what
