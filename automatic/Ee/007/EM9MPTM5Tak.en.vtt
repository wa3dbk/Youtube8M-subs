uni and study what I want to do but I

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.560 
uni and study what I want to do but I
did<00:00:34.950> some<00:00:35.370> research<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.880> note<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.210> spoke<00:00:36.420> to

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
did some research on the note I spoke to

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.600 
did some research on the note I spoke to
some<00:00:36.690> previous<00:00:37.079> students<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> finally

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
some previous students and finally

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.069 
some previous students and finally
decided<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.180> venue<00:00:39.420> step<00:00:39.600> program<00:00:39.930> with

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
decided that venue step program with

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.049 
decided that venue step program with
what<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> wanted<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.770> new<00:00:41.280> step<00:00:41.460> program<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
what I wanted to do new step program is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.690 
what I wanted to do new step program is
unique<00:00:42.930> because<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.590> doesn't<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.129> offer<00:00:44.399> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
unique because it doesn't just offer you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.819 
unique because it doesn't just offer you
a<00:00:44.969> pathway<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.780> university<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
a pathway to university so it just

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.650 
a pathway to university so it just
doesn't<00:00:47.129> give<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.370> HR<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.210> gives<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
doesn't give you the HR it gives you so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
doesn't give you the HR it gives you so
much<00:00:48.780> more<00:00:48.840> than<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.910> given<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
much more than that you're given the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.420 
much more than that you're given the
experience<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.960> get<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.649> know<00:00:52.770> what<00:00:53.010> campus
