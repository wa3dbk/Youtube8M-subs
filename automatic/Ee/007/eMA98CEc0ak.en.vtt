00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.360 
miserably not only through accuracy but
the<00:03:11.610> trajectory<00:03:12.610> is<00:03:12.760> going<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.150> be<00:03:13.239> quite<00:03:13.480> bad

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
the trajectory is going to be quite bad

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.820 
the trajectory is going to be quite bad
it's<00:03:15.370> going<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:15.640> fall<00:03:15.879> down<00:03:15.910> quite<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:17.230> very

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
it's going to fall down quite so very

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.880 
it's going to fall down quite so very
quick<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:19.450> distance<00:03:19.900> achieve<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.620> one<00:03:20.860> I

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
quick the distance achieve this one I

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.059 
quick the distance achieve this one I
think<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.340> going<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.580> be<00:03:21.640> very<00:03:21.819> poor<00:03:22.650> on<00:03:23.650> the

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
think is going to be very poor on the

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.960 
think is going to be very poor on the
lid<00:03:24.250> it<00:03:24.400> does<00:03:24.580> status<00:03:25.090> for<00:03:25.300> fhe<00:03:25.810> only<00:03:26.170> rifles

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
lid it does status for fhe only rifles

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.000 
lid it does status for fhe only rifles
I'm<00:03:27.970> sure<00:03:28.269> there's<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.599> few<00:03:28.870> lower<00:03:29.530> powered

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
I'm sure there's a few lower powered

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.490 
I'm sure there's a few lower powered
rifles<00:03:30.549> that<00:03:30.790> use<00:03:31.030> these<00:03:31.299> successfully<00:03:32.080> close

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
rifles that use these successfully close

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.680 
rifles that use these successfully close
range<00:03:33.780> bra<00:03:34.780> fan<00:03:35.080> for<00:03:35.319> my<00:03:35.440> rifle<00:03:36.299> these<00:03:37.299> are<00:03:37.540> no

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
range bra fan for my rifle these are no

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.539 
range bra fan for my rifle these are no
good<00:03:37.720> whatsoever<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:41.280> very<00:03:42.280> simply<00:03:43.349> decided

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
good whatsoever so very simply decided

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.810 
good whatsoever so very simply decided
it's<00:03:45.549> a<00:03:45.730> reject<00:03:46.239> decision
