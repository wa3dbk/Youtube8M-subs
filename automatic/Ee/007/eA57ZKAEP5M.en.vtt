00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.380
 Although it seems that everything is the same, you get to 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:04.200
 a center and you come to a hole where you 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.810
 generates a change only in the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.050

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.080
 if you do not think the mind is about to 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.870
 finish a psychology book and have 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.300

 the guy from eight ' marked the life of 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.670

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.190
 undoubted reference on television 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.800
 world however for ana lilia of the 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.690
 macorra was just an anecdote has not 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.270
 reconnected with none of the 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.790
 actors of that memorable cast and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.100
 He prefers to remain just that one 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.590

 out of the noise of television 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:37.430
 listening to the placid music that gives 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.700
 the silence that seems to follow 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.820
