00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
doesn't they don't always have the DC

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.360 
doesn't they don't always have the DC
power<00:03:34.030> outs<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:34.990> kind<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.320> incredibly<00:03:35.980> handy

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370

up a lot of space on your pedal board
and<00:03:43.510> you<00:03:43.600> can<00:03:43.720> kind<00:03:43.930> of<00:03:43.990> try<00:03:44.620> and<00:03:44.740> find<00:03:44.950> a<00:03:45.100> way

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
and you can kind of try and find a way

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.250 
and you can kind of try and find a way
to<00:03:45.250> make<00:03:45.490> it<00:03:45.520> fit<00:03:45.850> another<00:03:46.840> thing<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:47.200> I

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
to make it fit another thing that I

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.070 
to make it fit another thing that I
really<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.620> about<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.920> if<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.400> are<00:03:48.490> playing

want to switch on the fly I want to turn
off<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.240> analog<00:04:01.630> filter<00:04:01.960> and<00:04:02.170> turn<00:04:02.410> on<00:04:02.560> the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
off the analog filter and turn on the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:14.550 
off the analog filter and turn on the
gilliam<00:04:03.970> and<00:04:04.120> oh<00:04:08.730> I<00:04:12.300> can<00:04:13.300> just<00:04:13.480> with<00:04:14.020> one<00:04:14.260> foot

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
gilliam and oh I can just with one foot

turn off one and turn on the other if

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.080 
turn off one and turn on the other if
they're<00:04:17.100> right<00:04:18.100> beside<00:04:18.280> each<00:04:18.520> other<00:04:18.820> it's

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
they're right beside each other it's

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.360 
they're right beside each other it's
it's<00:04:19.480> nice<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.020> handy<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.440> be<00:04:20.950> able<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.160> do

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
it's nice and handy to be able to do

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's nice and handy to be able to do
that<00:04:21.520> and<00:04:21.790> just<00:04:22.570> gives<00:04:22.780> you<00:04:22.900> a<00:04:22.930> little<00:04:23.470> bit

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
that and just gives you a little bit

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.150 
that and just gives you a little bit
more<00:04:23.680> flexibility<00:04:24.280> I<00:04:25.620> think<00:04:26.620> it's<00:04:26.740> incredibly

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
more flexibility I think it's incredibly

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.030 
more flexibility I think it's incredibly
great<00:04:27.400> product<00:04:27.820> one<00:04:28.780> control<00:04:29.169> has<00:04:29.410> revised

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
great product one control has revised

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000 
great product one control has revised
this<00:04:30.370> one<00:04:30.580> this<00:04:30.790> is<00:04:30.970> a<00:04:31.000> mark<00:04:31.630> 2<00:04:31.870> I<00:04:32.110> didn't<00:04:32.830> have

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
this one this is a mark 2 I didn't have

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.480 
this one this is a mark 2 I didn't have
a<00:04:33.190> mark<00:04:33.580> the<00:04:34.240> first<00:04:34.419> original<00:04:34.930> one<00:04:35.260> but<00:04:36.160> my

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
a mark the first original one but my

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.670 
a mark the first original one but my
assumption<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.180> they<00:04:37.630> made<00:04:38.500> some

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
assumption is that they made some

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.140 
assumption is that they made some
improvements<00:04:39.160> probably<00:04:39.610> maybe<00:04:39.760> it's<00:04:39.910> a<00:04:40.000> bit

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
improvements probably maybe it's a bit

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.330 
improvements probably maybe it's a bit
smaller<00:04:40.450> a<00:04:40.540> little<00:04:40.630> bit<00:04:40.810> lighter<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:42.070> they

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
smaller a little bit lighter and they

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.280 
smaller a little bit lighter and they
took<00:04:42.520> some<00:04:42.910> consideration<00:04:43.600> from<00:04:44.050> some

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
took some consideration from some

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.800 
took some consideration from some
players<00:04:44.620> that<00:04:44.919> gave<00:04:45.850> them<00:04:46.030> some<00:04:46.180> feedback<00:04:46.330> but

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
players that gave them some feedback but

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.440 
players that gave them some feedback but

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
have a

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.860 
have a
in<00:05:22.450> your<00:05:22.570> chain<00:05:22.810> that<00:05:23.410> decides<00:05:23.830> not<00:05:24.040> to<00:05:24.100> work

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:24.870 
in your chain that decides not to work

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.830 
in your chain that decides not to work
then<00:05:25.870> you<00:05:25.900> don't<00:05:26.620> turn<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.490> pedal<00:05:27.970> on<00:05:28.120> you

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
then you don't turn that pedal on you

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.960 
then you don't turn that pedal on you
just<00:05:29.020> leave<00:05:29.290> it<00:05:29.410> out<00:05:29.560> and<00:05:29.770> your<00:05:30.160> signal<00:05:30.820> just

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
just leave it out and your signal just

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.630 
just leave it out and your signal just
bypasses<00:05:31.660> from<00:05:31.870> that<00:05:32.080> to<00:05:32.500> the<00:05:32.680> to<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.490> other

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
bypasses from that to the to the other

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.780 
bypasses from that to the to the other
side<00:05:33.910> of<00:05:34.060> the<00:05:34.120> loop<00:05:34.300> and<00:05:34.510> so<00:05:35.500> it's<00:05:36.100> just<00:05:36.190> really

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
side of the loop and so it's just really

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:40.350 
side of the loop and so it's just really
really<00:05:37.300> handy<00:05:37.810> in<00:05:38.590> a<00:05:38.680> lot<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.890> applications<00:05:39.610> to

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
really handy in a lot of applications to

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.050 
really handy in a lot of applications to
have<00:05:40.510> a<00:05:40.540> looper<00:05:40.900> and<00:05:41.290> so<00:05:41.560> one<00:05:42.370> control<00:05:42.760> has

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
have a looper and so one control has

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.490 
have a looper and so one control has
done<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.270> really<00:05:43.480> great<00:05:43.660> design<00:05:44.080> with<00:05:44.320> this

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
done a really great design with this

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.770 
done a really great design with this
model<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.070> it's<00:05:45.370> five<00:05:45.820> loops<00:05:46.150> it's<00:05:46.480> just<00:05:46.690> a

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
model and it's five loops it's just a

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.860 
model and it's five loops it's just a
few<00:05:47.460> loops<00:05:48.460> they<00:05:48.820> make<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.060> smaller<00:05:49.450> one<00:05:49.630> they

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
few loops they make a smaller one they

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.660 
few loops they make a smaller one they
make<00:05:50.050> a<00:05:50.080> bigger<00:05:50.320> one<00:05:50.410> they<00:05:51.130> have<00:05:51.250> some<00:05:51.430> really

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
make a bigger one they have some really

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.310 
make a bigger one they have some really
really<00:05:51.790> cool<00:05:51.940> neat<00:05:52.570> controllers<00:05:53.170> and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
really cool neat controllers and

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.250 
really cool neat controllers and
switchers<00:05:53.650> available<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.750> this<00:05:55.750> one<00:05:55.930> was

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
switchers available and this one was

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.850 
switchers available and this one was
shipped<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.710> me<00:05:57.660> very<00:05:58.660> very<00:05:58.900> fast<00:05:59.200> and<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.740> was
