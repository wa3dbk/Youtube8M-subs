video as well so you can see how it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.900 
video as well so you can see how it
makes<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.920> difference<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> what<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.360> shoot<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the reason I bought it is number one

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.959 
the reason I bought it is number one
because<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.219> price<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.670> number<00:00:38.850> two

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because of the price but number two

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.459 
because of the price but number two
because<00:00:39.090> it's<00:00:39.300> really<00:00:39.570> versatile<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.320> I

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
because it's really versatile so I

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.530 
because it's really versatile so I
didn't<00:00:41.460> want<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.730> because<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.239> mean<00:00:42.360> not

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
what it does is pretty cool so let's not

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.060 
what it does is pretty cool so let's not
with<00:01:11.010> DSLR<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> first<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.439> screw

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
with DSLR to it first a little and screw

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.050 
with DSLR to it first a little and screw
on<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> bottom<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
on the bottom there you have it

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.160 
on the bottom there you have it
different<00:01:18.060> things<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.750> don't<00:01:24.810> know<00:01:24.990> is

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
different things and I don't know is

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.850 
different things and I don't know is
easier<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.590> mount<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> SLR<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.290> before<00:01:28.290> or

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
easier to mount the SLR on it before or

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.730 
easier to mount the SLR on it before or
after<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.610> sort<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> found

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
after you sort of set it up but I found

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.620 
after you sort of set it up but I found
it<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.549> much<00:01:32.759> difference<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:33.210> boy<00:01:33.360> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it don't make much difference he boy so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
it don't make much difference he boy so
family<00:01:34.320> over<00:01:34.500> there<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.890> now<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
family over there like that now the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
family over there like that now the
easiest<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.540> found<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.770> your

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
easiest thing I found is you get your

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.550 
easiest thing I found is you get your
two<00:01:38.070> arms<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.570> pull<00:01:39.810> those<00:01:40.170> out

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
two arms on the side you pull those out

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.240 
two arms on the side you pull those out
and<00:01:41.509> then<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.750> pull<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.170> around<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and then you can pull them around and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.160 
and then you can pull them around and
that<00:01:44.460> will<00:01:44.840> free<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:47.149> underneath<00:01:48.170> that's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that will free up the underneath that's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
that will free up the underneath that's
been<00:01:49.409> on<00:01:49.590> its<00:01:49.710> own<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.189> then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
been on its own and then

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
been on its own and then
so<00:01:52.530> that<00:01:52.770> already<00:01:53.990> it<00:01:54.990> makes<00:01:55.170> a<00:01:55.290> pretty<00:01:55.470> cheap

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so that already it makes a pretty cheap

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.789 
so that already it makes a pretty cheap
and<00:01:56.130> easy<00:01:56.610> tripod<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.540> if<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.259> need<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.560> just

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and easy tripod and if you need to just

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.620 
and easy tripod and if you need to just
mount<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> camera<00:01:59.430> somewhere<00:01:59.640> quickly<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
mount you camera somewhere quickly so

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.570 
mount you camera somewhere quickly so
it's<00:02:00.810> out<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.110> way<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.440> where<00:02:02.250> it's<00:02:02.430> not

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
it's out of the way and where it's not

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.070 
it's out of the way and where it's not
just<00:02:02.640> still<00:02:03.090> on<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.509> ground<00:02:03.659> level

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
just still on the ground level

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.679 
just still on the ground level
so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:06.180> pretty<00:02:06.390> cool<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
so you know this is it's pretty cool you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.510 
so you know this is it's pretty cool you
know<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:06.930> can<00:02:07.080> adapt<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.590> slider<00:02:08.009> or

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
know you can adapt to a slider or

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.400 
know you can adapt to a slider or
something<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.810> just<00:02:09.959> give<00:02:10.080> yourself<00:02:10.170> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
something and just give yourself a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.630 
something and just give yourself a
little<00:02:10.530> bit<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.770> extra<00:02:10.950> stability<00:02:11.190> there

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
little bit of extra stability there

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.240 
little bit of extra stability there
straight<00:02:11.910> away<00:02:12.000> now<00:02:12.630> what<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.739> really<00:02:14.010> going

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
straight away now what I'm really going

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.449 
straight away now what I'm really going
to<00:02:14.280> use<00:02:14.459> it<00:02:14.580> most<00:02:14.730> for<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.350> lift<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.280> one

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
to use it most for if you lift this one

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:28.690 
to use it most for if you lift this one
up<00:02:17.520> like<00:02:17.760> that<00:02:18.620> unscrew<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:23.900> around<00:02:24.900> there

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.229 

saying<00:02:29.700> it<00:02:29.880> back<00:02:30.090> up<00:02:31.100> and<00:02:32.100> then<00:02:32.160> you've<00:02:32.640> got<00:02:32.880> a

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
saying it back up and then you've got a

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.240 
saying it back up and then you've got a
pretty<00:02:33.720> pretty<00:02:34.440> easy<00:02:34.680> pretty<00:02:34.980> quick

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
pretty pretty easy pretty quick

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.759 
pretty pretty easy pretty quick
shouldering<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:36.450> that's<00:02:37.200> going<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> give<00:02:37.620> you

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
shouldering so that's going to give you

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.800 
shouldering so that's going to give you
great<00:02:38.250> stability<00:02:38.819> when<00:02:39.090> you're<00:02:39.239> moving<00:02:39.330> and

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
great stability when you're moving and

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.330 
great stability when you're moving and
the<00:02:40.140> idea<00:02:40.380> is<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.950> shoot<00:02:41.100> really

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
the idea is then you can shoot really

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280 
the idea is then you can shoot really
quickly<00:02:41.670> we're<00:02:42.120> seeing<00:02:42.360> footage<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.959> you

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
quickly we're seeing footage and you

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.390 
quickly we're seeing footage and you
don't<00:02:43.500> have<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:43.739> worry<00:02:43.920> too<00:02:44.160> much<00:02:44.190> about

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
don't have to worry too much about

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.320 
don't have to worry too much about
camera<00:02:45.150> shake<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:46.430> my<00:02:47.430> idea<00:02:47.760> also<00:02:47.940> is<00:02:48.239> going

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
camera shake and my idea also is going

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.940 
camera shake and my idea also is going
to<00:02:48.390> be<00:02:48.450> Adam<00:02:48.870> why<00:02:49.260> not<00:02:49.380> try<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.590> get<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.739> rail

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
to be Adam why not try and get a rail

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.830 
to be Adam why not try and get a rail
system<00:02:50.190> check<00:02:50.549> amount<00:02:50.790> of<00:02:50.970> follow<00:02:51.239> focus<00:02:51.510> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
system check amount of follow focus to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.520 
system check amount of follow focus to
it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.340 
it
I've<00:02:53.430> been<00:02:53.580> looking<00:02:53.880> online<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.750> people<00:02:55.140> are

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
I've been looking online and people are

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.170 
I've been looking online and people are
using<00:02:55.560> these<00:02:55.829> like<00:02:56.160> Jarrah<00:02:56.459> doesn't<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.030> might

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
using these like Jarrah doesn't I might

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.370 
using these like Jarrah doesn't I might
get<00:02:57.299> some<00:02:57.450> of<00:02:57.540> those<00:02:57.600> as<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.900> stopgap<00:02:59.329> but

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
get some of those as a stopgap but

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.509 
get some of those as a stopgap but
ultimately<00:03:01.380> I'd<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:01.920> get<00:03:02.040> proper<00:03:02.340> follow

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
ultimately I'd like to get proper follow

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.880 
ultimately I'd like to get proper follow
focus<00:03:02.700> now<00:03:03.000> when<00:03:03.630> you're<00:03:03.810> manually<00:03:04.350> focusing

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
focus now when you're manually focusing

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.500 
focus now when you're manually focusing
I<00:03:05.010> find<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.430> little<00:03:05.579> bit<00:03:05.760> difficult<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.360> hold

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
I find it a little bit difficult to hold

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.110 
I find it a little bit difficult to hold
just<00:03:06.750> one<00:03:06.959> side<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.560> arm<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.250> what<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.459> do<00:03:08.609> is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
just one side of the arm so what I do is

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.140 
just one side of the arm so what I do is
if<00:03:09.480> you<00:03:09.660> swing<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.560> around<00:03:10.739> forward<00:03:11.489> gives

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
if you swing that around forward gives

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.000 
if you swing that around forward gives
you<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.480> bit<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.660> extra<00:03:12.870> bit<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.829> can

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
you a little bit of extra bit you can

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.370 
you a little bit of extra bit you can
hold<00:03:14.640> this<00:03:14.850> in<00:03:15.150> where<00:03:15.450> your<00:03:15.600> armpit<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.109> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
hold this in where your armpit is and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340 
hold this in where your armpit is and
then<00:03:16.859> you've<00:03:17.040> got<00:03:17.340> freedom<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.600> focus<00:03:18.989> and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
then you've got freedom to focus and

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.620 
then you've got freedom to focus and
then<00:03:19.470> I'll<00:03:19.620> be<00:03:19.769> even<00:03:20.070> easier<00:03:20.160> if<00:03:21.150> you've<00:03:21.420> got<00:03:21.600> a

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
then I'll be even easier if you've got a

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.539 
then I'll be even easier if you've got a
follow<00:03:21.870> focus<00:03:22.109> on<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.530> side<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:22.769> it<00:03:22.950> so<00:03:23.370> that's

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
follow focus on the side of it so that's

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.180 
follow focus on the side of it so that's
one<00:03:24.000> way<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.269> set<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.630> up<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:25.380> other<00:03:25.500> way<00:03:25.620> which

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
one way to set it up the other way which

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.400 
one way to set it up the other way which
is<00:03:26.269> probably<00:03:27.269> another<00:03:27.660> way<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.870> might<00:03:28.140> use<00:03:28.380> it

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
is probably another way I might use it

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.800 
is probably another way I might use it
is<00:03:29.040> if<00:03:29.430> we<00:03:29.670> don't<00:03:30.090> see<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:31.019> and<00:03:31.850> none<00:03:32.850> tip<00:03:33.150> on

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
is if we don't see that and none tip on

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.319 
is if we don't see that and none tip on
backwards<00:03:34.970> and<00:03:35.970> then<00:03:36.769> fold<00:03:37.769> away<00:03:38.299> one<00:03:39.299> of

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
backwards and then fold away one of

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:51.020 
backwards and then fold away one of
these<00:03:45.230> this<00:03:46.230> round<00:03:46.880> this<00:03:47.880> one<00:03:48.090> up<00:03:49.250> and<00:03:50.250> then

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
these this round this one up and then

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:59.559 
these this round this one up and then
you<00:03:51.540> can<00:03:52.400> loosen<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:55.850> side

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.660 

to<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.629> start<00:04:00.959> around<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.620> you've<00:04:02.099> got<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
to a start around and you've got a

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.430 
to a start around and you've got a
