00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the Crusaders defense and I wonder if

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.830 
the Crusaders defense and I wonder if
it's<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.129> loss<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.640> Prince<00:00:53.910> Amukamara<00:00:54.149> and

brandon spikes that has led to this now
the<00:00:57.329> flip<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.109> coin<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the flip side of this coin is the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.200 
the flip side of this coin is the
players<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.309> taken<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.910> for<00:01:00.059> those

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210

obviously<00:01:13.530> our<00:01:13.770> coverage<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.400> just<00:01:14.640> not

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
obviously our coverage is just not

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.450 
obviously our coverage is just not
getting<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.540> done<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:16.799> feel<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.250> a

getting it done and again I feel like a
lot<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.119> keeps<00:01:18.479> coming<00:01:18.869> back<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
lot of this keeps coming back to the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.870 
lot of this keeps coming back to the
sliders<00:01:20.970> but<00:01:21.630> they<00:01:22.350> weren't<00:01:22.680> really<00:01:23.130> changed

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
sliders but they weren't really changed

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.580 
sliders but they weren't really changed
all<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> much<00:01:24.420> from<00:01:24.960> where<00:01:25.110> we've<00:01:25.290> had<00:01:25.439> them

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
all that much from where we've had them

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.920 
all that much from where we've had them
before<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:26.280> don't<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.210> know<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.689> fix

it I'm really hoping the new man does
not<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.210> these<00:01:30.509> same<00:01:31.140> issues<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:32.130> one

does in terms of one little thing puts

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.340 
does in terms of one little thing puts
it<00:01:35.939> too<00:01:36.270> far<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.600> one<00:01:36.720> direction<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> other

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
it too far in one direction or the other

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.440 
it too far in one direction or the other
quite<00:01:37.950> honestly<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.430> wish<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> wouldn't<00:01:39.270> have<00:01:39.329> to

quite honestly I wish I wouldn't have to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.569 
quite honestly I wish I wouldn't have to
adjust<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.020> sliders<00:01:40.409> at<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.430> in

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
pretty comfortable with what we've seen

pretty comfortable with what we've seen
from<00:03:58.980> Tarpley<00:03:59.699> and<00:03:59.879> the<00:03:59.970> limited<00:04:00.299> time<00:04:00.540> he's

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
from Tarpley and the limited time he's

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.210 
from Tarpley and the limited time he's
played<00:04:01.109> jimmy<00:04:01.889> Moseley<00:04:03.410> 97<00:04:04.410> overall<00:04:04.799> one<00:04:05.099> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
played jimmy Moseley 97 overall one of

played jimmy Moseley 97 overall one of
the<00:04:05.280> best<00:04:05.549> free<00:04:05.849> safeties<00:04:06.239> in<00:04:06.269> the<00:04:06.480> entire<00:04:06.780> NFL

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
the best free safeties in the entire NFL

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.119 
the best free safeties in the entire NFL
but<00:04:07.620> he's<00:04:08.400> kind<00:04:08.699> of<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:10.079> seems<00:04:10.560> like<00:04:10.769> he<00:04:10.919> took

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
but he's kind of it seems like he took

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:13.610 
but he's kind of it seems like he took
the<00:04:11.370> last<00:04:11.579> year<00:04:11.940> off<00:04:12.150> he<00:04:12.870> really<00:04:13.319> didn't<00:04:13.530> have

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
some catches we've seen a lot of pretty

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.200 
some catches we've seen a lot of pretty
nice<00:04:25.770> place<00:04:26.039> from<00:04:26.250> Tarpley

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
nice place from Tarpley

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.460 
nice place from Tarpley
and<00:04:27.360> we're<00:04:27.479> going<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.660> kind<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.930> continue<00:04:28.110> with

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
and we're going to kind of continue with

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.260 
and we're going to kind of continue with
this<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:28.889> now<00:04:28.919> obviously<00:04:29.669> that<00:04:29.880> could<00:04:30.060> change

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
this for now obviously that could change

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.059 
this for now obviously that could change
I<00:04:30.539> do<00:04:30.600> feel<00:04:30.930> like<00:04:31.050> Jimmy<00:04:31.289> Mosley's<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.889> better

00:04:32.059 --> 00:04:32.069 
I do feel like Jimmy Mosley's the better

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.249 
I do feel like Jimmy Mosley's the better
player<00:04:32.370> but<00:04:33.300> he's<00:04:33.389> definitely<00:04:33.600> slumping<00:04:34.199> a

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
player but he's definitely slumping a

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:35.390 
player but he's definitely slumping a
little<00:04:34.470> bit<00:04:34.590> right<00:04:34.740> now<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.100> we're<00:04:35.220> going<00:04:35.310> to

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
little bit right now so we're going to

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.710 
little bit right now so we're going to
move<00:04:35.520> forward<00:04:35.729> with<00:04:35.849> Tarpley<00:04:36.270> for<00:04:36.449> the<00:04:36.509> time

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:09.510 
frequently running the ball and that's

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.810 
frequently running the ball and that's
all<00:07:09.810> devaron<00:07:10.200> golden<00:07:10.560> and<00:07:11.370> then<00:07:11.550> we<00:07:11.640> know

all devaron golden and then we know
