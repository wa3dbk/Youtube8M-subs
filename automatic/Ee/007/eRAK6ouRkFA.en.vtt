these boys hard and keep them honest for
the<00:02:13.430> front<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:14.390> your<00:02:14.750> boat<00:02:14.959> probably<00:02:15.260> being<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
the front and your boat probably being a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.620 
the front and your boat probably being a
21-foot<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.579> a<00:02:16.610> little<00:02:17.000> bit<00:02:17.120> more<00:02:17.239> suited<00:02:17.599> for

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
21-foot is a little bit more suited for

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.600 
21-foot is a little bit more suited for
the<00:02:17.840> wine<00:02:18.049> d<00:02:18.230> types<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.650> rivers<00:02:18.920> that<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.099> 23

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
the wine d types of rivers that the 23

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.490 
the wine d types of rivers that the 23
foot<00:02:19.819> is<00:02:19.970> at<00:02:20.090> handles<00:02:20.540> better<00:02:20.660> probably<00:02:20.989> ya

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
foot is at handles better probably ya

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.440 
foot is at handles better probably ya
know<00:02:21.829> our<00:02:22.099> cornering<00:02:22.519> speeds<00:02:22.790> well<00:02:22.970> up<00:02:23.150> so

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
know our cornering speeds well up so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.270 
know our cornering speeds well up so
it's<00:02:23.989> pretty<00:02:24.260> open<00:02:24.590> out<00:02:24.709> here<00:02:24.739> that's<00:02:25.040> pretty

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
it's pretty open out here that's pretty

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.680 
it's pretty open out here that's pretty
fast<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.730> straight<00:02:25.790> line<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.360> we<00:02:26.420> can<00:02:26.480> open

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
fast in a straight line so we can open

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.390 
fast in a straight line so we can open
it<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.049> and<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.620> get<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.040> thing<00:02:28.220> where

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
it up and so to get get the thing where

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.100 
it up and so to get get the thing where
I'm<00:02:28.489> doubt<00:02:28.700> which<00:02:28.849> is<00:02:29.000> good<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:29.660> what<00:02:29.870> sort<00:02:30.049> of

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
I'm doubt which is good so what sort of

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.720 
I'm doubt which is good so what sort of
speed<00:02:30.379> you're<00:02:30.620> dealing<00:02:30.890> with<00:02:30.920> here<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.430> don't

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
speed you're dealing with here I don't

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.490 
speed you're dealing with here I don't
know<00:02:31.790> we're<00:02:31.970> getting<00:02:32.329> over<00:02:32.810> 200<00:02:33.200> kilometers

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
know we're getting over 200 kilometers

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.259 
know we're getting over 200 kilometers
now<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:33.769> my<00:02:33.890> straight<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.549> yeah<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.060> good<00:02:35.209> to

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
now in my straight so yeah it's good to

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.789 
now in my straight so yeah it's good to
crack<00:02:35.450> it<00:02:35.600> up<00:02:35.690> stiffly<00:02:36.079> not<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.440> Reedy<00:02:36.590> that

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
crack it up stiffly not the Reedy that

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.430 
crack it up stiffly not the Reedy that
we<00:02:36.950> would<00:02:37.489> have<00:02:37.579> expected<00:02:37.850> today<00:02:38.150> but<00:02:38.480> here
