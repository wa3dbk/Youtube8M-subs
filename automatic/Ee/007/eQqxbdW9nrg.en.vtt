fight a lot we sue each other and kill

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.470 
fight a lot we sue each other and kill
each<00:00:15.450> other<00:00:16.460> yeah<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.760> related<00:00:18.270> but

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
each other yeah we're all related but

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.620 
each other yeah we're all related but
its<00:00:18.630> distant<00:00:19.310> very<00:00:20.310> distant<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.510> know

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
its distant very distant if you know

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.080 
its distant very distant if you know
what<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> mean<00:00:21.960> actually<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.310> might<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.970> as

what I mean actually it might not be as

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.790 
what I mean actually it might not be as
distant<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.600> you'd<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.779> it's<00:00:25.500> called<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
concept isn't too hard to grasp going

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.330 
concept isn't too hard to grasp going
backwards<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.469> had<00:00:34.649> two<00:00:34.829> parents<00:00:35.190> your

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
backwards you had two parents your

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.860 
backwards you had two parents your
parents<00:00:35.370> each<00:00:35.850> had<00:00:36.059> two<00:00:36.210> parents<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.719> their

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
parents each had two parents and their

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.720 
parents each had two parents and their
parents<00:00:36.899> each<00:00:37.350> had<00:00:37.530> two<00:00:37.710> parents<00:00:38.129> everybody's

parents each had two parents everybody's

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.340 
parents each had two parents everybody's
got<00:00:38.879> two<00:00:39.030> parents<00:00:39.450> so<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.960> doubles<00:00:40.230> every

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
got two parents so it doubles every

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.049

kind of a broad range but it's still
