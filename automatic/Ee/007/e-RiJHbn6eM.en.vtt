00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.630 
purpose of today is to try and explain
my<00:02:18.940> training<00:02:19.450> techniques<00:02:19.990> this<00:02:20.590> time<00:02:21.220> I

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
my training techniques this time I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.480 
my training techniques this time I
thought<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.600> start<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.680> horse<00:02:24.130> that<00:02:24.340> we

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
thought we start with a horse that we

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.930 
thought we start with a horse that we
haven't<00:02:24.959> produced<00:02:25.959> yet<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.970> he<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:29.640> been<00:02:30.640> a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
haven't produced yet and he is been a

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.960 
haven't produced yet and he is been a
naughty<00:02:31.300> horse<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:32.590> I<00:02:32.620> thought<00:02:33.010> for<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> change

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
naughty horse so I thought for a change

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.790 
naughty horse so I thought for a change
we'd<00:02:34.750> bring<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.990> horse<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.500> had<00:02:35.620> been

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
we'd bring a horse that had been

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.040 
we'd bring a horse that had been
difficult<00:02:36.430> he's<00:02:37.180> five<00:02:37.570> years<00:02:37.600> old<00:02:40.050> they

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
difficult he's five years old they

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.070 
difficult he's five years old they
deposited<00:02:41.709> all<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.880> my<00:02:43.030> staff<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.570> friends<00:02:43.959> on

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
deposited all of my staff and friends on

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
deposited all of my staff and friends on
the<00:02:44.200> floor<00:02:44.410> at<00:02:44.590> some<00:02:44.830> stage<00:02:45.100> in<00:02:45.280> his<00:02:45.400> life<00:02:45.959> and
