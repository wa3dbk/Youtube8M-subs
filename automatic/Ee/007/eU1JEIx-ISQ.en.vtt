Sun's up though just not that early but
I<00:00:33.000> was<00:00:33.720> cruising<00:00:34.230> through<00:00:34.470> YouTube<00:00:34.920> and

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
I was cruising through YouTube and

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.430 
I was cruising through YouTube and
looking<00:00:36.570> at<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:37.610> statistics<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:39.199> analytics<00:00:40.199> I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
looking at my statistics or analytics I

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.110 
looking at my statistics or analytics I
guess<00:00:40.650> is<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:40.830> they<00:00:41.100> call<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.519> on<00:00:41.670> YouTube

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
guess is what they call it on YouTube

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.020 
guess is what they call it on YouTube
and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.539> was<00:00:42.719> pretty<00:00:42.960> funny<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.550> see<00:00:44.550> all<00:00:44.820> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and it was pretty funny to see all the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.540 
and it was pretty funny to see all the
countries<00:00:45.719> where<00:00:46.200> people<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.920> subscribed

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
countries where people have subscribed

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.479 
countries where people have subscribed
to me<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.629> thought<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.289> you<00:00:49.949> know<00:00:49.980> read
