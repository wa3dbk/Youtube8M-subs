00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
not put it in the machine

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.490

probably moisés dense the air is hitting
it<00:00:22.260> will<00:00:22.410> cause<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> machine<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.340> jam<00:00:24.500> when

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it will cause the machine to jam when

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.089 
it will cause the machine to jam when
you're<00:00:25.619> ready<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.010> put<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> paper<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:28.099> take

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the paper out get it straight a little

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.670 
the paper out get it straight a little
bit<00:00:33.829> do<00:00:34.829> an<00:00:34.950> S<00:00:35.219> one<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.329> that<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:37.500> way

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
bit do an S one way that way one way

bit do an S one way that way one way
that<00:00:37.890> way<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.140> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:41.660> straight<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.809> up

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.170 

see<00:00:47.329> this<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.770> not<00:00:49.770> good<00:00:50.039> because<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.969> will

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
see this is not good because this will

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.619 
see this is not good because this will
cause<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.570> machine<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> Jam<00:00:53.420> probably<00:00:54.420> can't

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
cause the machine to Jam probably can't

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
cause the machine to Jam probably can't
see<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:57.829> when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> hold<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.550> paper<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:01.550> you

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
see it when you hold the paper in you

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.929 
see it when you hold the paper in you
can<00:01:02.910> load<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.199> tray<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.739> which<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
can load it into the tray one which is

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.840 
can load it into the tray one which is
the<00:01:06.119> biggest<00:01:06.330> trick<00:01:07.070> but<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.670> make

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the biggest trick but you have to make

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.570 
the biggest trick but you have to make
sure<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.600> only<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.470> paper<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
sure that you only put the paper on the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.530 
sure that you only put the paper on the
left-hand<00:01:12.210> side

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
left-hand side

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.850 
left-hand side
the<00:01:13.260> machine<00:01:13.650> will<00:01:14.090> put<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> paper<00:01:15.710> where<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the machine will put the paper where it

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.039 
the machine will put the paper where it
needs<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.220> automatically<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.750> will<00:01:18.780> left

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
needs to go automatically it will left

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.710 
needs to go automatically it will left
the<00:01:19.229> paper<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.710> from<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> left-hand<00:01:21.150> side<00:01:21.270> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
the paper up from the left-hand side and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.240 
the paper up from the left-hand side and
place<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> right-hand<00:01:22.590> side<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.009> don't

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
place it on the right-hand side so don't

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.670 
place it on the right-hand side so don't
put<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.820> in<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> right-hand<00:01:24.360> side<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:24.930> make

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
put it in the right-hand side just make

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.649 
put it in the right-hand side just make
sure<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.130> put<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.700> nice<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.000> easy

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659

00:01:29.659 --> 00:02:04.340 
sure you put it in there nice and easy
make<00:01:30.659> sure<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:30.960> all<00:01:31.110> strength

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.749 

push<00:02:05.350> it<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.650> it's<00:02:05.950> going<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.250> lift<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.580> paper

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
push it in it's going to lift the paper

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.029 
push it in it's going to lift the paper
up<00:02:07.000> from<00:02:07.240> the<00:02:07.330> left-hand<00:02:07.780> side<00:02:08.039> automatically

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
up from the left-hand side automatically

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.460 
up from the left-hand side automatically
move<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:09.789> right<00:02:09.970> hand<00:02:10.240> side<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:11.230> you

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
move it to the right hand side and you

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.740 
move it to the right hand side and you
won't<00:02:12.069> really<00:02:12.310> have<00:02:12.459> any<00:02:12.790> problems<00:02:13.270> with<00:02:13.510> gin

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
won't really have any problems with gin

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.350 
won't really have any problems with gin
and<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:15.220> screen<00:02:15.520> will<00:02:15.700> actually<00:02:16.090> tell<00:02:16.330> you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
and the screen will actually tell you

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.270 
and the screen will actually tell you
when<00:02:16.569> it's<00:02:16.720> ready<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.260> when<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.560> open<00:02:17.950> this<00:02:18.069> back

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
when it's ready so when I open this back

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
when it's ready so when I open this back
up<00:02:18.310> again

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
up again

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.170 
up again
you<00:02:20.560> see<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.950> it's<00:02:21.100> left<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.760> paper<00:02:21.970> up

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
you see that it's left all the paper up

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:33.830 
you see that it's left all the paper up
from<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.450> side<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.930> put<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.290> side

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.229 

so<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.739> of<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> things<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.370> keep<00:02:36.519> in<00:02:36.730> mind<00:02:36.760> is

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
so one of the things to keep in mind is

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.420 
so one of the things to keep in mind is
the<00:02:38.050> paper<00:02:38.320> there's<00:02:38.769> this<00:02:39.370> little<00:02:39.610> flap<00:02:40.000> here

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
certificate paper into the machine

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.270 
certificate paper into the machine
it<00:02:52.300> will<00:02:52.450> cause<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.870> machine<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.230> Jam<00:02:53.650> almost

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
it will cause the machine to Jam almost

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:01.110 
it will cause the machine to Jam almost
every<00:02:54.580> time<00:02:57.300> these<00:02:58.300> trades<00:02:58.810> down<00:02:59.110> here<00:03:00.120> don't
