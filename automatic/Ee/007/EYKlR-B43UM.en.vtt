00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.030 
statewide you have to be a center-right
candidate<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:49.140> that<00:01:49.350> means<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.799> we<00:01:50.009> have

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
candidate and so that means that we have

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.660 
candidate and so that means that we have
a<00:01:50.490> bill<00:01:51.149> white<00:01:51.560> versus<00:01:52.560> Rick<00:01:52.799> Perry<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
a bill white versus Rick Perry and you

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.249 
a bill white versus Rick Perry and you

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
would say that bill watch could prevail

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.440 
would say that bill watch could prevail
bill<00:01:56.130> white<00:01:56.340> can<00:01:56.610> beat<00:01:56.820> Rick<00:01:57.030> Perry<00:01:57.329> in

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
bill white can beat Rick Perry in

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.870 
bill white can beat Rick Perry in
