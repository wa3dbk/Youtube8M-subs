00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
sound studio we're recording our new

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.980 
sound studio we're recording our new
record<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.460> are<00:00:08.490> here<00:00:08.880> playing<00:00:09.389> with<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
record we are here playing with the

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.460 
record we are here playing with the
roland<00:00:10.920> TM<00:00:11.219> 2<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:12.420> rolling<00:00:12.719> triggers

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.050 

from<00:00:16.470> early<00:00:16.800> on<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.279> interested<00:00:17.940> in

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
from early on I was really interested in

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.929 
from early on I was really interested in
electronics<00:00:19.070> incorporating<00:00:20.070> electronics

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
electronics incorporating electronics

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.660 
electronics incorporating electronics
within<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.420> kit<00:00:21.689> and<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.500> remember<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.460> word

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
within the kit and I remember the word

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.929 
within the kit and I remember the word
trigger<00:00:24.500> sample<00:00:25.500> was<00:00:25.800> such<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> bad<00:00:26.580> word

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
trigger sample was such a bad word

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.890 
trigger sample was such a bad word
amongst<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> drumming<00:00:28.410> community<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.250> I

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
amongst the drumming community and I

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.490 
amongst the drumming community and I
never<00:00:30.900> understood<00:00:31.260> why<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.830> know<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.850> then

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
never understood why you know and then

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.520 
never understood why you know and then
years<00:00:34.500> ago<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.190> just<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.120> had<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
years ago I just have had it with this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.360 
years ago I just have had it with this
long<00:00:37.980> sound<00:00:38.460> checks<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:40.170> every<00:00:40.680> day<00:00:40.710> it

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
long sound checks and well every day it

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
long sound checks and well every day it
would<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.969> struggle<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.719> get<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> proper

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
would be a struggle to get the proper

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.889 
would be a struggle to get the proper
sound<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.010> needed<00:00:44.250> in<00:00:44.789> my<00:00:44.850> monitor<00:00:45.510> you

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
sound that I needed in my monitor you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.260 
sound that I needed in my monitor you
know<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.379> was<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.620> terrible<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.730> spend<00:00:48.059> like

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
know it was just terrible we spend like

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
know it was just terrible we spend like
hours<00:00:48.710> upon<00:00:49.710> hours<00:00:49.920> trying<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.879> right

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
hours upon hours trying to get the right

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.959 
hours upon hours trying to get the right
frequency<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.770> next<00:00:53.129> show<00:00:53.340> on<00:00:53.789> his

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
frequency and the next show on his

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
frequency and the next show on his
console<00:00:54.449> things<00:00:54.870> would<00:00:55.050> change<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.590> EQ<00:00:55.890> would

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
console things would change the EQ would

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.490 
console things would change the EQ would
change<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.550> room<00:00:56.789> would<00:00:56.940> change<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.230> just

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
change the room would change it was just

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.610 
change the room would change it was just
such<00:00:58.770> a<00:00:58.800> fight<00:00:59.420> and<00:01:00.420> that's<00:01:01.079> when<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.350> said<00:01:01.410> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
such a fight and that's when I said you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.189 
such a fight and that's when I said you
know<00:01:01.710> what<00:01:01.859> I'm<00:01:02.340> gonna<00:01:02.579> go<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.120> try<00:01:03.449> triggers

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
know what I'm gonna go and try triggers

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.550 
know what I'm gonna go and try triggers
and<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.830> I'm<00:01:05.489> gonna<00:01:05.700> make<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.180> work

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.320 

one<00:01:12.560> of<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.740> greatest<00:01:12.950> things<00:01:13.280> about<00:01:13.430> this<00:01:13.970> is

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
one of the greatest things about this is

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.820 
one of the greatest things about this is
the<00:01:15.080> size<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.530> it

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
the size of it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.860 
the size of it
I<00:01:15.860> mean<00:01:16.220> what's<00:01:16.460> inside<00:01:16.880> of<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.510> also

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
I mean what's inside of it is also

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.630 
I mean what's inside of it is also
really<00:01:18.170> special<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.100> fact<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.460> you

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
really special and the fact that you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.850 
really special and the fact that you
could<00:01:19.820> take<00:01:19.970> your<00:01:20.120> own<00:01:20.180> drum<00:01:20.630> sounds<00:01:21.170> put<00:01:21.740> it

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
could take your own drum sounds put it

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.280 
could take your own drum sounds put it
on<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> card<00:01:22.250> and<00:01:22.910> incorporate<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.540> into<00:01:23.810> this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
on a card and incorporate it into this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.570 
on a card and incorporate it into this
little<00:01:24.530> box<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.610> I<00:01:26.410> know<00:01:27.410> other<00:01:27.800> drummers<00:01:28.160> and

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
little box and I know other drummers and

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.360 
little box and I know other drummers and
other<00:01:28.760> bands<00:01:29.060> will<00:01:29.360> love<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.320> fact<00:01:30.530> that<00:01:30.680> this

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
other bands will love the fact that this

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.370 
other bands will love the fact that this
can<00:01:31.610> go<00:01:31.730> anywhere<00:01:31.760> so<00:01:32.570> if<00:01:32.660> you're<00:01:32.780> doing<00:01:33.020> fly

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
can go anywhere so if you're doing fly

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.220 
can go anywhere so if you're doing fly
dates<00:01:33.710> and<00:01:34.100> you<00:01:34.910> know<00:01:35.270> all<00:01:35.510> your<00:01:35.540> equipment

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
dates and you know all your equipment

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.340 
dates and you know all your equipment
can't<00:01:36.440> get<00:01:36.650> to<00:01:36.800> that<00:01:36.940> to<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.000> specific<00:01:38.660> city

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
can't get to that to that specific city

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.560 
can't get to that to that specific city
state<00:01:39.770> country<00:01:39.800> or<00:01:40.340> whatever<00:01:40.460> this<00:01:41.390> little

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
state country or whatever this little

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.950 
state country or whatever this little
thing<00:01:41.710> goes<00:01:42.710> with<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.160> wherever<00:01:43.340> and<00:01:43.790> I<00:01:44.540> think

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
thing goes with you wherever and I think

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.810 
thing goes with you wherever and I think
that's<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:45.650> of<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:45.800> best<00:01:46.040> parts<00:01:46.400> about<00:01:46.490> it

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
that's one of the best parts about it

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.990 
that's one of the best parts about it
it's<00:01:46.940> so<00:01:47.120> small<00:01:47.480> but<00:01:48.410> it<00:01:48.500> does<00:01:48.680> so<00:01:48.860> much<00:01:49.040> what

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
it's so small but it does so much what

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.060 
it's so small but it does so much what
the<00:01:50.090> rolling<00:01:50.390> triggers<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> find<00:01:51.380> that<00:01:51.650> there

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
the rolling triggers I find that there

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.130 
the rolling triggers I find that there
is<00:01:52.100> no<00:01:52.190> sweet<00:01:52.850> spot<00:01:53.210> that<00:01:53.510> you<00:01:53.600> have<00:01:53.720> to<00:01:53.840> put<00:01:54.020> it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
is no sweet spot that you have to put it

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.810 
is no sweet spot that you have to put it
in<00:01:54.260> you<00:01:54.410> could<00:01:54.530> put<00:01:54.710> it<00:01:54.830> anywhere<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.610> it

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
in you could put it anywhere and it

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:12.990 
in you could put it anywhere and it
responds<00:01:56.450> very<00:01:56.510> well

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.459 

my<00:02:14.000> previous<00:02:14.239> role<00:02:14.629> in<00:02:14.750> trigger<00:02:14.989> which<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.439> a

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:15.469 
my previous role in trigger which is a

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.490 
my previous role in trigger which is a
great<00:02:15.980> trigger<00:02:16.219> but<00:02:16.849> these<00:02:17.060> are<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.299> arty<00:02:17.959> 30s

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
great trigger but these are the arty 30s

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.910 
great trigger but these are the arty 30s
and<00:02:18.709> there's<00:02:19.700> been<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:21.049> improvements<00:02:21.620> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
and there's been some improvements to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.190 
and there's been some improvements to
these<00:02:22.280> triggers<00:02:22.700> different<00:02:23.299> sensor<00:02:23.900> better

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
these triggers different sensor better

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.309 
these triggers different sensor better
sensor<00:02:24.709> it<00:02:24.920> mounts<00:02:25.730> a<00:02:25.909> lot<00:02:26.209> easier<00:02:26.659> than<00:02:26.840> than

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
sensor it mounts a lot easier than than

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.740 
sensor it mounts a lot easier than than
the<00:02:27.530> previous<00:02:27.950> trigger<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.549> they<00:02:29.209> move<00:02:29.510> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
the previous trigger and they move the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.050 
the previous trigger and they move the
input<00:02:30.200> jack<00:02:30.230> from<00:02:30.709> the<00:02:30.799> side<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.370> top<00:02:31.579> it's

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
input jack from the side to the top it's

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.059 
input jack from the side to the top it's
so<00:02:32.389> easy<00:02:32.659> to<00:02:32.810> mount<00:02:33.109> these<00:02:33.349> you<00:02:33.859> just

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
so easy to mount these you just

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.360 
so easy to mount these you just
basically<00:02:34.489> put<00:02:35.030> it<00:02:35.719> on<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.139> rim<00:02:36.349> just<00:02:36.950> tighten

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
basically put it on the rim just tighten

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.580 
basically put it on the rim just tighten
a<00:02:37.579> little<00:02:37.700> bit<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.480> know<00:02:38.599> not<00:02:38.930> too<00:02:39.109> tight<00:02:39.349> and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
a little bit you know not too tight and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.649 
a little bit you know not too tight and
then<00:02:39.980> that's<00:02:40.219> it<00:02:40.430> it's<00:02:40.790> all<00:02:40.969> set<00:02:41.269> you're<00:02:41.480> good
