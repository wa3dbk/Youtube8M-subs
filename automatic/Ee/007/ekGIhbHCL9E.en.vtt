you can carry it around a belt vertical

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.899 
you can carry it around a belt vertical
horizontal<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.770> think<00:01:23.009> that's<00:01:23.159> quite<00:01:23.400> neat

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
horizontal I think that's quite neat

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
horizontal I think that's quite neat
they<00:01:24.240> say<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.570> mildew<00:01:24.990> resistant<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:26.159> would

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
they say it's mildew resistant it would

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.840 
they say it's mildew resistant it would
have<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.770> but<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:28.979> we<00:01:29.070> go<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.670> that's

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
have to be and but there we go so that's

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.120 
have to be and but there we go so that's
that's<00:01:30.060> that's<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.630> sheath<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.079> quite<00:01:31.920> quite

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that's that's the sheath and quite quite

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's that's the sheath and quite quite
decent<00:01:32.490> sheet<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.509> get<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.720> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
decent sheet that you and get with a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.109 
decent sheet that you and get with a
knife<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> move<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> knife<00:01:37.110> itself

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
knife and move on to the knife itself

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.140 
knife and move on to the knife itself
the<00:01:39.119> knife<00:01:39.540> has<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> half<00:01:40.920> serrated<00:01:41.909> high

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
the knife has a half serrated high

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.590 
the knife has a half serrated high
carbon<00:01:42.659> stainless<00:01:42.869> steel<00:01:43.320> drop<00:01:44.100> point<00:01:44.399> blade

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
carbon stainless steel drop point blade

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.870 
carbon stainless steel drop point blade
so<00:01:45.600> they're<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> half<00:01:46.680> serrations<00:01:47.280> very

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
so they're the half serrations very

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.569 
so they're the half serrations very
similar<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> other<00:01:48.570> serrations<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.500> on<00:01:50.130> other

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
similar to other serrations on on other

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.600 
similar to other serrations on on other
gerber<00:01:50.970> knives<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:54.560> knife<00:01:55.560> is<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> lock

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
gerber knives and the knife is a lock

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.289 
gerber knives and the knife is a lock
back<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:58.409> way<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.740> works<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.460> obviously

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
back so the way it works is obviously

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.100 
back so the way it works is obviously
there's<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.200> spring<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:03.000> fits<00:02:03.570> into

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
there's a spring there and it fits into

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
there's a spring there and it fits into
the<00:02:04.320> groove<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.799> into<00:02:05.189> place<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.270> locks

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the groove and into place and it locks

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.880 
the groove and into place and it locks
that<00:02:07.020> blade<00:02:07.590> from<00:02:07.890> moving<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:09.440> durable<00:02:10.440> type

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
that blade from moving very durable type

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.309 
that blade from moving very durable type
of<00:02:11.160> locking<00:02:11.730> mechanism<00:02:12.180> for<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> knife

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
of locking mechanism for a knife

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.860 
of locking mechanism for a knife
you<00:02:13.829> push<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.790> raises<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.299> bar<00:02:15.329> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
you push it and that raises the bar and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.039 
you push it and that raises the bar and
of<00:02:16.170> course<00:02:16.439> you<00:02:17.159> can<00:02:17.310> then<00:02:17.489> close<00:02:18.269> close<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
of course you can then close close the

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.929 
of course you can then close close the
blade<00:02:19.859> into<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.189> handles<00:02:21.120> okay<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
blade into the handles okay the

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:26.770 
blade into the handles okay the
deployment<00:02:23.939> is<00:02:24.109> dual<00:02:25.109> stud<00:02:25.549> ambidextrous

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
deployment is dual stud ambidextrous

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.410 
deployment is dual stud ambidextrous

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:42.749 
fine I'm gonna mix wise their grip looks

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.119 
fine I'm gonna mix wise their grip looks
quite<00:02:42.930> comfortable<00:02:43.409> actually<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.950> doesn't

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:44.129 
quite comfortable actually it doesn't

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.170 
quite comfortable actually it doesn't
doesn't<00:02:44.879> feel<00:02:45.120> cheap<00:02:45.150> or<00:02:45.719> anything<00:02:45.930> it's

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
doesn't feel cheap or anything it's

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.149 
doesn't feel cheap or anything it's
feels<00:02:48.180> quite<00:02:48.359> solid<00:02:48.739> these<00:02:49.739> are<00:02:49.950> rubber

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
feels quite solid these are rubber

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.550 
feels quite solid these are rubber
handles<00:02:50.669> I'd<00:02:51.299> say<00:02:51.659> if<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.989> got<00:02:52.109> this<00:02:52.260> way

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
handles I'd say if you got this way

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.189 
handles I'd say if you got this way
you'd<00:02:53.219> still<00:02:53.519> get<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.790> fair<00:02:54.060> bit<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.299> grip<00:02:54.659> and<00:02:54.870> I

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:55.199 
you'd still get a fair bit of grip and I

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.379 
you'd still get a fair bit of grip and I
think<00:02:55.530> that's<00:02:55.680> an<00:02:55.799> important<00:02:56.219> note<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.849> make

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
think that's an important note to make

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.390 
think that's an important note to make
and<00:02:58.189> the<00:03:00.019> the<00:03:01.019> priorities<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> survival<00:03:02.189> guard

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
and the the priorities of survival guard

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.189 
and the the priorities of survival guard
that<00:03:02.489> you<00:03:02.549> get<00:03:02.760> with<00:03:02.909> it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.180> it's<00:03:03.449> very<00:03:03.510> useful

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:04.199 
that you get with it is it's very useful

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:06.399 
that you get with it is it's very useful
and<00:03:04.379> I<00:03:04.829> know<00:03:04.980> I<00:03:05.010> made<00:03:05.219> a<00:03:05.250> joke<00:03:05.459> about<00:03:05.519> using<00:03:05.969> as

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
and I know I made a joke about using as

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:09.379 
and I know I made a joke about using as
you<00:03:07.409> know<00:03:07.500> start<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.069> fire<00:03:08.280> but<00:03:08.549> it's<00:03:09.030> got<00:03:09.209> many

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
you know start a fire but it's got many

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.409 
you know start a fire but it's got many
things<00:03:09.480> there<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.230> and<00:03:10.439> you<00:03:11.159> could<00:03:11.310> use<00:03:11.639> in

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:12.419 
things there that and you could use in

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:14.809 
things there that and you could use in
an<00:03:12.599> emergency<00:03:12.689> situation<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.949> they<00:03:14.669> could

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
an emergency situation and they could

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.050 
an emergency situation and they could
well<00:03:15.000> save<00:03:15.269> save<00:03:15.719> your<00:03:15.870> life<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.469> it's<00:03:16.650> worth

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
well save save your life so it's worth

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.229 
well save save your life so it's worth
reading<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.389> at<00:03:18.599> some<00:03:18.810> point<00:03:20.120> there's<00:03:21.120> no

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
reading that at some point there's no

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.780 
reading that at some point there's no
liners<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.079> knife<00:03:22.500> doesn't<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.669> be

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
liners in this knife doesn't have to be

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.520 
liners in this knife doesn't have to be
that's<00:03:23.970> not<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.209> walker<00:03:24.449> liner<00:03:25.169> lock<00:03:25.349> or

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
that's not a walker liner lock or

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.699 
that's not a walker liner lock or
anything<00:03:25.889> so<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:27.109> helps<00:03:28.109> with<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.500> with

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
anything so that helps with that with

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.649 
anything so that helps with that with
the<00:03:28.889> reduction<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.729> the<00:03:29.939> overall<00:03:30.419> weight<00:03:30.629> of

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
the reduction of the overall weight of

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.210 
the reduction of the overall weight of
this<00:03:30.989> knife<00:03:31.229> and<00:03:32.180> this<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.659> a<00:03:33.780> locking

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
this knife and this it is a locking

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.879 
this knife and this it is a locking
locking<00:03:35.220> blade<00:03:35.699> so<00:03:36.629> it<00:03:36.989> would<00:03:37.169> be<00:03:37.319> illegal<00:03:37.590> to

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
locking blade so it would be illegal to

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.580 
locking blade so it would be illegal to
carry<00:03:38.040> here<00:03:38.759> in<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:38.970> UK<00:03:39.299> I<00:03:39.569> think<00:03:40.139> it<00:03:40.229> is<00:03:40.349> made

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
carry here in the UK I think it is made

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.110 
carry here in the UK I think it is made
in<00:03:40.739> China<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.430> think<00:03:41.699> that's<00:03:41.849> what<00:03:42.000> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
in China I think that's what the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.170 
in China I think that's what the
packaging<00:03:42.569> said<00:03:42.989> I<00:03:43.259> know<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:43.889> the<00:03:44.220> bear

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
packaging said I know that the bear

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.960 
packaging said I know that the bear
grylls<00:03:45.419> parang<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:46.079> made<00:03:46.259> in<00:03:46.439> China<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.009> so<00:03:47.939> I

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
grylls parang is made in China and so I

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.360 
grylls parang is made in China and so I
wouldn't<00:03:48.509> hesitate<00:03:49.290> to<00:03:49.709> say<00:03:49.799> this<00:03:49.829> one<00:03:50.159> might

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
wouldn't hesitate to say this one might

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.999 
wouldn't hesitate to say this one might
be<00:03:50.519> as<00:03:50.609> well<00:03:50.639> and<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:52.079> price<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.590> one<00:03:52.739> of<00:03:52.769> these

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
be as well and the price of one of these

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:55.550 
be as well and the price of one of these
knives<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.699> about<00:03:53.970> forty<00:03:54.599> pounds<00:03:55.139> I<00:03:55.319> think

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
knives is about forty pounds I think

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.580 
knives is about forty pounds I think
that's<00:03:55.739> quite<00:03:56.519> justified<00:03:57.150> for<00:03:57.449> the<00:03:57.590> justjust

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
that's quite justified for the justjust

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.409 
that's quite justified for the justjust
a<00:03:58.739> range<00:03:59.009> of<00:03:59.250> material<00:03:59.729> so<00:03:59.849> you<00:03:59.939> get<00:04:00.120> with<00:04:00.239> this

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
a range of material so you get with this

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.649 
a range of material so you get with this
and<00:04:00.689> a<00:04:01.530> pretty<00:04:01.889> decent<00:04:02.310> sheath<00:04:02.609> it<00:04:03.239> hasn't<00:04:03.540> got

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
and a pretty decent sheath it hasn't got

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.209 
and a pretty decent sheath it hasn't got
a<00:04:03.689> pocket<00:04:04.019> clip<00:04:04.229> but<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> does<00:04:04.829> have<00:04:04.949> a<00:04:05.040> lanyard

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
a pocket clip but it does have a lanyard

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:08.089 
a pocket clip but it does have a lanyard
hole<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.870> I<00:04:06.870> think<00:04:07.109> it's<00:04:07.229> designed<00:04:07.590> mainly<00:04:07.859> to

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
hole and I think it's designed mainly to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.860 
hole and I think it's designed mainly to
put<00:04:08.400> in<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.609> sheath<00:04:08.879> around<00:04:09.090> your<00:04:09.389> belt<00:04:09.569> or

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
put in that sheath around your belt or

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.349 
put in that sheath around your belt or
something<00:04:10.049> like<00:04:10.289> that<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.879> it's<00:04:11.879> just<00:04:11.969> there

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
something like that and it's just there

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.860 
something like that and it's just there
and<00:04:12.599> it's<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.259> quite<00:04:13.439> a<00:04:13.530> quite<00:04:14.219> a<00:04:14.250> decent

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and it's it's quite a quite a decent

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.800 
and it's it's quite a quite a decent
knife<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.199> use<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.680> in<00:04:17.209> any<00:04:18.209> situation<00:04:18.780> that

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
knife to use in in any situation that

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.289 
knife to use in in any situation that
would<00:04:18.959> arise<00:04:19.229> and<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:20.519> think<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:20.820> is<00:04:20.909> decent

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
would arise and I think it is decent

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.120 
would arise and I think it is decent
decent<00:04:21.840> value<00:04:22.199> and<00:04:23.419> everyday<00:04:24.419> carry<00:04:24.690> now<00:04:25.130> it's

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
decent value and everyday carry now it's

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
decent value and everyday carry now it's
it's<00:04:26.490> light<00:04:26.669> but

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it's light but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.719 
it's light but
and<00:04:27.290> I<00:04:28.290> don't<00:04:28.770> know<00:04:28.919> you<00:04:28.979> could<00:04:29.220> use<00:04:29.400> it<00:04:29.550> every

of bushcraft knife this is kind of a
backup<00:04:54.030> thing<00:04:54.180> listen<00:04:54.509> I<00:04:54.660> don't<00:04:54.720> think<00:04:54.870> this

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
backup thing listen I don't think this

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.830 
backup thing listen I don't think this
would<00:04:55.259> be<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.410> you<00:04:55.919> mean<00:04:56.130> you<00:04:57.060> may<00:04:57.240> know<00:04:57.449> just

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
would be a you mean you may know just

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.189 
would be a you mean you may know just
because<00:04:58.080> you'd<00:04:58.530> want<00:04:58.740> a<00:04:58.770> baton<00:04:59.070> with<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.430> and

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
because you'd want a baton with it and

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.689 
because you'd want a baton with it and
it<00:05:01.199> wouldn't<00:05:01.410> really<00:05:01.800> work<00:05:02.070> as<00:05:02.250> well<00:05:02.430> with<00:05:02.639> a

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
it wouldn't really work as well with a

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:05.300 
it wouldn't really work as well with a
with<00:05:03.180> a<00:05:03.210> folding<00:05:03.690> knife<00:05:04.260> obviously<00:05:04.740> that's<00:05:05.160> up

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
with a folding knife obviously that's up

with a folding knife obviously that's up
for<00:05:05.460> debate<00:05:05.520> and<00:05:06.360> we'll<00:05:06.630> do<00:05:06.840> a<00:05:06.870> few

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
for debate and we'll do a few

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.700 
for debate and we'll do a few
comparisons<00:05:07.880> this<00:05:08.880> is<00:05:09.060> it<00:05:09.570> next<00:05:09.750> to<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> bear

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:10.710 
comparisons this is it next to the bear

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
locking one lock back and as you can see

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.270 
locking one lock back and as you can see
the<00:05:16.620> little<00:05:16.740> logo<00:05:16.919> as<00:05:17.990> peeled<00:05:18.990> off<00:05:19.199> but<00:05:19.680> the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
the little logo as peeled off but the

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.820 
the little logo as peeled off but the
knife<00:05:20.699> is<00:05:20.880> in<00:05:20.910> working<00:05:21.330> order<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.750> that's<00:05:22.710> the

knife is in working order and that's the

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.909 
knife is in working order and that's the
size<00:05:23.010> comparison<00:05:23.400> with<00:05:23.699> that<00:05:24.650> we'll<00:05:25.650> put<00:05:25.830> it

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
size comparison with that we'll put it

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.930 
size comparison with that we'll put it
next<00:05:26.039> to<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.310> bear<00:05:27.240> grylls<00:05:27.539> I<00:05:27.960> will<00:05:28.470> see

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
next to the bear grylls I will see

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.300 
next to the bear grylls I will see
sharpened<00:05:29.940> and<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:31.050> ultimate<00:05:31.830> survival

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
sharpened and the ultimate survival

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.140 
sharpened and the ultimate survival
knife<00:05:32.490> it's<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.510> it's<00:05:34.260> smaller<00:05:34.699> but<00:05:35.699> only<00:05:36.030> a

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
knife it's a it's smaller but only a

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.469 
knife it's a it's smaller but only a
little<00:05:36.360> bit<00:05:36.630> I<00:05:36.870> mean<00:05:37.199> I<00:05:37.699> mean<00:05:38.699> an<00:05:38.820> inch<00:05:39.210> or<00:05:39.449> so

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
little bit I mean I mean an inch or so

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:41.930 
little bit I mean I mean an inch or so
smaller<00:05:40.020> and<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:41.099> that's<00:05:41.280> that's<00:05:41.520> your<00:05:41.760> size

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
smaller and so that's that's your size

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.719 
smaller and so that's that's your size
comparisons<00:05:43.190> with<00:05:44.190> them<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.760> if<00:05:45.539> you<00:05:46.729> that

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
comparisons with them and if you that

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.320 
comparisons with them and if you that
the<00:05:47.880> handles<00:05:48.389> are<00:05:48.810> very<00:05:49.110> similar<00:05:49.409> and<00:05:49.830> both<00:05:50.729> of

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
the handles are very similar and both of

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.529 
the handles are very similar and both of
these<00:05:51.570> knives<00:05:51.930> just<00:05:52.760> a<00:05:53.760> blade<00:05:53.970> shapes<00:05:54.270> quite

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
these knives just a blade shapes quite

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.420 
these knives just a blade shapes quite
similar<00:05:54.900> as<00:05:55.020> well<00:05:55.199> I<00:05:55.470> mean<00:05:56.010> if<00:05:56.130> you<00:05:56.220> haven't

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
similar as well I mean if you haven't

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.600 
similar as well I mean if you haven't
got<00:05:58.190> these<00:05:59.190> knives<00:05:59.639> and<00:06:00.650> you've<00:06:01.650> got<00:06:01.830> like<00:06:02.039> I

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
got these knives and you've got like I

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.930 
got these knives and you've got like I
don't<00:06:02.940> know<00:06:03.150> the<00:06:03.479> spyderco<00:06:03.990> or<00:06:04.139> something<00:06:04.440> and

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
don't know the spyderco or something and

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.719 
don't know the spyderco or something and
it's<00:06:05.940> to<00:06:06.030> sit<00:06:06.210> next<00:06:06.360> to<00:06:06.539> a<00:06:06.599> tenacious

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
it's to sit next to a tenacious

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.219 
it's to sit next to a tenacious
obviously<00:06:08.729> two<00:06:08.909> very<00:06:09.150> different<00:06:09.330> types<00:06:10.050> of

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
obviously two very different types of

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.779 
obviously two very different types of
knives<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.650> what<00:06:10.800> you'd<00:06:10.919> use<00:06:10.949> them<00:06:11.310> for<00:06:11.520> but

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
knives and what you'd use them for but

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.670 
knives and what you'd use them for but
this<00:06:12.090> is<00:06:12.630> just<00:06:12.930> purely<00:06:13.199> for<00:06:13.470> a<00:06:13.500> size

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
this is just purely for a size

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.500 
this is just purely for a size
comparison<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.580> there's<00:06:14.760> a<00:06:14.820> Spyderco<00:06:15.330> you

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.510 
comparison and there's a Spyderco you

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.210 
comparison and there's a Spyderco you
kpek<00:06:15.979> okay<00:06:16.979> so<00:06:17.039> as<00:06:17.610> you<00:06:17.669> can<00:06:17.849> see<00:06:19.010> yes

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
kpek okay so as you can see yes

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.490 
kpek okay so as you can see yes
it's<00:06:20.639> larger<00:06:21.120> but<00:06:21.570> that's<00:06:21.960> because<00:06:22.110> of<00:06:22.349> its

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
it's larger but that's because of its

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.820 
it's larger but that's because of its
its<00:06:22.919> uses<00:06:23.430> pose<00:06:23.669> okay<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:24.810> in<00:06:25.409> case<00:06:25.590> you<00:06:25.740> were

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
its uses pose okay and in case you were

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.140 
its uses pose okay and in case you were
wondering<00:06:26.010> and<00:06:26.720> how<00:06:27.720> it<00:06:27.900> how<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.760> goes<00:06:29.760> next<00:06:30.060> to

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
wondering and how it how it goes next to

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.450 
wondering and how it how it goes next to

would<00:06:38.460> be<00:06:38.639> a<00:06:38.669> kind<00:06:39.330> of<00:06:39.389> a<00:06:39.450> decent<00:06:39.599> backup

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:40.590

neither<00:06:41.360> for<00:06:42.360> a<00:06:42.389> bushcraft<00:06:42.840> knife<00:06:43.020> for

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320
