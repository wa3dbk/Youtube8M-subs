meant you know we had our chances to win
this<00:01:06.240> game<00:01:06.299> tonight<00:01:10.580> Josh<00:01:11.580> would<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> think

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
this game tonight Josh would you think

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.880 
this game tonight Josh would you think
of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> midfield<00:01:13.229> play<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.470> jeaneen<00:01:13.740> yawn

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
of the midfield play up jeaneen yawn

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.749 
of the midfield play up jeaneen yawn
cell<00:01:14.610> service<00:01:15.560> it's<00:01:16.560> good<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.009> mean<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.460> both

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
cell service it's good I mean but both

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
cell service it's good I mean but both
teams<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.210> strong<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:18.869> position<00:01:19.590> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
teams are strong in that position I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.070 
teams are strong in that position I
think<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> game<00:01:20.549> was<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.659> real<00:01:21.900> good

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
think the game was a was a real good

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.999 
think the game was a was a real good
game<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.890> thought<00:01:24.350> for<00:01:25.350> majority<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
game and I thought for majority that

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.819 
game and I thought for majority that
game<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.780> backline<00:01:27.780> did<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> great<00:01:28.290> job<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
game or backline did a great job and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.550 
game or backline did a great job and
then<00:01:28.979> they<00:01:29.159> they<00:01:29.640> were<00:01:29.820> very<00:01:30.090> poor<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
then they they were very poor in in the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
then they they were very poor in in the
last<00:01:31.710> 10<00:01:32.009> minutes<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.060> perhaps<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.350> most

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
last 10 minutes and and perhaps the most

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.469 
last 10 minutes and and perhaps the most
important<00:01:35.009> minutes<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.430> game<00:01:35.479> arguably

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
important minutes of the game arguably

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.679 
important minutes of the game arguably
and<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.610> Monterey<00:01:38.610> was<00:01:38.939> able<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.360> exploit

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
and I and Monterey was able to exploit

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.469 
and I and Monterey was able to exploit
us<00:01:42.500> okay

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.040 

no<00:01:49.590> everybody's<00:01:50.590> tired<00:01:50.920> they<00:01:51.690> travel<00:01:52.690> to<00:01:52.840> why

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
no everybody's tired they travel to why

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.850 
no everybody's tired they travel to why
wouldn't<00:01:53.260> they<00:01:53.409> be<00:01:53.680> tired<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:56.710> right

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
wouldn't they be tired all right

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.590 
wouldn't they be tired all right
everyone's<00:01:57.820> tired<00:01:58.030> at<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.270> end<00:01:58.300> of<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.570> game

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
everyone's tired at the end of the game

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.620 
everyone's tired at the end of the game
it's<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.340> experiencing<00:02:00.340> concentration<00:02:01.150> and<00:02:01.360> I

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
it's a experiencing concentration and I

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.050 
it's a experiencing concentration and I
think<00:02:02.410> some<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.650> our<00:02:02.890> players<00:02:03.160> ran<00:02:03.550> themselves

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
think some of our players ran themselves

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.020 
think some of our players ran themselves
out<00:02:04.210> of<00:02:04.240> their<00:02:04.420> positions<00:02:05.190> over<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.250> last<00:02:06.460> 15

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
out of their positions over the last 15

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.410 
out of their positions over the last 15
minutes<00:02:07.270> if<00:02:07.509> that<00:02:07.690> hurt<00:02:07.869> us<00:02:08.729> Scott<00:02:09.729> Bruce<00:02:10.300> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
minutes if that hurt us Scott Bruce you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.120 
minutes if that hurt us Scott Bruce you
said<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.810> thought<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:11.440> defense<00:02:12.010> was

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
said that you thought the defense was

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.530 
said that you thought the defense was
very<00:02:12.340> poor<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> last<00:02:12.910> ten<00:02:13.150> minutes<00:02:13.239> how

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
very poor in the last ten minutes how

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.820 
very poor in the last ten minutes how
much<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.840> that<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.050> you<00:02:14.110> think<00:02:14.319> was<00:02:14.440> Monterey

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
much of that do you think was Monterey

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.030 
much of that do you think was Monterey
and<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.250> pressure<00:02:15.459> they<00:02:15.640> were<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:16.510> course

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and the pressure they were of course

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.800 
and the pressure they were of course
that<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.610> certainly<00:02:19.060> contributes<00:02:19.660> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
that that that certainly contributes to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.030 
that that that certainly contributes to
it<00:02:20.070> your<00:02:21.070> team<00:02:21.310> with<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.520> lot<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:21.850> quality<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
I thought obviously uh the first goal

the kind of concentration you need the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.490 
the kind of concentration you need the
experience<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.270> tactical<00:02:59.840> understanding

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
experience that tactical understanding

experience that tactical understanding
you<00:03:00.590> know<00:03:00.820> so<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:02.000> if<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:02.210> don't<00:03:02.360> get<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
tonight and position ourselves better to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.880 
tonight and position ourselves better to
go<00:03:20.210> into<00:03:20.360> monterey<00:03:20.810> now<00:03:21.110> going<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.560> monterey

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
go into monterey now going to monterey

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.500 
go into monterey now going to monterey
is<00:03:22.040> obviously<00:03:22.490> going<00:03:22.670> to<00:03:22.730> be<00:03:22.820> very<00:03:23.360> difficult

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
is obviously going to be very difficult

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:38.260 
is obviously going to be very difficult
and<00:03:24.080> that'll<00:03:24.680> be<00:03:24.800> our<00:03:24.920> challenge

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.290 

no<00:03:39.270> not<00:03:40.140> just<00:03:40.350> playing<00:03:40.770> the<00:03:40.890> game<00:03:40.950> at<00:03:41.850> the<00:03:42.090> end

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
no not just playing the game at the end

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.180 
no not just playing the game at the end
AJ<00:03:42.720> needs<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.200> be<00:03:43.790> defending<00:03:44.790> well<00:03:45.000> not<00:03:45.660> attack

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
AJ needs to be defending well not attack

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.310 
AJ needs to be defending well not attack
and<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.700> think<00:03:48.000> maybe<00:03:48.570> showed<00:03:49.050> some

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
and I think maybe showed some

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.520 
and I think maybe showed some
inexperienced<00:03:50.310> in<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.550> position<00:03:50.730> where<00:03:51.300> he

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
inexperienced in that position where he

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.840 
inexperienced in that position where he
he<00:03:52.530> may<00:03:52.710> be<00:03:52.770> raring<00:03:53.070> himself<00:03:53.430> into<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.820> ground

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
he may be raring himself into the ground

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.620 
he may be raring himself into the ground
and<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:56.160> perhaps<00:03:56.610> had<00:03:56.910> hurt<00:03:57.090> us<00:03:57.210> at<00:03:57.330> the<00:03:57.420> end<00:03:57.570> of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
and it perhaps had hurt us at the end of

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.390 
and it perhaps had hurt us at the end of
the<00:03:57.750> game<00:03:57.780> our<00:03:58.140> backline<00:03:58.560> was<00:03:58.800> tired<00:03:59.100> and<00:03:59.280> they

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
the game our backline was tired and they

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.820 
the game our backline was tired and they
they<00:03:59.940> weren't<00:04:00.270> they<00:04:01.140> didn't<00:04:01.380> play<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.680> last

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
they weren't they didn't play the last

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.760 
they weren't they didn't play the last
15-20<00:04:02.490> minutes<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.540> the<00:04:03.600> game<00:04:03.630> in<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.050> smart

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
15-20 minutes of the game in a smart

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.910 
15-20 minutes of the game in a smart
manner<00:04:04.980> they<00:04:05.940> needed<00:04:06.240> to<00:04:06.300> be<00:04:06.420> much<00:04:06.630> more<00:04:06.660> solid

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:23.060 

Greg<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.459> result<00:04:21.680> why<00:04:22.680> wouldn't<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:23.040> be

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
Greg the result why wouldn't I be

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.230 
Greg the result why wouldn't I be
frustrated<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:23.940> don't<00:04:24.870> think<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.140> should<00:04:25.680> be

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
frustrated I don't think I should be

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.710 
frustrated I don't think I should be
jumping<00:04:27.240> for<00:04:27.419> joy<00:04:27.680> that's<00:04:28.680> a<00:04:28.800> game<00:04:28.980> I<00:04:29.010> think

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
jumping for joy that's a game I think

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.090 
jumping for joy that's a game I think
we're<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> little<00:04:30.930> smart<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.530> little<00:04:31.560> bit<00:04:31.919> better

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
we're a little smart a little bit better

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.880 
we're a little smart a little bit better
we<00:04:32.400> win<00:04:32.910> by<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.180> couple<00:04:33.419> goals<00:04:33.750> instead<00:04:34.290> we<00:04:34.680> lose

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
we win by a couple goals instead we lose

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.860 
we win by a couple goals instead we lose
and<00:04:35.600> and<00:04:36.600> again<00:04:38.210> tremendous<00:04:39.210> credit<00:04:39.780> to

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
Monterey showed their experience and
