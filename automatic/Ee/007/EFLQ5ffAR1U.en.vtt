Guinness<00:00:13.830> so<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.730> thought<00:00:14.910> we<00:00:15.299> might<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
Guinness so we thought we might do a

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.120 
Guinness so we thought we might do a
little<00:00:15.809> video<00:00:16.109> clip<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.680> show<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> exactly

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.700 
little video clip and show you exactly
how<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:17.940> done<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> have<00:00:19.020> one<00:00:19.230> settling

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
how it's done and we have one settling

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.679 
how it's done and we have one settling
already<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.730> i<00:00:20.760> will<00:00:20.939> show<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.390> start

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
already but i will show you we start

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.689 
already but i will show you we start
from<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.289> start<00:00:22.529> with<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.010> point<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:25.699> so

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
from the start with the point and so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.000 
from the start with the point and so
basically<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.869> take<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.170> point<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> left

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
basically we take the point in the left

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.759 
basically we take the point in the left

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
that's sitting nicely just suddenly not

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.299 
that's sitting nicely just suddenly not
now<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:50.879> takes<00:00:51.090> two<00:00:51.559> minute<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.860> 3<00:00:53.190> minutes

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

depending<00:00:54.120> ok<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.440> what<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.980> do<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.340> as<00:00:56.579> we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
depending ok so what we can do now as we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.849 
depending ok so what we can do now as we
had<00:00:56.879> one<00:00:57.090> settled<00:00:57.539> all<00:00:57.629> right<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:58.530> will<00:00:58.680> show

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
had one settled all right we will show

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.410 
had one settled all right we will show
you<00:00:58.920> how<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> shamrock<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.059> top<00:01:00.300> of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you how to put the shamrock on top of

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
you how to put the shamrock on top of
the<00:01:00.480> beer<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.350> we<00:01:01.680> might<00:01:01.829> bring<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> camera<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
the beer so we might bring the camera a

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.579 
the beer so we might bring the camera a
little<00:01:02.520> bit<00:01:02.879> closer<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:04.080> feel

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
little bit closer so you can see it feel

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
little bit closer so you can see it feel
a<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.799> difficult<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.250> catch<00:01:05.460> what<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> do<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
a bit difficult to catch what we do is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.780 
a bit difficult to catch what we do is
we<00:01:06.330> pop<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.990> top<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.799> little<00:01:07.860> bit<00:01:08.310> forward<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
we pop the top a little bit forward and

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.330 
we pop the top a little bit forward and
that<00:01:08.880> gives<00:01:09.060> us<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.360> hour<00:01:09.600> tap<00:01:10.350> our<00:01:10.619> flow<00:01:11.159> of

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
that gives us an hour tap our flow of

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.030 
that gives us an hour tap our flow of
the<00:01:11.400> beer<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> will<00:01:12.119> cut<00:01:12.390> into<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> head

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
the beer and that will cut into the head

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.160 
the beer and that will cut into the head
so<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:15.090> figure<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.990> eight

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
so then we do a little figure of eight

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.620 
so then we do a little figure of eight
and<00:01:16.460> back<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.930> over<00:01:18.950> and<00:01:19.950> through<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:21.150> we

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and back and over and through and we

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.230 
and back and over and through and we
just<00:01:21.840> push<00:01:22.049> forward<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.530> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.770> harder

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
just push forward a little bit harder

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.490 
just push forward a little bit harder
and<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.420> we've<00:01:24.600> got<00:01:25.580> is<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.640> pint<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.119> Guinness

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
and what we've got is a pint of Guinness

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.550 
and what we've got is a pint of Guinness
the<00:01:28.500> perfect<00:01:28.979> shamrock<00:01:29.369> on<00:01:29.520> top

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 

so<00:01:38.100> why<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.340> people<00:01:38.759> love<00:01:38.850> gifts<00:01:39.290> why<00:01:40.290> do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so why do people love gifts why do

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.260 
so why do people love gifts why do
