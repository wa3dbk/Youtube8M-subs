and<00:01:15.409> back<00:01:16.409> down

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.390 

you're<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.590> actually<00:01:22.830> going<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.280> need<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
you're not actually going to need this

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.630 
you're not actually going to need this
okay<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.760> both<00:01:26.940> sides<00:01:27.680> so<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.250> side<00:01:29.490> as

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
okay and on both sides so this side as

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.370 
okay and on both sides so this side as
well<00:01:29.850> now<00:01:32.060> on<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.119> side<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.479> has<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:33.960> MA

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
well now on the side that has the MA

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.109 
well now on the side that has the MA
stone<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.220> can<00:01:35.369> actually<00:01:35.550> build<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
stone and you can actually build this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.780 
stone and you can actually build this
machine<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.830> MA<00:01:37.950> stone<00:01:38.190> on<00:01:38.310> both<00:01:38.490> sides

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
machine with the MA stone on both sides

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.359 
machine with the MA stone on both sides
you<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.210> mirror<00:01:39.960> this<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.950> I'm<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.070> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
you can mirror this but I'm just going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.969 
you can mirror this but I'm just going
to<00:01:41.399> do<00:01:41.520> one<00:01:41.670> side<00:01:41.880> for<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.180> tutorial

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
to do one side for this tutorial

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.660 
to do one side for this tutorial
above<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.460> MA<00:01:44.610> stone<00:01:44.940> so<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> not

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
above the MA stone so that it is not

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.389 
above the MA stone so that it is not
underneath<00:01:47.670> directly<00:01:48.479> underneath<00:01:48.720> sky

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
underneath directly underneath sky

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.649 
underneath directly underneath sky
you'll<00:01:50.399> place<00:01:50.880> some<00:01:51.180> more<00:01:51.270> building

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
you'll place some more building

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.930 
you'll place some more building
materials<00:01:52.110> now<00:01:52.320> if<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.979> underground<00:01:53.520> or

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
materials now if this is underground or

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.630 
materials now if this is underground or
inside<00:01:54.649> you<00:01:55.649> don't<00:01:55.830> have<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.039> do<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.369> because

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
inside you don't have to do this because

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.980 
inside you don't have to do this because
it<00:01:56.970> will<00:01:57.090> not<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:58.520> underneath<00:01:59.539> with<00:02:00.539> a<00:02:00.570> direct

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
it will not be underneath with a direct

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.260 
it will not be underneath with a direct
line<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> sight<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> sky<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:03.119> don't

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
line of sight to the sky so you don't

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.830 
line of sight to the sky so you don't
have<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.570> worry<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:05.060> okay<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:06.420> place

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
have to worry about that okay now place

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:16.580 
have to worry about that okay now place
your<00:02:06.869> water<00:02:11.060> in<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:13.350> space<00:02:15.170> between<00:02:16.170> those

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
your water in the space between those

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.420 
your water in the space between those
sides<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:18.260> your<00:02:19.260> lava<00:02:19.530> will<00:02:20.430> go<00:02:20.580> here<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
sides and your lava will go here and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.270 
sides and your lava will go here and
this<00:02:23.430> creates<00:02:23.850> a<00:02:23.940> cobblestone<00:02:24.510> generator<00:02:25.280> now

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

place your timer and set it to 15

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.300 
place your timer and set it to 15
seconds<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:07.659> then<00:03:08.659> send<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.860> Mauston

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
seconds and then send the Mauston

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.410 
seconds and then send the Mauston
wherever<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.760> want<00:03:11.000> I'm<00:03:11.269> just<00:03:11.569> gonna<00:03:11.659> place<00:03:11.989> a

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
wherever you want I'm just gonna place a

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.759 
wherever you want I'm just gonna place a
chest<00:03:14.420> right<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:16.299> and<00:03:17.349> when<00:03:18.349> you<00:03:18.500> first

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:18.769 
chest right here and when you first

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:20.710 
chest right here and when you first
place<00:03:19.010> your<00:03:19.190> timer<00:03:19.459> it's<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.849> 2<00:03:20.090> seconds<00:03:20.690> so

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
place your timer it's on 2 seconds so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.420 
place your timer it's on 2 seconds so
you're<00:03:21.049> probably<00:03:21.260> going<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.859> want<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.220> break

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
you're probably going to want to break

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.770 
you're probably going to want to break
the<00:03:23.359> first<00:03:23.569> few<00:03:23.930> cobblestone<00:03:24.560> that<00:03:24.769> it<00:03:24.890> makes

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
the first few cobblestone that it makes

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.770 
the first few cobblestone that it makes
and<00:03:26.950> that's<00:03:27.950> all<00:03:28.310> there<00:03:28.549> is<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:29.000> it<00:03:29.150> so<00:03:29.480> I'm

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and that's all there is to it so I'm

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.809 
and that's all there is to it so I'm
going<00:03:30.109> to<00:03:30.349> pause<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.099> video<00:03:31.190> and<00:03:31.549> let<00:03:31.700> this

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
going to pause the video and let this

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.899 
going to pause the video and let this
run<00:03:31.940> so<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.390> you<00:03:32.540> can<00:03:32.720> see<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:34.489> moss

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
run so that you can see the moss

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.180 
run so that you can see the moss
spreading<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.230> reason<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:36.620> works<00:03:36.829> is

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
spreading and the reason this works is

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.470 
spreading and the reason this works is
because<00:03:37.870> if<00:03:38.870> ma<00:03:39.709> stone<00:03:40.099> does<00:03:40.459> not<00:03:40.670> have<00:03:40.970> a

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
because if ma stone does not have a

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.780 
because if ma stone does not have a
direct<00:03:42.409> line<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> sight<00:03:42.890> to<00:03:42.920> the<00:03:43.159> sky<00:03:43.489> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
direct line of sight to the sky and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.089 
direct line of sight to the sky and
there<00:03:44.540> is<00:03:44.629> flowing<00:03:45.079> water<00:03:45.319> next<00:03:46.040> to

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
there is flowing water next to

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.099 
there is flowing water next to
cobblestone<00:03:46.849> that<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.329> also<00:03:47.510> next<00:03:47.810> to<00:03:47.959> the

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
cobblestone that is also next to the

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.250 
cobblestone that is also next to the
mosque<00:03:48.319> own<00:03:48.700> the<00:03:49.700> moss<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.209> spread<00:03:50.599> onto<00:03:51.139> that

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
mosque own the moss can spread onto that

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.710 
mosque own the moss can spread onto that
cobblestone<00:03:51.859> so<00:03:52.819> I'm<00:03:52.880> going<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.060> pause<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
cobblestone so I'm going to pause it and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.900 
cobblestone so I'm going to pause it and
I'll<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.349> back<00:03:54.560> so<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.099> you<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.370> see<00:03:55.609> the

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
I'll be back so that you can see the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.140 
I'll be back so that you can see the
moss<00:03:56.180> spreading<00:03:57.250> okay<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.790> you<00:03:58.849> can<00:03:59.090> see

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
moss spreading okay so as you can see

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.979 
moss spreading okay so as you can see
the<00:03:59.510> moss<00:03:59.690> has<00:03:59.959> already<00:04:00.410> spread<00:04:00.859> to<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
the moss has already spread to the

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.369 
the moss has already spread to the
furthest<00:04:03.620> cobblestone<00:04:04.430> block<00:04:04.849> and<00:04:08.079> you<00:04:09.079> may

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
furthest cobblestone block and you may

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.059 
furthest cobblestone block and you may
have<00:04:10.129> a<00:04:10.190> problem<00:04:10.519> with<00:04:10.930> occasionally<00:04:12.010> by<00:04:13.010> the

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
have a problem with occasionally by the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.210 
have a problem with occasionally by the
time<00:04:13.430> your<00:04:14.209> cobblestone<00:04:14.840> gets<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.070> end

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
time your cobblestone gets to the end

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.550 
time your cobblestone gets to the end
here<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:17.090> moss<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.329> not<00:04:17.720> spread<00:04:18.079> to<00:04:18.109> it

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
here the moss is not spread to it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.289 
here the moss is not spread to it
so<00:04:18.919> every<00:04:19.099> once<00:04:19.280> in<00:04:19.370> a<00:04:19.459> while<00:04:19.519> you<00:04:19.760> may<00:04:19.910> end<00:04:20.120> up

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
so every once in a while you may end up

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.159 
so every once in a while you may end up
with<00:04:20.690> some<00:04:21.169> cobblestone<00:04:21.739> in<00:04:22.010> your<00:04:22.250> chest<00:04:22.520> or
