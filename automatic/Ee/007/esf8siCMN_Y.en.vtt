now<00:00:14.950> that<00:00:15.099> we<00:00:15.190> have<00:00:15.339> an<00:00:15.459> understanding<00:00:16.029> of<00:00:16.299> you

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:16.510 
now that we have an understanding of you

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.089 
now that we have an understanding of you
v's<00:00:16.779> that<00:00:17.080> we<00:00:17.170> discussed<00:00:17.650> in<00:00:17.800> the<00:00:17.890> previous

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
v's that we discussed in the previous

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.880 
v's that we discussed in the previous
video<00:00:18.460> let's<00:00:19.240> go<00:00:19.390> ahead<00:00:19.449> and<00:00:19.689> do<00:00:19.900> a<00:00:19.930> little<00:00:20.380> UV

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
video let's go ahead and do a little UV

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.550 
video let's go ahead and do a little UV
mapping<00:00:21.189> on<00:00:21.550> our<00:00:21.730> sword<00:00:22.119> so<00:00:22.599> we<00:00:23.050> can<00:00:23.259> get<00:00:23.410> the

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
mapping on our sword so we can get the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.249 
mapping on our sword so we can get the
textures<00:00:24.039> to<00:00:24.250> appear<00:00:24.640> correctly<00:00:25.270> on<00:00:25.449> this<00:00:26.050> new

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
textures to appear correctly on this new

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.710 
textures to appear correctly on this new
object<00:00:26.500> that<00:00:26.860> we've<00:00:27.130> created<00:00:27.430> so<00:00:28.300> first<00:00:28.539> thing

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
object that we've created so first thing

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.240 
object that we've created so first thing
let's<00:00:28.960> go<00:00:29.050> ahead<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:29.290> drag<00:00:29.500> this<00:00:29.770> off<00:00:29.950> to<00:00:30.160> the

and click open then we want to press 6
on<00:00:55.420> our<00:00:55.450> keyboard<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.649> we<00:00:56.680> can<00:00:57.010> see<00:00:57.310> the

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
on our keyboard so we can see the

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.190 
on our keyboard so we can see the
texture<00:00:57.940> on<00:00:57.970> it<00:00:58.239> now<00:00:58.600> I'm<00:00:58.720> actually<00:00:58.930> gonna

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
texture on it now I'm actually gonna

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.500 
texture on it now I'm actually gonna
zoom<00:00:59.590> in<00:00:59.800> real<00:01:00.040> fast<00:01:00.309> just<00:01:00.520> to<00:01:00.730> show<00:01:01.000> you<00:01:01.059> this

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
zoom in real fast just to show you this

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.840 
zoom in real fast just to show you this
is<00:01:01.690> very<00:01:01.960> deformed<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.250> that's<00:01:03.399> because

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
is very deformed and that's because

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.410 
is very deformed and that's because
we've<00:01:04.229> manipulated<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> initial<00:01:05.770> box<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.640> we

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
we've manipulated the initial box and we

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.200 
we've manipulated the initial box and we
have<00:01:07.450> deformed<00:01:08.140> these<00:01:08.409> faces<00:01:08.979> but<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.430> box<00:01:09.850> is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
have deformed these faces but the box is

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.859 
have deformed these faces but the box is
still<00:01:10.390> laid<00:01:10.840> out<00:01:11.079> in<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.920> UV<00:01:12.369> map<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:13.390> same<00:01:13.659> as

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
still laid out in the UV map the same as

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.780 
still laid out in the UV map the same as
it<00:01:14.049> was<00:01:14.229> when<00:01:14.469> we<00:01:14.530> initially<00:01:14.979> created<00:01:15.490> the<00:01:15.579> box

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
it was when we initially created the box

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.109 
it was when we initially created the box
the<00:01:16.259> faces<00:01:17.259> when<00:01:17.499> we<00:01:17.619> change<00:01:17.889> faces<00:01:18.429> on<00:01:18.670> our

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
the faces when we change faces on our

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.230 
the faces when we change faces on our
object<00:01:19.329> the<00:01:20.200> face<00:01:20.619> shape<00:01:21.039> in<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.549> UV<00:01:21.819> map<00:01:21.999> does

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
object the face shape in the UV map does

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.510 
object the face shape in the UV map does
not<00:01:22.420> coincide<00:01:22.719> in<00:01:23.350> changes<00:01:24.189> you<00:01:24.369> have<00:01:24.459> to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
not coincide in changes you have to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.109 
not coincide in changes you have to
change<00:01:25.119> one<00:01:25.479> and<00:01:25.829> then<00:01:26.829> change<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.549> other<00:01:27.729> so

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
change one and then change the other so

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:30.660 
change one and then change the other so
that's<00:01:28.270> why<00:01:28.420> you<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:29.109> do<00:01:29.259> UV<00:01:29.679> mapping<00:01:29.950> I'm

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
that's why you have to do UV mapping I'm

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.129 
that's why you have to do UV mapping I'm
going<00:01:30.789> up<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.939> Edit<00:01:31.240> UVs<00:01:31.359> and<00:01:31.810> just<00:01:31.959> show<00:01:32.109> you

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:32.139 
going up to Edit UVs and just show you

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:33.779 
going up to Edit UVs and just show you
what<00:01:32.259> I'm<00:01:32.439> talking<00:01:32.829> about<00:01:32.889> open<00:01:33.340> up<00:01:33.399> the<00:01:33.520> UV

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
what I'm talking about open up the UV

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:36.779 
what I'm talking about open up the UV
texture<00:01:34.179> editor<00:01:34.329> and<00:01:35.130> again<00:01:36.130> that's<00:01:36.310> Edit<00:01:36.639> UVs

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:36.789 
texture editor and again that's Edit UVs

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.539 
texture editor and again that's Edit UVs
UV<00:01:37.659> texture<00:01:38.020> editor<00:01:38.109> I'm<00:01:38.799> gonna<00:01:38.920> select<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
UV texture editor I'm gonna select the

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.669 
UV texture editor I'm gonna select the
sword<00:01:39.850> and<00:01:40.119> show<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.779> exactly<00:01:41.109> what<00:01:41.439> I<00:01:41.469> mean

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
sword and show you exactly what I mean

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.469 
sword and show you exactly what I mean
by<00:01:41.859> that<00:01:41.889> here<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.609> can<00:01:42.639> see<00:01:42.999> this<00:01:43.149> is<00:01:43.329> our

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
by that here you can see this is our

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.830 
by that here you can see this is our
initial<00:01:43.719> box<00:01:44.170> it's<00:01:44.499> this<00:01:44.619> upside<00:01:45.219> down<00:01:45.249> T<00:01:46.090> now

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
initial box it's this upside down T now

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.599 
initial box it's this upside down T now
imagine<00:01:47.139> if<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.289> were<00:01:47.499> painting<00:01:48.039> this<00:01:48.249> sword

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
imagine if you were painting this sword

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.389 
imagine if you were painting this sword
you<00:01:48.909> had<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.270> paint<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.630> texture<00:01:50.109> here<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:51.249> it

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
you had to paint a texture here so it

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.849 
you had to paint a texture here so it
would<00:01:51.520> show<00:01:51.759> up<00:01:51.880> on<00:01:51.999> these<00:01:52.179> 3d<00:01:52.659> faces<00:01:53.229> that

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
would show up on these 3d faces that

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.919 
would show up on these 3d faces that
would<00:01:54.069> be<00:01:54.249> impossible<00:01:54.609> to<00:01:55.299> paint<00:01:55.659> this

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
would be impossible to paint this

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.010 
would be impossible to paint this
because<00:01:56.499> again<00:01:56.829> we've<00:01:57.429> reshaped<00:01:58.029> these<00:01:58.479> faces

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
because again we've reshaped these faces

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.649 
because again we've reshaped these faces
but<00:01:59.200> we<00:01:59.319> never<00:01:59.619> reject<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.429> faces<00:02:00.909> in<00:02:00.939> our<00:02:01.270> UV

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
but we never reject the faces in our UV

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.440 
but we never reject the faces in our UV
map<00:02:01.929> they<00:02:02.319> don't<00:02:02.529> coincide<00:02:02.919> and<00:02:03.459> change<00:02:03.819> you

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
map they don't coincide and change you

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.480 
map they don't coincide and change you
have<00:02:04.569> to<00:02:04.719> do<00:02:04.869> one<00:02:05.139> then<00:02:05.709> you<00:02:05.859> have<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.159> do<00:02:06.310> the

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
have to do one then you have to do the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639 
have to do one then you have to do the
other<00:02:06.669> and<00:02:06.999> typically<00:02:07.659> the<00:02:07.929> way<00:02:07.959> it<00:02:08.200> works<00:02:08.410> is

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
other and typically the way it works is

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.220 
other and typically the way it works is
first<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.280> do<00:02:09.459> your<00:02:09.640> modeling<00:02:10.149> then<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.080> do

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
first you do your modeling then you do

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.410 
first you do your modeling then you do
your<00:02:11.470> UV<00:02:11.800> mapping<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:12.880> let's<00:02:13.030> go<00:02:13.150> ahead<00:02:13.209> and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
your UV mapping so let's go ahead and

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.020 
your UV mapping so let's go ahead and
take<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.599> look<00:02:13.780> at<00:02:13.930> how<00:02:14.020> we<00:02:14.080> can<00:02:14.319> quickly<00:02:15.030> set

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
take a look at how we can quickly set

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.670 
take a look at how we can quickly set
all<00:02:16.270> these<00:02:16.450> faces<00:02:16.900> up<00:02:17.020> now<00:02:17.170> it's<00:02:17.349> not<00:02:17.500> going<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
all these faces up now it's not going to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.800 
all these faces up now it's not going to
be<00:02:17.800> ideal<00:02:17.980> we're<00:02:18.970> gonna<00:02:19.090> use<00:02:19.300> automatic

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
be ideal we're gonna use automatic

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.070 
be ideal we're gonna use automatic
mapping<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:21.130> starters<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.850> just<00:02:22.090> get<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> basic

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
mapping for starters to just get a basic

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.620 
mapping for starters to just get a basic
idea<00:02:23.200> of<00:02:23.620> how<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:24.070> sword<00:02:24.520> should<00:02:25.210> be<00:02:25.360> laid

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
idea of how this sword should be laid

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.210 
idea of how this sword should be laid
out<00:02:25.660> in<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
out in the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.800 
out in the
so<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.640> order<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.880> do<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.120> it's<00:02:28.270> very<00:02:28.540> quick

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
so in order to do that it's very quick

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
so in order to do that it's very quick
very<00:02:28.870> simple<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.860> do<00:02:30.010> we're<00:02:30.250> just<00:02:30.280> gonna<00:02:30.520> come

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
very simple to do we're just gonna come

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.430 
very simple to do we're just gonna come
up<00:02:30.850> here<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.360> create<00:02:31.780> UVs

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
up here to create UVs

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.160 
up here to create UVs
with<00:02:33.250> our<00:02:33.430> object<00:02:33.940> selected<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.720> we're<00:02:35.080> gonna

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
with our object selected and we're gonna

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.470 
with our object selected and we're gonna
come<00:02:35.470> down<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.770> automatic<00:02:36.730> mapping<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.360> we're

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
come down to automatic mapping and we're

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.180 
come down to automatic mapping and we're
gonna<00:02:37.570> select<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.080> little<00:02:38.350> box<00:02:38.620> next<00:02:39.130> to

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
gonna select this little box next to

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.860 
gonna select this little box next to
automatic<00:02:39.880> mapping<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.420> bring<00:02:40.630> up<00:02:40.750> the

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
automatic mapping to bring up the

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.740 
automatic mapping to bring up the
automatic<00:02:41.470> mapping<00:02:41.650> options<00:02:42.360> now<00:02:43.360> we<00:02:43.420> have<00:02:43.600> to

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
automatic mapping options now we have to

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.540 
automatic mapping options now we have to
set<00:02:43.900> our<00:02:43.960> planes<00:02:44.410> there<00:02:44.770> are<00:02:44.890> various<00:02:45.310> options

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
set our planes there are various options

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.550 
set our planes there are various options
you<00:02:45.880> could<00:02:46.060> do<00:02:46.210> eight<00:02:46.420> planes<00:02:46.750> twelve<00:02:47.200> planes

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
you could do eight planes twelve planes

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.630 
you could do eight planes twelve planes
and<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.250> on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
and so on

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.330 
and so on
now<00:02:49.000> planes<00:02:49.390> is<00:02:49.630> kind<00:02:49.930> of<00:02:50.080> telling<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.680> which

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
now planes is kind of telling you which

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.860 
now planes is kind of telling you which
direction<00:02:51.790> do<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.180> want<00:02:52.390> to<00:02:52.480> do<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.600> projection

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
direction do you want to do a projection

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.680 
direction do you want to do a projection
from<00:02:53.650> now<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.340> way<00:02:54.520> a<00:02:54.550> projection<00:02:55.030> works<00:02:55.450> is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
from now the way a projection works is

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.230 
from now the way a projection works is
like<00:02:55.870> this<00:02:55.930> all<00:02:56.830> right<00:02:57.010> let's<00:02:57.310> say<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.820> want<00:02:58.150> to

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
like this all right let's say I want to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.660 
like this all right let's say I want to
delay<00:02:58.540> these<00:02:58.810> phases<00:02:59.410> out<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.890> this<00:03:00.430> direction

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
delay these phases out in this direction

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.960 
delay these phases out in this direction
okay<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.840> looked<00:03:02.170> flat<00:03:02.650> like<00:03:03.190> it<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.490> here

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
okay so it looked flat like it is here

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.440 
okay so it looked flat like it is here
but<00:03:04.750> on<00:03:04.990> my<00:03:05.530> 2d<00:03:05.950> texture<00:03:06.400> what<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.940> does<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.300> it

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
but on my 2d texture what it does is it

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.200 
but on my 2d texture what it does is it
takes<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:08.050> plane<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.800> it<00:03:09.340> says<00:03:09.580> okay<00:03:09.940> this

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
takes this plane and it says okay this

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.350 
takes this plane and it says okay this
would<00:03:10.420> be<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:11.200> Z<00:03:11.770> plane<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.090> would<00:03:13.180> take<00:03:13.330> a

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
would be the Z plane and it would take a

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.870 
would be the Z plane and it would take a
picture<00:03:13.870> of<00:03:14.020> this<00:03:14.470> from<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.190> angle<00:03:15.430> but<00:03:15.730> this

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
picture of this from that angle but this

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.150 
picture of this from that angle but this
isn't<00:03:16.090> just<00:03:16.270> the<00:03:16.630> Z<00:03:16.780> plane<00:03:16.960> this<00:03:17.740> is<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:18.010> Z

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
isn't just the Z plane this is the Z

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.330 
isn't just the Z plane this is the Z
plus<00:03:18.670> plane<00:03:19.090> alright<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.110> from<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.860> Z<00:03:21.040> plus

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
plus plane alright so from the Z plus

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.520 
plus plane alright so from the Z plus
looking<00:03:21.790> at<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.060> from<00:03:22.210> this<00:03:22.390> direction<00:03:22.530> that

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
looking at it from this direction that

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.580 
looking at it from this direction that
would<00:03:23.710> lay<00:03:23.890> these<00:03:24.160> faces<00:03:24.850> out<00:03:25.060> flat<00:03:25.510> facing<00:03:26.410> up

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
would lay these faces out flat facing up

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.150 
would lay these faces out flat facing up
on<00:03:26.950> our<00:03:27.460> 2d<00:03:27.850> texture<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.600> again<00:03:29.440> on<00:03:29.710> the

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
on our 2d texture and again on the

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.400 
on our 2d texture and again on the
backside<00:03:30.640> remember<00:03:31.330> this<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.050> plus

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
backside remember this is the plus

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.220 
backside remember this is the plus
because<00:03:32.860> it's<00:03:33.040> plus<00:03:33.640> it's<00:03:34.600> going<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.080> that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
because it's plus it's going in that

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.660 
because it's plus it's going in that
direction<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.740> can<00:03:35.950> always<00:03:36.100> look<00:03:36.340> here<00:03:36.580> for

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
direction you can always look here for

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.070 
direction you can always look here for
your<00:03:36.820> plus<00:03:37.030> negative<00:03:37.480> and<00:03:37.630> then<00:03:37.750> everything

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
your plus negative and then everything

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.740 
your plus negative and then everything
behind<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.530> Z<00:03:38.800> is<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.160> Z<00:03:39.190> negative<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.600> it

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
behind the Z is the Z negative so it

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.020 
behind the Z is the Z negative so it
would<00:03:40.870> also<00:03:41.020> take<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.410> picture<00:03:41.920> from<00:03:42.340> here<00:03:42.880> and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
would also take a picture from here and

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.840 
would also take a picture from here and
the<00:03:43.390> way<00:03:43.480> this<00:03:43.630> works<00:03:43.900> again<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.040> it's<00:03:45.640> like<00:03:45.820> a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
the way this works again is it's like a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.110 
the way this works again is it's like a
box<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.840> Y<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.709> another<00:03:48.280> Y<00:03:48.520> then<00:03:49.030> you

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
box you have a Y and another Y then you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.810 
box you have a Y and another Y then you
have<00:03:49.240> an<00:03:49.390> X<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.990> another<00:03:50.440> X<00:03:50.680> plane<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.340> you

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
have an X and another X plane and you

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.110 
have an X and another X plane and you
have<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.410> Z<00:03:53.410> which<00:03:54.370> would<00:03:54.520> be<00:03:54.640> in<00:03:54.730> front<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.030> it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
have a Z which would be in front of it

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.900 
have a Z which would be in front of it
and<00:03:55.270> behind<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:56.020> now<00:03:56.610> that'll<00:03:57.610> make<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.790> lot

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
and behind it now that'll make a lot

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.640 
and behind it now that'll make a lot
more<00:03:58.209> sense<00:03:58.270> here<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.840> just<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.110> second<00:03:59.470> when<00:03:59.560> we

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
more sense here in just a second when we

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.410 
more sense here in just a second when we
actually<00:03:59.890> project<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:00.880> wanted<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.270> lay

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
actually project I just wanted to lay

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.990 
actually project I just wanted to lay
that<00:04:01.630> out<00:04:01.690> for<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.110> second<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.010> optimized<00:04:03.640> for

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
that out for a second so optimized for

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.880 
that out for a second so optimized for
fewer<00:04:04.420> pieces<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.230> go<00:04:05.500> ahead<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.770> select

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
fewer pieces and go ahead and select

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.310 
fewer pieces and go ahead and select
insert<00:04:06.459> projection<00:04:07.000> before<00:04:07.180> deformers<00:04:07.900> and

insert projection before deformers and
I'm<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.620> gonna<00:04:08.800> scroll<00:04:09.190> down<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.489> little<00:04:09.730> bit

I'm just gonna scroll down a little bit

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.580 
I'm just gonna scroll down a little bit
just<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.270> show<00:04:10.330> you<00:04:10.510> what<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.989> shell<00:04:11.260> layout

what's happened here is it has created

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.230 
what's happened here is it has created
six<00:04:32.080> planes<00:04:32.380> in<00:04:32.560> our<00:04:32.680> 3d<00:04:33.040> space<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:33.520> these<00:04:34.060> you

six planes in our 3d space and these you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.240 
six planes in our 3d space and these you

has looked at the face of the object and

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:51.929 
has looked at the face of the object and
it's<00:04:48.669> decided<00:04:49.389> ok<00:04:49.719> which<00:04:50.139> direction<00:04:50.919> is<00:04:51.400> this

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
it's decided ok which direction is this

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.989 
it's decided ok which direction is this
face<00:04:52.300> most<00:04:52.749> likely<00:04:53.349> pointed<00:04:53.889> towards<00:04:54.279> and<00:04:54.490> it

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
face most likely pointed towards and it

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.629 
face most likely pointed towards and it
said<00:04:55.300> okay<00:04:55.569> if<00:04:56.050> this<00:04:56.499> is<00:04:56.770> most<00:04:57.009> likely<00:04:57.219> facing

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
said okay if this is most likely facing

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.309 
said okay if this is most likely facing
that<00:04:58.629> direction<00:04:59.189> then<00:05:00.189> this<00:05:00.550> plane<00:05:01.240> is<00:05:01.629> going

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
that direction then this plane is going

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.320 
that direction then this plane is going
to<00:05:02.620> take<00:05:03.009> a<00:05:03.039> picture<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.550> it<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:03.819> lay<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.150> out

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
to take a picture of it and lay it out

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.390 
to take a picture of it and lay it out
flat<00:05:04.539> here<00:05:05.020> that's<00:05:05.710> all<00:05:05.830> it<00:05:05.919> did<00:05:06.069> it's<00:05:06.279> just

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
flat here that's all it did it's just

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.820 
flat here that's all it did it's just
being<00:05:06.789> very<00:05:06.819> smart<00:05:07.389> kind<00:05:08.050> of<00:05:08.169> deciding<00:05:08.680> which

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
being very smart kind of deciding which

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.040 
being very smart kind of deciding which
direction<00:05:09.639> it<00:05:09.849> should<00:05:09.879> take<00:05:10.270> a<00:05:10.300> picture<00:05:10.539> of

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
direction it should take a picture of

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.080 
direction it should take a picture of
the<00:05:11.199> faces<00:05:11.620> from<00:05:11.889> essentially<00:05:12.789> what<00:05:12.939> it's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
the faces from essentially what it's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.360 
the faces from essentially what it's
done<00:05:13.330> is<00:05:13.569> it's<00:05:13.750> determined<00:05:14.469> which<00:05:14.770> direction

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
done is it's determined which direction

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.640 
done is it's determined which direction
each<00:05:15.610> face<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.449> object<00:05:17.020> is<00:05:17.169> pointing

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
each face of the object is pointing

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.769 
each face of the object is pointing
towards<00:05:18.189> you<00:05:18.699> know<00:05:18.759> which<00:05:18.939> is<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.240> probable

00:05:19.769 --> 00:05:19.779 
towards you know which is the probable

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.809 
towards you know which is the probable
direction<00:05:20.409> and<00:05:20.620> then<00:05:20.740> it's<00:05:20.889> laid<00:05:21.219> that<00:05:21.550> out

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
direction and then it's laid that out

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.290 
direction and then it's laid that out
flat<00:05:22.449> based<00:05:22.870> on<00:05:23.139> that<00:05:23.469> planar<00:05:23.919> direction<00:05:24.699> so

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
flat based on that planar direction so

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.540 
flat based on that planar direction so
if<00:05:25.360> we<00:05:25.449> take<00:05:25.629> a<00:05:25.659> look<00:05:25.900> here<00:05:26.199> in<00:05:26.409> our<00:05:26.620> UV<00:05:26.979> map<00:05:27.189> one

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
if we take a look here in our UV map one

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.800 
if we take a look here in our UV map one
of<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.729> great<00:05:27.909> things<00:05:28.210> about<00:05:28.330> automatic

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
of the great things about automatic

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.570 
of the great things about automatic
mapping<00:05:29.349> is<00:05:29.590> it's<00:05:29.889> done<00:05:30.189> all<00:05:30.340> this

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
mapping is it's done all this

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.429 
mapping is it's done all this
automatically<00:05:31.180> we<00:05:31.389> can<00:05:31.539> select<00:05:32.080> off<00:05:32.259> the

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439 
automatically we can select off the

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.649 
automatically we can select off the
object<00:05:32.589> and<00:05:33.129> kind<00:05:33.819> of<00:05:33.909> just<00:05:34.120> look<00:05:34.330> it's

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
object and kind of just look it's

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.540 
object and kind of just look it's
flattened<00:05:35.589> everything<00:05:36.009> out<00:05:36.159> everything

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
flattened everything out everything

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.860 
flattened everything out everything
looks<00:05:36.729> really<00:05:37.000> good

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
looks really good

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.480 
looks really good
and<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.379> would<00:05:38.499> think<00:05:38.740> okay<00:05:39.069> that's<00:05:39.249> all

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
and you would think okay that's all

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.879 
and you would think okay that's all
there<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:39.669> to<00:05:39.999> it<00:05:40.150> I<00:05:40.300> can<00:05:40.360> go<00:05:40.629> about<00:05:40.749> my<00:05:40.900> day<00:05:41.110> but

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:41.889 
there is to it I can go about my day but

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:44.010 
there is to it I can go about my day but
unfortunately<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:43.180> world<00:05:43.360> is<00:05:43.599> not<00:05:43.750> that

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
unfortunately the world is not that

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.659 
unfortunately the world is not that
perfect<00:05:44.560> and<00:05:44.740> we<00:05:44.889> have<00:05:44.919> to<00:05:45.279> do<00:05:45.430> a<00:05:45.460> little

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
perfect and we have to do a little

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.480 
perfect and we have to do a little
modification<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.719> this<00:05:46.900> through<00:05:47.740> a<00:05:47.770> series<00:05:48.460> of

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
modification to this through a series of

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.149 
modification to this through a series of
planar<00:05:48.909> mappings<00:05:49.509> cuts<00:05:49.990> and<00:05:50.349> unfolds<00:05:51.009> which

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
planar mappings cuts and unfolds which

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.309 
planar mappings cuts and unfolds which
we'll<00:05:51.310> be<00:05:51.339> covering<00:05:51.460> very<00:05:52.029> shortly<00:05:52.389> so<00:05:53.020> as<00:05:53.169> you

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 
we'll be covering very shortly so as you

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.409 
we'll be covering very shortly so as you
can<00:05:53.409> see<00:05:53.680> it's<00:05:53.919> laid<00:05:54.279> out<00:05:54.460> our<00:05:54.490> blade<00:05:55.089> very

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
can see it's laid out our blade very

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.839 
can see it's laid out our blade very
flat<00:05:55.810> you<00:05:56.500> can<00:05:56.620> see<00:05:56.770> it's<00:05:56.889> flat<00:05:57.039> but<00:05:57.339> there<00:05:57.699> are

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
flat you can see it's flat but there are

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.999 
flat you can see it's flat but there are
problems<00:05:58.210> so<00:05:58.629> if<00:05:58.719> i<00:05:58.839> zoom<00:05:58.870> in<00:05:59.289> here<00:05:59.319> and<00:05:59.770> for

00:05:59.999 --> 00:06:00.009 
problems so if i zoom in here and for

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:01.980 
problems so if i zoom in here and for
instance<00:06:00.250> we<00:06:00.460> look<00:06:00.699> at<00:06:00.849> the<00:06:01.029> ball<00:06:01.330> think<00:06:01.899> if

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
instance we look at the ball think if

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:03.510 
instance we look at the ball think if
you<00:06:02.110> are<00:06:02.199> trying<00:06:02.409> to<00:06:02.560> texture<00:06:03.009> this<00:06:03.159> in<00:06:03.430> a

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
you are trying to texture this in a

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.089 
you are trying to texture this in a
program<00:06:03.939> like<00:06:03.990> Photoshop<00:06:04.990> or<00:06:05.199> GIMP<00:06:05.229> this<00:06:05.830> ball

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
program like Photoshop or GIMP this ball

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:07.950 
program like Photoshop or GIMP this ball
would<00:06:06.310> be<00:06:06.460> almost<00:06:06.639> impossible<00:06:06.969> to<00:06:07.719> just

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
would be almost impossible to just

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.719 
would be almost impossible to just
texture<00:06:08.589> the<00:06:08.889> only<00:06:09.069> way<00:06:09.189> this<00:06:09.370> would<00:06:09.580> be

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
texture the only way this would be

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.129 
texture the only way this would be
effective<00:06:10.180> is<00:06:10.449> if<00:06:10.659> you<00:06:10.779> were<00:06:10.930> actually

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:11.139 
effective is if you were actually

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:13.230 
effective is if you were actually
planning<00:06:11.770> on<00:06:11.949> painting<00:06:12.310> in<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.699> 3d<00:06:13.000> program

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
planning on painting in the 3d program

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.149 
planning on painting in the 3d program
and<00:06:13.659> even<00:06:13.990> then<00:06:14.409> you'd<00:06:14.620> probably<00:06:14.800> have

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
and even then you'd probably have

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.189 
and even then you'd probably have
problems<00:06:15.610> with<00:06:15.759> textures<00:06:16.449> seams<00:06:16.779> which<00:06:17.020> is

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
problems with textures seams which is

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.689 
problems with textures seams which is
something<00:06:17.589> we'll<00:06:17.740> probably<00:06:17.770> discuss<00:06:18.250> a

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
something we'll probably discuss a

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.730 
something we'll probably discuss a
little<00:06:18.909> more<00:06:19.060> in<00:06:19.330> depth<00:06:19.539> in<00:06:19.719> the<00:06:19.839> future<00:06:20.229> so

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
little more in depth in the future so

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.889 
little more in depth in the future so
this<00:06:20.919> ball<00:06:21.189> will<00:06:21.460> need<00:06:21.639> to<00:06:21.789> be<00:06:21.939> fixed<00:06:22.270> on<00:06:22.629> both

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:22.899 
this ball will need to be fixed on both

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:25.589 
this ball will need to be fixed on both
sides<00:06:23.289> and<00:06:23.770> again<00:06:24.520> we<00:06:24.789> can<00:06:24.969> take<00:06:25.149> a<00:06:25.180> look<00:06:25.419> at

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
sides and again we can take a look at

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.749 
sides and again we can take a look at
certain<00:06:26.349> other<00:06:26.469> little<00:06:26.949> parts<00:06:27.339> like<00:06:27.550> the

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
certain other little parts like the

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:30.329 
certain other little parts like the
handle<00:06:28.270> this<00:06:28.539> part<00:06:28.810> right<00:06:28.990> here<00:06:29.050> or<00:06:29.979> just<00:06:30.189> like

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
handle this part right here or just like

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.129 
handle this part right here or just like
these<00:06:30.490> faces<00:06:30.909> that's<00:06:31.089> these<00:06:31.330> faces<00:06:31.839> here<00:06:32.020> you

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:32.139 
these faces that's these faces here you

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.110 
these faces that's these faces here you
can<00:06:32.259> see<00:06:32.439> that<00:06:32.560> there's<00:06:32.740> gaps<00:06:33.069> there's<00:06:33.939> no

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
can see that there's gaps there's no

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.450 
can see that there's gaps there's no
need<00:06:34.300> for<00:06:34.539> that<00:06:34.659> because<00:06:34.689> we<00:06:35.169> could<00:06:35.349> plane<00:06:36.279> or

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
need for that because we could plane or

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.360 
need for that because we could plane or
map<00:06:36.639> this<00:06:37.000> cut<00:06:37.930> it<00:06:38.110> and<00:06:38.349> then<00:06:38.500> unfold<00:06:38.979> it<00:06:39.159> so

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
map this cut it and then unfold it so

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.879 
map this cut it and then unfold it so
it's<00:06:39.520> one<00:06:39.789> solid<00:06:40.089> square<00:06:40.899> and<00:06:41.229> then<00:06:41.500> we<00:06:41.649> just

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
it's one solid square and then we just

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:43.499 
it's one solid square and then we just
have<00:06:42.099> to<00:06:42.250> paint<00:06:42.430> that<00:06:42.639> one<00:06:42.849> sell<00:06:43.089> it<00:06:43.180> square<00:06:43.360> be

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:43.509 
have to paint that one sell it square be

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:45.360 
have to paint that one sell it square be
a<00:06:43.539> lot<00:06:43.719> easier<00:06:43.750> to<00:06:44.080> texture<00:06:44.649> so<00:06:45.009> in<00:06:45.099> the<00:06:45.189> next

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:45.370 
a lot easier to texture so in the next

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.499 
a lot easier to texture so in the next
video<00:06:45.669> what<00:06:45.819> we're<00:06:45.939> gonna<00:06:46.029> do<00:06:46.240> is<00:06:46.330> we're<00:06:46.449> gonna

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:46.509 
video what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:48.360 
video what we're gonna do is we're gonna
take<00:06:46.839> a<00:06:46.870> look<00:06:47.110> at<00:06:47.199> how<00:06:47.349> we<00:06:47.409> can<00:06:47.649> use<00:06:47.889> planar

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
take a look at how we can use planar

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.790 
take a look at how we can use planar
