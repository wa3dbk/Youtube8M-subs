 put your energy to save with the thermostat one degree lower and the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.900
 user an extra energy-saving lamp 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.980
 only 20 percent of our energy consumption goes for our daily food 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 we need more and more land water and energy for it 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:27.800
 Do you want scientist to be enthusiasts 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.119
 developed method to measure the sustainability of eating patterns 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.120
 when they compared current consumption with that of 19 50 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.000
 it turned out that we use more and more natural resources for our food 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 the problem is that in the netherlands we have become increasingly prosperous and 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.390
 therefore go even though it is 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.770
 Peter favors fewer and fewer potatoes, but it does 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.130
 other products such as 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:53.040
 astana 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.990
 rice 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.360
 down 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.090
 it is precisely those products that place a greater burden on our natural ones 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.690
 resources such as the country 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 the training mission 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.280
 daily shopping rarely takes into account the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.500
 durability 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.610
 We give 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870
 and today more than 5 euros 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.560
 we are going to descend and 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 tempering binda 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.310
 everything in the Netherlands far from where 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 when you express the sustainability world in the use of natural 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.350
 Resources First the victims food puts on you 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:33.609
 open naturally 

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:35.160
 and met 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.780
 Similarly, four to 40 percent of the surface area is needed for 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.159
 making food 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.859
 is in the Netherlands 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:44.690
 a fan has a telephone 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 energy use for food often think that they are at home about energy 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.600
 needed for 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.819
 the heating of the house already for the use of the car too 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.460
 but that it is also needed for energy to produce food 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.469
 I think is something new 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.409
 five times is seventy percent of all fresh water on a global scale 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.409
 people use food needed 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.239

 peter r 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.569
 never mind but then 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:28.000
 a portion of travel costs newcomer 27 square meters of hand in 183 literature 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.020

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.630
 a portion of marc anthony costs and even after fifteen square meters of land 128 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.090
 literature and income a mega show that energy but a portion of potatoes 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.529
 Dutch soil 

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:45.579
 only newcomer costs new square meters of land 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.039
 sixty-nine liters of water m newcomer four megashow energy 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.480
 and is therefore by far the best 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.480
 per barrel per share 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.869
 lovely cup procedure for the kids 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.749
 mb 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.349
 even in the health food store it is not always possible to take into account 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.229
 take into account the sustainability of the products 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:17.929
 then it all comes from 

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:22.099
 Well a larger proportion comes from the Southern Europe norms and values ​​of 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.860
 The Netherlands 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.339
 the season before 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.990
 what a different light comes to the test 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.469
 they are cut back on their expectations for the new harvest 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.949
 use greenpeace well 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.299
 wilders wants women all year round 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.929
 the second is our contract for healthy and fit fruit per day 

00:03:39.749 --> 00:03:43.049
 really nothing more the project will be the trip 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.409
 I have looked at how much money is needed 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.839
 to replace it since I have a tear 

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:53.109
 for this I have calculated how many square meters needed to complete the 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.479
 produce a mirrored addition 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:59.069
 the square meters are not Dutch but also abroad 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.759
 for example in south america 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:07.029
 I combined this with data already before consumption if you then when I am on 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.339
 counts you finally have the number of square meters for a given 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:14.379
 consumption pattern that is shown by playing red 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:19.349
 Foods of animal origin place a very large burden on lowlands 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.859
 m what other foods such as drinks beer my coffee 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.979
 turn off a very large burden on the customer 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.979
 that is something that usually does not realize that way 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.169
 new boats are being filled with 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:38.229
 please this way so not approved 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.529
 you would not want to say so 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:45.219
 but according to the jury, it is the intention of the Beauvoir to include 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:47.499
 revealed that the legend top 40 some 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:49.629
 after a few containers not to a gig 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.569
 that made this morning the indian is still the tube except that they do other things 

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:55.729
 are called 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.180
 for example more macaroni and travels than its hijacking 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.730
 There are also many more things that you can eat for which you have energy 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.520
 Need 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.539
 if you look around the supermarket there must be lots packed 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.419
 get products 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:15.419
 products come from all over the world 

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.639
 and it can always be built in the arm, so people often don't even have it anymore 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.579
 know if they eat lots of seasonal vegetables or not to keep the door 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.249
 I have beaten 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:30.309
 click here 

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:33.309
 harderwijk 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.439
 beyond 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.699
 I try to clean the lawnmower more often 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:43.289
 that is the reality 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.080
 this season is 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.349
 me too 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.789
 9 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 I'm so beat you 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.710
 when buying food you could also be called what 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.289
 you buy exactly 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:04.979
 tunis not too many buyers so you don't have to throw away too much or that 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.080
 is immediately pure profit 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.499
 there is a lot to be able to see to it that you do not already buy too much food 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.619
 that this works are typical coffee break 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:19.439
 that room can also pay attention that you do not too often copy food from 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:20.860
 have come away 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.810
 the red devils were potatoes and encountered in lock for 24 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.389
 messages in the hall 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:30.259
 circumstances 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:33.259
 A good diet is an important role can alternate nutrition important 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.669
 it costs something but then you also have something 

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:39.210
 and all this a contraction of GDP 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.719
 then you notice a fall 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:43.849
 to eat her actions and some goodies 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.449
 in the first place, food must of course always be healthy 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.729
 emmen 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:52.729
 And of course you can also think about it 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:54.719
 things like that
