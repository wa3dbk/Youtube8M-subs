said now I'm going to readjust my

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.520 
said now I'm going to readjust my
technology<00:03:17.780> tree<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.739> I<00:03:18.769> can<00:03:20.530> more

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
technology tree so I can more

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.890 
technology tree so I can more
efficiently<00:03:21.769> do<00:03:22.190> research<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.510> go<00:03:23.690> ahead

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
efficiently do research and I go ahead

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.710 
efficiently do research and I go ahead
and<00:03:24.370> move<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.550> Espionage<00:03:26.150> all<00:03:26.330> the<00:03:26.450> way<00:03:26.540> down

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
and move the Espionage all the way down

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.100 
and move the Espionage all the way down
2.2<00:03:27.470> for<00:03:27.920> it<00:03:28.070> seems<00:03:28.310> reasonable<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.930> got<00:03:30.080> a

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
2.2 for it seems reasonable and I got a

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.020 
2.2 for it seems reasonable and I got a
lot<00:03:30.260> of<00:03:30.290> extra<00:03:30.680> research<00:03:31.010> that<00:03:31.370> can<00:03:31.519> do<00:03:31.730> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
lot of extra research that can do and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.120 
lot of extra research that can do and
i'm<00:03:32.239> going<00:03:32.360> to<00:03:32.420> start<00:03:32.630> it<00:03:32.750> off<00:03:32.870> with<00:03:33.130> doing

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
i'm going to start it off with doing

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.020 
i'm going to start it off with doing
some<00:03:34.310> infantry<00:03:34.790> research<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:36.580> little<00:03:37.580> bit<00:03:37.880> of

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
without question some air research here

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:56.410 
without question some air research here
a<00:03:49.269> little<00:03:50.269> bit<00:03:50.420> of<00:03:50.540> bombers

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.450 

and<00:03:57.420> yell<00:03:57.990> I'll<00:03:58.440> do<00:03:58.650> agriculture<00:03:59.070> because

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
and yell I'll do agriculture because

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.320 
and yell I'll do agriculture because
manpower<00:03:59.910> is<00:04:00.090> always<00:04:00.360> helpful<00:04:05.150> little<00:04:06.150> bit<00:04:06.240> of

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
manpower is always helpful little bit of

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:27.490 
manpower is always helpful little bit of
land<00:04:06.570> research

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.500 

okay<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:30.200> what<00:04:30.350> about<00:04:30.580> does<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.790> technology

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
okay so what about does the technology

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.330 
okay so what about does the technology
tree<00:04:32.780> I<00:04:32.960> like<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.620> build<00:04:33.920> a<00:04:34.100> lot<00:04:34.250> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
tree I like to build a lot of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.330 
tree I like to build a lot of
anti-aircraft<00:04:34.880> guns<00:04:35.540> as<00:04:35.780> I<00:04:36.020> as<00:04:36.650> I<00:04:36.770> play<00:04:37.040> here

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
anti-aircraft guns as I as I play here

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.670 
anti-aircraft guns as I as I play here
because<00:04:37.670> definitely<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.900> will<00:04:38.930> find<00:04:39.410> that

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
because definitely you will find that

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.880 
because definitely you will find that
the<00:04:39.980> British<00:04:40.550> AI<00:04:40.730> and<00:04:41.120> ice<00:04:41.840> mod<00:04:42.170> is<00:04:42.350> more<00:04:42.710> than

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
the British AI and ice mod is more than

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.100 
the British AI and ice mod is more than
capable<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:44.320> sending<00:04:45.320> a<00:04:45.620> lot<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:47.110> strategic

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
capable of sending a lot of strategic

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.100 
capable of sending a lot of strategic
bombers<00:04:48.500> in<00:04:48.620> your<00:04:48.800> direction<00:04:48.950> so<00:04:49.960> gotta<00:04:50.960> have

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
a lot of anti-aircraft guns help out

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.760 
a lot of anti-aircraft guns help out
your<00:04:52.820> fighters<00:04:53.240> I'm<00:04:54.110> going<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.290> go<00:04:54.410> ahead<00:04:54.440> and
