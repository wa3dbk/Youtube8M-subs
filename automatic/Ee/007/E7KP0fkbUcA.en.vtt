00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
zoom in and start the nose so just a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.470 
zoom in and start the nose so just a
couple<00:01:24.040> things<00:01:24.220> right<00:01:24.640> off<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.030> I'm<00:01:25.150> seeing

makes the difference logo along the side
this<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.819> our<00:02:16.060> house<00:02:16.209> color<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.230> guess<00:02:17.739> partial

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
this is our house color I guess partial

this is our house color I guess partial
of<00:02:18.370> carbon<00:02:18.760> library<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.410> check<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.400> tail

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
of carbon library and check out the tail

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.510 
of carbon library and check out the tail
there

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
there

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.900 
there
get<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.120> camera<00:02:23.510> focus<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:25.370> pretty<00:02:25.580> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
get the camera focus that's pretty just

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.440 
get the camera focus that's pretty just
pretty<00:02:26.420> overall<00:02:26.900> nice<00:02:27.410> model<00:02:28.150> now<00:02:29.150> another

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
pretty overall nice model now another

pretty overall nice model now another
thing<00:02:29.750> I'm<00:02:30.050> going<00:02:30.260> to<00:02:30.320> paint<00:02:30.740> this<00:02:30.860> camera

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
thing I'm going to paint this camera

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.680 
thing I'm going to paint this camera
back<00:02:31.280> real<00:02:31.550> quick<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:31.940> I'll<00:02:32.030> get<00:02:32.180> a<00:02:32.210> top<00:02:32.420> shot

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
back real quick and I'll get a top shot

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.140 
back real quick and I'll get a top shot
for<00:02:32.930> y'all<00:02:33.080> but<00:02:33.410> bear<00:02:34.340> in<00:02:34.370> mind<00:02:34.490> how<00:02:34.820> small

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
for y'all but bear in mind how small

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:41.280 
for y'all but bear in mind how small
this<00:02:35.330> is<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.530> got<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:37.130> two<00:02:39.370> three

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
this is so you got one two three

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.050 
this is so you got one two three
antennas<00:02:42.290> not<00:02:42.920> counting<00:02:43.550> they<00:02:43.670> even

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
antennas not counting they even

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.790 
antennas not counting they even
simulated<00:02:44.810> and<00:02:44.990> I'm<00:02:45.080> I<00:02:45.320> don't<00:02:45.530> know<00:02:45.680> if<00:02:45.740> these

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
simulated and I'm I don't know if these

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.590 
simulated and I'm I don't know if these
are<00:02:45.890> Wi-Fi<00:02:46.340> antenna<00:02:46.730> two<00:02:46.880> sat-nav<00:02:47.150> or

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
are Wi-Fi antenna two sat-nav or

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.210 
are Wi-Fi antenna two sat-nav or
what-have-you<00:02:47.750> but<00:02:48.230> they've<00:02:48.650> even<00:02:48.800> got<00:02:49.010> that

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
what-have-you but they've even got that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.080 
what-have-you but they've even got that
on<00:02:49.460> top

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
on top

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.890 
on top
so<00:02:50.740> again<00:02:51.740> just<00:02:52.010> overall<00:02:52.880> first<00:02:53.270> impressions

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
so again just overall first impressions

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.220 
so again just overall first impressions
of<00:02:53.960> this<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.890> model<00:02:55.370> I'm<00:02:55.720> pretty<00:02:56.720> impressed

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
of this this model I'm pretty impressed

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.830 
of this this model I'm pretty impressed
so<00:02:57.710> let's<00:02:58.400> get<00:02:58.550> this<00:02:58.760> turned<00:02:59.090> around<00:02:59.240> get<00:02:59.750> to

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
so let's get this turned around get to

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.320 
so let's get this turned around get to
the<00:02:59.900> other<00:03:00.050> side<00:03:00.460> make<00:03:01.460> sure<00:03:01.520> I<00:03:01.760> got<00:03:01.940> this<00:03:02.090> in<00:03:02.300> a

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
the other side make sure I got this in a

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.200 
the other side make sure I got this in a
camera<00:03:02.900> view<00:03:03.080> here<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:04.520> we<00:03:04.850> do<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.090> same

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:05.210 
camera view here and we do the same

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.710 
camera view here and we do the same
thing<00:03:05.510> start<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.990> nose<00:03:07.210> actually<00:03:08.210> stand<00:03:08.570> by

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
thing start the nose actually stand by

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.300 
thing start the nose actually stand by
guys<00:03:08.900> let<00:03:09.110> me<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.200> get<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:09.620> camera<00:03:10.040> alright

sorry<00:03:10.640> about<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.820> this<00:03:11.090> should<00:03:11.270> work<00:03:11.390> out<00:03:11.570> a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
sorry about that this should work out a

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.600 
sorry about that this should work out a
little<00:03:12.080> bit<00:03:12.440> better<00:03:12.620> hopefully<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:15.460> here<00:03:16.460> you

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
go just kind of along the opposite side

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.540 
go just kind of along the opposite side
here<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.290> see<00:03:21.500> some<00:03:21.650> of<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:21.830> fan<00:03:22.070> detail

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
here you see some of the fan detail

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.330 
here you see some of the fan detail
there<00:03:22.850> see<00:03:23.810> those<00:03:23.960> antennas<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:24.770> yes<00:03:25.100> there

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
there see those antennas and yes there

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.160 
there see those antennas and yes there
is<00:03:25.490> actually<00:03:25.880> antennas<00:03:26.480> on<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.690> bottom<00:03:27.020> as

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
is actually antennas on the bottom as

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.270 
is actually antennas on the bottom as
well<00:03:29.110> around<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.260> world<00:03:30.470> saying<00:03:30.980> back

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
well around the world saying back

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.140 
well around the world saying back
towards<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.030> tail<00:03:32.210> the<00:03:32.630> registration<00:03:33.260> number

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
towards the tail the registration number

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.110 
towards the tail the registration number
and<00:03:35.150> ending<00:03:35.750> again<00:03:35.840> in<00:03:36.230> the<00:03:36.460> carbon<00:03:37.460> library

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
and ending again in the carbon library

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.330 
and ending again in the carbon library
on<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.270> tail<00:03:38.570> there<00:03:39.040> another<00:03:40.040> cool<00:03:40.550> thing

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
on the tail there another cool thing

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.160 
on the tail there another cool thing
I'll<00:03:43.340> see<00:03:43.820> if<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.090> get<00:03:44.210> this<00:03:44.360> camera<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:44.840> pick<00:03:45.050> it

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
I'll see if I get this camera to pick it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.170 
I'll see if I get this camera to pick it
up<00:03:45.290> here<00:03:45.560> or<00:03:45.680> not<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:48.380> actually<00:03:48.500> got<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:49.180> a350

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
up here or not to actually got the a350

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.740 
up here or not to actually got the a350
on<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.750> wing<00:03:51.230> look<00:03:51.440> they're<00:03:51.680> on<00:03:51.920> both<00:03:52.130> sides

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
on the wing look they're on both sides

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.440 
on the wing look they're on both sides
so<00:03:53.750> you<00:03:53.780> can<00:03:53.930> kind<00:03:54.380> of<00:03:54.470> see<00:03:54.680> it<00:03:55.300> made<00:03:56.300> out

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
so you can kind of see it made out

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.450 
so you can kind of see it made out
across<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:57.080> way<00:03:57.230> over<00:03:57.590> here<00:03:57.800> on<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.010> opposite

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
across the way over here on the opposite

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.120 
across the way over here on the opposite
wing<00:03:58.670> but<00:03:59.200> that's<00:04:00.340> pretty<00:04:01.340> neat<00:04:01.580> detail<00:04:02.030> there

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
wing but that's pretty neat detail there

but uh antenna got like what's a little
bit<00:04:53.860> of<00:04:53.949> a<00:04:54.010> beacon<00:04:54.310> detail<00:04:54.729> there<00:04:54.940> for<00:04:55.240> right

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
bit of a beacon detail there for right

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.490 
bit of a beacon detail there for right
next<00:04:55.930> to<00:04:56.370> they<00:04:57.370> got<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.639> a350<00:04:58.120> X<00:04:58.720> log<00:04:59.050> on<00:04:59.229> the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
next to they got the a350 X log on the

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.520 
next to they got the a350 X log on the
bottom<00:04:59.889> but<00:05:00.040> actually<00:05:00.400> in<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:00.850> zero<00:05:01.720> at<00:05:01.990> 350

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
bottom but actually in the zero at 350

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.530 
bottom but actually in the zero at 350
would<00:05:02.710> be<00:05:02.860> for<00:05:03.400> a<00:05:03.430> stand<00:05:03.790> this<00:05:04.090> did<00:05:04.330> not<00:05:04.479> come

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:04.540 
would be for a stand this did not come

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.890 
would be for a stand this did not come
with<00:05:04.960> a<00:05:04.990> stand<00:05:06.240> you<00:05:07.240> can<00:05:07.389> see<00:05:07.539> some<00:05:07.720> more

with a stand you can see some more

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.659 
with a stand you can see some more
detail<00:05:08.289> along<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.590> bottom<00:05:10.979> and<00:05:11.979> see<00:05:12.520> if<00:05:12.580> we

detail along the bottom and see if we

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.870 
detail along the bottom and see if we
can<00:05:12.789> just<00:05:12.910> turn<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.330> up<00:05:14.010> its<00:05:15.010> nose<00:05:15.250> this<00:05:15.639> way

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880
