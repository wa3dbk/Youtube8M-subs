probably the most efficient way of
getting<00:02:30.280> fell<00:02:30.519> blight<00:02:30.760> is<00:02:30.939> because<00:02:31.629> of<00:02:31.750> the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
getting fell blight is because of the

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.670 
getting fell blight is because of the
simple<00:02:32.109> fact<00:02:32.349> of<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:33.819> have<00:02:34.569> an<00:02:35.049> enormous
