00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
techniques

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.250 
techniques
PNF<00:00:16.949> which<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> proprioceptive

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
PNF which is proprioceptive

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.750 
PNF which is proprioceptive
neuromuscular<00:00:19.260> facilitation<00:00:19.650> which<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.730> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
neuromuscular facilitation which is a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.870 
neuromuscular facilitation which is a
contract<00:00:21.660> relaxed<00:00:22.080> technique<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.880> static

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
contract relaxed technique and static

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.750 
contract relaxed technique and static
stretch<00:00:25.010> always<00:00:26.010> make<00:00:26.189> sure<00:00:26.220> when<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.609> do

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
stretch always make sure when you do

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.640 
stretch always make sure when you do
stretching<00:00:27.240> that<00:00:27.420> you<00:00:27.570> warmed<00:00:27.869> up<00:00:27.960> before<00:00:28.109> you

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
stretching that you warmed up before you

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.890 
stretching that you warmed up before you
want<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.859> raise<00:00:29.070> your<00:00:29.550> body<00:00:29.730> temperature<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.510> a

want to raise your body temperature to a
little<00:00:31.170> sweaty

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.740 

we'll<00:00:34.530> start<00:00:34.769> with<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.100> PNF<00:00:35.489> stretching<00:00:35.750> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
we'll start with the PNF stretching you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.689 
we'll start with the PNF stretching you
want<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.019> contract<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> relax<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.370> muscle<00:00:38.670> I

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
want to contract and relax the muscle I

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:41.000 
want to contract and relax the muscle I
want<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.120> stretched<00:00:39.449> when<00:00:40.410> contracting

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
want to be stretched when contracting

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.540 
want to be stretched when contracting
the<00:00:41.100> muscle

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the muscle

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
the muscle
you<00:00:41.640> don't<00:00:41.820> need<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.059> extreme<00:00:42.930> contraction

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
you don't need an extreme contraction

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.770 
you don't need an extreme contraction
just<00:00:43.980> want<00:00:44.159> a<00:00:44.250> slight<00:00:44.550> contraction<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.210> then

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
just want a slight contraction and then

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.619 
just want a slight contraction and then
you<00:00:45.930> realize<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.250> PNF<00:00:47.610> stretching<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
you realize so for PNF stretching for

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.079 
you realize so for PNF stretching for
the<00:00:48.809> quad<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.949> just<00:00:50.159> rest<00:00:50.399> your<00:00:50.489> foot<00:00:50.790> on<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.089 
the quad you just rest your foot on the

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.139 
the quad you just rest your foot on the
ball<00:00:51.440> this<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> start<00:00:52.949> position<00:00:53.070> if<00:00:53.879> it's

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
ball this is the start position if it's

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.509 
ball this is the start position if it's
much<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.659> a<00:00:54.690> stretch<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.559> move<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.370> knee

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
much of a stretch just move you knee

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.639 
much of a stretch just move you knee
forward<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.930> need<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.110> bigger<00:00:58.290> stretch

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
forward if you need a bigger stretch

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.069 
forward if you need a bigger stretch
then<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> bring<00:00:59.579> your<00:00:59.640> knee<00:00:59.850> back<00:00:59.930> you<00:01:00.930> want

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
then you bring your knee back you want

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.959 
then you bring your knee back you want
to<00:01:01.140> push<00:01:01.469> down<00:01:01.500> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.339> wall<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.760> five

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to push down on the wall for five

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.840 
to push down on the wall for five
seconds<00:01:03.299> as<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> inhale<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.170> then<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.369> excel

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
seconds as you inhale and then you excel

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.999 
seconds as you inhale and then you excel
for<00:01:06.179> five<00:01:06.420> seconds<00:01:06.899> if<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.800> want<00:01:07.920> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
slight contraction to activate the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.570 
slight contraction to activate the
muscle<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.880> push<00:01:12.979> straight<00:01:13.979> position<00:01:14.280> with

next muscle will be stretching is the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.999 
next muscle will be stretching is the
hamstring<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:05.420> foot<00:02:05.600> forward<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.200> your<00:02:06.770> heel

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
hamstring one foot forward on your heel

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.660 
hamstring one foot forward on your heel
and<00:02:08.170> you<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.619> select<00:02:10.039> it<00:02:10.369> then<00:02:10.550> you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
and you want to just select it then you

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.710 
and you want to just select it then you
need<00:02:10.849> and<00:02:11.530> move<00:02:12.530> forward<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.480> think<00:02:14.480> about
