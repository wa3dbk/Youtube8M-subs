and then I was thinking of maybe that
like<00:02:58.070> obviously<00:02:58.520> I'm<00:02:58.730> not<00:02:58.760> sure<00:02:59.060> when<00:02:59.210> I'm

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
like obviously I'm not sure when I'm

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.880 
like obviously I'm not sure when I'm
going<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.570> time<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.810> do<00:03:00.050> this<00:03:00.200> this<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.620> all

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
going to get time to do this this is all

going to get time to do this this is all
I'm<00:03:01.160> very<00:03:02.230> far<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.380> future<00:03:03.710> maybe<00:03:04.580> sort<00:03:05.540> of

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
I'm very far in the future maybe sort of

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.840 
I'm very far in the future maybe sort of
sooner<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.830> don't<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.400> what<00:03:07.580> it's<00:03:07.700> going<00:03:07.790> to
