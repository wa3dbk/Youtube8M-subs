00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:07.400
 hello celine hello angel also 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.990
 this is the team's star 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.700
 céline atlante a record of 15 victories 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.590
 8 defeats still very largely in 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.740
 head of the conference is but three 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.770
 consecutive losses to these raging 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.080
 perhaps in what state of mind is 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.400
 find is the team while one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.030
 gently approach play-offs 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.920
 yes, but here are these three defeats 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.360
 consecutive as you said 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.360
 it's not and it's not always easy 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.829
 we had the break that made that that's it 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.589
 really does 2 after this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.480
 small cut so we try to stay 

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.179
 concentrated one is not in the army by 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.829
 fauré what was happening still nothing 11 

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.440
 matches we forget if before 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 play-offs so here again the time of 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.119
 to reverse a little bit this bad series 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.059
 and here we aim to be the 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:55.589
 better placed we can go here tried 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.159
 to stay at this first phase of 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.869
 conferences to have play-offs 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.030
 with the advantage of an all that so we 

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:04.439
 try here to chain the image 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.850
 try to spend a little bit I'm 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.640
 the defeats and that's to see that what 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.289
 has been advanced 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 continue it's still long so we know 

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:15.299
 that the team experienced a blow of fate 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.829
 quite recently with the absence of your 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.049
 coach michael cooper the former teammate 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:21.929
 from magic to the lakers in the 80s 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.670
 did it have an impact on the 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:25.670
 group and about the results lately 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.210
 we learn the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.619
 these are the health problems of contacts 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.200
 which is close to us and it is true that 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.539
 his absence is felt in here 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.430
 in all that touches who knows so 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:42.960
 his job is coach and so it's true 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.909
 that the assistants are here to take 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.899
 relay they do it very well I 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.789
 do not know if it's the defeats without due to 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.110
 the absence of the coach but in any case I 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.240
 think that if we met teams 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.950
 this is the thaci minister even if after 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 eleven defeats after two extra time 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.970
 it's still not a bad result 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.970
 the one from two days ago that was it 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:08.000
 a little annoying but it's sport 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.160
 must do with 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.320
 and you know when he will come back within 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.270
 of the team have not yet 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.530
 date of agreement and so on the plane 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.060
 staff were now 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.390
 encountered a little less than two 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.710
 month 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.960
 this is a game time now that 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.480
 oscillates around 20 minutes 20 25 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.600
 minutes in general lan how is this 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.310
 that you get used to the game w nba you have 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.520
 beat still falls points recently 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.209
 face against chicago with 10 points 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.130
 a few words a few words on it 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.870
 no yes I take what there is to take 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.740
 it is true that my state of mind has not 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.040
 changed from 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.079
 from my beginning there is 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.909
 this is the best match that 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.069
 these two days except that I play little 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.329
 almost two or three minutes in first 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.459
 half time and I find you at 110 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:53.519
 inhabitants so it's very fluctuating and 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.250
 it's different from what I have 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.659
 the habit of living in France is 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.189
 interesting enough for me to adapt 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.659
 and stay in the match while I 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.140
 am not a lot when I had a lot 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.359
 suddenly 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.409
 so it's things like that who has who 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.180
 are different and on which he 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.189
 must I adapt and here I try 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.659
 to bring what I can when I'm 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.359
 on the ground and when I'm not on 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.069
 the terrain I try to stay is so 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.069
 defeated had also told us that this 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.900
 experience in wmv been as much a 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.650
 human experience discover a new 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.790
 championship as a sports project 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.579
 now after two months 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.470
 in the united states how is life 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:33.150
 atlanta super there is a lot of 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.099
 things very well on the basketball plan but 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.019
 there are also a lot of things that 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.150
 are great outside and here I am 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.129
 many visits from my family of my 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.220
 friends I discover more and more the one 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.180
 from Atlanta who sees there are plenty of 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.060
 lots of things to discover so 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.099
 really c 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.770
 mekla in my experience again and 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:53.090
 again and again is this so there and 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.410
 when you're on a road trip is this 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.489
 you've also had time small 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.140
 little to discover the cities 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.790
 Is there anything that has made you 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.010
 name every time it's true that as soon 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.440
 that we move we usually arrive in 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.630
 mid afternoon and I pass my end 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.500
 afternoon early evening to visit 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.010
 a little bit of what's in the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.750
 surroundings 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.030
 in general we are well placed in 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.160
 town centers like that so here I have 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.010
 every time discovered cities that 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.450
 I may have never seen so here 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.519
 announced I have nothing that marks me in 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.590
 particular at the same time there is everything that 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.210
 see there whenever I am 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.630
 part I am always impressed by 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.370
 a veil 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.360
 what is the difference also when you 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:33.650
 go to san antonio that you validate to dakar 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.760
 is a particular city that gave you the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:43.280
 more amazed or the most surprised 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.460
 maybe I knew new york 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.660
 will be more then after the room 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.920
 madison square garden this is the hour 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.320
 basketball mecca 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:58.520
 but the same no no there is no instant 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.080
 okay just have a word so you come from 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.820
 mention the madison square garden at 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.530
 level of infrastructure compared to 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:18.400
 what do you know about 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:18.400
 appearance at georgia tech university 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.330
 the hall of the university that 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.280
 he quoted 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.930
 a prettier than all our rooms in 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.419
 France brings together acea 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.840
 that's just for that I saw what 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.039
 that's chasing after a balloon this 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.009
 kind does not have a culture it's rather 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:39.550
 rather agree another world another 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.449
 when we look and we played in the morning 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.520
 women in a morning 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:44.949
 the room was full there were sixteen 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.539
 a thousand kids inside 1 that was 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.669
 just amazing there was a noise 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:50.710
 possible and here you see all these 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.879
 kids with their t-shirts and that's it 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.289
 it's something that we in France 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.969
 we do not usually do 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.229
 not this culture like that become and to 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.530
 that's it's no it's really another 

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.289
 world
