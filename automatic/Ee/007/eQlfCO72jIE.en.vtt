00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:16.209
 There is no problem if the project is in progress 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:24.840
 However, if it becomes abnormal condition, problems with quality and cost delivery will come out immediately 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:30.050
 There are various causes that cause an abnormal condition, but change is the biggest cause among them . 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:36.170
 Project management is constantly changing 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:37.280
 You must manage this change to maintain the project in good condition. 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.520
 Hmm 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:48.260
 Managing this change is called change point management 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:52.360
 Let's consider what changes are occurring in the project 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.450
 There are two major changes that occur in the project 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.070
 4 m of 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:59.760
 This design change whether 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:05.300
 Change of 4 reading is resource 1 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:12.590
 Equipment and system methods are things and content change 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:14.850
 A design change is a change that is related to the basis of a project by literally changing the design 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.920
 There are many things 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.900
 There is one more requirement change 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:29.690
 It is a change of the demand from the customer and the management side 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:33.230
 This change will be reflected have change of 4 m of change design 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:38.540
 Change point management for change of 4 reading 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:41.780
 Make a management plan of change points and visualize daily changes 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 Identification management for design changes 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.650
 It performs a synthetic management換低level management 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.650
 Restore abnormal state of project to normal state 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:59.049
 Let's organize a little more about change 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.630
 Change in work is a resource for work 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:08.929
 It is easy to organize by dividing it into 4 m 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:16.510
 Changes in resources will affect many aspects of project activities 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:22.250
 Conversely, managing changes in the resource 4 read will minimize the impact 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.090
 Let's consider one by one the changes read 4 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.400
 I first m Hama 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 It is a person 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:37.340
 For example, if people are replaced or newcomers come in, the difference in human skills changes 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.550
 The average skill as a team also changes 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.710
 It also falls on the awareness and experience of work 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.770
 Both will change with the turnover of people 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:53.270
 Work output will change as people's skills and commanding experience change. 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.920
 Next is the machine 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:01.870
 Equipment and systems 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:07.069
 Equipment has a big difference in the ability by the introduction time 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:13.880
 Also, with the passage of time, it will come out and sink 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:16.990
 Difference in individual ability and Tinkatsu chink greatly affect the ability to perform work 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.660
 Method is that of methods and procedures 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:25.370
 Methods and standards are also technological advances 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:31.530
 It becomes obsolete and changes due to environmental changes 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:37.380
 Also , depending on the technology background and people who use the industry, Jae Jun will vary. 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:40.140
 Also it changes the productivity and quality of work if Kaware a way Ya only Jun 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.100
 The last is losing real 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.550
 It is the product and the current line content 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:52.240
 Such as products and raw materials has its own path in August 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:58.640
 It also degrades with time 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:05.880
 Variations and deterioration greatly affect work output 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:12.870
 In this way, if you live in a world where work is ideal, it will greatly affect work if it changes 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:19.660
 You need to detect and deal with 4 u 6 changes to minimize the impact 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:26.290
 Let's explain how to manage this 4 m change point 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:27.640
 Consider the management plan for the change of 4 Read that can occur is Waseda-Keio in the project 5 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.350
 There are tools to crawl 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:37.760
 It is 4 reading change point management examination sheet 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:43.610
 Use this sheet to manage the change to read that put the project activities in m 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:45.889
 First, expect the change point of the m as that put in the project of the system and work 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.189
 Make me a mouth 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:51.090
 Consider the worries about change 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:58.380
 Wash out 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:05:05.480
 We will clarify measures that lead to major problems among the worry points and plan their countermeasures 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:12.200
 Implement measures and standardize rules and structure so that effects will continue 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:15.700
 I think that it will occur in the above procedure I will identify the change of the name and take measures in advance 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.700
 Make sure there is no impact
