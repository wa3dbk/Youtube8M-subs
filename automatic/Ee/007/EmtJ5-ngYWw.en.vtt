dark world to take some direct attacks

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.550 
dark world to take some direct attacks
but<00:04:13.819> then<00:04:14.030> drop<00:04:14.239> a<00:04:14.269> 3k<00:04:14.750> beater<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.109> just<00:04:15.349> beat

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
but then drop a 3k beater and just beat

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.810 
but then drop a 3k beater and just beat
over<00:04:15.829> whatever<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.190> hell<00:04:16.310> your<00:04:16.459> opponent

the<00:04:19.250> cards<00:04:19.549> that<00:04:19.609> he<00:04:19.760> needs<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.329> I<00:04:20.419> think<00:04:20.630> that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.870 
the cards that he needs and I think that
it<00:04:20.840> was<00:04:20.900> pretty<00:04:21.109> smart<00:04:21.470> to<00:04:22.039> run<00:04:22.220> a<00:04:22.280> 3<00:04:22.669> copies

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
it was pretty smart to run a 3 copies

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.270 
it was pretty smart to run a 3 copies
not<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.360> mention<00:04:23.750> it's<00:04:24.289> a<00:04:24.380> machine<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.039> with
