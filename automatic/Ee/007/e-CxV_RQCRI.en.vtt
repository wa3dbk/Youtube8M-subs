certain piece of information until later
when<00:00:49.260> they're<00:00:49.440> more<00:00:49.620> traumatic<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.579> some

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
when they're more traumatic but some

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.760 
when they're more traumatic but some
things<00:00:51.120> just<00:00:51.239> don't<00:00:51.449> make<00:00:51.690> sense<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:52.410> not<00:00:52.530> be

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
things just don't make sense to not be

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.000 
things just don't make sense to not be
revealed<00:00:53.129> like<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.969> did<00:00:54.289> Sirius<00:00:55.289> Black<00:00:55.469> being
