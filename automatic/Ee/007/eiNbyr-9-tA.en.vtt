00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.779
 cycle is for you a format 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.599
 different from glitter everything you go 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.489
 need is described in waste and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.170
 to learn as a tape only one 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.850
 and then I will continue to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.559
 makeup I once did on the eyebrow in a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.620
 another video you can follow 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.950
 by link floor here and I'm going to use what 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 you most of the time of 2013 that is the glitter 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.239
 stature who says that this berenice 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 arrived here at home was a gift from 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.980
 shop and it was really cool and with whoever wanted it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.289
 various mold and authentic constitution 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.829
 Little star has this one of fiuk is very 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.760
 cool, I think I'm going to do it today. 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:07.830
 butterfly is decorated with decoration 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.630
 and what is it that will make armadillos 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.540
 glitter can be a face can be a 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.430
 What I'm going to do is what 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.650
 right here because it was most of the time I 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 I found where the dick is where it goes 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.960
 stay the act of bingo 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.909
 The kit here times it has the glue that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.189
 This set this cool thing that you 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.100
 test before because I had the same 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.329
 reaction is to her that I have as latex the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.040
 latex is one thing you can use 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.950
 for makeup but some people 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.689
 look for allergy so it's cool you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.939
 test before to see I do not know if this 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.860
 glue and pencil looks but I do not have 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.270
 How to state that it's good for you to test only if 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.549
 you will not have energy and the energy of the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.299
 latex she shows up at the time of going here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.370
 and is not red have no allergy and 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.270
 also comes with four 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.740
 then in 12 we have the green or pink the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.130
 yellow river 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.020
 so the first one we'll start 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.410
 removing the purple part that we want 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 others do not cut me out 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.399
 Only then will we start the first one. 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.390
 removing the plastic from above that is 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.180
 type a protective layer or else pull 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.840
 here you will take it as soon as the 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.090
 transparent plastic will 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.090
 education with this yellow and purple business 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:28.290
 and then you will take the purple from within 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.000
 it will draw and will form the drawing and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.590
 one has to be very careful to remove 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.790
 because it has a partidinhas staying 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.250
 within the law 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.980
 if you 're careful not to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.490
 ends up tearing is something the sticker is not 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.070
 the strada legal and there he will stay 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.410
 so this part here yellows and goes 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.650
 take off carefully also leave 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.510
 whole and that's what you'll stick on 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.510
 Your face, then I'll put 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.810
 The protocol is that we ask ourselves and 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.690
 without much scolari in the face because 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.900
 otherwise it will not work, it will last 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.060
 more on your face if you make a face 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.950
 without makeup but I'm based and I 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.200
 I applied a little blush then 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.970
 changes a little more durability but 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.290
 You do not have to be afraid that this glue 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.270
 She'll last forever after she goes. 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.730
 get money for you and I 'll use it 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.620
 these three military men here for doing 1 of 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.770
 and also because the word of the day 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.540
 It's gradient and then I'm going to make the glue 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.670
 I'm applying a little glue and a 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.440
 little of me because they have the glue dries 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.840
 at dawn no more glue 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:41.200
 So I 'll pick it up and I'll put a 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.880
 little on the finger fault and then I go the state 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.580
 can not apply a very thick layer 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.680
 takes off because otherwise it did not look pretty 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.410
 This is where the purple is gonna go. 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.660
 pick up rochel put some on the lid 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.030
 I woke up from the same and rolling 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.790
 little ass and here the more beautiful you 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.160
 make coolest tattoo will get 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.880
 if you apply kofu it gets very ugly 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:08.250
 so that's all my time is doing with 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:11.680
 Calm down and slow down. 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.600
 and you take it easy and look beautiful, right? 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.280
 and now I'm going to work with a little bit of 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.560
 pink a little purple to create a 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.810
 step to get some of the glue where it goes 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.120
 be the gradient where the rose will pass 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:29.370
 I'll get some purple put 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:33.630
 but not very good and now I'll get a 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 little pink color from the bottom up 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.280
 concentrates more below and above 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.400
 - What I did the face from above to 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.400
 low 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.250
 and now we're going to put the 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.470
 rest that will be integrated of the rose 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.900
 golden and I'll get some of the school 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.410
 same model and two other times in the 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:10.319
 applied I 'll start by taking a 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:10.319
 pink little bit and now the golden 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.429
 Hence when finished here was one 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:26.199
 place in the line goes to school and I'm only 

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:27.699
 The same beast we did in the beginning when 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:33.429
 I finish if you think it's good for us 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:35.439
 take care carefully there look some 

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:38.319
 places that stayed the end you just 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:41.319
 waiting to dry it will not rise 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.179
 Service is pencil but I think it's then 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:44.889
 treating it as if it were the latex and 

00:05:43.179 --> 00:05:47.169
 transparent not to worry about 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.299
 it says here that says she berenice 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.789
 lasts all day you can so you 

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:54.519
 can literally skip the carnival by 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:56.469
 Blocks just take rain just as hell. 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.329
 roll in the mud you drink does not get 

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:00.119
 his face as they tried to pass the 

00:05:58.329 --> 00:06:02.739
 soap scrub with sponge will come out 

00:06:00.119 --> 00:06:04.629
 I know and you'll have to go through 

00:06:02.739 --> 00:06:05.499
 water-based make-up remover to remove 

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:07.269
 this from here 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:09.309
 or else you'll be rubbing like this 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:11.529
 they ended up beating your face, it's not 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:13.449
 cool , this tattoo is so cool 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.219
 will not fail to pay for the face 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.529
 also explained exactly how 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:19.449
 I did what had to be public he 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.119
 will not leave here year 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.709
 You can pass the hand and it does not go out and 

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.329
 You can use the bags to whom 

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:26.889
 also said to do because 

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:29.139
 Glitter eyeliner I made here in the 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.449
 channel the other day was really cool too 

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:32.889
 Very easy people came and I hope you 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.439
 have enjoyed available in any 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:37.599
 part of the body that you do what 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.039
 It was very cool and I highly recommend it. 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.679
 Now you know how to do the eyebrow 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.619
 And the tattoo on Friday, you go. 

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:46.719
 learning how to make a lip is integral 

00:06:44.619 --> 00:06:49.509
 I think super beautiful superfine you 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.969
 can be used not only at carnival but 

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:53.829
 one thing is more subtle little is 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:55.029
 Can you use it on a day-to-day basis? 

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:57.549
 one color only 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:07:00.669
 but heals how to get around a bit 

00:06:57.549 --> 00:07:02.889
 clearer is in the center of the mouth gives 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:06.329
 difference then accompanies us in the 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.329
 Friday to learn computing
