Smith's the one thing you do have that
that's<00:00:30.900> going<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that's going for you is you can see the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.180 
that's going for you is you can see the
ramp<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.719> you're<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.559> getting<00:00:34.680> into<00:00:34.950> it

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
ramp so as you're you're getting into it

you're locking locking and I think is a
little<00:00:36.899> bit<00:00:37.050> harder<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.410> back<00:00:37.710> like<00:00:37.920> there's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
little bit harder for back like there's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
little bit harder for back like there's
a<00:00:38.160> lot<00:00:38.730> more<00:00:38.940> people<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.570> frontside

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
a lot more people that can do frontside

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
where you're going your positioning of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
where you're going your positioning of

it's kind of harder to push because of

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's kind of harder to push because of
the<00:01:00.629> way<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:00.870> body<00:01:00.989> has<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.530> be<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:01.920> it's<00:01:02.460> not

as scary once you learn it because you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.710 
as scary once you learn it because you
can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.549> ramp

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590 

alright<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.560> backside<00:01:11.370> Smith's<00:01:11.700> for<00:01:12.210> me<00:01:12.330> when

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.850 
I learned them it was really hard for me
to<00:01:15.930> still<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:18.260> to<00:01:19.260> do<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.500> same<00:01:19.680> thing

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to still kind of is to do the same thing

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.770 
to still kind of is to do the same thing
with<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.010> front<00:01:20.130> Smith<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.550> far<00:01:20.760> as<00:01:20.940> carving

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
with the front Smith as far as carving

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.720 
with the front Smith as far as carving
into<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.200> it's<00:01:22.740> kind<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.280> bit<00:01:23.400> easier

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
into it it's kind of a little bit easier

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.850 
into it it's kind of a little bit easier
for<00:01:24.030> some<00:01:24.180> reason<00:01:24.450> just<00:01:24.480> backside<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.740> up

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600 
for some reason just backside going up
into<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.550> little<00:01:27.480> bit<00:01:27.720> straighter<00:01:28.550> so<00:01:29.550> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
into it a little bit straighter so you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.370 
into it a little bit straighter so you
come<00:01:29.820> up<00:01:29.850> same<00:01:30.450> kind<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.810> thing<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.110> little<00:01:31.200> bit

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
