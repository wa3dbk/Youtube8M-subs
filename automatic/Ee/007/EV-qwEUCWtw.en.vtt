you<00:00:11.840> know<00:00:11.959> I'm<00:00:12.260> involved<00:00:12.980> in<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.549> craft<00:00:14.059> of

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
you know I'm involved in the craft of

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.859 
you know I'm involved in the craft of
something<00:00:15.740> that<00:00:15.980> is<00:00:16.129> not<00:00:17.560> always<00:00:18.560> a<00:00:19.220> given<00:00:19.869> but

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
something that is not always a given but

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.400 
something that is not always a given but
I<00:00:20.900> think<00:00:21.110> it's<00:00:21.230> important<00:00:21.650> to<00:00:21.860> offer<00:00:23.289> you<00:00:24.289> know

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
I think it's important to offer you know

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.470 
I think it's important to offer you know
your<00:00:24.590> photography<00:00:25.160> God<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:25.940> effort<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:28.480> I

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
your photography God the effort and I

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.130 
your photography God the effort and I
decided<00:00:30.289> that<00:00:30.940> it<00:00:31.940> might<00:00:32.449> be<00:00:32.570> interesting<00:00:33.020> to

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
decided that it might be interesting to

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.809 
decided that it might be interesting to
try<00:00:33.289> to<00:00:33.379> make<00:00:33.559> pictures<00:00:34.510> inside<00:00:35.510> a<00:00:36.050> portable

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:36.819 
try to make pictures inside a portable

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:40.799 
try to make pictures inside a portable
camera<00:00:37.819> obscura<00:00:38.300> that<00:00:38.960> allows<00:00:39.260> images<00:00:39.859> of<00:00:40.249> the

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
camera obscura that allows images of the

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.110 
camera obscura that allows images of the
nearby<00:00:41.809> landscapes<00:00:42.679> to<00:00:43.249> actually<00:00:43.579> fall<00:00:43.940> on

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
nearby landscapes to actually fall on

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.489 
nearby landscapes to actually fall on
the<00:00:44.239> ground<00:00:44.420> itself<00:00:46.239> so<00:00:47.239> austere<00:00:47.960> but<00:00:48.289> not<00:00:48.949> I

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:50.499 
the ground itself so austere but not I

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:56.619 
the ground itself so austere but not I
think<00:00:51.499> that's<00:00:51.799> okay<00:00:54.069> so<00:00:55.069> what<00:00:55.549> I<00:00:55.579> do<00:00:55.729> then<00:00:56.600> is

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
think that's okay so what I do then is

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.779 
think that's okay so what I do then is
to<00:00:56.959> make<00:00:56.989> a<00:00:57.170> picture<00:00:57.440> record<00:00:58.219> a<00:00:58.309> picture<00:00:58.609> of

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
to make a picture record a picture of

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.139 
to make a picture record a picture of
that<00:00:58.999> that<00:00:59.629> event<00:00:59.749> of<00:01:00.370> images<00:01:01.370> landing<00:01:01.819> on<00:01:01.999> the

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
that that event of images landing on the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.120 
that that event of images landing on the
ground<00:01:02.179> and<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:03.530> sandwich<00:01:04.070> is<00:01:05.740> very<00:01:06.740> surreal

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
ground and that sandwich is very surreal

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.020 
ground and that sandwich is very surreal
but<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:07.460> also<00:01:07.580> very<00:01:07.700> natural<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.910> this<00:01:10.910> is

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
but it's also very natural so this is

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.190 
but it's also very natural so this is
this<00:01:11.150> kind<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.390> thing<00:01:11.480> that<00:01:11.600> I<00:01:11.750> do<00:01:11.810> where<00:01:12.170> a

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
this kind of thing that I do where a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.860 
this kind of thing that I do where a
landscape<00:01:12.830> lands<00:01:13.250> on<00:01:13.400> grass<00:01:13.750> you<00:01:14.750> could

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
landscape lands on grass you could

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.780 
landscape lands on grass you could
easily<00:01:14.990> do<00:01:15.320> this<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.710> Photoshop<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.400> can<00:01:16.550> just

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
easily do this in Photoshop you can just

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.070 
easily do this in Photoshop you can just
you<00:01:17.120> know<00:01:17.240> I<00:01:17.420> mean<00:01:17.830> everybody's<00:01:18.830> doing<00:01:19.070> it<00:01:20.080> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
you know I mean everybody's doing it so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.950 
you know I mean everybody's doing it so
in<00:01:21.230> a<00:01:21.290> way<00:01:21.440> having<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.490> work<00:01:22.730> to<00:01:23.210> earn<00:01:23.510> a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
in a way having to work to earn a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.990 
in a way having to work to earn a
certain<00:01:24.800> kind<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.190> image<00:01:26.470> feels<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.710> if<00:01:28.700> it

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
certain kind of image feels right if it

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.810 
certain kind of image feels right if it
comes<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.360> easy<00:01:29.570> mmm<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.890> might<00:01:31.130> be<00:01:31.250> suspect

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.200 

the<00:01:35.820> bridge<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:36.930> way<00:01:37.049> symbolizes<00:01:37.710> this

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
the bridge in some way symbolizes this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
the bridge in some way symbolizes this
great<00:01:39.210> art<00:01:39.479> form<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.940> useful<00:01:41.940> thing<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
great art form this useful thing but it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
great art form this useful thing but it
was<00:01:44.310> made<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.940> certain<00:01:45.240> shape<00:01:45.510> that<00:01:46.260> is

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
was made in a certain shape that is

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.469 
was made in a certain shape that is
beautiful<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.030> that's<00:01:48.119> Baird

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
beautiful and I think and that's Baird

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.820 
beautiful and I think and that's Baird
I'm<00:01:48.630> trying<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> work<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> same<00:01:49.500> way

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
I'm trying to work the same way

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.940 
I'm trying to work the same way
there<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> about<00:01:50.940> being<00:01:51.150> inventive<00:01:51.830> you<00:01:52.830> know

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
there is about being inventive you know

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.149 
there is about being inventive you know
not<00:01:53.340> just<00:01:53.930> just<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.110> comma<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.009> make<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
not just just a comma here and make a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.200 
not just just a comma here and make a
quick<00:01:56.460> picture<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.820> it

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
quick picture of it

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.600 
quick picture of it
that's<00:01:57.630> nothing<00:01:58.110> because<00:01:58.440> that's<00:01:58.649> their

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that's nothing because that's their

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.930 
that's nothing because that's their
building<00:02:00.119> pictures<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> bridge<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.940> think

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
building pictures of this bridge I think

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.090 
building pictures of this bridge I think
there<00:02:03.060> may<00:02:03.180> be<00:02:03.210> only<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.070> I

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
there may be only one like the one I

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.609 
there may be only one like the one I
just<00:02:05.190> made<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.420> I<00:02:06.539> think<00:02:06.720> people<00:02:07.289> who<00:02:07.410> build

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
just made and I think people who build

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.100 
just made and I think people who build
this<00:02:07.770> bridge<00:02:08.570> probably<00:02:09.570> had<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:09.959> mind

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this bridge probably had that in mind

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.330 
this bridge probably had that in mind
too<00:02:10.289> we're<00:02:10.679> gonna<00:02:10.769> be<00:02:10.979> able<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.190> make

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
too we're gonna be able to make

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.620 
too we're gonna be able to make
something<00:02:11.550> special<00:02:13.160> I<00:02:14.269> don't<00:02:15.269> always<00:02:15.480> feel

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
something special I don't always feel

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.930 
something special I don't always feel
comfortable<00:02:16.320> speaking<00:02:16.830> about<00:02:17.160> spiritual

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
comfortable speaking about spiritual

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.530 
comfortable speaking about spiritual
things<00:02:17.970> but<00:02:18.959> there<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.230> something<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:20.360> came<00:02:21.360> to

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
things but there is something I came to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.390 
things but there is something I came to
that<00:02:21.690> where<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.800> know<00:02:22.920> we're<00:02:23.100> inside<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
that where you know we're inside a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340 
that where you know we're inside a
darkened<00:02:23.850> space<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.480> we're<00:02:24.630> allowing<00:02:24.930> light

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
darkened space and we're allowing light

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.570 
darkened space and we're allowing light
to<00:02:25.380> do<00:02:26.370> its<00:02:26.550> job<00:02:26.850> and<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.840> sort<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
to do its job and we're sort of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.809 
to do its job and we're sort of
observing<00:02:30.170> quite<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> mystical<00:02:32.100> process<00:02:32.310> you

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
observing quite a mystical process you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.259 
observing quite a mystical process you
know<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.300> no<00:02:33.750> matter<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.910> abstract<00:02:35.910> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
know that no matter how abstract you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.680 
know that no matter how abstract you
know<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.600> ideas<00:02:37.019> behind<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.620> get<00:02:38.690> eventually

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
know the ideas behind it get eventually

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.590 
know the ideas behind it get eventually
what<00:02:40.170> you're<00:02:40.320> dealing<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.680> is<00:02:41.299> the<00:02:42.299> ground

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
what you're dealing with is the ground

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.810 
what you're dealing with is the ground
