00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.309
 benefits 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.840
 we must take advantage of it so what do we 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 will do what one would intend to do 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.930
 to do is follow the path that is here 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.510
 and then to go to the top of the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.980
 above the board 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:01.650

 will say about two hours with nothing 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.960
 find valid I found that from the 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.040
 cartridge that from him christophe him 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 during that time makes a beautiful 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.540

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.729

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.340
 going to say 13 14th century in addition to the 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 decorate at this level there was almost 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.750
 whole screed may have a 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.570
 little piece and the fragilities of the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.270
 sheet of 2,2 copper but otherwise we 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:11.790
