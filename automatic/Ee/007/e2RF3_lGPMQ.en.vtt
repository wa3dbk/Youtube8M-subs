00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.750
 people i am studio of gameplaces game 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.090
 and here is also Maria hello 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.740
 and yes we were at gamescom today 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:31.360
 and we can see you can see something 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.220
 blurry pictures but that it is here 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:38.050
 gran turismo 6 for the playstation 3 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.989
 yes, we drove against each other 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.860
 surprise you who won 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.840
 Comparatively big screen see that it 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.550
 winter still the menu choice we have 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.910
 a nissan nissan gt r is racing 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.640
 So then the 3 version goes off 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.920
 Here you see money that is up 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.620
 silverstone drove the normal 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.670
 company course so that version one 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.530
 shortened version how to win 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.590
 no case sometimes help everyone 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.180
 switch only three pictures we have 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.380
 taken no idea had the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.970
 Brake points are the first example 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.330
 but no traction control can 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.070
 But he is not a stability control 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:22.030
 asc shows that it is 5 pm 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 become more realistic 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.939
 So I definitely think I have 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.430
 yes even tourism 2 3 and 4 played and 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.340
 now with I had only the first 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.060
 possibility with steering wheel quite too 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.880
 drive that we are now very different to 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.369
 especially when braking on everyone 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.850
 case noticed that the cars really nervous 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.539
 you would brake and you with the 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.390
 splitscreen the cars were really nervous 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:53.009
 on the axis and you maybe what 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.840
 and you work right away 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.000
 I'm down , unfortunately, was the one 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.030
 first coup I like it a bit 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.570
 that's not surprising 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.490
 on a permanent son marius is in the picture above 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.229
 continue to brake contact with the enemy 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.549
 one immediately turned so if that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.760
 not a race but with insider 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.160
 Dangers you get admitted 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.600
 yes, but now abdullah the newspapers 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:25.170
 we are coming much better days 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:26.819
 gtr friendly car with all-wheel want 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.739
 but one day even embellished and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.080
 also when braking gc as the bremer 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.849
 were fine but you really have to without 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.780
 but now carefully with the gear 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.780
 that supports me very much, I'm in front 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.800
 you have to go through this khalifa 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.130
 graphically you have to say that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:54.320
 light effects but bread will come then 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.320
 relatively similar are almost equal 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.360
 named is a bit further up 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:07.290
 the old ones are just the right ones 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:08.450
 old grow slowly on the brake there 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.590
 comes back 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.850
 I am also now in front of him 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.370
 only for on head height the fast left 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.920
 right left right of the platform 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.920
 to get a problem 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.360
 on the brake bit difficult almost 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.420
 par here really exciting I 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.840
 so in finance characterful the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.840
 first 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 No 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.020
 still almost on par 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.440
 the time lost by that he 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:57.500
 just later these cars are outdated and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:00.110
 but still relatively equal even 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.350
 now here two seconds ahead in the 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.350
 Curve 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.400
 but it's in two races 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.239
 why is still okay times 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.989
 see who that won the for nothing 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.989
 to take in advance 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.310
 unfortunately without his two matches after 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.160
 as possible ended so yes 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.260
 Generally when playing with us 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.679
 can be heard in islam still event 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:38.839
 to take 

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:40.909
 directly as someone else many of the 

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:46.360
 People drove because we were not one 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:46.360
 the best ones and turned in a circle 

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:54.949
 decide manually switched on 

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:56.419
 All ours just do not have to 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:01.410
 partly you do not always stop 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:03.160
 the whole rhythm when switching 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.540
 that's why it was always like that 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.580
 a bit tricky that you can not 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.820
 rotates so I for some 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.910
 passages a bit careful 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.270
 deal also done 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.270
 promise small 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:12.040
 but still announced in any case that 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:13.630
 First time that I drove longer and 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.580
 has really felt good 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.580
 So it was the feedback that was the start 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.170
 we are almost at the goal we are looking at 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.410
 this to look how to think in time 

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.580
 I got myself the victorious 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:31.260
 exciting race in any case and 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.260
 Dance be world see you soon
