00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.540 
in the lab it looked like a cigarette
but<00:01:16.850> it<00:01:16.940> wasn't<00:01:17.180> lit<00:01:17.360> oh<00:01:17.800> it's<00:01:18.800> an<00:01:18.979> electronic

liquid<00:01:27.080> in<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.290> filter<00:01:27.560> that<00:01:27.830> turns<00:01:28.130> into

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
liquid in the filter that turns into

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.670 
liquid in the filter that turns into
vapor<00:01:28.670> and<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.300> inhale<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.869> microparticles

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
vapor and you inhale the microparticles

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.370 
vapor and you inhale the microparticles
so<00:01:31.190> that<00:01:31.430> was<00:01:31.610> vapor<00:01:31.910> I'd<00:01:32.510> actually<00:01:32.750> rather<00:01:32.960> be

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
so that was vapor I'd actually rather be

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
that room the smoke would wreck the

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.370 
that room the smoke would wreck the
precision<00:01:38.119> equipment<00:01:38.360> in<00:01:38.690> there<00:01:38.840> ruin<00:01:39.259> all

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
its wiring but the vapor is just steam

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.469 
its wiring but the vapor is just steam
