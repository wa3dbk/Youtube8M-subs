00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.310
 this time I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:08.500
 solve a system of equations 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.900
 linear with complex numbers in matlab 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.890
 this helps him solve any 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.920
 system of equations m by n 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.630
 for this example I base myself on a problem 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.710
 seen in the alternating current class 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.260
 where they asked me to find voltage 1 and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.720
 voltage 2 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.530
 It would take me more time to explain how 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.240
 solve the circuit I'm going to focus 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.240
 just tell them how to solve the matrix 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:45.280
 since it has accumulated the matrix is 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.280
 say with their parts with their real parts 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.370
 and its imaginary part 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.770
 in the mad lab we make two matrices 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.150
 one for the actual coefficients and 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.510
 imaginary we call it 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.550
 good to start accommodating that in the 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.290
 mat latos 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.460
 I have the matlab 7.0 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.460
 we open the matlab 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.890
 since we have the malaga open 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:22.670
 we put 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.670
 the same matrix or square brackets 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:30.690
 we accommodate the real part 0.1 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.130
 less 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.130
 the imaginary part that is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 0.15 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.720
 how is it in the same line what 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.630
 still do not put a semicolon 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:51.560
 followed only one space is high it gets 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.560
 zero minus 0.25 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.380
 what follows 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.380
 it is in him 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.060
 you skip a line then when you pass it 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.840
 here 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.840
 with a semicolon 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.720
 ricomÃ¡ 0 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.510
 - 0.55 and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 and 0 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.580
 - 0.25 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.660
 then we close the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.570
 the clasp 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.570
 and the matrix will be accommodated here 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.110
 we have to put to make another matrix of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 solutions 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.310
 we are not going to call be open a clasp 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.650
 and we put 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.379
 the results of the equations be 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.379
 what comes from the right side of the 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.569
 let's put 20 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.180
 two 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.810
 semicolon 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.810
 0 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 we close the clasp 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.000
 we will look like the matrix bay 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.840
 for the solution 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.590
 we put solution 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.590
 same 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.200
 reverse diagonal b 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.000
 and it will give us the solution 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.770
 automatically 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.770
 what is 18 6 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.200
 13.20 4.40 and 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:44.740
 and those are the voltages 1 and 2 and voltage 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.740
 That would be all
