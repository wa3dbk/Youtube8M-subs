right<00:00:15.630> now<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.900> looks<00:00:16.049> kind<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
right now this looks kind of just like a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.680 
right now this looks kind of just like a
bush<00:00:17.310> and<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.210> look<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
bush and I want it to really look like a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
bush and I want it to really look like a
miniature<00:00:19.590> tree<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:19.949> want<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> bring<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.369> little

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
miniature tree I want to bring a little

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.580 
miniature tree I want to bring a little
bit<00:00:20.670> of<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.789> Japanese<00:00:21.270> element<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.320> we're

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
bit of a Japanese element into it we're

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
bit of a Japanese element into it we're
going<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.769> limit<00:00:23.189> up<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.580> little<00:00:23.789> bit<00:00:23.970> so<00:00:24.150> that

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
going to limit up a little bit so that

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.759 
going to limit up a little bit so that
we<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.539> see<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> trunk<00:00:25.019> we're<00:00:25.410> also<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.710> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
we can see the trunk we're also going to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.019 
we can see the trunk we're also going to
start<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.099> thin<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> out<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.670> going<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.820> let

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
start to thin it out we're going to let

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.000 
start to thin it out we're going to let
a<00:00:27.060> little<00:00:27.269> bit<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.510> light<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.590> we're

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
a little bit of light in here we're

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.259 
a little bit of light in here we're
going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.160> take<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.550> some<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.880> branches

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
going to take out some of the branches

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.669 
going to take out some of the branches
that<00:00:30.420> Kraus<00:00:30.750> we're<00:00:31.019> going<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.230> take<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.500> any

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that Kraus we're going to take out any

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.380 
that Kraus we're going to take out any
dead<00:00:31.920> branches<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.610> find<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.270> we're

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
dead branches that we find and we're

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.760 
dead branches that we find and we're
going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.570> bring<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.050> little<00:00:34.530> bit<00:00:34.649> so

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
going to bring it in a little bit so

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.139 
going to bring it in a little bit so
we're<00:00:34.860> going<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.010> sort<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.579> shorten<00:00:36.059> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
we're going to sort of shorten the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.370 
we're going to sort of shorten the
length<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.540> some<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.780> these<00:00:36.840> branches<00:00:37.260> but

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
length of some of these branches but

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.040 
length of some of these branches but
starting<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.829> grow<00:00:38.010> into<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.430> particular

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
starting to grow into this particular

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.500 
starting to grow into this particular
barbary<00:00:40.050> here<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> we<00:00:40.920> want<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.190> remove<00:00:41.760> some

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
barbary here and we want to remove some

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
barbary here and we want to remove some
of<00:00:42.540> those<00:00:42.690> limbs<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.140> are<00:00:43.260> doing<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
of those limbs that are doing that to

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470 
of those limbs that are doing that to
let<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.129> plant<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> little<00:00:45.210> bit<00:00:45.300> more

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
let that plant have a little bit more

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
let that plant have a little bit more
form<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.050> structure<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.710> as<00:00:46.829> well<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
form and structure to it as well so you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.100 
form and structure to it as well so you
know<00:00:47.700> what<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.809> get<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
know what we really just have to get to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.220 
know what we really just have to get to
work<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> am<00:00:50.399> under<00:00:50.730> here<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.840> branch

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
work so I am under here and this branch

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.709 
work so I am under here and this branch
right<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.590> what<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.360> I<00:00:54.510> want

right here what I want to do is I want
to<00:00:54.809> bring<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.170> branch<00:00:55.500> up<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.920> little<00:00:56.129> bit<00:00:56.370> by

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to bring this branch up a little bit by

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.090 
to bring this branch up a little bit by
taking<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.480> off<00:00:57.660> what<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.260> like<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.649> do<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.890> make

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
taking it off what I like to do is make

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.979 
taking it off what I like to do is make
a<00:00:59.129> cut<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.730> then<00:00:59.789> back<00:01:00.180> away<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.660> look<00:01:00.870> at

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
a cut and then back away and look at

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.290 
a cut and then back away and look at
what<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.410> difference<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:02.460> I'm<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.180> going

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
what the difference is so I'm just going

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.710 
what the difference is so I'm just going
to<00:01:03.390> cut<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.600> piece<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.229> off<00:01:04.439> like<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
to cut a piece of this off like that

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.969 
to cut a piece of this off like that
then<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.750> want<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.200> what<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.500> looks<00:01:07.560> like

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
then I want to see what that looks like

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.240 
then I want to see what that looks like
I'm<00:01:08.580> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.850> step<00:01:09.060> back<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> we've<00:01:10.979> created

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I'm going to step back and we've created

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
I'm going to step back and we've created
a<00:01:11.460> little<00:01:11.610> hole<00:01:11.909> there<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.330> we're<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
a little hole there what we're doing is

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.170 
a little hole there what we're doing is
we're<00:01:13.170> bringing<00:01:13.530> up<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.950> bottom<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.880> tree

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
we're bringing up the bottom of the tree

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.690 
we're bringing up the bottom of the tree
from<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.840> ground<00:01:16.280> raising<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> because<00:01:17.610> we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
from the ground raising it because we

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.580 
from the ground raising it because we
want<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.360> trunk<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> give<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> more

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
want to see that trunk and give it more

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
want to see that trunk and give it more
of<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.890> tree<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.400> look<00:01:20.970> when<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.930> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
of a tree like look when do you do this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.020 
of a tree like look when do you do this
when<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> good<00:01:22.890> time<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
when is a good time you know I like to

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
when is a good time you know I like to
do<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.450> during<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> middle<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> latter<00:01:26.100> half

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
do this during the middle to latter half

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.010 
do this during the middle to latter half
of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> summer<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.119> still<00:01:27.600> think<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.840> there

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
of the summer I still think that there

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.480 
of the summer I still think that there
needs<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.470> more<00:01:28.680> taken<00:01:29.100> out<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.340> I'm<00:01:29.400> going

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
needs to be more taken out so I'm going

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.789 
needs to be more taken out so I'm going
to<00:01:29.579> go<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.850> under<00:01:30.180> there<00:01:30.470> you<00:01:31.470> see<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
to go back under there you see it

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
to go back under there you see it
starting<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> open<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:33.329> don't<00:01:33.540> want<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.869> do

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
starting to open up you don't want to do

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
starting to open up you don't want to do
this<00:01:34.170> quickly<00:01:34.500> with<00:01:34.799> something<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.729> delicate

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this quickly with something so delicate

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
this quickly with something so delicate
you<00:01:36.479> take<00:01:36.869> out<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.170> wrong<00:01:37.320> branch<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.979> won't

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you take out the wrong branch you won't

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
you take out the wrong branch you won't
kill<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.640> tree<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.150> certainly<00:01:39.450> won't<00:01:39.630> hurt

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
kill the tree you certainly won't hurt

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.600 
kill the tree you certainly won't hurt
it<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.560> it's<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.829> take<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.130> couple<00:01:41.490> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it but it's going to take a couple of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.130 
it but it's going to take a couple of
years<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.909> grow<00:01:42.000> back<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.420> fill<00:01:42.659> back<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.020> if

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
years to grow back and fill back in if

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.139 
years to grow back and fill back in if
you<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.560> wrong<00:01:43.710> cut<00:01:44.040> if<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.610> raise<00:01:44.850> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
you make the wrong cut if I raise this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.450 
you make the wrong cut if I raise this
here<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.869> enables<00:01:46.259> me<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> see<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.979> trunk<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
here that enables me to see that trunk a

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.980 
here that enables me to see that trunk a
little<00:01:47.670> bit<00:01:47.820> better<00:01:47.970> notice<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.869> see

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
little bit better notice you don't see

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.289 
little bit better notice you don't see
the<00:01:49.200> trunk<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> there<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.430> behind<00:01:50.939> there

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
the trunk and there it is behind there

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.209 
the trunk and there it is behind there
I've<00:01:51.570> got<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.729> small<00:01:53.729> hand<00:01:54.060> saw<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:55.890> done

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
I've got a small hand saw so that's done

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
I've got a small hand saw so that's done
the<00:01:56.759> reason<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.119> prune<00:01:57.360> underneath<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.140> not

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
the reason I prune underneath and not

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.499 
the reason I prune underneath and not
from<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.770> top<00:01:59.369> down<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.090> these<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
from the top down is that these are the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.120 
from the top down is that these are the
older<00:02:00.899> branches<00:02:01.290> under<00:02:01.530> here<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.829> I<00:02:01.860> want<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
older branches under here so I want to

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.410 
older branches under here so I want to
take<00:02:02.310> out<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> older<00:02:02.759> branches<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.240> those

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
take out the older branches not those

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.330 
take out the older branches not those
new<00:02:04.020> ones<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:04.979> dead<00:02:05.159> wood

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
new ones and there's some dead wood

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.130 
new ones and there's some dead wood
under<00:02:05.610> here<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.969> we're<00:02:06.090> removing<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
under here so we're removing that this

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.719 
under here so we're removing that this
will<00:02:07.320> also<00:02:07.469> help<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.250> during<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> winter

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
will also help so that during the winter

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.270 
will also help so that during the winter
I<00:02:09.209> don't<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.349> weight<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.739> snow<00:02:11.099> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
I don't have the weight of the snow and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.850 
I don't have the weight of the snow and

all these branches snow this branch

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.970 
all these branches snow this branch
just<00:02:14.160> grows<00:02:14.880> in<00:02:15.150> such<00:02:15.360> an<00:02:15.480> odd<00:02:15.720> direction<00:02:16.020> let

just grows in such an odd direction let

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
just grows in such an odd direction let
me<00:02:17.040> get<00:02:17.160> rid<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.340> that<00:02:17.520> because<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> don't<00:02:17.880> like

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
me get rid of that because I don't like

me get rid of that because I don't like
the<00:02:18.120> way<00:02:18.210> it's<00:02:18.390> growing<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.930> not<00:02:19.080> nice<00:02:19.650> and

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
the way it's growing it's not nice and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.500 
the way it's growing it's not nice and
straight<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.460> not<00:02:20.520> weeping<00:02:21.090> I'm<00:02:21.300> going<00:02:21.450> to

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
straight it's not weeping I'm going to

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.510 
straight it's not weeping I'm going to
also<00:02:21.660> bring<00:02:22.050> down<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.010> height<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.370> this<00:02:23.460> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
also bring down the height of this a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.650 
also bring down the height of this a
little<00:02:23.700> bit<00:02:23.880> I've<00:02:24.000> got<00:02:24.150> some<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.570> these

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
little bit I've got some of these

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
little bit I've got some of these
branches<00:02:25.050> which<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.350> just<00:02:25.500> grown<00:02:25.740> straight

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
branches which have just grown straight

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.680 
branches which have just grown straight
up<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.520> we<00:02:26.610> want<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.850> take<00:02:27.000> those<00:02:27.180> down<00:02:27.420> as<00:02:27.540> well
