00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
flounder because it's another whole type

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.910 
flounder because it's another whole type
of<00:00:42.690> fishing<00:00:44.270> it's<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:46.079> really<00:00:46.410> pretty<00:00:46.559> easy

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
of fishing it's it's really pretty easy

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100 
of fishing it's it's really pretty easy
if<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.520> can<00:00:47.700> find<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.239> water<00:00:48.600> conditions

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
if you can find the water conditions

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.080 
if you can find the water conditions
where<00:00:49.289> it's<00:00:49.410> clear<00:00:49.739> stab<00:00:50.520> them<00:00:50.700> behind<00:00:50.910> the

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
where it's clear stab them behind the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.470 
where it's clear stab them behind the
back<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.949> with<00:00:52.949> his<00:00:53.160> boat<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.670> really<00:00:54.180> good

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
back and with his boat it's really good

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.090 
back and with his boat it's really good
because<00:00:54.629> you<00:00:54.899> got<00:00:55.020> these<00:00:55.199> platforms<00:00:55.500> and

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
because you got these platforms and

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.299 
because you got these platforms and
these<00:00:56.219> lights<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.379> that<00:00:58.379> really<00:00:58.890> makes<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> big

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
these lights and that really makes a big

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
these lights and that really makes a big
difference<00:00:59.910> because<00:01:00.120> you're<00:01:00.480> maneuvering<00:01:01.020> in

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
difference because you're maneuvering in

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.160 
difference because you're maneuvering in
shallow<00:01:01.920> water<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.789> lot<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> times<00:01:03.780> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
shallow water a lot of the times and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.469 
shallow water a lot of the times and
you're<00:01:04.589> moving<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.939> he's<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.360> an

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you're moving a lot and he's got an

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.890 
you're moving a lot and he's got an
airboat<00:01:06.990> which<00:01:07.560> enables<00:01:07.979> him<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.659> propel<00:01:09.659> from

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
airboat which enables him to propel from

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.240 
airboat which enables him to propel from
the<00:01:09.990> back<00:01:10.200> without<00:01:10.470> having<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.979> use<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> prop<00:01:13.250> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
the back without having to use a prop it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.800 
the back without having to use a prop it
seems<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.580> every<00:01:14.909> time<00:01:14.939> I've<00:01:15.330> gone<00:01:15.360> out<00:01:15.570> with

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
seems like every time I've gone out with

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469 
seems like every time I've gone out with
Captain<00:01:16.380> red<00:01:16.590> we've<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> limit<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.030> nice

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
Captain red we've had a limit of nice

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.620 
Captain red we've had a limit of nice
flounder<00:01:19.850> within<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> first<00:01:21.150> hour<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.600> a

flounder within the first hour and a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.140 
flounder within the first hour and a
half<00:01:21.869> even<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.740> windy<00:01:23.130> nights<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.790> like

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
half even on windy nights and in like

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.090 
half even on windy nights and in like
here<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.479> conditions<00:01:25.080> are<00:01:25.200> not<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
here the conditions are not really the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.920 
here the conditions are not really the
best<00:01:26.400> because<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.880> water<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.270> not<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.600> clear

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
best because the water is not that clear

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.800 
best because the water is not that clear
but<00:01:28.560> 23<00:01:29.430> hours<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> water<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.720> be

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
but 23 hours out of the water you can be

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.530 
but 23 hours out of the water you can be
back<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.380> hotel<00:01:31.500> by<00:01:31.920> one<00:01:32.640> midnight<00:01:33.090> one

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
o'clock with a nice limit of flounder

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.690 
o'clock with a nice limit of flounder
another<00:01:37.619> thing<00:01:37.860> that's<00:01:38.009> kind<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.250> cool<00:01:38.460> when

a lot of snakes out here and you can see

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.120 
a lot of snakes out here and you can see
why<00:01:45.090> we're<00:01:45.899> cruising<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.439> bank<00:01:46.829> and

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
why we're cruising down the bank and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
why we're cruising down the bank and
here's<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.759> little<00:01:47.820> field<00:01:48.360> mouse<00:01:48.479> just

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
here's this little field mouse just

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.499 
here's this little field mouse just
cruising<00:01:49.590> along<00:01:49.649> paddling<00:01:50.460> along<00:01:50.549> takes<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
cruising along paddling along takes a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.590 
cruising along paddling along takes a
little<00:01:51.630> 90<00:01:52.020> degree<00:01:52.320> turn<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.679> I<00:01:53.460> mean<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.329> don't

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
little 90 degree turn and I mean I don't

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.609 
little 90 degree turn and I mean I don't
think<00:01:54.780> you'll<00:01:54.899> make<00:01:55.049> it<00:01:55.110> through<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.470> night

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
think you'll make it through the night

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.830 
think you'll make it through the night
because<00:01:56.069> captain<00:01:56.909> van<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.360> saying<00:01:57.630> that

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
because captain van was saying that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600
