00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.520
 Popeye! 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Bob Lee Swagger! It's difficult for you to find ... 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I do not think so 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.910
 There will be an attempt to assassinate the president within two weeks. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.640
 you will help us protect him 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.359
 someone else will perfectly prevent it 

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:36.140
 You will prevent it. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.280
 We need an observer like you would have done so that we could stop him. I am not convinced if it can be done. ... but we do not want to risk it. 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.920
 Only a few people know what to look for. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 He loaded the gun! Take him off, take him down now! 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Wanted Bob Lee Swagger 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.410
 I'm in trouble and I need help. I would not come here if I was lying. 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.180
 I do not know if I will have to kill someone ... 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.220
 Swagger is still alive 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 this one man can destroy everything 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 all this is not holding up 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.660
 I have a plan, but I need your help 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.670
 Ok, I'll do it 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.640
 I have not told you what is going on.
