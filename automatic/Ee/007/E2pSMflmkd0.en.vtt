00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:16.179
 Let's talk about flowers. 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.089
 She is a floral designer after ten days Juliana. 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.089
 it is attractive and tax 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.890
 for who prefers to wait said the leader 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.550
 henrique who was most injured 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.660
 highlight of the visiting team got 13 the IMF informed the effect 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.920
 is a very special item within Nelore owl floriculture is a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.810
 relatively small variety 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.820
 but now exists for the genetic modifications of several 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.310
 types of plants that said they whistled to what today can be treated as 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.510
 perfect mentor 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 you can have your home in a small corner 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.979
 money is part of what is called these extraneous factors 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.390
 it did and we have the basic account of the cut lines 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.810
 they are planted are the divas cut lines are those we use to 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.500
 make love 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.250
 floral angels 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.250
 teams and already took their government and praised her by the siate vision system 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.210
 but we have for example that the nostrils are counted 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.130
 is this barrier is a mini I get upset so she usually is 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.620
 very large né ii with the genetic modification one can get a plant 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.179
 smaller 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.080
 including this consultation just have good nutrition 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.190
 but with small trees but here it is genetically assembled it is not like a 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.320
 good site you are cutting the countries for it to keep because it is not right 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.700
 and she is already in this one that tomorrow right this is the draft beer are very 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.390
 the doctor said in any month indicating that she is 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.150
 dengue epidemic 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.890
 rita is to better clarify the energy in the central Italian area 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.030
 and at those times these are my good chances 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.820
 before they are very beautiful, and they can also be classified invasion 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.650
 from China and I hope the plant 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.820
 in the case of pink aline is an exception to where you have that is coming to measure 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.580
 I love them every day, so it has a beautiful flowering, and then I would 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.600
 shame handed him there are also several species and outstanding sales 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.880
 and thales sa and the mini begonia that she does not get out much this morning also has 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.869
 some color options 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.869
 and then we have the bromeliads 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.059
 There's a thing you have is a shorter mothers a little smaller These are all so 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:45.369
 little big but they're still missing they're right né 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.340
 and then another merge deic pineapple in fact we have something like that 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.799
 if you have some seminis plants they are small like these and have other 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.339
 what is aflore is small 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:58.320
 is the case for example of the mini pineapple and the maize pineapple and energy 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.419
 we create is still a challenge 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.389
 and it is much used to make arrangements 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.260
 their team 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.629
 My pleasure is he is very interesting. 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:12.469
 after which we have orchids in orc India has mini-picking and 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.999
 I will accept some 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.629
 It is a type of orchid that you have it will not grow more in day than the 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.480
 people were wonderful from the front staff 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.480
 these three session election campaigns 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.329
 the electricity will put next to the other two 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.499
 after having to talk about him 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.499
 on q3 but these review studies 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.349
 and is also a plant 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.519
 fairly extensive will last a beautiful 20 days a person buy penn during 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.519
 less two three weeks a munich plant at home né 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.189
 is this is a goal to miniaturization even it will not grow much more than 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.179
 that this 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:02.199
 then you have the beginner assis and osama how hard it is for us to see 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.019
 we see people is that among the most common is the idea is 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.169
 working with him can not do it anymore 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.039
 than to stop, huh? 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:15.279
 and oscillating rudeness used very beautiful they in arrangements are plants 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:16.189
 wonderful 

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:19.459
 enter but you have a folded in then I get internal arrangement 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.539
 It's very beautiful 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.319
 that they are also 

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:27.930
 this is certain that it is also a pretty pretty plant she would have folded to the 

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.929
 contrary to nasser where the difference of 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.050
 the disk reader they want 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.940
 and then on the bills we still have way - and mini cards 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:44.189
 and as their turn they also have different characteristics and care 

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:48.439
 If mikati graduates there is very little water so if you put two 

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:52.559
 droplets per week is more than imagined and if discussed the land stays 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:53.590
 wet 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.190
 is what you miss the plant because it can rather have a quick land try 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.140
 pib shut kamba saints then aceco ti we have cause to be sequels is that 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.680
 all those that are cutting 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.350
 so then we will shut up you are those types of glass of milk powder 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.639
 they are in cause 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.639
 This one has nothing or a curious boy. 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:16.659
 there are people who do not allow another wine can say that it is a lower quality 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.039
 dodo anthurium 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.139
 it is the little house that the cabin also that house and I spoke the plan is great 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.659
 in chile we have wrong in an example is the big village and the plant 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.560
 It's 40 centimeters more or less but this one is small for you too. 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.669
 make my life 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:35.300
 good and has three other options
