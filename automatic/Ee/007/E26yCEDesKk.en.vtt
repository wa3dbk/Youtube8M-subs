00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.579
 they want red they saw that their tip was 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:36.280
 red rojito is not fire is not the face of 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.170
 the woman 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.170
 I'm going to learn 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:52.800
 good is blonde you are infrared is 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 to make a saving between reds 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.080
 It is always advisable to put it on 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.850
 our hair in the part of here the 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 scalp because it's going to stimulate 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.970
 All our services oxygenate and go to 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.510
 help the hair follicle is oxygenated and 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:14.100
 it gets stronger it stimulates and avoids 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.580
 that we lose red hair helps us to 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.440
 it 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.950
 and apart with what remains is asked the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.320
 hair and shiny and this has the 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
 particularity of having negative what 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.250
 it's negative against frizz low 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.020
 then your hair does not want to appreciate 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.550
 get a little air and I'm going to 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.690
 direct everything here because many 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.480
 Sometimes we and our shareholders 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.040
 with band-aid elements value situ and is 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.040
 easier to work them not molded 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.790
 kisses us 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.860
 the entire period for here 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.030
 we divide it into three one trace three no 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.030
 I know if one already 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:06.400
 2 and 3 ok we're going to make sure everything 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.530
 have the same portion of the hair is the 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.420
 long long and the one that suddenly here 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:15.100
 we have more short truth 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.470
 I am here above or is it 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:20.420

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.310
 tie up a little 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.310

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.980
 simple of 3 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.120
 good when we have our press 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.199
 now we are going to increase 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.199
 this part of here 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.280
 let's go 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.500

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.630

 what it does is very different 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.390
 It was like we took a lot of wit 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.639
