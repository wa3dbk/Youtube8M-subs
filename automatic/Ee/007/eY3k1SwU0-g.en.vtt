00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:24.560 
on the road to the Eagles and for
Jacksonville<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.150> know<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> thought<00:00:24.480> they

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
Jacksonville you know I thought they

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.730 
Jacksonville you know I thought they
afforded<00:00:24.960> themselves<00:00:25.350> pretty<00:00:25.500> well

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
afforded themselves pretty well

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.290 
afforded themselves pretty well
obviously<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> first<00:00:26.550> half<00:00:26.730> last<00:00:27.000> week

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
obviously in the first half last week

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.029 
obviously in the first half last week
getting<00:00:27.539> out<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.900> 17<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.410> nothing<00:00:28.650> lead

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
getting out to a 17 to nothing lead

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
getting out to a 17 to nothing lead
against<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:29.939> Eagles<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.510> think<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.050> what

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
against the Eagles I think that's what

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.630 
against the Eagles I think that's what
you're<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.500> see<00:00:31.679> with<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> Jaguars<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
you're going to see with the Jaguars in

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
you're going to see with the Jaguars in
particular<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.270> year<00:00:33.510> when<00:00:33.930> they<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.260> force

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
particular this year when they can force

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.260 
particular this year when they can force
turnovers<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.250> be<00:00:35.340> opportunistic<00:00:35.910> you'll

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
turnovers and be opportunistic you'll

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.330 
turnovers and be opportunistic you'll
see<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.630> stay<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.020> games<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> me<00:00:38.190> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
see them stay in games but to me the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.040 
see them stay in games but to me the
question<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.850> be<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.149> year<00:00:39.480> until

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
question is going to be this year until

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930 
question is going to be this year until
it<00:00:40.230> gets<00:00:40.410> answered<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.280> know<00:00:41.309> ken<00:00:41.730> that

offense<00:00:42.480> when<00:00:43.140> it's<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.440> getting<00:00:43.710> extreme

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
offense when it's not getting extreme

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.819 
offense when it's not getting extreme

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's going to be Chad Henne it looks

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.540 
it's going to be Chad Henne it looks
like<00:00:56.879> again<00:00:57.210> in<00:00:57.449> week<00:00:58.050> two<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.620> particularly

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
like again in week two and particularly

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
like again in week two and particularly
against<00:01:00.120> Washington<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> know<00:01:01.020> there's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
against Washington you know there's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
against Washington you know there's
holes<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> defense<00:01:02.309> particularly<00:01:02.760> in

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
holes in that defense particularly in

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.929 
holes in that defense particularly in
the<00:01:03.120> secondary<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:04.350> Chad<00:01:04.650> Henne<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.220> company

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the secondary can Chad Henne and company

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.760 
the secondary can Chad Henne and company
take<00:01:06.150> advantage<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.720> those<00:01:06.840> holes<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.650> know

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
take advantage of those holes you know

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
take advantage of those holes you know
you<00:01:07.830> haven't<00:01:08.340> really<00:01:08.520> been<00:01:08.610> able<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.939> see<00:01:09.119> them

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
you haven't really been able to see them

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
you haven't really been able to see them
do<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.659> consistently<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.799> over<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> last

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
do that consistently here over the last

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
do that consistently here over the last
couple<00:01:12.030> years<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.560> flip<00:01:13.770> side<00:01:13.799> I

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
couple years but on the flip side I

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
couple years but on the flip side I
think<00:01:14.250> their<00:01:14.369> defense<00:01:14.760> will<00:01:14.939> get<00:01:15.119> plenty<00:01:15.270> of

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
think their defense will get plenty of

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.200 
think their defense will get plenty of
opportunities<00:01:16.170> um<00:01:16.490> to<00:01:17.490> pick<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> ball<00:01:18.000> off

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
opportunities um to pick the ball off

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.340 
opportunities um to pick the ball off
when<00:01:18.450> you're<00:01:18.540> talking<00:01:18.869> about<00:01:19.020> playing

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
when you're talking about playing

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.100 
when you're talking about playing
against<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.740> team<00:01:20.060> certainly<00:01:21.110> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
against the team certainly like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
against the team certainly like
Washington<00:01:22.830> who<00:01:22.950> Robert<00:01:23.340> Griffin<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> me<00:01:23.850> just

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
Washington who Robert Griffin to me just

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
Washington who Robert Griffin to me just
still<00:01:24.270> does<00:01:24.450> not<00:01:24.630> look<00:01:24.810> comfortable<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.500> don't

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
still does not look comfortable I don't

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
still does not look comfortable I don't
know<00:01:26.070> if<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.400> still<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.939> knee<00:01:27.119> or<00:01:27.600> he<00:01:27.780> just

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
know if it's still the knee or he just

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
know if it's still the knee or he just
does<00:01:28.320> not<00:01:28.350> look<00:01:28.560> comfortable<00:01:29.040> as<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> pocket

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
does not look comfortable as a pocket

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.149 
does not look comfortable as a pocket
passer<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.720> think<00:01:30.990> what's<00:01:31.439> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.680> come<00:01:31.860> here

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
passer I think what's going to come here

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.460 
passer I think what's going to come here
sooner<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.610> later<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.869> order<00:01:34.079> for<00:01:34.320> him<00:01:34.380> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
career for Jay Gruden this to me was a

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.920 
career for Jay Gruden this to me was a
lot<00:02:47.459> tougher<00:02:47.760> game<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.390> sort<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.690> evaluate

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
lot tougher game to sort of evaluate

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.080 
lot tougher game to sort of evaluate
than<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.530> thought<00:02:49.800> because<00:02:50.489> if<00:02:50.610> i<00:02:50.700> look<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:51.000> the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
than I thought because if i look at the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.750 
than I thought because if i look at the
Jaguars<00:02:51.510> defense<00:02:51.620> there's<00:02:52.620> their<00:02:53.370> strength

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
Jaguars defense there's their strength

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.420 
Jaguars defense there's their strength
being<00:02:54.000> forcing<00:02:54.540> turnovers<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.350> then<00:02:56.160> I<00:02:56.190> look

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
being forcing turnovers and then I look

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.800 
being forcing turnovers and then I look
at<00:02:56.520> the<00:02:56.640> Redskins<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.209> look<00:02:57.420> at<00:02:57.540> them<00:02:57.660> as<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
at the Redskins and look at them as a

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.290 
at the Redskins and look at them as a
turnover<00:02:58.410> prone<00:02:58.560> team<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.610> know<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.150> lot

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
turnover prone team you know it's a lot

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
turnover prone team you know it's a lot
tougher<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.750> evaluate<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.709> mind<00:03:01.950> but

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
tougher to evaluate that in my mind but

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.640 
tougher to evaluate that in my mind but
I<00:03:02.760> think<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> difference<00:03:03.420> in<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.690> one<00:03:03.959> okay

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
I think the difference in this one okay

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.940 
I think the difference in this one okay
is<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:05.550> to<00:03:05.670> be<00:03:06.170> Washington's<00:03:07.170> ability<00:03:07.800> to

is going to be Washington's ability to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.310 
is going to be Washington's ability to
run<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.280> ball<00:03:08.489> mainly<00:03:09.360> behind<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.870> for<00:03:10.110> Mars

run the ball mainly behind out for Mars
I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:10.680> he's<00:03:10.800> going<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.010> be<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.280> x-factor<00:03:11.580> in

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
I think he's going to be the x-factor in

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.030 
I think he's going to be the x-factor in
this<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.600> think<00:03:12.900> he's<00:03:13.260> going<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> free<00:03:13.860> up

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
this one I think he's going to free up

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.400 
this one I think he's going to free up
that<00:03:14.070> play-action<00:03:14.700> passing<00:03:15.360> game<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:16.140> find

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
that play-action passing game to find

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.440 
that play-action passing game to find
Pierre<00:03:16.739> Garcon<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.459> DeSean<00:03:17.760> Jackson<00:03:18.269> down

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson down

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.870 
Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson down
the<00:03:18.630> field<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.560> think<00:03:19.799> Gruden's<00:03:20.640> going<00:03:20.820> to

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the field and I think Gruden's going to

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.449 
the field and I think Gruden's going to
put<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.090> less<00:03:21.299> on<00:03:21.540> Robert<00:03:22.230> Griffin<00:03:22.590> than<00:03:23.370> he

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
put it less on Robert Griffin than he

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.039 
put it less on Robert Griffin than he
did<00:03:23.580> last<00:03:23.640> week<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.510> I<00:03:24.570> think<00:03:24.780> it's<00:03:24.900> going<00:03:24.989> to

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
did last week and I think it's going to

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.289 
did last week and I think it's going to
be<00:03:25.110> effective<00:03:25.650> for<00:03:25.799> them<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.190> think<00:03:26.850> this<00:03:27.209> is

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
be effective for them I think this is

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.490 
be effective for them I think this is
going<00:03:27.390> to<00:03:27.480> be<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.600> close<00:03:27.870> game<00:03:27.900> though<00:03:28.290> so<00:03:28.320> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
going to be a close game though so I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.310 
going to be a close game though so I
like<00:03:28.860> Washington<00:03:29.630> to<00:03:30.630> win<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> game<00:03:30.959> outright

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
like Washington to win the game outright

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.430 
like Washington to win the game outright
but<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.400> Jacksonville<00:03:33.060> plus<00:03:33.810> 6i<00:03:34.380> think

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
but I like Jacksonville plus 6i think

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
but I like Jacksonville plus 6i think
Jacksonville's<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.190> to<00:03:35.250> hang<00:03:35.430> around<00:03:35.580> and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
Jacksonville's going to hang around and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.490 
Jacksonville's going to hang around and
I<00:03:36.269> don't<00:03:36.480> think<00:03:36.690> Washington<00:03:36.870> has<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
I don't think Washington has the

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.100 
I don't think Washington has the
explosive<00:03:38.220> offense<00:03:38.700> that<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.330> Eagles<00:03:39.780> do<00:03:39.959> to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
explosive offense that the Eagles do to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.630 
explosive offense that the Eagles do to
just<00:03:40.290> blow<00:03:40.500> them<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:40.980> water<00:03:41.160> but<00:03:41.459> i<00:03:41.519> do

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
just blow them out of the water but i do

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.699 
just blow them out of the water but i do
think<00:03:41.820> Washington<00:03:42.600> will<00:03:43.110> win<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.500> again

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
think Washington will win so again

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.580 
think Washington will win so again
Washington<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.310> win<00:03:44.459> outright<00:03:44.640> but

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
Washington to win outright but

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.500 
Washington to win outright but
Jacksonville<00:03:46.590> plus<00:03:47.459> six<00:03:47.760> guys<00:03:48.209> let<00:03:48.420> me<00:03:48.450> know
