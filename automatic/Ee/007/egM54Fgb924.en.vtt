00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:05.150
 the one that's a kid and I'll introduce the ofsp there's there and his part 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:06.690
 devices that allows 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.729
 market by quality and a mouse on 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.579
 station 3 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.010
 not that I wanted to show right away how the device responds to me 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.529
 often of modern warfare 2 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.449
 at the end of the game 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.689
 the local years 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.789
 not to bother me too much so I can show you how 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.329
 How does it work 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 already that I made some parties in the front and back 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.059
 know that the ps3 is cool it makes me crack 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.160
 and so as to all the servers are practically filled with small 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.050
 errors 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.050
 gj then met live he is balanced 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.050
 that the strategies and bombers of the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 the total what and why not the girl so it was per player 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.920
 so I prefer to show young people and local parties 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.770
 so we are quieter 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.670
 so I sell can see that m 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.710
 his answer 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.450
 relatively 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.210
 30 e max pie xii 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.120
 the pre-columbian site 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.460
 micromovements too 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.049
 the siren in the limit the same problem 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.760
 Quebec 7 to 5 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.900
 so what is good would it be there 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.750
 these lines 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.140
 but if the sale 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.620
 the cell only 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.620
 no I said I can make a stir I want 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.700
 grand slam 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 after a free kick 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 we can see that the crepon device 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.210
 I would not say that 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.230
 at the finger and the eye same design as 1 5% 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.060
 pretty good 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.789
 so it's better for me it's playable already done and go 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.890
 and a country where positive immigration europe 

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:14.539
 I did not feel it gives them a young male 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.019
 playing 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.019
 with the shift on ps3 

00:02:23.029 --> 00:02:26.319
 so we can really show up too quickly on the fast movements 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.689
 as on pc 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.689
 I do not look at the victory 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:37.119
 How much is that 

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:39.079
 microfinance 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.079
 Sunday over a year and a half 

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:48.509
 It's really interesting 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.649
 that this kind of device comes out on both consoles 

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.439
 for allergic to the pastor's allergic 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.409
 in this case another begins 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:05.609
 jacques asline 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.539
 commando 

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.539
 so I get hurt every year in support 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.219
 so we can see that responds very very well 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.639
 so 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.269
 with the keyboard 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.709
 the mouse 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.709
 c change 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:26.029
 all enemies in water 

00:03:26.029 --> 00:03:26.829
 sting 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.829
 while the intermediary 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:39.660
 the xs p the bed of the hesse meet 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.660
 relatively well 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:45.459
 on ps3 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.489
 so I can I recommend it 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.839
 for those who do not have stocks 6 me 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:54.699
 my first race there is there a sum on ps3 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.229
 which is the equivalent of psa xs 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.659
 I am blocked 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.659
 it's the equivalent of 10% 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.069
 x of 360 ffkm 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.319
 so here I can more 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.760
 move I'm stuck these violations france 2 that's in the texts 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:16.809
 so after getting involved in the crates 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.389
 I can tell you 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.829
 what else can I tell you 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.520
 Sequedin 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.220
 at the software level it is very very well supplied because their parents 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.990
 heaven of men 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.300
 that allow us to configure it to them on pc 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.220
 just as signed the keys on the keyboard when you want sensitivity all 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:37.080
 it 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.230
 after several configuration files this is excellent 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.130
 all renewable energies and refused to conclude for such a 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.159
 or such game 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.229
 just load on pc from the ump 2 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.029
 loblaw in the man 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.700
 in the bed of the decline and after abba 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.770
 it's perfect it works 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.159
 contrary to what is done elsewhere 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.349
 if you want to play other games you have to reconfigure for each game it's 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:07.819
 the small euros -1% 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:09.919
 what I have done 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.919
 during my test with the exceptional 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:18.129
 so here I hope he was passing this short video to show a little 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:19.439
 how 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:23.139
 the game works well the father factors works with the game 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.630
 note that these stays to blois but hey I stopped playing on ps3 because 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.630
 that I received my i7 is elsewhere 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.770
 So here is 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.969
 it's perfect 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:39.360
 so marcy to have me listen 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.300
 and one of his flocks to a few more videos 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.279
 you have a match in my eyes tons 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:48.349
 auger made gameplay videos with laurent 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:49.689
 as of this weekend 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.349
 and the ghana is on which one right 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:55.239
 thank you to all its members around this summer in las vegas
