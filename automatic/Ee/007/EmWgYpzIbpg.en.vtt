 redo for the intimate and our 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.800
 scientific research would like to answer 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.149
 to a question that many fans get 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.420

 and yes electro of shereni so our 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.049
 scientific research mayor invites any 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.759
 blurry as you see there is no 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.009
