that's the next available flight or why

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.050 
that's the next available flight or why
doesn't<00:02:19.770> give<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.130> a<00:02:20.190> series<00:02:20.700> of<00:02:20.730> different

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
doesn't give you a series of different

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.720 
doesn't give you a series of different
right<00:02:21.960> so<00:02:22.140> these<00:02:22.290> are<00:02:22.470> in<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.250> case<00:02:23.490> these

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right so these are in this case these

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.800 
right so these are in this case these
are<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> only<00:02:24.600> flights<00:02:24.960> between<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.740> two

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
are the only flights between these two

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.740 
are the only flights between these two
destinations<00:02:27.810> today<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.760> even<00:02:30.570> though<00:02:30.630> we

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
destinations today so even though we

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.720 
destinations today so even though we
understood<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.230> there<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.250> that's<00:02:32.520> getting

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
understood that there and that's getting

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.670 
understood that there and that's getting
that<00:02:32.850> data<00:02:33.060> from<00:02:33.300> where<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.410> would<00:02:34.590> be

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
that data from where so this would be

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.180
