then I hit all of mine cart and a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.470 
then I hit all of mine cart and a
minecart<00:00:49.770> should<00:00:50.100> come<00:00:50.309> through<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> one<00:00:51.360> of

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
minecart should come through the one of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.200 
minecart should come through the one of
the<00:00:51.600> only<00:00:51.719> disadvantages<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.210> train

the only disadvantages of this train

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.700 
the only disadvantages of this train
system<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.899> does<00:00:55.020> take<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> little<00:00:55.440> bit<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
system is it does take a little bit of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.150 
system is it does take a little bit of
time<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.610> minecart<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.270> here<00:00:57.539> like

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
time for the minecart to get here like

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.470 
time for the minecart to get here like
10ish<00:00:59.160> second<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.090> isn't<00:01:00.359> unreasonable

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
10ish second which isn't unreasonable

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.529 
10ish second which isn't unreasonable
but<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> bit<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.609> disadvantage<00:01:02.850> but

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
but to get the bit of a disadvantage but

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.940 
but to get the bit of a disadvantage but

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
the way I came I get sent through a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.149 
the way I came I get sent through a
different<00:01:30.840> pathway<00:01:31.290> that's<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> take

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
different pathway that's going to take

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.770 
different pathway that's going to take
me<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.570> entrance<00:01:34.259> area<00:01:34.619> where<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.600> can

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
me to the entrance area where you can

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.660 
me to the entrance area where you can
see<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.229> reflect<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.189> minecart

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
see it's going to reflect the minecart

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.830 
see it's going to reflect the minecart
here<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.659> second<00:01:40.049> there<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.290> go<00:01:40.439> um<00:01:41.689> just<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
here in a second there you go um just to

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.359 
here in a second there you go um just to
prove<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.259> works<00:01:43.409> let's<00:01:43.770> try<00:01:43.979> two<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
prove that it works let's try two and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:51.260 
prove that it works let's try two and
three<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.729> well<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:44.970> hit<00:01:45.829> two<00:01:47.630> line<00:01:48.630> cart<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.270> in

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
three as well I hit two line cart and in

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.789 
three as well I hit two line cart and in
a<00:01:51.390> second<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.990> mine<00:01:52.200> cart<00:01:52.470> should<00:01:52.590> come

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
a second and mine cart should come

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.260 
a second and mine cart should come
through<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.399> takes<00:01:53.579> longer<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.119> go

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
through it actually takes longer to go

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.749 
through it actually takes longer to go
to<00:01:54.329> two<00:01:55.049> than<00:01:55.259> one<00:01:55.409> longer<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.460> three

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
to two than one longer go to go to three

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.990 
to two than one longer go to go to three
than<00:01:57.000> two<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.950> not<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.130> significant

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
than two so it's not a significant

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:11.780 
than two so it's not a significant
amount<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.240> time<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:02.869> launch<00:02:05.570> destination<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:20.250 

then<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.969> I<00:02:13.060> head<00:02:13.239> back<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:19.629> finally

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
then if I head back and finally

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:32.179 
then if I head back and finally
destination<00:02:21.390> 30<00:02:27.689> minecart<00:02:30.599> get<00:02:31.599> to<00:02:31.780> do

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
destination 30 minecart get to do

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
actually send the old mine carts away

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.619 
actually send the old mine carts away
it's<00:03:42.340> whipped<00:03:42.549> out<00:03:42.729> more<00:03:42.909> momentum<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:43.479> it

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:43.629 
it's whipped out more momentum when it

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.030 
it's whipped out more momentum when it
comes<00:03:43.840> in<00:03:44.079> so<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:44.620> gonna<00:03:46.379> but<00:03:47.379> point<00:03:47.709> is<00:03:47.829> it

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
comes in so it's gonna but point is it

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.819 
comes in so it's gonna but point is it
actually<00:03:48.220> does<00:03:48.549> work<00:03:48.819> at<00:03:49.379> come<00:03:50.379> here<00:03:52.829> there's

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
actually does work at come here there's

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.349 
actually does work at come here there's
anti-jamming<00:03:54.729> features<00:03:55.569> there<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:58.150> yeah

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
anti-jamming features there so yeah

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.319 
anti-jamming features there so yeah
that's<00:03:58.569> pretty<00:03:58.959> much<00:03:59.409> it<00:03:59.590> I<00:04:00.579> suppose<00:04:01.180> this

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329

um the RS nor latch is are connected

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.980 
um the RS nor latch is are connected
with<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.310> repeater<00:04:33.880> with<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.090> full<00:04:34.360> delay<00:04:34.660> on<00:04:34.840> it

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
latch is before the one that you want to

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
get select get selected so that means

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.450 
get select get selected so that means
that<00:04:45.150> only<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.630> these<00:04:47.100> outputs<00:04:48.100> is<00:04:48.250> going

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
that only one of these outputs is going

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.250 
that only one of these outputs is going

back<00:05:02.950> to<00:05:03.130> three<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:06.640> output<00:05:07.150> also<00:05:07.360> does

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
back to three and the output also does

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.110 
back to three and the output also does
two<00:05:07.870> things<00:05:07.920> firstly<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:09.100> sends<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.090> signal

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
two things firstly it sends a signal

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.410 
two things firstly it sends a signal
back<00:05:10.630> to<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:11.110> main<00:05:11.290> area<00:05:11.740> which<00:05:12.310> these<00:05:13.270> and

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
back to the main area which these and

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.810 
back to the main area which these and
repeaters<00:05:13.750> here<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.110> because<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.440> is<00:05:14.820> more

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
repeaters here just because it is more

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.730 
repeaters here just because it is more
compact<00:05:16.240> which<00:05:17.490> turns<00:05:18.490> on<00:05:18.700> or<00:05:18.880> off<00:05:19.000> these

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
compact which turns on or off these

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.840 
compact which turns on or off these
these<00:05:20.740> torches<00:05:21.490> and<00:05:22.470> it<00:05:23.470> also<00:05:23.740> sends<00:05:24.310> signal

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
these torches and it also sends signal

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.040 
these torches and it also sends signal
over<00:05:25.060> here<00:05:25.090> which<00:05:25.540> is<00:05:25.630> actually<00:05:25.780> they're

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
over here which is actually they're

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:27.780 
over here which is actually they're
really<00:05:26.380> this<00:05:26.890> is<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.130> bit<00:05:27.280> that<00:05:27.310> I<00:05:27.490> came<00:05:27.580> up

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
really this is the bit that I came up

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.850 
really this is the bit that I came up
with<00:05:28.030> it<00:05:28.150> I'm<00:05:28.270> really<00:05:28.600> proud<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:29.260> the

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
with it I'm really proud of is the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.910 
with it I'm really proud of is the
sorting<00:05:30.600> sorting<00:05:31.600> system<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.230> it's<00:05:32.470> kind<00:05:32.830> of

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:32.920 
sorting sorting system and it's kind of

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.290 
sorting sorting system and it's kind of
hard<00:05:33.100> to<00:05:33.160> explain<00:05:33.310> but<00:05:33.790> I<00:05:33.850> think<00:05:34.030> it'll<00:05:34.210> make

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
hard to explain but I think it'll make

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.820 
hard to explain but I think it'll make
sense<00:05:34.360> if<00:05:34.750> you<00:05:34.840> watch<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:35.500> here<00:05:35.710> i<00:05:35.770> have

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
sense if you watch it so here i have

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.980 
sense if you watch it so here i have
three<00:05:36.220> selected<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:37.240> i'm<00:05:37.360> going<00:05:37.540> to<00:05:37.600> call<00:05:37.960> a

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
three selected and i'm going to call a

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.890 
three selected and i'm going to call a
minecart<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.880> see<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.150> mine<00:05:40.360> cart<00:05:40.570> comes

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
minecart you see the mine cart comes

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.230 
minecart you see the mine cart comes
through<00:05:41.230> goes<00:05:41.920> on<00:05:42.100> here<00:05:42.400> but<00:05:42.520> actually<00:05:42.880> stops

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
through goes on here but actually stops

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.880 
through goes on here but actually stops
on<00:05:43.540> there<00:05:43.690> for<00:05:43.870> a<00:05:43.930> second<00:05:44.230> before<00:05:44.320> this<00:05:44.650> turns

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
on there for a second before this turns

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.650 
on there for a second before this turns
on<00:05:45.190> giving<00:05:45.490> enough<00:05:45.820> time<00:05:45.850> to<00:05:46.150> get<00:05:46.240> pushed<00:05:46.570> back

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
on giving enough time to get pushed back

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.560 
on giving enough time to get pushed back
the<00:05:46.840> other<00:05:47.080> way<00:05:47.370> before<00:05:48.370> it<00:05:48.490> goes<00:05:48.730> to<00:05:49.210> through

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
the other way before it goes to through

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.320 
the other way before it goes to through
the<00:05:49.720> three<00:05:50.050> third<00:05:50.800> track<00:05:51.460> and<00:05:51.700> it<00:05:51.790> gets<00:05:52.030> sent

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
the three third track and it gets sent

00:05:52.330 --> 00:06:03.620 
the three third track and it gets sent
to<00:05:53.160> three<00:05:54.160> spot<00:05:54.580> oh<00:05:54.610> my<00:05:54.820> god<00:05:55.030> stupid<00:05:55.480> grain<00:05:59.460> and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.290 

but<00:06:04.630> if<00:06:04.750> I<00:06:04.840> slept<00:06:05.140> in<00:06:06.630> one<00:06:08.100> and<00:06:09.100> they<00:06:09.970> called

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
but if I slept in one and they called

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.490 
but if I slept in one and they called
mine<00:06:10.570> cart<00:06:11.490> instead<00:06:12.490> as<00:06:13.030> you<00:06:13.270> can<00:06:13.420> see<00:06:13.660> the

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
mine cart instead as you can see the

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.290 
mine cart instead as you can see the
output<00:06:14.710> already<00:06:15.370> charges<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:17.370> one<00:06:18.370> track

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
output already charges the one track

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.400 
output already charges the one track
meaning<00:06:19.690> that<00:06:19.780> it<00:06:19.900> goes<00:06:20.050> straight<00:06:20.230> through

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
meaning that it goes straight through

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.300 
meaning that it goes straight through
without<00:06:20.890> being<00:06:21.610> stopped<00:06:21.970> and<00:06:22.500> goes<00:06:23.500> to<00:06:23.950> the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
without being stopped and goes to the

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.150 
without being stopped and goes to the
one<00:06:24.550> station<00:06:25.150> instead<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.830> it<00:06:26.830> would<00:06:26.980> work

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
one station instead and it would work

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.680 
one station instead and it would work
for<00:06:27.520> two<00:06:27.760> with<00:06:27.910> well<00:06:28.150> I<00:06:28.180> don't<00:06:28.300> think<00:06:28.570> I<00:06:28.630> need

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
for two with well I don't think I need

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.660 
for two with well I don't think I need
to<00:06:28.780> demonstrate<00:06:29.050> it<00:06:29.560> and<00:06:29.740> I<00:06:30.220> suppose<00:06:30.520> we'll

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
to demonstrate it and I suppose we'll

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.400 
to demonstrate it and I suppose we'll
just<00:06:30.850> quickly<00:06:30.970> go<00:06:31.210> over<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.540> pez<00:06:31.750> dispenser

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
just quickly go over the pez dispenser

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.500 
just quickly go over the pez dispenser
as<00:06:32.560> well<00:06:32.800> this<00:06:33.490> is<00:06:33.610> a<00:06:33.640> pretty<00:06:33.910> standard<00:06:34.330> pez

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
as well this is a pretty standard pez

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.970 
as well this is a pretty standard pez
dispenser<00:06:35.020> it's<00:06:35.200> using<00:06:35.500> the<00:06:36.120> hatch<00:06:37.740> which<00:06:38.740> is

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
dispenser it's using the hatch which is

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.860 
dispenser it's using the hatch which is
a<00:06:39.190> new<00:06:39.370> addition<00:06:39.550> in<00:06:39.790> 1.6<00:06:40.480> and<00:06:40.660> this<00:06:40.750> is

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
a new addition in 1.6 and this is

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.750 
a new addition in 1.6 and this is
actually<00:06:41.020> pretty<00:06:41.800> much<00:06:41.920> the<00:06:42.190> standard<00:06:42.340> pest

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:42.760 
actually pretty much the standard pest

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.450 
actually pretty much the standard pest
spent<00:06:43.060> to<00:06:43.180> these<00:06:43.330> days<00:06:43.650> I<00:06:44.650> did<00:06:45.040> not<00:06:45.190> come<00:06:45.310> up

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
spent to these days I did not come up

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.160 
spent to these days I did not come up
with<00:06:45.640> it<00:06:45.760> I'm<00:06:45.880> not<00:06:46.000> sure<00:06:46.180> who<00:06:46.300> did<00:06:46.480> if<00:06:46.690> someone

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
with it I'm not sure who did if someone

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.420 
with it I'm not sure who did if someone
wants<00:06:47.380> to<00:06:47.440> tell<00:06:47.620> me<00:06:47.740> I'll<00:06:47.830> credit<00:06:48.130> them<00:06:48.220> in<00:06:48.340> a

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:48.430 
wants to tell me I'll credit them in a

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.530 
wants to tell me I'll credit them in a
notation<00:06:50.430> but<00:06:51.430> what<00:06:51.610> does<00:06:51.880> make<00:06:52.120> this<00:06:52.270> special

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:52.540 
notation but what does make this special

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.090 
notation but what does make this special
and<00:06:52.840> I<00:06:52.900> did<00:06:53.080> come<00:06:53.260> up<00:06:53.380> with<00:06:53.530> this<00:06:53.710> is<00:06:53.890> that

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
and I did come up with this is that

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.720 
and I did come up with this is that
generally<00:06:54.850> the<00:06:56.040> in<00:06:57.040> the<00:06:57.310> 1.5<00:06:58.030> Pez<00:06:58.570> dispensers

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 
generally the in the 1.5 Pez dispensers

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.950 
generally the in the 1.5 Pez dispensers
minecarts<00:07:00.730> bounced<00:07:01.090> off<00:07:01.270> each<00:07:01.420> other<00:07:01.600> so<00:07:01.870> you

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
minecarts bounced off each other so you

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.440 
minecarts bounced off each other so you
didn't<00:07:02.200> need<00:07:02.320> this<00:07:02.500> but<00:07:02.770> if<00:07:03.520> I<00:07:03.700> just<00:07:04.030> made<00:07:04.240> this

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
didn't need this but if I just made this

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.840 
didn't need this but if I just made this
lead<00:07:05.140> straight<00:07:05.530> up<00:07:05.770> to<00:07:06.040> the<00:07:06.190> this<00:07:06.610> whole

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
lead straight up to the this whole

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.960 
lead straight up to the this whole
there'd<00:07:07.810> be<00:07:08.050> jams<00:07:08.710> if<00:07:08.950> you<00:07:09.070> tried<00:07:09.310> to<00:07:09.340> overload

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
there'd be jams if you tried to overload

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.150 
there'd be jams if you tried to overload
the<00:07:10.240> pez<00:07:10.780> dispenser<00:07:11.290> but<00:07:11.500> after<00:07:11.800> playing<00:07:11.950> for

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 
the pez dispenser but after playing for

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
a little bit I found out that if you set

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:23.010 
a little bit I found out that if you set
it<00:07:17.770> up<00:07:17.830> like<00:07:17.920> this<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:21.300> then<00:07:22.300> you<00:07:22.330> send<00:07:22.690> more

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020 
it up like this and then you send more

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:30.500 
it up like this and then you send more
minecarts<00:07:23.620> in<00:07:25.860> they<00:07:26.860> will<00:07:28.800> bounce<00:07:29.800> back

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:30.510 
minecarts in they will bounce back

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.060 
minecarts in they will bounce back
properly<00:07:31.510> instead<00:07:31.990> of<00:07:32.110> jamming<00:07:32.620> it<00:07:32.710> up<00:07:32.860> and

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:33.070 
properly instead of jamming it up and

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.190 
properly instead of jamming it up and
then<00:07:33.220> they<00:07:33.700> just<00:07:33.880> go<00:07:34.060> into<00:07:34.270> lava<00:07:34.480> I<00:07:34.780> suppose

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.200
