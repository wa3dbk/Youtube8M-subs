00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.580
 we know amalgam also what 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.279
 copy-paste modified improved finger this 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.480
 what has become of this inspiration 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.520
 thank you already for the opportunity you 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.680
 offer me to be able to talk to 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.910
 Internet users 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.710
 I would say that this inspiration is 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.480
 first divine it would be a crime 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.420
 of lèse majesté that not to first 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.490
 pay tribute to the very one who 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.730
 so gave us that to the essence of the 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.970
 life 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.630
 and secondly I would also say that this 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.640
 is one of my games saying all of my 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.320
 follies and others because I like 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.180
 also set the mood around me 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.190
 I also like amused the gallery in crisis 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.519
 as it says but firstly it's 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:59.780
 an inspiration that my faith and divine 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:02.030
 to say that it would therefore necessarily be my 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.199
 own person I could have put on 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.540
 paper first because what we 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.800
 could should know is that 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.430
 writing is also an inspiration 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.590
 every work of art is divine 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.120
 so I was first that this 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.370
 inspiration comes from god momo the gone 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.110
 we know irrgang there has not been 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.240
 particular apprehension because we 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.040
 was not afraid to face I regain 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.689
 also they're doing right now I do not 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.799
 I do not want to fight yoro gang or game 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.390
 anybody I would say everything 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.720
 just face a universe on 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.640
 knows very well also a situation 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.950
 that our country has lived we are 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.540
 currently trying to 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 stand out i would even say that we are 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.530
 on a very good track the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.000
 apprehensions yes there were some there 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.409
 will always have one there will be some 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.830
 people who may come to you 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.900
 to discourage 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.370
 some will also say that you have not 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.660
 not afraid of you I was in that thing 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.150
 because it's a little political I 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.750
 tell me I did not touch any edge 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.200
 policy 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.840
 quite the opposite I try to bring my 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.860
 modest contribution to the relaxation 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.410
 because the more I use I mean 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.550
 politics is used to make it 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.590
 of humor 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.980
 I also think that the better 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.840
 to to left sir who do not speak 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.940
 right sir is good laugh 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.890
 together a bit like football so 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 to be able to forget a little bit everything 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.700
 that there are like palaver and other 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.040
 now after if they want to come back 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.440
 on political debates so much better 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.030
 if they also want to put them to 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 cupboard 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.270
 it's also good for me next to this 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.570
 that can be drawn as the good 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.640
 mood 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.370
 the particularity of the free of charge 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.000
 single one wanted to do what books for 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.400
 all but also humor all this 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.840
 well I would say that free of charge 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.200
 you have to know you have to take it under 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.840
 pretty crazy look pretty left 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.690
 free of the single because good 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.700
 many people said go ahead wind 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.860
 the wind the wine the but I mean that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.880
 it's like that too in the game because 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.340
 we also know that piracy 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.650
 today we know how is it 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.280
 Piracy touches the artistic milieu 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.680
 and therefore say a host abena nb by 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.489
 example that this single is free to 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.550
 because of the pirates 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.870
 I would say that it sounds stupid but 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.760
 likewise a lot of people 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.640
 have approached me a facebook box for me 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.590
 to say but it's not too bad as an idea 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.850
 because selling a single for free 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.019
 this is done in the United States or 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.430
 to go see that for example a 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.010
 third person like that a 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.090
 artist to an album he will not do it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.310
 go out directly 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.709
 he will go molo molo that is to say out 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 two singles three months after six months 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.880
 after after consumption of this first 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.220
 single out of the second single 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.150
 so as president I will say everything 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.890
 just that that's it also allows 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.959
 it's a contribution in order to be able 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.130
 so help the artists 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.220
 I simply ask them 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.810
 to use that kind of tactics there so 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.950
 simply to allow us 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.840
 matches and here is artist today 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.940
 comedian it means that the bridge 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.069
 from the microphone of the animator to the 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.130
 radio now up to the microphone of 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.690
 the comedian said francis down I would say 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.660
 that we are trying to 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.580
 to cross the bridge the proof is that the 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.220
 third bridge is not over yet 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.390
 will soon booklet to all 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.310
 Ivorians so the animation turns on 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.110
 humor to animation I would say everything 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.090
 simply that there is not a big gap 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.010
 except that you just have to know 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.930
 adapt I'm the water has been doing since 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.280
 soon five years 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.160
 I hope I will still have your 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.479
 trust give me your trust I 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.960
 will necessarily give you the same 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:41.080
 Here chance to 2d if you were a 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.910
 book for you to complete a wahou corner 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.169
 if I were a book I would ask everything 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.330
 just all those people to whom 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:50.150
 may have a 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.759
 in claw the chance to read me from 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.580
 remember can be the joy of living 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:59.000
 a young man who decided so thoroughly 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.610
 it is to darken to darken I do not want 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.439
 head down but also listening to the 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.930
 different tips on both sides 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:07.520
 like what there is only one life there 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.900
 must live it thoroughly but live thoroughly 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.909
 does not mean that one has to indulge in 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.729
 libertinism behind the mask dallas 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.289
