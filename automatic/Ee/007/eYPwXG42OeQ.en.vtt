00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:01.579
 last year it's certainly not easy 

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:04.540
 calendar date for 12 months has passed them 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.569
 dialogue development occurred a number of events 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.670
 which in the most serious way 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.549
 influenced the current agenda 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.069
 for the life of our country 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.179
 these events they are certainly a splinter again 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.779
 made us rethink and 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:19.740
 many of those challenges 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.960
 I have been voiced at the beginning of last year 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.769
 and 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.180
 changed from 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.880
 situation of the country if you speak in the economy 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:30.699
 that 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:32.460
 certainly the most important 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.120
 himself important 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.250
 so 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.290
 the moment was the financial crisis 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.450
 which exists today 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.720
 in almost all developed countries 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.820
 of course 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.760
 This is the reaction of Ankara since May 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.250
 has changed significantly your 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.280
 a heart 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.170
 but I would like to specifically 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.880
 emphasize that we nevertheless despite 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.410
 on all these difficulties 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470
 must continue forward 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.450
 world crisis in currency and situation 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.400
 around the dollar situation around 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.360
 existing financial markets 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.450
 global financial activities 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.310
 structures 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.030
 once put on the agenda yes it is important to create 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.160
 new giving an architectural muscle assessment 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.780
 That means that the club liat 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.550
 still have all the possibilities 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.670
 ultimately become one of 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.180
 reserve 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.210
 financial 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.590
 units of one of the world reserve 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.990
 currencies or another task is the development 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.300
 Information Society for 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.040
 few years we managed 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.190
 to plug 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.380
 Russian school to the internet when you 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.320
 were starting 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530
 on this topic it turned out that this 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 The task is extremely difficult, I would like 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.050
 say that I will continue this day personally 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.700
 ensure that despite 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.770
 financial difficulties 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.580
 and the federal center and regions 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.730
 continued to work on the issue 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.410
 worked on time 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.740
 finance this access to 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.110
 Internet during a crisis of course 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.140
 the issue has escalated 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.140
 creating new jobs 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.729
 in the development of digital technology holland 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.180
 one additional opportunity despite 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.570
 Canadians you need to know I do not 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.110
 intends to refuse the account of one major 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.420
 which task 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.439
 wording last year 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:19.469
 we must consistently 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.889
 implement all intended decisions 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:22.889
 for in two ways 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.889
 demographic situation in the country 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:28.849

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:30.869
 fertility and mortality reduction 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.179
 which we consider priority 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.339
 which is already being implemented in 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.539
 state you know that not so long ago it was 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.089
 decided to allow 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:40.079
 use maternity capital 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.329
