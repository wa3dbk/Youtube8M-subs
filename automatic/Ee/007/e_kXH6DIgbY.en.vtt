00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear friends and with you 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.750
 today kayu gtv 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.059
 and we will talk about questions to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.969
 to the developers and the answers to them today 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.769
 us rubric answers to questions 2 so 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.020
 I'll start right away I will not pull 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.750
 put the fight to you on the storm tivi look 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.210
 enjoy in defense on stalingrad 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 enemy tanks shoot through walls and without 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.160
 sight when another player will return the roulette 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.170
 asks and he answers the video 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.789
 please send shoot with a gun 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.920
 and miss especially on distant 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.809
 distances if you maneuver 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 and do not stand still it will greatly increase 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 your chances of surviving a roulette wheel in that form 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.899
 in which she was no longer return then 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
 there is it means that the tape measure is now 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.800
 but if not the final version of the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.260
 like the old she won't become anyway 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.420
 and so the next question the player asks us 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.760
 hello will there be a raise of martial 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.739
 characteristics on the tank m48 for interesting 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.149
 questions in trembling since he 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.890
 absolutely loses everything 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.680
 classmates with respect to the same 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.390
 leopard n 48 can be lowered to the level 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.090
 below thank you in advance 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.280
 rebalance will be but still unclear when 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.530
 that is, the developers understand that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.970
 this tank is relatively weak here machines 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.180
 t-55 and leopard will abruptly but change 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.820
 don't know yet whether or not 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.159
 more specifically but not yet know when and so 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 the player asks if it will be recycled 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.670
 damage and penetration of the calculation system 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.170
 high-explosive shells and finally 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.320
 developers answer what I have long 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.939
 I would like to hear that I will recycle 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 in the system of damage to high-explosive shells 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.590
 because now she works pretty 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.340
 incorrect well and I hope it will be all 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.679
 more or less good 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.070
 him and so on why are gun masks not 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.859
 make their way and in to 3601 pierce the runoff 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.319
 guns on like bl-10 

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:51.159
 impossible to be silent about the fact that 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:53.969
 breaking through 329 should pierce 100 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.590
 millimeters and armor in the head 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.799
 developers answer yes yes of course 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.569
 such a thing gun declared breakdown 286 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:03.640
 does not break through the declared armor 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.500
 100 millimeters possible in tanks 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.780
 mechanically there are not only vulnerable 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.209
 places but vice versa especially thick points 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 In real life , that was what the developers were 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.680
 wean that yes there are such places strong 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 even on small tanks where 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.530
 you can not pierce them very very powerful 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.540
 guns and so on there is a very interesting 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.810
 question I noticed that there are towers in the game 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.459
 kv-220 mod and kv-3 it means that these 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.829
 the tanks are already in the game and they will 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.750
 added in the next update 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:34.690
 developers respond q-3 will be soon 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.160
 added sq-220 is not planned yet 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.200
 there is probably an error again 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.900
 developers because in the description there 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.239
 it is written that now you can put in 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.730
 you on the tank but the tanks themselves are not here 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.889
 general and slept your plans and so on 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.380
 why aren't you working on graphics and 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.540
 environmental properties 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.819
 Well, the developers respond to this is that 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.889
 while they are 101 percent gameplay in 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.069
 the best side is not finished on the graphics and 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:02.470
 any kind of ryushechkami will not work 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.780
 next question is it true that there will be 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.060
 world map for regions and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.769
 developers answer yes true in 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.200
 March update that is in 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.419
 near future we are waiting for world war 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.090
 finally friends we waited for the clan 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.680
 get ready now and so be prepared 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.389
 the next question is when planned 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.970
 realize the possibility of return 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.220
 players current battle when departing this 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.590
 priority march april 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.569
 and it will be done that is this 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.459
 Here's the problem when you pulled out let's say 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.650
 server problems some or you 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.150
 just inadvertently closed the game somehow and 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.040
 again in Giverny 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.840
 you can not fix it and soon 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.689
 You can join this game 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.909
 session again and when there will be new 

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:45.010
 February update fix update already 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.720
 came out the twenty-first following 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.810
 update scheduled for late march 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.730
 that's just with this world war well 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.829
 everyone understands what is left to wait is not 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.439
 too long and hopefully she will be very 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.930
 good world map look forward to when he 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.849
 great and great british salt tanks 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.099
 there are no plans at all about tanks 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:06.639
 the uk is the earliest in the second 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:09.099
 half of 2014 but if you really want something 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:10.810
 You can ask and it is the British 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.970
 then we will consider it 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.379
 suggestion maybe something we change that 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.930
 if there is someone very unbearable 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:18.549
 see British tanks then you can 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.799
 write to the developers they are at it 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.020
 will respond but is now scheduled from 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.090
 plans for the next update new 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.510
 branch of the Soviet tyazh I understand it 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.650
 the branch will be up to some type of 4 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.900
 let's see what will not be here now 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.449
 predict straight but it seems to me 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.430
 what will be exactly this tank well what am i 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.090
 I hope you were interested to hear these 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.760
 answers 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.830
 I generally picked out vegetables 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.419
 the most interesting told ban for this 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.820
 information can like me 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.220

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.479
 world war and all see you soon 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.360
