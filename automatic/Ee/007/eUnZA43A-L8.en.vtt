do this in compound sets so we're going
to<00:00:23.760> take<00:00:23.910> two<00:00:24.119> exercises<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.080> do<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.529> straight

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
to take two exercises and do it straight

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.980 
to take two exercises and do it straight
off<00:00:25.980> to<00:00:26.130> each<00:00:26.220> other<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:27.060> have<00:00:27.300> 30<00:00:27.570> seconds

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
off to each other then have 30 seconds

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.689 
off to each other then have 30 seconds
break<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.769> another<00:00:28.859> two<00:00:29.189> exercises

break and do another two exercises

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.759 
break and do another two exercises
straight<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.779> each<00:00:30.869> other<00:00:31.109> it's<00:00:31.590> like<00:00:31.740> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
straight off to each other it's like a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.709 
straight off to each other it's like a
superset<00:00:32.399> but<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> superset<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.239> where<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.480> use

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
superset but a superset is where you use

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.720 
superset but a superset is where you use
different<00:00:34.290> exercise<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.010> different<00:00:35.340> muscles

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
different exercise or different muscles

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
different exercise or different muscles
to<00:00:36.210> do<00:00:36.390> straight<00:00:36.690> off<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:37.050> each<00:00:37.110> other<00:00:37.320> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to do straight off to each other so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.580 
to do straight off to each other so
let's<00:00:37.800> for<00:00:37.950> example<00:00:37.980> say<00:00:38.750> leg<00:00:39.750> extension<00:00:39.989> for

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
let's for example say leg extension for

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
let's for example say leg extension for
your<00:00:40.680> part<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.219> legs<00:00:41.460> call<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.969> your

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
your part and then legs call for your

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.030 
your part and then legs call for your
hamstrings<00:00:42.540> that's<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.840> super<00:00:43.170> sick<00:00:43.350> if<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:43.890> do

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
hamstrings that's a super sick if you do

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
hamstrings that's a super sick if you do
it<00:00:44.160> for<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> same<00:00:44.760> muscle<00:00:45.180> groups<00:00:45.210> called<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it for the same muscle groups called the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.470 
it for the same muscle groups called the
compound<00:00:46.440> set<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.340> first<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.940> all<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.149> need<00:00:48.329> for

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
compound set so first of all I need for

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.020 
compound set so first of all I need for
you<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.200> nice<00:00:49.590> long<00:00:50.039> exercise<00:00:50.520> band

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
you to have a nice long exercise band

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.430 
you to have a nice long exercise band
and<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> understand<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.930> second<00:00:52.260> why

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
and you understand in a second why

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.470 
and you understand in a second why
otherwise<00:00:53.430> you're<00:00:53.730> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.940> have<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> change

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
otherwise you're going to have to change

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.720 
otherwise you're going to have to change
the<00:00:54.750> exercise<00:00:55.140> band<00:00:55.469> with<00:00:55.920> every<00:00:56.370> exercise

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the exercise band with every exercise

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.939 
the exercise band with every exercise
cause<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.690> length<00:00:58.020> changes<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> time

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
cause if the length changes all the time

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.119 
cause if the length changes all the time
so<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.820> nice<00:01:00.059> long<00:01:00.570> exercise<00:01:00.840> band<00:01:01.289> nice

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so get a nice long exercise band nice

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.880 
so get a nice long exercise band nice
feet<00:01:03.000> right<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.510> top<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:04.019> shoulder<00:01:04.680> width

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
feet right on top of it shoulder width

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.210 
feet right on top of it shoulder width
apart<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.909> then<00:01:06.060> let's<00:01:06.930> wind<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:07.950> till<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
apart and then let's wind it up till you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.280 
apart and then let's wind it up till you
get<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> nice<00:01:08.549> tension<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> first<00:01:10.110> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
get a nice tension now the first to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500 
get a nice tension now the first to
exercise<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.369> shoulder<00:01:12.240> press

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
exercise is going to be shoulder press

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.170 
exercise is going to be shoulder press
and<00:01:12.810> then<00:01:13.320> shoulder<00:01:13.920> lateral<00:01:14.610> raise<00:01:14.820> which<00:01:15.060> is

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
and then shoulder lateral raise which is

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.539 
and then shoulder lateral raise which is
to<00:01:15.299> decide<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.020> shoulder<00:01:16.590> press<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
to decide so shoulder press is here and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.870 
to decide so shoulder press is here and
in<00:01:17.970> lateral<00:01:18.479> raise<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.650> so<00:01:20.189> let's<00:01:20.369> do

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
in lateral raise is here so let's do

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
in lateral raise is here so let's do
five<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.540> each<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:21.960> then<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.439> can<00:01:22.590> see

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
five of each and then you can see

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.340 
five of each and then you can see
exactly<00:01:23.070> real<00:01:23.970> speed<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.869> what<00:01:25.020> time<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
exactly real speed and to what time it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
exactly real speed and to what time it
will<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.500> done<00:01:25.740> so<00:01:26.310> let's<00:01:26.490> go<00:01:26.610> shoulder<00:01:27.000> press

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
will be done so let's go shoulder press

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.700 
will be done so let's go shoulder press
first<00:01:27.530> one<00:01:29.000> to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
first one to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.430 
first one to
three<00:01:32.080> four<00:01:33.520> five<00:01:34.520> and<00:01:34.580> then<00:01:34.909> straight<00:01:35.270> into

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
three four five and then straight into

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.700 
three four five and then straight into
lateral<00:01:36.440> raise<00:01:37.690> elbows<00:01:38.690> bent<00:01:39.020> we<00:01:39.440> don't<00:01:39.530> want

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
lateral raise elbows bent we don't want

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.680 
lateral raise elbows bent we don't want
to<00:01:39.770> do<00:01:39.920> this<00:01:40.490> thing<00:01:40.790> that<00:01:40.909> means<00:01:41.090> nothing<00:01:41.479> so

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
to do this thing that means nothing so

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.710 
to do this thing that means nothing so
elbows<00:01:42.020> Bend<00:01:42.290> I<00:01:42.560> mean<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.640> side<00:01:43.880> we

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
elbows Bend I mean up to the side we

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.359 
elbows Bend I mean up to the side we
might<00:01:44.900> have<00:01:44.930> seen<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.440> just<00:01:45.740> grabbed<00:01:46.100> another

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
might have seen I just grabbed another

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.190 
might have seen I just grabbed another
little<00:01:46.640> bit<00:01:46.820> day<00:01:47.030> to<00:01:47.570> make<00:01:47.720> it<00:01:47.840> nice<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.170> hard

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
little bit day to make it nice and hard

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.240
