Pyramid Texts glue and I've got it here

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.330 
Pyramid Texts glue and I've got it here
so<00:00:35.700> ultra<00:00:36.570> bond<00:00:36.750> it's<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.590> super<00:00:38.190> glue

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
so ultra bond it's a it's a super glue

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.600

thing I think it's 25 gauge 24 actually
24<00:00:46.079> gauge<00:00:46.289> copper<00:00:46.829> or<00:00:47.129> wire<00:00:47.989> the<00:00:48.989> heat<00:00:49.110> base<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
24 gauge copper or wire the heat base is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.400 
24 gauge copper or wire the heat base is
oak<00:00:50.539> which<00:00:51.539> has<00:00:51.719> been<00:00:51.899> stained<00:00:54.079> show<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.140> more

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
oak which has been stained show you more

detail<00:00:55.770> there's<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.910> feed<00:00:57.180> there<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.600> two

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
detail there's the feed there are two

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.330 
detail there's the feed there are two
flaws<00:00:57.930> missing<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:59.070> really<00:00:59.309> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
flaws missing but that's not really a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.039 
flaws missing but that's not really a
shocker<00:01:02.570> there's<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.660> legs<00:01:05.570> tail<00:01:08.750> rib<00:01:09.750> cage

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
shocker there's a legs tail rib cage

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.210 
shocker there's a legs tail rib cage
wings<00:01:10.850> and<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.420> skull<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.380> beak<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.979> the

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
wings and the skull with beak and the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.530 
wings and the skull with beak and the
eye<00:01:14.250> sockets<00:01:15.439> which<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.619> bone<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> eye

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
eye sockets which are bone the eye

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
eye sockets which are bone the eye
sockets<00:01:18.990> stop<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.830> head<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.159> vibrating

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
sockets stop the head from vibrating

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.450 
sockets stop the head from vibrating
here<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.600> eye<00:01:21.630> sockets<00:01:22.140> ought<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.409> be<00:01:22.560> there

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
here the eye sockets ought to be there

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.920 
here the eye sockets ought to be there
they're<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.180> attached<00:01:24.450> or<00:01:24.600> anything<00:01:24.750> they

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
they're not attached or anything they

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.050 
they're not attached or anything they
float<00:01:25.170> inside<00:01:25.530> but<00:01:25.979> I've<00:01:26.189> glued<00:01:26.729> under<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
float inside but I've glued under the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719 
float inside but I've glued under the
nose<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.799> there's<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> place

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
nose because there's that's the place

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.710 
nose because there's that's the place
that<00:01:29.759> they<00:01:29.970> would<00:01:30.119> look<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> best<00:01:30.540> there's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
that they would look the best there's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.580 
that they would look the best there's
really<00:01:30.840> no<00:01:31.020> other<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:33.320> you<00:01:34.320> can<00:01:34.439> see

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
really no other way to do it you can see

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
really no other way to do it you can see
they<00:01:35.060> try<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.299> them<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.570> copper

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
they try and do them in on the copper

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.649 
they try and do them in on the copper
wire<00:01:37.170> inside<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> spine<00:01:39.259> as<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.530> see<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
wire inside the spine as you can see the

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:50.740 
wire inside the spine as you can see the
neck<00:01:42.659> there

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.010 

there's<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:51.470> keel<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.370> wishbone<00:01:52.930> missing<00:01:53.930> a

there's the keel the wishbone missing a
few<00:01:54.170> ribs<00:01:54.500> once<00:01:55.370> again<00:01:55.640> not<00:01:55.880> a<00:01:55.910> big<00:01:56.120> shocker

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
few ribs once again not a big shocker

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.300 
few ribs once again not a big shocker
although<00:01:57.470> we<00:01:57.560> do<00:01:57.680> have<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:58.180> tiny<00:01:59.180> little

the comments if you can spot which bone
it<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.330> I'll<00:02:23.480> tell<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.750> what<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:23.990> made

it is and I'll tell you what it's made

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:41.050 
it is and I'll tell you what it's made
out<00:02:24.230> of

that's a cool of you well I'll hopefully
make<00:02:47.280> some<00:02:47.460> other<00:02:47.580> videos<00:02:47.940> about<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.780> process

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
make some other videos about the process

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.580 
make some other videos about the process
to<00:02:49.740> get<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.820> this<00:02:50.910> point<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:52.230> I<00:02:52.290> like<00:02:52.470> your

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
to get to this point and I like your

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.400 
to get to this point and I like your
data<00:02:52.740> obviously<00:02:53.370> takes<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.120> while<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.300> find<00:02:54.930> you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
data obviously takes a while to find you

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.080 
data obviously takes a while to find you
know<00:02:55.530> even<00:02:55.860> when<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.040> find<00:02:56.190> them<00:02:56.400> by<00:02:56.550> finding

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
know even when you find them by finding

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.810 
know even when you find them by finding
these<00:02:57.150> deceased<00:02:57.510> animals<00:02:57.720> by<00:02:58.050> chance<00:02:58.380> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
these deceased animals by chance and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.980 
these deceased animals by chance and
then<00:02:59.820> you<00:02:59.850> have<00:03:00.030> to<00:03:00.180> wait<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.480> several<00:03:00.780> months

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
then you have to wait to several months

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.610 
then you have to wait to several months
for<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.230> body<00:03:01.410> decomposed<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:03.440> hope<00:03:04.440> you

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
for the body decomposed I hope you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.730 
for the body decomposed I hope you
