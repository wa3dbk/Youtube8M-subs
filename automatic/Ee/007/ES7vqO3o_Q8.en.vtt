I can still see the light at the end of
the<00:00:14.150> tunnel<00:00:14.389> shine<00:00:14.960> through<00:00:15.469> the<00:00:15.589> dark<00:00:15.889> times

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
even when I lose my mind but it feels

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.380 
even when I lose my mind but it feels
like<00:00:18.529> no<00:00:18.920> one<00:00:19.100> in<00:00:19.250> the<00:00:19.400> world<00:00:19.640> is<00:00:19.910> listening
