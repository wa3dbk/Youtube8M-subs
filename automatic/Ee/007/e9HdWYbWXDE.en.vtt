let's<00:00:26.160> talk<00:00:26.250> gravity<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.210> put<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.510> very<00:00:27.750> simply

let's talk gravity to put it very simply

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.050 
let's talk gravity to put it very simply
it's<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> force<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.070> makes<00:00:29.279> objects<00:00:29.760> fall

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's the force that makes objects fall

some of the blocks in Minecraft obey

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.880 
some of the blocks in Minecraft obey
gravity<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.420> sand<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.110> gravel<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.770> the

gravity like sand and gravel but the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520 
gravity like sand and gravel but the
rest<00:00:35.130> seem<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.030> ignore<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:37.230> example

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530

we<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.100> tree<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.670> if<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.329> chop

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
we have this tree right here if you chop

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.330 
we have this tree right here if you chop
the<00:00:39.750> bottom<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.260> top<00:00:40.469> of<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> tree<00:00:40.920> will<00:00:41.070> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
the bottom the top of the tree will just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
the bottom the top of the tree will just
stay<00:00:41.520> there<00:00:41.730> floating<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.450> air<00:00:42.660> that's<00:00:43.200> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
stay there floating in air that's a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
stay there floating in air that's a
pretty<00:00:43.770> fundamental<00:00:44.579> difference<00:00:45.000> right<00:00:45.360> off

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539

the bat but if you're up for it let's

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.290 
the bat but if you're up for it let's
get<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.010> little<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.340> complicated<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.180> can

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
get a little more complicated you can

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.090 
get a little more complicated you can
also<00:00:48.480> carry<00:00:48.780> around<00:00:49.020> cobblestone<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.920> you

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
also carry around cobblestone with you

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.610 
also carry around cobblestone with you
no<00:00:50.489> big<00:00:50.670> deal<00:00:50.879> right<00:00:51.210> well<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.050> had<00:00:52.260> enough

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
no big deal right well if we had enough

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.310 
no big deal right well if we had enough
of<00:00:52.739> them<00:00:52.980> we<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.370> carrying<00:00:53.820> over<00:00:54.320> 4,000

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
