00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
piece by piece but this is a little bit

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.479 
piece by piece but this is a little bit
tedious<00:01:03.390> but<00:01:03.890> once<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.430> you

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.670 
to withstand this punishment and also
drop<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.910> on<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.330> back<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.930> ipad<00:02:27.200> 2<00:02:27.440> and

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
drop it on the back of the ipad 2 and

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.470 
drop it on the back of the ipad 2 and
the<00:02:27.980> front<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.490> ipad<00:02:28.820> tube<00:02:29.060> with<00:02:29.210> the<00:02:29.240> case

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the front of the ipad tube with the case

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.420 
the front of the ipad tube with the case
itself<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.410> result<00:02:30.800> was<00:02:30.920> just<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.250> same

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
itself and the result was just the same

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.610 
itself and the result was just the same
so<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.700> case<00:02:31.940> does<00:02:32.180> really<00:02:32.450> do<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> good<00:02:33.020> job<00:02:33.080> as

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so the case does really do a good job as

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.830 
so the case does really do a good job as

far as accidental drops alright so my

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.120 
far as accidental drops alright so my
final<00:02:35.990> verdict<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.410> this<00:02:36.500> case<00:02:36.710> of<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.950> it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
final verdict on this case of that it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.230 
final verdict on this case of that it
does<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> really<00:02:37.580> good<00:02:37.730> job<00:02:37.790> at<00:02:38.120> protecting

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
does a really good job at protecting

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.450 
does a really good job at protecting
your<00:02:38.570> iPad<00:02:38.930> 2<00:02:39.110> from<00:02:39.290> accidental<00:02:39.920> drops<00:02:40.190> and

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
your iPad 2 from accidental drops and

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.400 
your iPad 2 from accidental drops and
falls<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.330> normal<00:02:41.660> wear<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:41.870> tear<00:02:42.050> and

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
falls and just normal wear and tear and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.630 
falls and just normal wear and tear and
I<00:02:42.650> think<00:02:42.830> it's<00:02:42.920> not<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.250> withstand

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
I think it's not going to be withstand

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.520 
I think it's not going to be withstand
extreme<00:02:44.180> punishment<00:02:44.480> but<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.200> think<00:02:45.380> it<00:02:45.440> would

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
extreme punishment but I think it would

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.840 
extreme punishment but I think it would
be<00:02:45.560> great<00:02:45.740> for<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.190> especially<00:02:46.250> going<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.790> be

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
be great for it especially going to be

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.370 
be great for it especially going to be
giving<00:02:47.030> your<00:02:47.150> kids<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.570> iPad<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.230> don't

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
giving your kids and iPad to you don't

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.990 
giving your kids and iPad to you don't
want<00:02:48.530> them<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.770> break<00:02:48.920> it<00:02:49.100> easily<00:02:49.430> put<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.760> into

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
want them to break it easily put it into

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.640 
want them to break it easily put it into
this<00:02:50.120> case<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.540> may<00:02:50.690> be<00:02:50.870> able<00:02:50.990> to<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.500> know
