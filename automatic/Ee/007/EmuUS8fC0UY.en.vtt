00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
seasonal it's not something you're going

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.320 
seasonal it's not something you're going

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.290 
to use all the time and there's just no
point<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.410> is<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.920> one<00:03:12.280> in<00:03:12.520> blue<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.150> i'm

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
point so this is the one in blue and i'm

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.520 
point so this is the one in blue and i'm
going<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.540> just<00:03:13.690> warm<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.990> up<00:03:14.080> on<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.350> back<00:03:14.500> of

going to just warm it up on the back of
my<00:03:14.770> hand<00:03:14.980> first<00:03:15.310> because<00:03:15.820> the<00:03:16.330> formula<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:17.020> be

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
my hand first because the formula can be

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.080 
my hand first because the formula can be
a<00:03:17.230> little<00:03:17.440> bit<00:03:17.620> hard<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.190> if<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.430> warm<00:03:18.700> up<00:03:18.850> on

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
a little bit hard so if you warm up on

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.420 
a little bit hard so if you warm up on
the<00:03:19.180> back<00:03:19.300> of<00:03:19.330> your<00:03:19.540> hand<00:03:19.750> first<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:21.070> kind<00:03:21.340> of

just softens the pencil a little bit

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.590 
just softens the pencil a little bit

how<00:03:40.780> kind<00:03:41.079> of<00:03:41.170> accurate<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.769> shape<00:03:41.950> is<00:03:42.159> you

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
how kind of accurate the shape is you

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.819 
how kind of accurate the shape is you
can<00:03:42.459> see<00:03:42.700> there<00:03:42.989> then<00:03:43.989> I'm<00:03:44.260> just<00:03:44.379> going<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> go

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
can see there then I'm just going to go

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:52.530 
can see there then I'm just going to go

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
in and really start to kind of fill in

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:59.540 
in and really start to kind of fill in
any<00:03:53.049> gaps

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.130 

and<00:03:59.990> just<00:04:00.990> kind<00:04:01.260> of<00:04:02.330> make<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.540> color<00:04:03.810> a<00:04:03.930> little

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:04.140 
and just kind of make the color a little

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.800 
and just kind of make the color a little
bit<00:04:04.350> more<00:04:04.500> intense<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:05.610> as<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.210> can<00:04:06.330> see<00:04:06.570> there

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
bit more intense so as you can see there

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.110 
bit more intense so as you can see there
the<00:04:07.170> color<00:04:07.410> looks<00:04:07.770> much<00:04:08.160> more<00:04:08.460> intense<00:04:08.820> it

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the color looks much more intense it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.750 
the color looks much more intense it
looks<00:04:09.300> very<00:04:09.630> blue<00:04:09.960> and<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.980> kind<00:04:11.400> of<00:04:11.490> a<00:04:11.640> nice

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
looks very blue and it's kind of a nice

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.300 
looks very blue and it's kind of a nice
shape<00:04:12.450> as<00:04:12.690> well<00:04:12.900> but<00:04:13.620> then<00:04:13.770> I'm<00:04:13.950> just<00:04:14.100> going<00:04:14.250> to

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
shape as well but then I'm just going to

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.670 
shape as well but then I'm just going to
go<00:04:14.490> in<00:04:14.520> and<00:04:14.820> kind<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.150> Tidy<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.780> outer<00:04:15.990> corner

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.970 
go in and kind of Tidy the outer corner
a<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:19.080> want<00:04:19.260> to<00:04:19.410> really<00:04:19.590> wing

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
a little you don't want to really wing

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.410 
a little you don't want to really wing
it<00:04:20.190> but<00:04:20.549> just<00:04:20.760> soften<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.330> a<00:04:21.480> tiny<00:04:21.810> tiny<00:04:22.200> bit

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
it but just soften it a tiny tiny bit

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.760 
it but just soften it a tiny tiny bit
like<00:04:24.420> so<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.750> could<00:04:25.140> do<00:04:25.290> kind<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.560> like<00:04:25.710> a

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
like so you could do kind of like a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.770 
like so you could do kind of like a
winged<00:04:26.040> eye<00:04:26.250> but<00:04:26.580> I<00:04:26.610> just<00:04:26.880> feel<00:04:27.090> like<00:04:27.120> with

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
winged eye but I just feel like with

winged eye but I just feel like with
blue<00:04:28.020> liner<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.440> can<00:04:28.830> be<00:04:29.040> a<00:04:29.070> little<00:04:29.340> bit<00:04:29.550> much

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
blue liner that can be a little bit much

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.720 
blue liner that can be a little bit much
so<00:04:30.540> then<00:04:30.930> just<00:04:31.350> make<00:04:32.010> sure<00:04:32.220> you've<00:04:32.430> kind<00:04:32.700> of

of smudged really badly on me but I

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.490 
of smudged really badly on me but I
don't<00:05:20.490> know<00:05:20.700> if<00:05:20.760> it's<00:05:21.030> my<00:05:21.570> skin<00:05:21.930> at<00:05:22.050> the<00:05:22.110> moment

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
I feel like most mascaras tend to sort

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.790 
I feel like most mascaras tend to sort
of<00:05:27.270> get<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:27.480> little<00:05:27.690> bit<00:05:27.870> better<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.650> longer

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
of get a little bit better the longer

you've<00:05:29.190> had<00:05:29.400> them<00:05:29.610> even<00:05:29.880> they<00:05:29.970> shouldn't<00:05:30.330> keep

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
you've had them even they shouldn't keep

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.850 
you've had them even they shouldn't keep
them<00:05:30.660> for<00:05:30.780> more<00:05:30.930> than<00:05:30.990> three<00:05:31.169> months<00:05:31.290> but

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
them for more than three months but

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:33.740 
them for more than three months but
that's<00:05:32.070> what<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.280> used<00:05:32.520> on<00:05:32.640> my<00:05:32.760> lashes<00:05:32.970> and<00:05:33.450> i

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
that's what I used on my lashes and i

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:19.759 
in the post this morning but I haven't

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.490 
in the post this morning but I haven't
tried<00:07:20.000> this<00:07:20.300> yet<00:07:20.360> but<00:07:20.690> it's<00:07:20.930> just<00:07:21.169> a<00:07:21.259> really

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:21.500 
tried this yet but it's just a really

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.670 
tried this yet but it's just a really
pretty<00:07:22.660> bubblegummy<00:07:23.660> pink<00:07:23.960> but<00:07:24.320> i<00:07:24.350> swatched

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
pretty bubblegummy pink but i swatched

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.740 
pretty bubblegummy pink but i swatched
it<00:07:24.710> and<00:07:25.100> it's<00:07:25.190> quite<00:07:25.430> sure<00:07:25.729> so<00:07:26.090> it's<00:07:26.360> kind<00:07:26.690> of

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
it and it's quite sure so it's kind of

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.939 
it and it's quite sure so it's kind of
like<00:07:26.870> a<00:07:26.930> lip<00:07:27.229> balm<00:07:27.440> you<00:07:27.620> look<00:07:27.740> and<00:07:27.889> I<00:07:27.919> think

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949 
like a lip balm you look and I think

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:39.519 
like a lip balm you look and I think
that<00:07:28.280> would<00:07:28.430> really<00:07:28.460> look<00:07:28.910> nice<00:07:29.210> with<00:07:29.600> a<00:07:29.870> boy<00:07:30.110> I

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:39.529 

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.949 

and<00:07:39.649> as<00:07:40.639> you<00:07:40.819> can<00:07:40.999> see<00:07:41.029> it's<00:07:41.329> not<00:07:41.479> overly

00:07:41.949 --> 00:07:41.959 
and as you can see it's not overly

00:07:41.959 --> 00:07:44.139 
and as you can see it's not overly
