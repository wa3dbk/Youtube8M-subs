00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
died many times trying to tame him I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.970 
died many times trying to tame him I
wasn't<00:00:21.840> prepared<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.590> didn't<00:00:22.800> know<00:00:22.859> the

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
wasn't prepared I didn't know the

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.820 
wasn't prepared I didn't know the
tactics<00:00:23.460> properly<00:00:24.029> but<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> did<00:00:25.500> it

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
tactics properly but the way I did it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.830 
tactics properly but the way I did it
the<00:00:26.039> week<00:00:26.250> later<00:00:26.789> was<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.510> stand<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the week later was to just stand on the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.169 
the week later was to just stand on the
platform<00:00:28.019> also<00:00:28.650> get<00:00:29.010> pushed<00:00:29.310> back<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:30.000> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
platform also get pushed back like the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.220 
platform also get pushed back like the
hunter<00:00:30.539> there<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.830> think<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.230> another

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
hunter there I think there is another

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.709 
hunter there I think there is another
tactic<00:00:34.920> where<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.670> pushed<00:00:36.000> back<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
tactic where you get pushed back and you

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.680 
tactic where you get pushed back and you
use<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.260> turns<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:38.610> avoid<00:00:38.940> his<00:00:39.090> damage<00:00:39.420> over

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
use that turns to avoid his damage over

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.900 
use that turns to avoid his damage over
time<00:00:39.719> spell<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.620> that's<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.219> tactic<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
time spell but that's not the tactic I

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.560 
time spell but that's not the tactic I
used<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.520> way<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.670> deter<00:00:45.059> was<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.300> stay<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
used so the way I deter was to stay on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.479 
used so the way I deter was to stay on

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the Therans before engaging him you have

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.230 
the Therans before engaging him you have
to<00:01:14.670> use<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.000> there<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.210> pretty<00:01:15.750> late<00:01:17.240> because

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
to use that there is pretty late because

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.010 
to use that there is pretty late because
else<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.780> won't<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.020> able<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.350> avoid<00:01:19.799> his<00:01:20.130> or

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
else you won't be able to avoid his or

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.600 
else you won't be able to avoid his or
reflect<00:01:22.020> his<00:01:22.229> damage<00:01:22.619> over<00:01:22.890> time<00:01:22.920> spell

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
reflect his damage over time spell

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.469 
reflect his damage over time spell
that's<00:01:23.790> pretty<00:01:24.210> important<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:26.820> think

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
that's pretty important and I think

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.780 
that's pretty important and I think
that's<00:01:27.869> pretty<00:01:28.110> much<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> will<00:01:29.400> see

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
that's pretty much it so you will see

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
that's pretty much it so you will see
how<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:31.280> troll<00:01:32.280> hunter<00:01:33.170> did<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.890> I
