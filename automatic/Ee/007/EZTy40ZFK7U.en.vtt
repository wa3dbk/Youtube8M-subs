other<00:01:13.170> part<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.990> gas<00:01:15.990> manifold<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.770> tap

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
other part of the gas manifold and tap

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.450 
other part of the gas manifold and tap
down<00:01:17.310> there<00:01:18.350> they're<00:01:19.350> both<00:01:19.560> running<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> tee

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
down there they're both running to a tee

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.810 
down there they're both running to a tee
piece<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.000> then<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.780> one<00:01:21.960> bottle

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.960 

there's<00:01:30.820> two<00:01:32.250> cast-iron<00:01:33.250> burners<00:01:33.760> in<00:01:33.940> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
there's two cast-iron burners in the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.670 
there's two cast-iron burners in the
bottom<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:36.130> two<00:01:36.400> steel<00:01:36.700> racks<00:01:37.470> covered<00:01:38.470> with

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:52.910 

so<00:01:44.920> it's<00:01:45.070> either<00:01:46.890> all<00:01:47.890> stainless<00:01:48.460> steel<00:01:50.040> or

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
so it's either all stainless steel or

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.750 
so it's either all stainless steel or
galvanized<00:01:54.480> material<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:00.040> one<00:02:00.430> thing<00:02:00.640> is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
galvanized material and one thing is

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.460 
galvanized material and one thing is
what<00:02:00.970> to<00:02:01.090> mention<00:02:02.010> also<00:02:03.010> installed<00:02:03.550> a<00:02:03.700> young

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
what to mention also installed a young

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:13.070 
what to mention also installed a young
electronic<00:02:05.470> ignition<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.899> there<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.170> have<00:02:11.200> it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
electronic ignition so there you have it

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.950 
electronic ignition so there you have it
twin<00:02:14.080> gas<00:02:14.350> rotisserie
