00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 the mid-Atlantic back where 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.649
 Eurasian and American 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.210
 continental plates inside goes right in the middle 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.070
 across the country from southwest to northeast 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.039
 every year the plates separate 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.050
 about two centimeters 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.289
 this phenomenon is especially good for the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 ping we are watching that all 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.990
 tourists are shown here 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.289
 obligatory picture that every island 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.320
 should ever have visitors in a photo album 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.410
 foot on the Eurasian and on the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.719
 American plate is the thing 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 but not as easy to 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.289
 both plates move away in one 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 million years to about 20 kilometer so 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.030
 Of course nobody has long legs 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.260
 the column between the two plates 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.590
 do not stay open 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.600
 she feels with liquid magma 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 this channel magma chamber underground 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 stay hidden or to the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.799
 penetrate the earth's surface 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.229
 surface water for example as 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.049
 rainwater or molten water in the 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.750
 area of â€‹â€‹a magma chamber becomes this 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.479
 heated and can be spontaneous as hot 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 water stream or fight again the 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.830
 reach the surface of the earth 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 to amaze and delight the tourists 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.189
 like here the famous geyser stopwatch 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.049
 or the water and steam eruptions in the 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.049
 sold honor field would be 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.890
 What happens here in nature spontaneously 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.649
 can directly as a source of hot water, for example 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.299
 or indirectly via bore to 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:52.430
 energy recovery can be used 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.940
 the capital reykjavik sits in the middle 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.720
 on the mid-Atlantic back 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.990
 that probably does not happen 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.470
 about the way back also means 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 bay 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.690
 that could indicate that already 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.509
 the first settlers geotherm all 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.069
 had interest and from the hot water 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:15.019
 sources in the bay wanted to profit 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.380
 There is no energy crisis in Iceland 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:21.560
 the earth heat is used for the production of 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.410
 district heating and more recently also from 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.540
 electricity used 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.049
 The heat of the earth has a share of almost 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.530
 60 percent of the primary energy was 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:35.390
 World lace means the use of 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.030
 become geothermal energy 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.820
 low temperature and high temperature 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.370
 fields differ in the low 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:47.450
 temperature fields here little black 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.570
 Dots is primarily used to generate district heat 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.840
 high temperature fields big red dots 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.079
 lie in cuban territory and become 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.820
 for electricity generation and district heating 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.620
 used 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.680
 At the moment, there are six major ones 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.650
 geothermal power plants thereby triangles 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.829
 displayed operated 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.980
 three of them will be introduced shortly 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:16.130
 the power plant is located north of the lake 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.380
 how wait for the kavlak raute one 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.670
 public road crosses the 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.670
 power plant terrain 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:37.140
 the views of the deep holes lie 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:41.450
 partly new on the street 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.530
 power plant took his business in 1977 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.300
 it is noteworthy that during the 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.970
 construction time in about two kilometers 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:52.620
 distance to a series of funk 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.560
 outbreaks took place the lavafelder 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.560
 were made accessible to the tourists 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:07.050
 the still steaming testifies 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.680
 from the dramatic construction phase of the 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:14.819
 power plant this has an output of 60 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.769
 megawatt the power plant to heidi 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.250
 is located in the southern part of the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.790
 Henkel mountains the power plant his 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.010
 operational in 2006 recorded located in 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:30.330
 construction and eventually becomes one 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.790
 Capacity of 300 megawatts of electricity and 400 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.700
 megawatts of thermal energy 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.979
 It will be the largest thermal power plant 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.960
 his 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:42.200
 the visitor center bears this circumstance 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.479
 already today 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:48.810
 the power plant that yes because here is 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:52.640
 In any case, the handle it mountains 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:57.690
 produces 120 megawatts of electricity 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:59.520
 380 megawatts of district heating for Reykjavik the 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:02.789
 District heating is here in contrast 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.270
 to helis heidi power station british 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:09.820
 misplaced that is not exactly beautiful 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:12.460
 but instructive 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.750
 the thermal water will pass 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:21.670
 pumped from where it is with gravity 27 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:26.500
 km along the road 435 to Reykjavik 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:28.960
 flows before the water is out now 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.840
 local low temperature fields or 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.660
 from high temperature fields to the 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.540
 Households will be delivered in 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:40.180
 stored tanks 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.100
 the best known hot water tank plant in 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.830
 Reykjavik is pearls 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.720
 this belongs to the architectural 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:54.540
 landmark of the city per country captivates 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.540
 by the simple clear line guidance 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:07.430
 The six storage tanks enclose in the 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:10.750
 ground floor a hall with exhibitions 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.520
 and shops as well as the sager museum 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.590
 the restaurant that once in two 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.930
 hours around its own axis turns 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.210
 is under a huge 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.740
 glaskuppel 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.020
 we are now on the terrace with 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:27.620
 fantastic view of the city 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:30.169
 and the slumbering volcano handle the 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.639
 the northernmost capital in europe 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:33.639
 comforting heat supplied
