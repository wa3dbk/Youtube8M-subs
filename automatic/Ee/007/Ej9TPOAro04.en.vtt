00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.390 
would you have done the same I believe
so<00:04:36.139> it's<00:04:36.350> just<00:04:36.470> a<00:04:36.530> scary<00:04:36.830> board<00:04:37.100> we<00:04:37.220> both

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
so it's just a scary board we both

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.980 
so it's just a scary board we both
started<00:04:37.699> with<00:04:37.820> 500<00:04:38.000> thousand<00:04:38.570> from<00:04:38.750> this

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
started with 500 thousand from this

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.480 
started with 500 thousand from this
needle<00:04:39.350> was<00:04:39.560> neither<00:04:39.800> one<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.010> us<00:04:40.160> want<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.400> go

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
needle was neither one of us want to go

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.219 
needle was neither one of us want to go
broke<00:04:40.610> there<00:04:40.910> if<00:04:41.240> this<00:04:41.479> hand<00:04:41.690> had<00:04:41.780> happens<00:04:42.080> at

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
broke there if this hand had happens at

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:43.540 
broke there if this hand had happens at
the<00:04:42.350> end<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.740> session<00:04:42.919> instead<00:04:43.310> of<00:04:43.400> at<00:04:43.490> the

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the end of the session instead of at the

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.500 
the end of the session instead of at the
beginning<00:04:43.880> do<00:04:43.970> you<00:04:44.030> think<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.270> might<00:04:44.389> have

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
beginning do you think it might have

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.450 
beginning do you think it might have
gone<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.660> little<00:04:44.780> differently<00:04:45.100> yeah<00:04:46.100> it<00:04:46.340> could

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
gone a little differently yeah it could

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.800 
gone a little differently yeah it could
have<00:04:46.550> gone<00:04:46.729> differently<00:04:47.150> it<00:04:47.389> also<00:04:47.510> could<00:04:47.750> have

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
have gone differently it also could have

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.840 
have gone differently it also could have
gone<00:04:47.930> differently<00:04:48.110> if<00:04:48.410> we<00:04:48.530> just<00:04:48.740> if<00:04:49.310> we<00:04:49.700> both

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
gone differently if we just if we both

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.370 
gone differently if we just if we both
would<00:04:50.030> have<00:04:50.120> had<00:04:50.210> 200,000<00:04:50.960> in<00:04:51.020> front<00:04:51.200> of<00:04:51.260> us

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
would have had 200,000 in front of us

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.560 
would have had 200,000 in front of us
instead<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.740> 500<00:04:51.919> probably<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.060> money<00:04:53.240> all

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
instead of 500 probably the money all

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.270 
instead of 500 probably the money all
the<00:04:53.660> money<00:04:53.690> would<00:04:53.990> have<00:04:54.050> been<00:04:54.110> in<00:04:54.320> the<00:04:54.979> middle

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
the money would have been in the middle

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.460 
the money would have been in the middle
but<00:04:56.090> you<00:04:56.180> know<00:04:56.240> if<00:04:56.389> we<00:04:56.570> have<00:04:56.720> we<00:04:56.900> play<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.139> lot<00:04:57.349> of

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
but you know if we have we play a lot of

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.140 
but you know if we have we play a lot of
hours<00:04:57.740> with<00:04:57.919> each<00:04:57.979> other<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.400> we<00:04:58.520> come<00:04:58.700> in<00:04:58.849> know

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
hours with each other so we come in know

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.800 
hours with each other so we come in know
where<00:04:59.330> we<00:04:59.450> stand

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
where we stand

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.610 
where we stand
pants<00:05:00.650> that's<00:05:01.160> an<00:05:01.280> understatement
