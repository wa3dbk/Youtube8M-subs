00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
using thin brush and white acrylic paint

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.660 
using thin brush and white acrylic paint
start<00:00:50.280> painting<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> base<00:00:52.409> of<00:00:52.769> your<00:00:52.800> icicles

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
start painting the base of your icicles

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:08.600 
start painting the base of your icicles
near<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.720> cuticle

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.630 

now<00:01:09.610> outline<00:01:09.970> your<00:01:10.570> first<00:01:10.960> icicle<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:12.430> will

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
now outline your first icicle this will

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.310 
now outline your first icicle this will
be<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.000> main<00:01:13.180> one<00:01:13.450> and<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:14.110> biggest<00:01:14.320> one<00:01:16.320> try

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
be the main one and the biggest one try

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.100 
be the main one and the biggest one try
to<00:01:17.350> paint<00:01:17.680> the<00:01:17.890> lines<00:01:18.180> they'll<00:01:19.180> uneven<00:01:19.930> and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
to paint the lines they'll uneven and

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.360 
to paint the lines they'll uneven and
wavy<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.730> looks<00:01:21.970> like<00:01:22.180> real<00:01:22.420> icicles

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.760 

outline<00:01:27.370> more<00:01:27.730> smaller<00:01:28.330> icicles<00:01:29.230> next<00:01:29.680> to

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
outline more smaller icicles next to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.070 
outline more smaller icicles next to
each<00:01:29.920> other<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.490> fill<00:01:31.390> them<00:01:31.600> with<00:01:31.630> white

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
each other and fill them with white

00:01:32.080 --> 00:02:22.009 
each other and fill them with white
paint

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.380 

so<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.260> is<00:02:23.439> the<00:02:23.590> base<00:02:23.829> for<00:02:24.159> the<00:02:24.489> icicles<00:02:25.120> done

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
so this is the base for the icicles done

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.410 
so this is the base for the icicles done
and<00:02:25.950> now<00:02:26.950> we're<00:02:27.159> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> let<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.640> dry<00:02:28.030> for<00:02:28.060> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and now we're going to let it dry for a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.750 
and now we're going to let it dry for a
bit<00:02:30.870> while<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.079> nail<00:02:32.230> was<00:02:32.439> drying<00:02:32.799> I<00:02:33.159> mixed<00:02:33.700> up

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
bit while the nail was drying I mixed up

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.720 
bit while the nail was drying I mixed up
light<00:02:34.000> blue<00:02:34.329> color<00:02:34.659> which<00:02:35.230> now<00:02:35.439> we'll<00:02:35.739> use<00:02:35.980> for

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
light blue color which now we'll use for

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.670 
light blue color which now we'll use for
darker<00:02:37.510> shades<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.400> icicles<00:02:40.530> paint<00:02:41.530> a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
darker shades in icicles paint a

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.789 
darker shades in icicles paint a
slightly<00:02:42.159> shaky<00:02:42.670> line<00:02:42.879> on<00:02:43.569> the<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.140> side<00:02:44.500> of

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
slightly shaky line on the right side of

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.759
