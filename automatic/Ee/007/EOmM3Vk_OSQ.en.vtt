00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:13.809
 we are often asked to arrange 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.750
 drilling machine which sometimes 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.730
 appears in our commercials it is very 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:25.300
 old machine at least i im 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.800
 enjoyed the earliest childhood in 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.949
 material shortage conditions 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.520
 it was constructed from which everything got 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:37.510
 laugh at you idea their little first 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:43.360
 Morse telegraph collected from what 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.039
 got it like this is boring 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.449
 the machine was created in the dormitory of the Institute 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:51.489
 cinema engineers respectively and 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.539
 most of its parts are borrowed 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.539
 from the movie parador 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.170
 resistant console 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.750
 made of parts like stool and 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.000
 seat base for durability 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.880
 places among her parts are set 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.280
 plywood kerchiefs 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:00.649
 for transportation of the machine is provided 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.649
 detachable connection resistant to base 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.090
 just loosen the nut and in and wind 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.090
 to put the machine in a flat diplomat 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.039
 Needless to say lift table too 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.039
 unscrew 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.120
 most of the details table and 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.840
 made of wood 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.910
 he was also designed on the go therefore 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.800
 its walls are made of docked plywood 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:40.400
 the fact is that it was first made by itself 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:45.950
 table and then fit him 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.310
 lifting the lever originally stand 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.200
 located in the middle of the base 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.570
 pushing the lever I gave tilting 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.120
 effort machine as we wanted to fix on 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.190
 Clamp the table so that it does not 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.980
 rolled over this defect was eliminated 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.739
 shifting the strut to the left 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.860
 no now vector application by force not 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.620
 beyond the area of â€‹â€‹the supports former 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.030
 penalty position reminds this ridiculous 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.640
 pass one more minus design 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.620
 is that the engine power 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.030
 in film projectors carried 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.030
 voltage 127 in 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:29.470
 had to power the drilling machine from 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.600
 ready autotransformer 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.530
 or laboratory which for short 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.530
 called later 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.590
 but in the end turned up pretty 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.879
 flat transformer 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.500
 that fit in a flat base and 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.450
 sin would not take it 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:58.420
 low voltage winding for lighting 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:04:01.750
 place of drilling under the throne at the time 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.769
 creating a machine here was very rusty and 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.310
 old and even after the kerosene bath and 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.170
 abundant lubrication of his already well-worn species 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.670
 crackers so ambiguous 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.769
 clamped with a drill that once installed 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.709
 him with a minimum of beating him already 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.180
 did not touch so that this machine with us 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.220
 applies only to drilling 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.220
 holes for two types of radio components 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.210
 swelling 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.620
 look at the smartphone that's it 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.900
 going to the next order goods we 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.290
 purchased a small cartridge for just 115 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.290
 rubles 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.800
 then mow or technical ufo market 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.520
 on video collet clamp for thin 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:14.860
 drilled with a set of center costs 150 rubles 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:17.800
 and what we can construct from 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.580
 these details tell a little about it 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.580
 our
