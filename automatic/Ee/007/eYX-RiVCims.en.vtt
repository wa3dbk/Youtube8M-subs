phase 2
technically<00:03:24.640> Avengers<00:03:25.299> age<00:03:25.390> of<00:03:25.510> Ultron<00:03:25.630> was

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
technically Avengers age of Ultron was

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.990 
technically Avengers age of Ultron was
the<00:03:26.200> end<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.410> phase<00:03:26.590> 2<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.160> really<00:03:27.459> ant-man<00:03:27.760> is

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
the end of phase 2 but really ant-man is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.060 
the end of phase 2 but really ant-man is
the<00:03:28.150> bookend<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.660> that<00:03:28.840> it's<00:03:29.500> really<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.829> job

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
the bookend to that it's really the job

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:31.289 
the bookend to that it's really the job
of<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.310> film<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.670> show<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.060> anybody

of this film to show you that anybody

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.050 
of this film to show you that anybody
including<00:03:31.630> ex-cons<00:03:32.560> can<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.100> big<00:03:33.370> heroes<00:03:33.790> like

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
including ex-cons can be big heroes like

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.879 
including ex-cons can be big heroes like
the<00:03:34.090> Avengers<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:35.290> way<00:03:35.410> I'm<00:03:35.530> thinking<00:03:35.560> about

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
the Avengers the way I'm thinking about

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:36.870 
the Avengers the way I'm thinking about
ant-man<00:03:36.250> right<00:03:36.519> now

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
ant-man right now

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.310 
ant-man right now
in<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> context<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> the<00:03:37.570> Avengers<00:03:37.930> is<00:03:38.140> that

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
in the context of the Avengers is that

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.990 
in the context of the Avengers is that
when<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:38.800> get<00:03:38.950> to<00:03:39.100> Captain<00:03:39.460> America's<00:03:39.820> Civil

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
when we get to Captain America's Civil

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.970 
when we get to Captain America's Civil
War<00:03:40.300> he'll<00:03:40.750> be<00:03:40.870> like<00:03:41.020> the<00:03:41.110> guy<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.290> let<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:41.860> air

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
War he'll be like the guy to let the air

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.740 
War he'll be like the guy to let the air
out<00:03:42.010> of<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.370> balloon<00:03:42.610> before<00:03:42.820> it<00:03:43.060> pops<00:03:43.270> just

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
out of the balloon before it pops just

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.240 
out of the balloon before it pops just
because<00:03:43.960> the<00:03:44.080> tension<00:03:44.380> will<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.560> so<00:03:44.890> crazy

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
because the tension will be so crazy

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.490 
because the tension will be so crazy
between<00:03:45.520> Captain<00:03:46.030> America<00:03:46.330> and<00:03:46.360> Iron<00:03:46.450> Man<00:03:46.750> but

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
between Captain America and Iron Man but

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.630 
between Captain America and Iron Man but
I<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:47.740> the<00:03:47.830> way<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.010> clip<00:03:48.190> tells<00:03:48.370> you<00:03:48.460> he's

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
I like the way the clip tells you he's

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.790 
I like the way the clip tells you he's
not<00:03:48.790> just<00:03:49.060> an<00:03:49.180> ex-con<00:03:49.450> he<00:03:49.990> is<00:03:50.140> an<00:03:50.380> engineer

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
not just an ex-con he is an engineer

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.650 
not just an ex-con he is an engineer
like<00:03:50.950> he<00:03:51.100> has<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> very<00:03:51.700> advanced<00:03:52.060> degree<00:03:52.510> he's

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
like he has a very advanced degree he's

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.600 
like he has a very advanced degree he's
very<00:03:52.840> smart<00:03:53.170> person<00:03:53.350> he's<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.040> just<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.310> common

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
very smart person he's not just a common

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.990 
very smart person he's not just a common
thief

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
thief

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.760 
thief
so<00:03:55.150> like<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.480> film<00:03:55.870> will<00:03:55.990> explain<00:03:56.320> that<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:56.680> if

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
so like the film will explain that so if

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.230 
so like the film will explain that so if
you<00:03:56.830> read<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.100> comics<00:03:57.490> he's<00:03:57.670> not<00:03:57.850> like<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
you read the comics he's not like the

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.910 
you read the comics he's not like the
Eric<00:03:58.600> O'Grady<00:03:59.140> ant-man<00:03:59.530> he's<00:03:59.770> not

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
Eric O'Grady ant-man he's not

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.350

irredeemable ant-man

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.420 
irredeemable ant-man
maybe<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.140> little<00:04:02.350> morally<00:04:02.740> grave<00:04:02.950> but<00:04:03.130> really

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
maybe a little morally grave but really

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.710 
maybe a little morally grave but really
it's<00:04:03.550> his<00:04:03.670> relationship<00:04:04.180> with<00:04:04.330> his<00:04:04.510> daughter

it's his relationship with his daughter

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.020 
it's his relationship with his daughter
