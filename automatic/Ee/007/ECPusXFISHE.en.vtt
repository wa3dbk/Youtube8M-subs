different process let's quickly run
through<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> ingredients<00:00:40.620> refined<00:00:41.250> flour

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
through the ingredients refined flour

powder vanilla essence lemon rind soft
butter<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> begin<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.940> let's<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:51.539> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
butter so to begin with let's take the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:00.180 
butter so to begin with let's take the
eggs

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.270 

so<00:01:01.190> after<00:01:01.489> we've<00:01:01.640> beaten<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.120> eggs<00:01:02.239> let's<00:01:02.780> add

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
so after we've beaten the eggs let's add

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.200 
so after we've beaten the eggs let's add
Demerara<00:01:04.280> sugar<00:01:04.750> grain<00:01:05.750> sugar<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:07.759> 2

Demerara sugar grain sugar and 2
vanillas<00:01:08.690> cents<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.170> this<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:10.700> we<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.119> beat

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
vanillas cents to this and we to beat

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:19.890 
vanillas cents to this and we to beat
this<00:01:11.600> stage<00:01:11.990> Ruben<00:01:12.350> stage

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.980 

so<00:01:20.900> this<00:01:21.229> is<00:01:21.409> what<00:01:21.650> I<00:01:21.680> mean<00:01:22.010> by<00:01:22.280> ribbon<00:01:22.640> stage

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
so this is what I mean by ribbon stage

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.410 
so this is what I mean by ribbon stage
you<00:01:23.990> see<00:01:24.170> this<00:01:24.320> if<00:01:24.530> I<00:01:24.650> lift<00:01:25.250> up<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.580> meter<00:01:25.820> this

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you see this if I lift up the meter this

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.410 
you see this if I lift up the meter this
falls<00:01:26.780> like<00:01:27.140> ribbons<00:01:27.830> so<00:01:28.640> we<00:01:28.759> stop<00:01:29.060> at<00:01:29.240> this

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
falls like ribbons so we stop at this

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.130 
falls like ribbons so we stop at this
stage<00:01:30.220> so<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.369> eggs<00:01:31.640> are<00:01:32.000> beaten<00:01:32.360> well<00:01:32.570> so

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
stage so the eggs are beaten well so

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.749 
stage so the eggs are beaten well so
what<00:01:33.320> we<00:01:33.470> have<00:01:33.590> to<00:01:33.680> do<00:01:33.799> with<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.070> receive<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
what we have to do with you receive the

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.760 
what we have to do with you receive the
flower<00:01:35.060> into<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.659> eggs<00:01:35.840> but<00:01:36.140> prior<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.440> that<00:01:36.590> I

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
flower into the eggs but prior to that I

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.590 
flower into the eggs but prior to that I
need<00:01:36.979> to<00:01:37.250> melt<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:37.729> butter<00:01:37.790> for<00:01:38.360> which<00:01:38.479> I'm

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
need to melt this butter for which I'm

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.990 
need to melt this butter for which I'm
going<00:01:38.720> to<00:01:38.780> put<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.290> microwave<00:01:46.000> so

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
going to put this in the microwave so

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.639 
going to put this in the microwave so
melted<00:01:47.450> butter<00:01:47.720> is<00:01:47.960> something<00:01:48.259> that<00:01:48.380> we<00:01:48.470> gonna

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
melted butter is something that we gonna

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.499 
melted butter is something that we gonna
pour<00:01:48.920> at<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.190> end<00:01:49.369> but<00:01:49.700> prior<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:49.970> that<00:01:50.149> we'll

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
pour at the end but prior to that we'll

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.419 
pour at the end but prior to that we'll
sieve<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.049> flour<00:01:51.080> baking<00:01:51.830> powder<00:01:51.860> together

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
sieve the flour baking powder together

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.910 
sieve the flour baking powder together
into<00:01:53.030> this<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.720> what<00:01:53.899> we'll<00:01:54.080> do<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.410> we'll<00:01:54.590> see

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
into this so what we'll do is we'll see

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.649 
into this so what we'll do is we'll see
if<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.399> flour<00:01:55.729> along<00:01:56.450> with<00:01:57.190> salt<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.729> baking

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
if the flour along with salt and baking

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:08.029 
if the flour along with salt and baking
powder

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.830 

after<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.160> add<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.520> flower<00:02:09.910> very<00:02:10.360> lightly

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
after we add in the flower very lightly

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.559 
after we add in the flower very lightly
fold<00:02:11.410> this<00:02:11.590> in<00:02:11.830> make<00:02:12.430> sure<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.940> don't<00:02:13.209> really

fold this in make sure you don't really

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.750 
fold this in make sure you don't really
get<00:02:13.930> rid<00:02:14.200> of<00:02:14.260> all<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.920> aeration<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.580> you've

gets<00:02:26.290> mixed<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:26.890> at<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> same<00:02:27.310> time<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.910> don't

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
gets mixed in at the same time you don't

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.170 
gets mixed in at the same time you don't
lose<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.810> aeration<00:02:29.140> so<00:02:29.860> gently<00:02:30.550> with<00:02:30.730> gentle

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
lose the aeration so gently with gentle

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.540 
lose the aeration so gently with gentle
hands<00:02:31.420> just<00:02:31.840> fold<00:02:32.200> this<00:02:32.380> in<00:02:32.620> there's<00:02:33.459> another

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
hands just fold this in there's another

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.759 
hands just fold this in there's another
way<00:02:33.910> to<00:02:33.970> do<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.480> number<00:02:34.810> eight<00:02:34.989> like<00:02:35.470> this

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.910 

so<00:02:38.769> after<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.340> fold<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:41.049> eggs<00:02:41.290> will<00:02:41.739> have

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
so after we fold it the eggs will have

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.949 
so after we fold it the eggs will have
to<00:02:42.040> pour<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.610> butter<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.690> butter

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
to pour in the butter so this butter

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.660 
to pour in the butter so this butter
which<00:02:44.290> was<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.739> microwave<00:02:45.310> I'm<00:02:45.430> just

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
which was in the microwave I'm just

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.550 
which was in the microwave I'm just
pouring<00:02:45.880> it<00:02:46.150> into<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.420> bigger<00:02:46.750> bowl<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.290> it<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
pouring it into a bigger bowl for it to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.890 
pouring it into a bigger bowl for it to
cool<00:02:47.860> because<00:02:48.489> we<00:02:48.790> can't<00:02:49.090> really<00:02:49.330> pour<00:02:49.720> this

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
cool because we can't really pour this

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.110 
cool because we can't really pour this
into<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.230> batter<00:02:50.530> which<00:02:50.799> has<00:02:50.980> eggs<00:02:51.280> cause<00:02:51.700> if

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
into a batter which has eggs cause if

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.479 
into a batter which has eggs cause if
you<00:02:52.390> put<00:02:52.599> hot<00:02:52.840> butter<00:02:53.200> into<00:02:53.799> eggs<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.310> eggs

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
you put hot butter into eggs the eggs

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.820 
you put hot butter into eggs the eggs
are<00:02:54.700> sure<00:02:54.849> to<00:02:55.060> scramble<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.230> have<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.650> let

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
are sure to scramble so you have to let

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.830 
are sure to scramble so you have to let
this<00:02:57.099> cool<00:02:57.700> or<00:02:57.940> add<00:02:58.060> this<00:02:58.209> come<00:02:58.480> to<00:02:58.660> room

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
this cool or add this come to room

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.860 
this cool or add this come to room
temperature<00:02:59.610> okay<00:03:00.610> so<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.880> is<00:03:01.030> good<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.269> go

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
temperature okay so this is good to go

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.770 
temperature okay so this is good to go
so<00:03:02.470> before<00:03:02.829> I<00:03:02.860> put<00:03:03.040> all<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:04.120> into<00:03:04.450> this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
so before I put all of this into this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.229 
so before I put all of this into this
I'm<00:03:05.440> going<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:05.860> take<00:03:06.220> some<00:03:06.549> portion<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.060> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
I'm going to take some portion of the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:15.809 
I'm going to take some portion of the
batter<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:10.500> just<00:03:11.500> mix<00:03:11.890> this<00:03:12.130> well<00:03:13.980> okay<00:03:14.980> and

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
batter and just mix this well okay and

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.920 
batter and just mix this well okay and
now<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.180> pour<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.260> entire<00:03:17.440> thing<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
now we pour the entire thing a lot of

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.990 
now we pour the entire thing a lot of
people<00:03:20.079> also<00:03:20.680> refer<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.190> Madeline<00:03:21.700> there's

this<00:03:36.609> batter<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:37.180> come<00:03:37.480> out<00:03:37.600> really<00:03:37.989> smooth<00:03:41.730> so

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
this batter is come out really smooth so

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.120 
this batter is come out really smooth so
our<00:03:42.850> batter<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.329> done<00:03:43.630> now<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.889> pour

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
our batter is done now we have to pour

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.890 
our batter is done now we have to pour
this<00:03:45.340> into<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.790> Madeleine<00:03:46.299> mold<00:03:46.569> for<00:03:46.780> which

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
this into the Madeleine mold for which

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.600 
this into the Madeleine mold for which
I'll<00:03:47.079> use<00:03:47.230> a<00:03:47.340> piping<00:03:48.340> bag

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.090 

the<00:03:55.610> battery<00:03:55.940> is<00:03:56.060> quite<00:03:56.360> runny<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.470> best<00:03:57.830> thing

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
the battery is quite runny so best thing

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.290 
the battery is quite runny so best thing
is<00:03:58.220> to<00:03:58.250> use<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.550> piping<00:03:59.060> bag<00:04:00.100> so<00:04:01.100> your<00:04:01.670> goes<00:04:02.060> in

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
is to use a piping bag so your goes in

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.930 
is to use a piping bag so your goes in
the<00:04:02.540> batter<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:03.830> batter<00:04:03.860> is<00:04:04.280> quite<00:04:04.550> runny

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
the batter the batter is quite runny

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.090 
the batter the batter is quite runny
which<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.360> why<00:04:05.630> I<00:04:05.660> am<00:04:06.110> using<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.620> piping<00:04:07.070> bag

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
which is why I am using a piping bag

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.210 
which is why I am using a piping bag
call<00:04:07.550> it<00:04:07.670> becomes<00:04:08.000> really<00:04:08.390> easy<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.140> pour<00:04:09.950> out

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
call it becomes really easy to pour out

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.080 
call it becomes really easy to pour out
the<00:04:10.459> batter<00:04:10.670> into<00:04:10.940> a<00:04:11.120> mold<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.880> it's<00:04:13.880> also

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
the batter into a mold and it's also

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.860 
the batter into a mold and it's also
less<00:04:14.930> messy<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.920> will<00:04:16.100> cut<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:17.060> tip<00:04:17.359> of<00:04:17.660> this

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
less messy we will cut the tip of this

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:35.689 
less messy we will cut the tip of this
pour<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.680> batter<00:04:22.660> don't<00:04:23.660> overfill<00:04:24.320> this

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.029 

the<00:04:36.419> Madeleine<00:04:36.810> moles<00:04:37.110> are<00:04:37.349> done<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.860> how

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:38.039 
the Madeleine moles are done and how

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:40.040 
the Madeleine moles are done and how
this<00:04:38.189> will<00:04:38.370> go<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.789> oven<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:39.599> baking<00:04:39.900> time

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
this will go in the oven the baking time

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.779 
this will go in the oven the baking time
in<00:04:40.259> case<00:04:40.409> what<00:04:40.590> Madeleine<00:04:40.949> is<00:04:41.099> very<00:04:41.310> less<00:04:41.520> this

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
in case what Madeleine is very less this

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.670 
in case what Madeleine is very less this
shouldn't<00:04:42.300> take<00:04:42.360> more<00:04:42.629> than<00:04:42.689> 10<00:04:43.199> to<00:04:43.379> 15

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680

take time however we'll check for ten
minutes<00:04:49.530> and<00:04:49.860> then<00:04:50.219> if<00:04:50.370> it's<00:04:50.520> needed<00:04:50.909> we<00:04:51.030> may

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
minutes and then if it's needed we may

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.790 
minutes and then if it's needed we may
leave<00:04:51.330> it<00:04:51.419> for<00:04:51.569> another<00:04:51.689> five<00:04:52.110> minutes

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
leave it for another five minutes

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.559 
leave it for another five minutes
so<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.159> Madeline's<00:04:53.580> have<00:04:53.759> gone<00:04:53.969> in<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.240> oven

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:54.569 
so the Madeline's have gone in the oven

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:56.659 
so the Madeline's have gone in the oven
and<00:04:54.780> you're<00:04:55.349> baking<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.740> at<00:04:55.860> 180<00:04:56.310> degrees

and you're baking it at 180 degrees
Celsius<00:04:56.699> this<00:04:57.330> will<00:04:57.509> not<00:04:57.689> take<00:04:57.870> more<00:04:58.110> than<00:04:58.229> 10

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
Celsius this will not take more than 10

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.219 
Celsius this will not take more than 10
to<00:04:58.800> 15<00:04:59.189> minutes<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.669> after<00:05:00.330> 15<00:05:00.659> minutes<00:05:00.870> this

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
to 15 minutes and after 15 minutes this

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.809 
to 15 minutes and after 15 minutes this
would<00:05:01.409> be<00:05:01.590> done<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.009> we<00:05:02.129> will<00:05:02.250> have<00:05:02.490> it<00:05:02.520> with<00:05:02.789> a
