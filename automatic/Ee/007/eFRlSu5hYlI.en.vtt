00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.240
 hello so here so the demonstration 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.320
 of the first smart hole omate watch 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.109
 of the name so this is the first model 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.060
 available on the market 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:26.070
 this is the first smartwatch 2.0 watch 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.849
 laurent does why 2.0 because she is 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.859
 autonomous 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.499
 it can work as a simple 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.980
 smartphone so all in one with his card 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.560
 sim 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.970
 so we can integrate here in 3g 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.490
 3g sim card that lets you switch 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.840
 your calls send your sms receive your 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.090
 emails connect you on your 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.390
 social network apps like 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.000
 whatsapp skype yes facebook twitter 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.390
 all that is usual about the product 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.250
 integrates a 5 megapixel 720p camera into 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.250
 memory in high definition video 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.920
 here 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.739
 so the cameras here is a button 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.640
 to put on standby to turn on as 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.640
 this to unlock 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.390
 we then have different styles of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.260
 watch dials not forget that it's 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.260
 of course a watch 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.630
 here is the riddle here we have either 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.450
 numerically either needles and one has 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.310
 two hundred and 200 frames in different there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 we really have a whole bunch of a whole bunch 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.140
 of things Saturday the day he counted 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.020
 serve 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.340
 so we can download it via 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.409
 store so to the score it's the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.320
 applications dedicated to mint dedicated to 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.140
 its format the watch runs on android 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.720
 4.2.2 jelly bean that has been reformatted at 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.850
 size level for the screen so he 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 is really dedicated to the products well one 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.930
 spoke here more than a microphone that we 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.220
 allows you to control and pass 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.119
 calls without bluetooth headset but 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.390
 of course we can connect a 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.390
 Bluetooth earpiece 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.610
 so the mp3 player can listen to 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.020
 the music was sending it to mine 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.860
 so we are on the first model on 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.280
 is in 512 + 4 gigas the second model 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 will be available from April rather 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.850
 put it will be available in 1 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.650
 giga plus 8 gigabyte so this second 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.950
 version of the performantes in terms of 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.950
 memory 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:22.920
 the bracelet is the coach or the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 classic that's with then for 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.460
 the moment one model but your arms 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.600
 it's the GPS antenna built into 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.670
 brassens 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.370
 so with a very accurate gps keyboard 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.010
 flexi for a lot more keyboard 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.290
 much more intuitive despite the whole 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.900
 small screen size so with a 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.070
 corrector of the word propositions on 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.810
 goes into something it's very intuitive 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.700
 also sonic emotion boarded at 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.430
 level are so for a big 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.130
 comfort 3d costs we see it 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.480
 headphones or headphones but 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.250
 also to concentrate lessons from the top 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.220
 speaker to optimize to the maximum 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.680
 we reduce the field of speakers to 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.410
 maximum to have made the most of the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.400
 sound of the speakers here is that the sound 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.400
 do not scatter 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.930
