00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 before starting this video I want 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.660
 advise you a bigworld game project 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.470
 rolle play server is on stage 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.300
 development 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.849
 but you can join him right 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 it is now possible to become a future player 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 on their page you can watch the blog 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.619
 development reference in the description view 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.779
 The author is private and may not 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.320
 match viewers and creators 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.390
 the project 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.730
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.769
 today we will see a game project 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.960
 absolute rolle play for this project 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.540
 There are 4 game servers, three of which 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.579
 have a rolle play mode but call them 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.559
 role can only be under spice or under 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.780
 something heavier because no adequate 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.239
 man just can't say what it is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 really rp server 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 daily average online about 600 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.110
 the most visited person of course first 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.420
 the server is on it and I filmed the material 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 for this review well let's 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.949
 let's start at registration they offer us 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.289
 set a password for the future account 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.420
 and choose the skin of course this skins 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.280
 homeless and no diversity here 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.460
 expect not worth the same we can 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.650
 translate our nickname into Russian 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.659
 right at the beginning there is a mini story and then 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 the system immediately offers us to go 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.260
 on one of the works 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.750
 we choose the shop and look at what of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.220
 this work presents itself to me 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.869
 or have I already seen it somewhere 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 looking at the statistics of our character we 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.030
 can see something butchers before 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.250
 counter drift blyat motif counter and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.619
 also drift record server how would 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.009
 hints that go fuck with your rolle 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.630
 play 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.090
 because as we can see the players 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.039
 server does not know how to drive each 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.899
 the second is some kind of autistic who 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.390
 spat on all those where he 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.490
 can you please still in cars 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.799
 notice the neon light which 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.020
 peculiar to 30 servers and kill 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.090
 sheet which is also peculiar to 3 in 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.399
 dns servers and not at all 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.899
 combined with the rolle play chat project 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.970
 forever clogged by actions 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.640
 administrations that I personally do 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.590
 not interesting and returning to the wake-up 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.679
 we players want to point out that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.759
 absolutely all the players is just as well, shock 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.759
 there is simply no comment 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 among the interiors can not be noted at all 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.170
 Well, actually nothing at all nothing 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.210
 good site is well designed but it is no longer 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.430
 surprises we saw the design 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.640
 better by the way on the site you can see 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:44.040
 the administration action log and I was 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.200
 interesting here is this item it gives us 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.480
 the right to think that the administration is paying 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.670
 add your friends to your account 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.010
 game currency on the forum can be found 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.200
 sections and biographies but biographies there 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.780
 not just a whole lot of arbors and 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.460
 some left themes can be seen that section 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.100
 the administration is simply not 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.170
 Models on this all I no longer want 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.390
 spend your time on this gods project 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.410
 just a pathetic parody of the rp server and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.770
 Nothing more 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.870
 my rating to this server is 0 out of 10 thanks 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.060
 for watching and don't forget to leave yours 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.740
 opinion in the comments all helpful
