going from Z all the way down to a so we

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.699 
going from Z all the way down to a so we
can<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.910> course<00:03:22.180> control<00:03:22.780> how<00:03:23.320> they're<00:03:23.530> being

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
can of course control how they're being

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.050 
can of course control how they're being

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.050 
go backward and forward in the order

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.430 
go backward and forward in the order
that<00:06:41.080> I

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
that I
