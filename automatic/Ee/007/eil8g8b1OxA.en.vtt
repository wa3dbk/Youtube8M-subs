want as long as it's easy as long as

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010 
want as long as it's easy as long as
it's<00:01:04.320> something<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:05.570> because<00:01:06.570> along

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it's something different because along

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.170 
it's something different because along
with<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.710> physical<00:01:08.220> rest<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.790> really

think you need that little mental break
you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.180> if<00:01:12.240> you've<00:01:12.360> been<00:01:12.450> trained<00:01:12.990> really

down<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.670> crash<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.909> little<00:01:27.270> hard<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.780> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
down and crash a little hard and you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
down and crash a little hard and you
just<00:01:28.350> are<00:01:28.560> exhausted<00:01:29.250> mentally<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.000> idea<00:01:30.329> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
just are exhausted mentally the idea of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
just are exhausted mentally the idea of
getting<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> gym<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.799> doing<00:01:32.369> something

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
getting in the gym and doing something

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.730 
getting in the gym and doing something
really<00:01:33.030> difficult<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:33.990> heavy<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
really difficult really heavy can be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.819 
really difficult really heavy can be
pretty<00:01:35.520> unappealing<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.720> think<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
pretty unappealing so I think it's a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.060 
pretty unappealing so I think it's a
really<00:01:38.340> important<00:01:38.759> time<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.090> take<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.450> break

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
really important time to take that break

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.319 
really important time to take that break
mentally<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.189> physically<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.030> mix<00:01:42.210> it

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
mentally and physically and just mix it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.170 
mentally and physically and just mix it
up<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> program<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.820> stuck

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
up and not have a program to be stuck

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.810 
up and not have a program to be stuck
with<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.899> not<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.070> do<00:01:47.159> any<00:01:47.310> exercises

with and not have to do any exercises
you<00:01:48.210> really<00:01:48.720> don't<00:01:48.899> feel<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.320> doing

this<00:04:01.470> came<00:04:01.709> up<00:04:01.739> but<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.190> push<00:04:02.370> press<00:04:02.639> to<00:04:02.790> me<00:04:02.940> is

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
this came up but the push press to me is

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.930 
this came up but the push press to me is
it<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.419> really<00:04:04.229> really<00:04:05.099> useful<00:04:05.430> exercise

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
it is a really really useful exercise

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.020 
it is a really really useful exercise
for<00:04:06.540> almost<00:04:07.290> every<00:04:08.040> weightlifter<00:04:08.609> there's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
for almost every weightlifter there's

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.300 
for almost every weightlifter there's
some<00:04:09.239> people<00:04:09.479> i<00:04:09.540> won't<00:04:09.750> use<00:04:09.930> it<00:04:09.959> with<00:04:10.199> but<00:04:10.500> if

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
some people i won't use it with but if

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.259 
some people i won't use it with but if
you<00:04:11.729> can<00:04:11.879> keep<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.269> quick<00:04:12.510> enough<00:04:13.879> it's<00:04:14.879> not

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
you can keep it quick enough it's not

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.460 
you can keep it quick enough it's not
going<00:04:15.479> to<00:04:15.569> interfere<00:04:15.780> with<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.229> jerk

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
going to interfere with the jerk

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.860 
going to interfere with the jerk
mechanics<00:04:17.010> or<00:04:17.159> the<00:04:17.250> timing<00:04:17.639> at<00:04:17.729> all<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.120> it

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
mechanics or the timing at all and it

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.560 
mechanics or the timing at all and it
really<00:04:19.049> gets<00:04:19.320> people<00:04:19.470> driving<00:04:20.130> straight

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
really gets people driving straight

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.830 
really gets people driving straight
learning<00:04:21.570> how<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.750> bring<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.349> bar<00:04:22.560> back<00:04:23.130> over

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
learning how to bring that bar back over

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.400 
learning how to bring that bar back over
with<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.199> arms<00:04:24.940> and<00:04:25.940> driving<00:04:26.780> high<00:04:27.080> all<00:04:27.380> the

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
with the arms and driving high all the

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.230 
with the arms and driving high all the
way<00:04:27.620> up<00:04:27.740> through<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.070> bar<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.610> I<00:04:28.639> think<00:04:28.790> it<00:04:29.090> has

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
way up through the bar so I think it has

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.570 
way up through the bar so I think it has
a<00:04:29.510> lot<00:04:29.570> of<00:04:29.930> really<00:04:30.590> important<00:04:31.010> carry<00:04:31.250> over<00:04:31.400> to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
a lot of really important carry over to

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.810 
a lot of really important carry over to
the<00:04:31.820> jerk<00:04:32.150> itself<00:04:33.010> it's<00:04:34.010> quite<00:04:34.550> a<00:04:34.610> bit

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
the jerk itself it's quite a bit

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.850 
the jerk itself it's quite a bit
different<00:04:34.850> than<00:04:35.330> doing<00:04:35.870> strict<00:04:36.260> presses<00:04:36.740> or

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
different than doing strict presses or

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.740 
different than doing strict presses or
benching<00:04:37.820> or<00:04:37.940> something<00:04:38.210> like<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:38.389> where

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
benching or something like that where

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.830 
benching or something like that where
it's<00:04:38.930> much<00:04:39.680> more<00:04:39.919> of<00:04:40.010> a<00:04:40.100> slow<00:04:40.840> grinding

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
it's much more of a slow grinding

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.170 
it's much more of a slow grinding
movement<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.410> can<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:43.669> that's<00:04:43.940> what<00:04:44.090> the

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
movement that can and that's what the

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.730 
movement that can and that's what the
timing<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.750> rhythm<00:04:45.080> of<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.260> jerk<00:04:45.500> and

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
timing and the rhythm of the jerk and

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.680 
timing and the rhythm of the jerk and
also<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:46.430> know<00:04:46.550> bind<00:04:46.790> up<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:47.120> shoulder<00:04:47.510> with

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
also you know bind up that shoulder with

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.070 
also you know bind up that shoulder with
a<00:04:47.720> little<00:04:47.960> bit<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:49.220> bench<00:04:49.669> in<00:04:49.850> particular<00:04:50.389> to

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
a little bit the bench in particular to

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.560 
a little bit the bench in particular to
really<00:04:51.320> screw<00:04:51.590> with<00:04:51.710> the<00:04:51.740> jerk<00:04:52.300> Blake<00:04:53.300> here

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
really screw with the jerk Blake here

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.060 
really screw with the jerk Blake here
about<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.020> fall<00:04:54.199> off<00:04:54.229> the<00:04:54.590> back<00:04:54.770> of<00:04:54.830> the

total which was a 9 kilo competition
total<00:05:13.370> PR<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.990> that's<00:05:15.560> pretty<00:05:16.400> much<00:05:16.729> unheard

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000

of but he just has really had some big
improvements<00:05:22.280> with<00:05:22.669> his<00:05:22.850> consistency<00:05:23.720> lately

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
improvements with his consistency lately

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.350 
snatching clean and jerks a lot more
reliably<00:05:29.810> than<00:05:29.930> he<00:05:30.139> had<00:05:30.289> in<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.470> past<00:05:30.710> so

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
reliably than he had in the past so

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.670 
reliably than he had in the past so
really<00:05:32.360> blew<00:05:32.539> the<00:05:32.660> doors<00:05:32.870> off<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.320> that<00:05:33.440> one

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
really blew the doors off of that one

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.890 
really blew the doors off of that one
and<00:05:33.919> now<00:05:34.700> he's<00:05:34.940> set<00:05:35.150> up<00:05:35.300> in<00:05:35.510> a<00:05:35.600> good<00:05:35.720> position
