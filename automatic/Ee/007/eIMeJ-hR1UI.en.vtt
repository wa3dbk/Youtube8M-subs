see<00:01:04.580> no<00:01:04.759> reason<00:01:04.790> to<00:01:05.390> put<00:01:05.810> old<00:01:06.410> hardware<00:01:07.040> or<00:01:07.660> old

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
see no reason to put old hardware or old

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.469 
see no reason to put old hardware or old
software<00:01:09.350> with<00:01:09.950> new<00:01:10.190> hardware<00:01:10.700> that<00:01:11.210> just

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
software with new hardware that just

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.480 
software with new hardware that just
makes<00:01:11.720> compatibility<00:01:12.560> issues<00:01:12.950> and<00:01:13.160> it<00:01:13.250> skips

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
makes compatibility issues and it skips

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.150 
makes compatibility issues and it skips
problems<00:01:13.970> all<00:01:14.119> around<00:01:14.590> other<00:01:15.590> reasons<00:01:16.009> like

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
problems all around other reasons like

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.480 
problems all around other reasons like
XP<00:01:16.850> does<00:01:17.090> not<00:01:17.240> have<00:01:17.390> trim<00:01:17.750> support<00:01:17.990> for<00:01:18.800> ssds

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
XP does not have trim support for ssds

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.760 
XP does not have trim support for ssds
and<00:01:20.180> that's<00:01:20.330> bad<00:01:20.570> because<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:21.110> your<00:01:21.140> SSD<00:01:21.530> you

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
and that's bad because in your SSD you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.310 
and that's bad because in your SSD you
might<00:01:22.009> get<00:01:22.250> hurt<00:01:23.149> in<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.420> process<00:01:23.600> be<00:01:24.020> using

Windows 7 with trim support you do not

Windows 7 with trim support you do not

some<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.380> compatibility<00:04:22.919> mode<00:04:23.220> but<00:04:24.210> they

some in compatibility mode but they

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.380 
some in compatibility mode but they
still<00:04:24.690> work<00:04:24.960> when<00:04:25.229> windows<00:04:25.830> 7<00:04:26.160> only<00:04:26.550> things<00:04:27.180> up

the 90s in

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.320 
the 90s in
you<00:04:31.780> really<00:04:32.170> can't<00:04:32.890> expect<00:04:33.370> nine<00:04:34.090> new

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
you really can't expect nine new

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.710 
you really can't expect nine new
software<00:04:34.810> to<00:04:35.170> work<00:04:35.350> with<00:04:35.920> like<00:04:36.210> 2007<00:04:37.210> software

so<00:04:38.470> that's<00:04:38.680> really<00:04:39.610> why<00:04:39.790> I'm<00:04:40.270> solving<00:04:40.570> the

so that's really why I'm solving the
stem<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.140> I<00:04:41.410> just<00:04:41.650> wanted<00:04:41.800> explain<00:04:42.400> clearly

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
stem and I just wanted explain clearly

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.480 
stem and I just wanted explain clearly

a time I'm very beautiful I four or five
times<00:05:37.570> has<00:05:38.260> not<00:05:38.500> slowed<00:05:38.860> down<00:05:39.000> computer<00:05:40.000> as

times has not slowed down computer as

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.880 
times has not slowed down computer as
not<00:05:40.270> so<00:05:40.450> now<00:05:40.600> everything<00:05:41.080> opens<00:05:41.410> perfectly

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
not so now everything opens perfectly

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.250 
not so now everything opens perfectly
quickly<00:05:42.370> on<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.730> and<00:05:42.910> everything<00:05:43.540> else<00:05:44.050> and

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.260 
quickly on it and everything else and

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.200 
quickly on it and everything else and
that's<00:05:44.500> why<00:05:44.890> I<00:05:44.920> wanted<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.460> sell<00:05:45.730> his<00:05:45.820> day<00:05:46.000> in

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
that's why I wanted to sell his day in

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.390 
that's why I wanted to sell his day in
it<00:05:46.360> because<00:05:46.780> I<00:05:47.170> was<00:05:47.320> tired<00:05:47.590> of<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.130> slow

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
it because I was tired of the slow

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.120 
it because I was tired of the slow
performance<00:05:48.610> I<00:05:49.210> got<00:05:49.690> with<00:05:50.380> my<00:05:50.560> other<00:05:50.740> drive

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
performance I got with my other drive

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.180 
performance I got with my other drive
even<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.360> windows<00:05:52.660> XP<00:05:52.810> uses<00:05:53.410> less<00:05:53.620> resources

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
even of windows XP uses less resources

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.000 
even of windows XP uses less resources
it<00:05:54.520> doesn't<00:05:55.090> matter<00:05:55.270> a<00:05:55.690> solid-state<00:05:56.560> just

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
it doesn't matter a solid-state just

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.580 
it doesn't matter a solid-state just
faster<00:05:57.580> overall<00:05:58.030> I<00:05:58.450> hope<00:05:58.870> this<00:05:59.080> answer<00:05:59.410> some

00:05:59.580 --> 00:05:59.590 
faster overall I hope this answer some
