00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
basically what you're supposed to do is

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.470 
basically what you're supposed to do is
you're<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.580> mime<00:00:55.850> blocks<00:00:56.150> that<00:00:56.690> are<00:00:59.020> breakable

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.619 
you're a mime blocks that are breakable
and<00:01:01.690> depending<00:01:01.839> on<00:01:02.140> how<00:01:02.289> big<00:01:02.679> they<00:01:02.829> are<00:01:03.629> take

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
and depending on how big they are take

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.469 
and depending on how big they are take
some<00:01:04.780> more<00:01:04.900> shots<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.500> mean<00:01:05.770> like<00:01:06.040> I<00:01:06.270> broke<00:01:07.270> in
