for<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.300> question<00:01:03.890> you're<00:01:04.890> asking<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.720> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
for your question you're asking is it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.950 
for your question you're asking is it
essentially<00:01:08.070> normal<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.759> have<00:01:08.910> I<00:01:09.210> bags<00:01:09.570> at<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
essentially normal to have I bags at the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.219 
essentially normal to have I bags at the
age<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.500> 20<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.479> described<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.110> your

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
age of 20 and that you described in your

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.499 
age of 20 and that you described in your
question<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.250> mother<00:01:14.490> got<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:15.030> bags

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
question that your mother got I bags

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.100 
question that your mother got I bags
when<00:01:16.020> she<00:01:16.140> was<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.380> her<00:01:16.500> 30s<00:01:16.970> well<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.930> are

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
when she was in her 30s well you are

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.950 
when she was in her 30s well you are
definitely<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.640> track<00:01:21.000> because<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
definitely on the right track because I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
definitely on the right track because I
bags<00:01:22.500> typically<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:24.050> genetic<00:01:25.050> and<00:01:25.369> they<00:01:26.369> do

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
bags typically are genetic and they do

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.650 
bags typically are genetic and they do
cause<00:01:27.740> people<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:29.100> them<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.640> early<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.600> in

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:30.660 
cause people to have them as early as in

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.859 
cause people to have them as early as in
their<00:01:31.560> teen<00:01:31.800> years<00:01:31.830> in<00:01:32.369> fact<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.570> our<00:01:33.690> own

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
their teen years in fact in our own

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.010 
their teen years in fact in our own
practice<00:01:34.530> we've<00:01:34.979> had<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> patient<00:01:35.670> who<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.270> 14

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
practice we've had a patient who is 14

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.219 
practice we've had a patient who is 14
years<00:01:37.050> old<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.030> was<00:01:39.030> had<00:01:39.420> such<00:01:39.659> big<00:01:39.900> bags

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
years old and was had such big bags

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
years old and was had such big bags
under<00:01:40.590> his<00:01:40.740> eyes<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.310> he<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.180> being<00:01:42.390> teased

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
under his eyes that he was being teased

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.840 
under his eyes that he was being teased
at<00:01:42.960> school<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.650> so<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:45.300> went<00:01:46.050> ahead<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.850> did

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
at school and so we went ahead and did

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.080 
at school and so we went ahead and did
the<00:01:48.090> lower<00:01:48.720> eye<00:01:48.930> bags<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.880> helped<00:01:50.880> him

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the lower eye bags and helped him

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.120 
the lower eye bags and helped him
literally<00:01:51.570> change<00:01:51.870> his<00:01:52.020> life<00:01:52.260> because<00:01:52.500> he<00:01:52.740> was

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
literally change his life because he was

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.510 
literally change his life because he was
being<00:01:53.340> teased<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:55.020> being<00:01:55.080> on<00:01:55.500> drugs<00:01:55.710> because

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
being teased for being on drugs because

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.710 
being teased for being on drugs because
of<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.850> bags<00:01:57.120> under<00:01:57.330> his<00:01:57.510> eyes<00:01:58.040> so

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
of the bags under his eyes so

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.990 
of the bags under his eyes so
essentially<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.729> bags

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
essentially you know that you have bags

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.910 
essentially you know that you have bags
under<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.450> eyes<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.960> what<00:02:04.350> I'm<00:02:04.500> going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.740> do

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
under the eyes and what I'm going to do

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.240 
under the eyes and what I'm going to do
is<00:02:05.250> essentially<00:02:06.320> clear<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.590> for<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:07.979> the

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
is essentially clear up for you the

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.090 
is essentially clear up for you the
cause<00:02:08.519> of<00:02:08.549> those<00:02:09.149> bags<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.899> those<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.619> not

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
cause of those bags and those and not

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.460 
cause of those bags and those and not
the<00:02:11.310> genetic<00:02:11.760> cause<00:02:11.940> but<00:02:12.209> rather<00:02:12.420> what<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.320> is

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the genetic cause but rather what it is

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.490 
the genetic cause but rather what it is
anatomically<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.610> those<00:02:15.330> bags<00:02:15.690> represent

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
anatomically and those bags represent

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.170 
anatomically and those bags represent
something<00:02:16.769> called<00:02:17.130> lower<00:02:17.370> eyelid<00:02:17.760> fat

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
something called lower eyelid fat

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.560 
something called lower eyelid fat
prolapse<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:19.549> what<00:02:20.549> that<00:02:20.760> means<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.540> that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
prolapse and what that means is that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.750 
prolapse and what that means is that
there's<00:02:22.200> fat<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:22.830> normally<00:02:22.920> around<00:02:23.430> the

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
there's fat that's normally around the

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.199 
there's fat that's normally around the
eyes<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.560> at<00:02:25.560> various<00:02:26.370> times<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:27.000> people's

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
eyes and at various times in people's

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.960 
eyes and at various times in people's
lives<00:02:27.690> based<00:02:28.230> on<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> combination<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:29.340> genetics

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
lives based on a combination of genetics

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.840 
lives based on a combination of genetics
and<00:02:30.269> some<00:02:30.540> other<00:02:31.610> environmental<00:02:32.610> factors

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
and some other environmental factors

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.650 
and some other environmental factors
such<00:02:33.660> as<00:02:33.690> smoking<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.920> allergies<00:02:35.549> these<00:02:36.330> fat

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
such as smoking and allergies these fat

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.680 
such as smoking and allergies these fat
pockets<00:02:37.200> can<00:02:37.380> push<00:02:37.680> forward<00:02:38.390> sometimes<00:02:39.390> they

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
pockets can push forward sometimes they

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.190 
pockets can push forward sometimes they
refer<00:02:40.019> to<00:02:40.230> as<00:02:40.470> herniated<00:02:41.430> fat<00:02:41.459> or<00:02:42.000> a

refer to as herniated fat or a
or<00:02:43.739> fat<00:02:44.040> prolapse<00:02:44.420> so<00:02:45.420> when<00:02:46.410> you<00:02:46.500> have

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
or fat prolapse so when you have

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.050

eyelid there's no outside scar and
that's<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.430> big<00:04:09.060> advantage<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.049> so<00:04:10.739> the

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:10.889 
that's a really big advantage and so the

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.430 
that's a really big advantage and so the
rest<00:04:11.100> of<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.700> art<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.420> finesse<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.200> that's

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
rest of it is art and finesse and that's

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.440
