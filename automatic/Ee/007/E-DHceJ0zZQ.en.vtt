00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.420
 modern life is hard to imagine without 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.490
 music and where there is music and headphones 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.400
 allowing you to enjoy it in any 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.630
 a place without anxiety 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.519
 others however unfortunately 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.559
 research says negative 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.020
 hearing effects on headphones 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:20.119
 so you should understand what the harm 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.920
 from headphones and how correctly they 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.920
 use so as not to spoil the ear 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.359
 sound waves falling fly through 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.580
 auditory canal using the drum 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.620
 membranes are converted to vibrations and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.379
 are transmitted to the cochlea being 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.239
 the inner ear where these vibrations 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.559
 transformed into nerve impulses 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.749
 perceived nature of the brain 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.969
 Provided a mechanism to protect against 

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.949
 damage to the inner ear in the form of 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.229
 special muscles that are strong 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.019
 fluctuations tenses and limits 

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:53.089
 movement of the auditory ossicles in this way 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.769
 impact on sensitive cells decreases 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.780
 however, muscles cannot last long 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.489
 resist loud sound and through 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.589
 some time their stress and 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.989
 accordingly, the protection weakens 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.670
 they stop protecting the inner ear 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.780
 causing nerve damage 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 hair cells 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.700
 brain impulses 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.350
 naive evolution don't even think 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.299
 could that at one moment people would start 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.429
 make up your ears some things 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.740
 who will hammer for hours on 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:19.579
 eardrums 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.380
 studies have shown that after 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.820
 short exposure to high 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.640
 sound levels hair cells 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.770
 the hearing acuity is reduced 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.960
 only temporarily and slightly but at 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.270
 repeated and prolonged exposure to noise 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.549
 these auditory cells are damaged more 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.859
 seriously and restoring them becomes 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.719
 almost impossible needed 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.850
 realize that the sound is too loud 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.189
 inevitably leads to a decrease in hearing 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.170
 the louder the music in the headphones and the 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.210
 longer will they use the 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.920
 more noticeable is hearing loss 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.590
 but this does not mean that we should stop 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.439
 use headphones you just have to do 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.909
 it is wise first of all 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.759
 set volume too high 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.499
 sound is the key point try not 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.259
 use headphones for more than an hour 

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:05.240
 in a row and not more than two hours a day but 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.619
 Again, it all depends on the volume 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.569
 which you install 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.159
 if she is moderate then I think 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.500
 you can listen and a little longer 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.300
 choose correctly 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.640
 and external headphones which are good 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 isolate your best from third-party sound 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.290
 the less audible the surrounding the less 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.750
 You can set the volume of the music and therefore 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.820
 and less harm to the ear, for example 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.520
 metro sound pollution and so 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.320
 very high overlap music 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.840
 you need to twist the volume almost to 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.830
 full and in that case your ears don't 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.780
 envy 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.550
 but in order to regain a great 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.840
 hearing will have to go through serious and 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.570
 long treatment 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.730
 procedure shots so best not 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.820
 bring matters to such a situation and take care 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 what health we have on this 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.590
 Thank you all for the likes and comments. 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.500
 it makes it clear that these videos at least 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.310
 someone likes and my work is in demand 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.310
 until 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.680
 Well
