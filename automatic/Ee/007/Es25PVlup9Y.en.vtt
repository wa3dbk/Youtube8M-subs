so<00:00:11.840> that<00:00:12.080> on<00:00:12.860> here<00:00:13.130> is<00:00:13.520> in<00:00:13.910> cubic<00:00:14.660> centimeters

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
so that on here is in cubic centimeters

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.370 
so that on here is in cubic centimeters
but<00:00:15.380> it's<00:00:15.500> also<00:00:15.650> famous<00:00:16.610> leaders<00:00:17.200> it'd<00:00:18.200> be

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380 
but it's also famous leaders it'd be

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.640 
but it's also famous leaders it'd be
four<00:00:18.770> point<00:00:18.980> four<00:00:19.369> six<00:00:23.260> lessons<00:00:24.260> bottle

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
four point four six lessons bottle

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.220 
four point four six lessons bottle
capacity<00:00:24.770> then<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:25.340> multiply<00:00:25.520> that<00:00:25.910> by

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
capacity then you multiply that by

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:37.330 
capacity then you multiply that by
twenty<00:00:27.230> two<00:00:27.380> for<00:00:27.669> from<00:00:28.669> mantels<00:00:29.029> chairman

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.670 

all<00:00:37.790> right<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.300> now<00:00:38.510> when<00:00:39.080> he<00:00:39.110> gets<00:00:39.380> in<00:00:39.560> the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
all right so now when he gets in the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.950 
all right so now when he gets in the
tank<00:00:40.120> he's<00:00:41.120> gonna<00:00:41.270> go<00:00:41.480> ahead<00:00:41.660> and<00:00:41.780> sit<00:00:41.930> down

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
tank he's gonna go ahead and sit down

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:52.270 
tank he's gonna go ahead and sit down
and<00:00:42.320> on<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.010> chair<00:00:43.220> in<00:00:43.340> here<00:00:51.100> check<00:00:52.100> the

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
and on the chair in here check the

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.060 
and on the chair in here check the
temperature<00:00:52.880> of<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.360> water<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:54.680> determine

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
temperature of the water the determine

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.020 
temperature of the water the determine
your<00:00:55.870> the<00:00:56.870> density<00:00:57.230> of<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.410> water<00:00:57.560> and<00:00:58.550> is

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
your the density of the water and is

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.570 
your the density of the water and is
that<00:00:59.440> thirty<00:01:00.440> four<00:01:00.740> degrees<00:01:00.830> Celsius

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
that thirty four degrees Celsius

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:15.250 
that thirty four degrees Celsius
so<00:01:02.180> if<00:01:02.270> you<00:01:02.360> look<00:01:02.540> at<00:01:02.630> your<00:01:03.250> appendix<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:15.080> want

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
so if you look at your appendix you want

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.900 
so if you look at your appendix you want
to<00:01:15.350> get<00:01:15.440> him<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.130> chair<00:01:16.369> he<00:01:16.520> shouldn't<00:01:16.850> be

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
to get him on the chair he shouldn't be

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.340 
to get him on the chair he shouldn't be
touching<00:01:17.150> the<00:01:17.390> floor<00:01:17.600> speech<00:01:17.960> gonna<00:01:18.200> be<00:01:18.290> on

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
touching the floor speech gonna be on

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.830 
touching the floor speech gonna be on
the<00:01:18.470> floors<00:01:18.680> everything<00:01:19.450> should<00:01:20.450> be<00:01:20.479> on<00:01:20.600> the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the floors everything should be on the

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.020 
the floors everything should be on the
chair<00:01:21.050> so<00:01:21.860> there's<00:01:22.280> a<00:01:22.340> bar<00:01:22.550> across<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:22.850> bottom

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
chair so there's a bar across the bottom

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.200 
chair so there's a bar across the bottom
where<00:01:23.660> he<00:01:23.900> can<00:01:24.080> go<00:01:24.200> on<00:01:24.410> and<00:01:24.700> then<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:25.910> can<00:01:25.940> hold

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
where he can go on and then you can hold

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.030 
where he can go on and then you can hold
on<00:01:26.330> to<00:01:26.660> the<00:01:26.930> arm<00:01:27.470> where<00:01:28.220> else<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> right<00:01:30.040> or

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
on to the arm where else to the right or

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.490 
on to the arm where else to the right or
you<00:01:31.070> can<00:01:31.250> hold<00:01:31.400> on<00:01:31.490> to<00:01:31.520> the<00:01:31.700> seat<00:01:31.910> just<00:01:32.500> make

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
you can hold on to the seat just make

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
you can hold on to the seat just make
sure<00:01:33.650> it's<00:01:33.979> hands<00:01:34.160> or<00:01:34.310> else

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.209 

and<00:01:37.659> what<00:01:37.810> he's<00:01:37.899> gonna<00:01:38.049> do<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.649> stick<00:01:39.039> its<00:01:39.159> head

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
and what he's gonna do is stick its head

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.069 
and what he's gonna do is stick its head
in<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.579> water<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:40.000> blow<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:40.329> all<00:01:40.630> over<00:01:40.659> there

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
in the water and blow out all over there

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.410 
in the water and blow out all over there
and<00:01:41.350> possible<00:01:41.799> so<00:01:42.399> he's<00:01:42.520> gonna<00:01:42.640> keep<00:01:42.820> on<00:01:43.030> and

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
and possible so he's gonna keep on and

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.039 
and possible so he's gonna keep on and
then<00:01:44.229> once<00:01:45.189> you<00:01:45.369> see<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.700> bubbles<00:01:46.090> kind<00:01:46.990> of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
then once you see the bubbles kind of

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.830 
then once you see the bubbles kind of
stop<00:01:47.640> you're<00:01:48.640> gonna<00:01:48.700> go<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.060> the<00:01:49.210> computer<00:01:49.659> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
stop you're gonna go to the computer and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.450 
stop you're gonna go to the computer and
hit<00:01:50.439> enter<00:01:50.679> okay

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
hit enter okay

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.459 
hit enter okay
and<00:01:51.579> then<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:52.390> will<00:01:52.539> record<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.929> reading<00:01:53.229> and

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
and then that will record a reading and

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.730 
and then that will record a reading and
once<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.740> hear<00:01:53.920> beep<00:01:55.170> call<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.259> tank<00:01:56.469> so<00:01:56.649> they

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
once you hear beep call the tank so they

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.260 
once you hear beep call the tank so they
know<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.860> come<00:01:57.130> up<00:01:57.280> that's<00:01:57.459> a<00:01:57.549> very<00:01:57.759> important

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
know to come up that's a very important

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:07.820 
know to come up that's a very important
thing<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:58.569> not<00:01:59.560> on<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.860> tanks<00:02:00.130> come<00:02:00.340> up<00:02:04.890> okay

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
thing and not on the tanks come up okay

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:28.199 
thing and not on the tanks come up okay
all<00:02:08.280> right<00:02:08.400> so<00:02:09.500> whenever<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.680> ready

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.970 

all<00:02:29.209> right<00:02:29.390> its<00:02:29.720> weight<00:02:29.989> under<00:02:30.379> water<00:02:30.590> for<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
all right its weight under water for the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.479 
all right its weight under water for the
first<00:02:31.159> trial<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:32.019> 3.25<00:02:33.019> for<00:02:34.450> making<00:02:36.489> all

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
first trial with 3.25 for making all

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.050 
first trial with 3.25 for making all
right<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:37.879> probably<00:02:38.209> do<00:02:39.220> forensics<00:02:40.220> good

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
right so you probably do forensics good

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.850 
right so you probably do forensics good
amount<00:02:41.299> of<00:02:41.330> trials<00:02:41.660> to<00:02:41.750> get<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.989> so<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.739> you

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
amount of trials to get it so and you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.970 
amount of trials to get it so and you
want<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.099> within<00:02:43.629> about<00:02:44.629> 0.1<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.650> each<00:02:45.769> other

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
want it within about 0.1 of each other

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.699 
want it within about 0.1 of each other
three<00:02:46.400> problems<00:02:46.640> within<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.440> so<00:02:48.440> whenever

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
three problems within that so whenever

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.699 
three problems within that so whenever
you're<00:02:49.010> ready<00:02:49.040> if<00:02:49.640> you<00:02:49.760> want<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:50.000> also<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.709> guess

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
you're ready if you want to also I guess

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.750 
you're ready if you want to also I guess
your<00:02:51.890> games<00:02:52.040> are<00:02:52.160> all<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.340> way<00:02:52.430> down<00:02:52.549> there

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
your games are all the way down there

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:53.830 
your games are all the way down there
back<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.000> look<00:02:53.239> for<00:02:53.390> that<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.569> you<00:02:53.660> want<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
back and look for that if you want to

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:21.120 
back and look for that if you want to
give<00:02:53.959> me<00:02:54.049> a<00:02:54.110> thumbs<00:02:54.379> up<00:02:54.530> that's<00:02:54.920> easier

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:59.420 

second<00:03:21.970> trial<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.470> 3.31<00:03:23.470> five<00:03:23.920> kilograms

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.750 

their<00:04:00.430> trial<00:04:00.730> three<00:04:01.240> point<00:04:01.510> two<00:04:01.840> four<00:04:02.110> five<00:04:02.320> so

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
their trial three point two four five so

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.980 
their trial three point two four five so
very<00:04:03.760> close<00:04:03.940> maybe<00:04:04.240> get<00:04:04.420> about<00:04:04.570> two<00:04:04.810> more

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990 
very close maybe get about two more

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:22.800 
very close maybe get about two more
trials<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:05.470> see<00:04:05.620> if<00:04:05.680> these<00:04:05.940> listen

something having blow out all those

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.360 
something having blow out all those
there<00:05:09.450> before<00:05:09.810> he<00:05:09.870> goes<00:05:10.020> under<00:05:10.380> and<00:05:10.710> then<00:05:11.160> when

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
there before he goes under and then when

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.500 
there before he goes under and then when
you<00:05:11.490> go<00:05:11.610> under<00:05:11.850> you're<00:05:11.970> actually<00:05:12.210> we<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.450> a

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
you go under you're actually we have a

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.690 
you go under you're actually we have a
little<00:05:12.660> bit<00:05:13.020> more<00:05:13.170> just<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.160> see<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.400> looks<00:05:14.550> the

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
little bit more just to see it looks the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.280 
little bit more just to see it looks the
same<00:05:15.170> if<00:05:16.170> you<00:05:16.230> don't<00:05:16.410> mind<00:05:16.590> see<00:05:18.110> since<00:05:19.110> you're

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
same if you don't mind see since you're

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.600 
same if you don't mind see since you're
you<00:05:19.530> know<00:05:19.620> in<00:05:19.770> the<00:05:19.860> tank<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.220> everything

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
you know in the tank and everything

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:39.890 
you know in the tank and everything
might<00:05:20.850> as<00:05:20.940> well

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.800 

three<00:05:40.900> one<00:05:41.110> two<00:05:41.350> three<00:05:41.380> nine<00:05:42.510> I've<00:05:43.510> learned<00:05:43.720> it

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
three one two three nine I've learned it

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.900 
three one two three nine I've learned it
both<00:05:43.930> ways<00:05:44.110> so<00:05:44.169> I<00:05:44.350> said<00:05:44.650> those<00:05:44.800> alleles<00:05:45.100> you

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:45.910 
both ways so I said those alleles you

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.469 
both ways so I said those alleles you
can<00:05:46.060> also<00:05:46.270> do<00:05:47.520> you<00:05:48.520> can<00:05:48.580> measure<00:05:48.850> this<00:05:49.120> without

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
can also do you can measure this without

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.730 
can also do you can measure this without
head<00:05:50.440> submergence<00:05:51.270> there's<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.740> calculations

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
head submergence there's a calculations

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.409 
head submergence there's a calculations
you<00:05:53.830> can<00:05:53.949> do<00:05:54.070> it<00:05:54.160> so<00:05:54.310> for<00:05:54.520> a<00:05:54.580> population<00:05:55.000> some

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
you can do it so for a population some

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.570 
you can do it so for a population some
way<00:05:55.570> who<00:05:56.560> can't<00:05:56.800> put<00:05:57.040> their<00:05:57.160> head<00:05:57.310> underwater

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
way who can't put their head underwater

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.520 
way who can't put their head underwater
you<00:05:58.479> can<00:05:58.660> do<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:59.010> their<00:06:00.010> struggle<00:06:00.400> with
