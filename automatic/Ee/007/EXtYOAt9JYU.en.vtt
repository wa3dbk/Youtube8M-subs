 tamriel in all its glory yes

 All provinces have taken and transferred to 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 online with all of the implications 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.430
 how good this idea is now and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.969

 I'll go play the platform in to mac ps4 and xbox 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010
 one 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.070
 character editor allows us to create 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.619
 a hero belonging to any of 10 times 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.229
 holders of the usual and the publication 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 altogether only nine are available 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.540
 imperial nevertheless all these races 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.740
 familiar to any fan of the series here 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.070
 us and bretons 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.890
 and the nords and orcs and so on besides 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 it is necessary to choose the side it is an alliance 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.670
 there are only three 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.790
 and from what kind of union you choose 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.030
 depends on the current exactly where you start the game and 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.580
 which side will pvp sew 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.820
 classes in the game only 4 magician dragon 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.280
 knight night plate and templar which is nice 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.770
 especially nobody in class 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.720
 the framework will not drive the same 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.020
 sorcerer can safely arm 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.600
 huge sword and chained in iron but also 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.320
 self character customization 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 the local editor is something beautiful 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.509
 a bunch of sliders buttons and menus 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.670
 I can even regulate everything 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:06.350
 ass size and that in general it is not 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.350
 necessarily but nice 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.079
 well, then it's quite classic for 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:17.189
 series tie we prisoner the same thing was 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.500
 and in morrowind 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:22.379
 both in Oblivion and recent Skyrim 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.110
 prison here is something like training and in 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.170
 If you later create more 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.859
 one character training is allowed 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:35.030
 miss thank goodness being in 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:37.890
 the prison is worth looking around and about a bottle 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:42.840
 skyrim ovsky habits tyrit everything 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:45.780
 do not give rest buddy here you are 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.030
 speak speak speak and speak to me like that 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.670
 I want to put a bucket on your head and 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.299
 clean your pockets here you are not 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:57.030
 skyrim in general here we are introduced to the course 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.590
 local plot and teach management 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.139
 which in general is more than that 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.989
 understandable and that will definitely please everyone 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.750
 fans because I am him and I am on the screen 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.889
 there is nothing superfluous just like in the same 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.620
 skyrim same compass above and and all 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:16.410
 of course I can not say that for imam 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.359
 games such an approach is convenient for those who 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.760
 local interface is not to your liking 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.459
 can fix it in the game settings 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.090
 Display all they need 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.449
 although 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.389
 you can play and just learn what 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.280
 button for what skill is responsible and everything 

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.440
 let's say potions hang on special 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.019
 quick access wheel which 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.120
 activated by pressing the cue the same 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.669
 by the way concerns other players 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.919
 which is not marked here and if 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.470
 not their jerky jumps and throwing on 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:48.000
 their map could easily be confused 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.970
 with regular npc 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.030
 running around running 3 mini boss training 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.609
 finished honestly always hated 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.209
 elder scrolls all these foreplay want in 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:59.209
 open world 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.520
 so getting the third level we are in my 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.160
 case we fall into daggerfall 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.860
 that province and accordingly 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 elder scrolls 2 daggerfall who could 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.040
 to think 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.340
 The first thing that hits is two things. 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.010
 picture and optimization i'm right there 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:26.010
 I remember the recent order of magic which 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.490
 managed to slow down on the same gland 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.980
 right there all okay the scenery is beautiful weather 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.270
 changing yes and finally look 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:38.640
 is it all and tamriel is it a misfortune 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.910
 even the cockroaches on the ground traced more 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.370
 than worthy 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.090
 honestly I donâ€™t really want to enter 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.910
 at this door 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:51.510
 usually in games this is nothing good 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.690
 ends by the way playing for haji then i'm 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.550
 first five minutes after training 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.820
 managed tightly stuck in the stairs 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.100
 just climbing it helped only 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.920
 restart the client and it took 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.620
 do floor 2 times 3 3 3 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.470
 we spot a familiar female spirit 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.560
 probably only oldfagam who played ancient 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.110
 for scrolls adventures adguard or 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.350
 carefully read the dialogues in Skyrim 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.900
 there he was also mentioned by the way more 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.300
 cozy view from 1 person is better yet 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.520
 switch to the view from the third thing in 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.919
 that for mechanics and mom he fits 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.620
 much better enemies are often many 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:33.720
 they move extremely fast and can 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.820
 periodically pass through you 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.310
 so with the third person view you 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.340
 control the situation much better 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:43.530
 quests deserve a separate discussion 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.460
 I already forgot when the last time 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.280
 would see mom 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:49.440
 games like local tasks 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.140
 look more like quests from single 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.350
 output with between non-standard and mom lpg 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:56.640
 there is almost no heresy in the style of kill 15 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.310
 hormones and liter 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:02.250
 There are 10 prostitutes in that location almost 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:05.040
 all local tasks are framed with great 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.310
 voiced dialogues have meaning and 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.540
 often interesting stories for example in 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.610
 this quest 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.100
 to steal valuable papers for us from 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.800
 palace for this you first need to bribe 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.380
 this dude here take his clothes 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.020
 aki hitman change clothes this very 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.300
 clothes to pass for your penetrate 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:26.340
 to the palace then whistle the key 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.830
 drunk womanizer previously sprinkled 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.110
 him in a cup sleeping pills after which 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.390
 climb up discover that paper 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.760
 guards the guard go down 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.610
 find out that the guard can be distracted 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.420
 distract the guard and then pick up 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:43.620
 paper 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.110
 that's what i call rbg 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.290
 the guard cannot be killed unlike 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:54.360
 other games of the series but you can kill 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:55.020
 monkey on the railing in the general result test 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.450
 online 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:59.970
 This is a very strange product and it is not up to 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.460
 the end is a regular single elder scrolls 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.410
 im not completely online because local 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.510
 rights and mode looks more like 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.520
 not a bad single company that 

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:11.130
 for some reason launched other players 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:14.460
 more or less clear you get in 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:17.280
 pvp mode here everything is clear and besides 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.670
 the price for the client makes to put it mildly 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:22.050
 ahu censorship upset people not 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.500
 familiar with the show 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.930
 it can definitely frighten away but if you like 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:30.630
 and i'm a fan of elder scrolls this is definitely 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.820
 Mast hev here and add nothing and 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:35.070
 serious shortcomings except perhaps 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.770
 mentioned price and bugs 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:41.160
 which of course is believed correct patches 

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:43.860
 Well, pumping up to level 10 will take 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.830
 you somewhere two nights leisurely game 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.330
 Well, I have this all thanks to all 

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.330
 bye everyone
