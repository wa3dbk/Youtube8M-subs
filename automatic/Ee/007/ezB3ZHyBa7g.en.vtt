00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
I've got a couple interesting studies to

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:02.929 
I've got a couple interesting studies to
tell<00:00:01.650> you<00:00:01.740> about<00:00:01.829> here's<00:00:02.159> one<00:00:02.460> that<00:00:02.790> was

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
tell you about here's one that was

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.070 
tell you about here's one that was
written<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.510> Scientific<00:00:03.990> American

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
written about in Scientific American

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.160

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
women can just be friends assuming that

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.600

they're both heterosexual in this case

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.879 
they're both heterosexual in this case
appears<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.110> true

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
appears to be not true

I<00:01:28.619> would<00:01:29.250> actually<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.790> in<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.119> having<00:01:30.390> a

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I would actually be in to having a

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.170 
I would actually be in to having a
romantic<00:01:30.930> relationship<00:01:31.560> with<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.430> woman<00:01:32.490> so

romantic relationship with this woman so

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.149 
romantic relationship with this woman so
the<00:01:33.600> results<00:01:34.049> really<00:01:34.470> seemed<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.950> indicate

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the results really seemed to indicate

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.450 
the results really seemed to indicate
that<00:01:35.520> men<00:01:36.479> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.229> harder<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.860> being<00:01:38.369> just

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that men have the harder time being just

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.850 
that men have the harder time being just
friends<00:01:39.329> whereas<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.869> women<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.439> really

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
friends whereas for women it really

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.590 
friends whereas for women it really
appears<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.729> much<00:01:42.060> more<00:01:42.329> straightforward

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
appears to be much more straightforward

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.179 
appears to be much more straightforward
to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.259> friends<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.740> would<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.040> my

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
to be just friends that would be my

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
to be just friends that would be my
guess<00:01:44.399> too<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.060> been<00:01:45.149> yeah<00:01:45.360> just

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
guess too it would have been yeah just

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.889 
guess too it would have been yeah just
from<00:01:46.290> what<00:01:46.500> I've<00:01:46.619> observed<00:01:47.479> I've<00:01:48.479> always

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
from what I've observed I've always

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.510 
from what I've observed I've always
