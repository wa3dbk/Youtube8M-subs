00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
volts fluctuating now all we have here

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.819 
volts fluctuating now all we have here
is<00:00:42.120> just<00:00:42.149> actual<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.590> water

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
is just actual this is just water

is just actual this is just water
nothing<00:00:44.550> else<00:00:44.910> now<00:00:45.149> I'm<00:00:45.300> using<00:00:45.539> tungsten

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
nothing else now I'm using tungsten

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.170 
nothing else now I'm using tungsten
because<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.190> heat<00:00:47.370> reaction<00:00:47.879> these<00:00:48.030> are

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
because of the heat reaction these are

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
because of the heat reaction these are
eighth<00:00:48.300> inch<00:00:48.600> tungsten<00:00:49.260> rods<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.800> my

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
eighth inch tungsten rods and my

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.040 
eighth inch tungsten rods and my
secondary<00:00:50.910> electrode<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.809> be<00:00:51.899> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
secondary electrode is going to be the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
secondary electrode is going to be the
same<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.500> an<00:00:52.590> 18<00:00:52.890> at<00:00:53.039> 1/8<00:00:54.000> inch<00:00:54.239> gage<00:00:54.510> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
same it's an 18 at 1/8 inch gage you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.049 
same it's an 18 at 1/8 inch gage you
know<00:00:55.260> tungsten<00:00:55.770> these<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> melting<00:00:56.820> point

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
know tungsten these have a melting point

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420 
know tungsten these have a melting point
at<00:00:57.149> about<00:00:57.239> 6500<00:00:58.079> degrees<00:00:58.320> Fahrenheit<00:00:58.859> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
at about 6500 degrees Fahrenheit so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.799 
at about 6500 degrees Fahrenheit so
we're<00:00:59.579> gonna<00:00:59.670> watch<00:01:00.000> an<00:01:00.210> incredible<00:01:00.660> reaction

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
we're gonna watch an incredible reaction

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
we're gonna watch an incredible reaction
so<00:01:01.680> if<00:01:01.800> we<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.340> at<00:01:02.430> both<00:01:02.699> you'll<00:01:02.969> actually

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
so if we look at both you'll actually

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.109 
so if we look at both you'll actually
see<00:01:03.390> both<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:04.229> both<00:01:04.439> rods<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:05.970> see

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
see both the both rods you will see

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.630 
see both the both rods you will see
instantaneous<00:01:06.869> hydrogen<00:01:07.830> coming<00:01:08.189> off<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
instantaneous hydrogen coming off of the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.390 
instantaneous hydrogen coming off of the
secondary<00:01:09.180> rod<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.530> connecting

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
secondary rod or the or the connecting

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.280 
secondary rod or the or the connecting
rod<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.850> then<00:01:12.270> our<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.930> one<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.200> we

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
rod and then our with the one that we

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.469 
rod and then our with the one that we
immerse<00:01:13.650> we'll<00:01:13.920> have<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.270> secondary<00:01:15.270> reaction

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
immerse we'll have a secondary reaction

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
immerse we'll have a secondary reaction
which<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.290> an<00:01:16.380> instantaneous

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
which is going to be an instantaneous

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.219 
which is going to be an instantaneous
flash<00:01:17.490> off<00:01:17.790> of<00:01:17.970> hydrogen<00:01:18.479> immediate

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
flash off of hydrogen immediate

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
flash off of hydrogen immediate
separation<00:01:20.009> now<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.729> immediately<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.509> go

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
separation now this immediately will go

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.530 
separation now this immediately will go
into<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:21.930> combustion<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.130> start<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.640> generate

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
into a combustion and start to generate

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.899 
into a combustion and start to generate
heat<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.799> away<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.100> we're<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.729> show

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
heat right away but we're going to show

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
heat right away but we're going to show
you<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> very<00:01:27.420> unique<00:01:27.479> phenomenon<00:01:28.290> here<00:01:28.530> which

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.390 

we<00:02:36.160> could<00:02:36.340> keep<00:02:36.490> this<00:02:36.990> reactive<00:02:37.990> continual

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
reaction will be watch these pumpkin

we're<00:02:45.780> eating<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.230> son<00:02:46.590> sooraj<00:02:47.040> with<00:02:47.370> water

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
we're eating the son sooraj with water

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:56.380 
we're eating the son sooraj with water
up<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> a<00:02:49.349> very<00:02:49.680> high<00:02:49.769> state<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.340> obsession

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.270 

and<00:02:57.200> then<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.710> discharge

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.280 

when<00:03:00.910> I<00:03:00.940> emerged<00:03:01.270> through<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.780> hydrogen

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
when I emerged through the hydrogen

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:16.070

reaction

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.420 

so<00:03:17.080> as<00:03:17.140> you<00:03:17.260> see<00:03:17.470> we're<00:03:17.650> getting<00:03:17.739> energy<00:03:18.280> in

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
so as you see we're getting energy in

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.429 
so as you see we're getting energy in
many<00:03:18.610> ways<00:03:18.849> again<00:03:19.780> it's<00:03:19.989> just<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.200> tungsten

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
many ways again it's just the tungsten

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.559 
many ways again it's just the tungsten
rod

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569
