00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.660
 besides having the possibility to adapt the start menu 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.599
 the taskbar and the graphic interface of hÃºrin dos is important 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.799
 adapt the properties of the windows 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.119
 moving around 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.059
 over grouped icons combined in the taskbar 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.710
 we can see the different nasdaq penta are initiated 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.109
 pointing to one of them by simply sliding the mons 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.960
 over the preview 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.830
 we can see quadrupled 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.830
 a complete view 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.660
 we have everything in the series of windows open on the desktop 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.130
 doing through a foot on the desk button 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.530
 we can see them and we realize that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.750
 there are several windows that are activated 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.640
 and it would be interesting to be able to organize talks 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.780
 by clicking with the right key delma 11 we can tell how to show 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.190
 maybe in batches 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.110
 alierta 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.729
 among the options to organize the windows we have windows in cascade 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.180
 we choose this option first 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.510
 and we can see that all the open windows are sorted one 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.869
 after another open all with the same size 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.119
 and not seeing 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.569
 only the corresponding title of each window 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.250
 with the option 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 show windows atil fairies 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.050
 we observe that they flee 2 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.640
 open all the windows on the desktop screen 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.869
 locating exactly the same ones with the same size 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.730
 showing the windows in parallel we see that he has opened them at three o'clock 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:44.930
 side of the other 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.800
 with the same size 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.170
 we started showing the desktop 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.960
 grouped to these windows again in the taskbar by combining them under a 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.500
 single icon 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.549
 the size of a window we can not modify 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.500
 dragging the mossad well the amount of each window 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.740
 Plucking the edge while maintaining 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.259
 the left key 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.509
 pressed and dragging the edge to extend by reducing the window 

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.219
 If we do this action from a corner 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.569
 we can at the same time reduce the two dimensions 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.649
 the height and width of the window 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.810
 remember that dragging the window to one side of the screen 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 with the function 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.859
 aero snap shows wendo its cradle transparent preview that tells us what 

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.540
 that the window will occupy 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.230
 exactly half 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.319
 from the desktop screen 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.370
 dragging the window back to the center of the screen 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.639
 regained its original size 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.639
 now dragging the window towards the top edge 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.030
 windows 7 does not show a preview 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.750
 indicating that you are going to use the entire screen on your desktop 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.730
 by dragging from the title bars again the center 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.759
 from the screen 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:08.889
 it is reduced to its own size these functions can only be activated 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.779
 in open windows and not 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.779
 in the windows that are minimize 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.549
 remember the functions 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.999
 who manage a window we just saw ice cream makers mead 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.869
 we have the airman 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.869
 and if we have several windows 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.499
 in antalya desk taking one of them 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.569
 and shaking 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.159
 minimize other windows 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:45.099
 returning them to go 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.099
 the windows are reopened and we can 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.969
 to hail for example again in parallel 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:54.620
 once they are 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.549
 organized parallel cem 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.590
 if we go back to the bar 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.899
 chores 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:01.719
 we can 

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:05.169
 show stacked windows again 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.169
 they will be one over the other with the same size 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.380
 in this video we have shown you 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.380
 the various possibilities that it has 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.669
 to manage them 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.779
 windows 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.559
 in terms of its size ie the position that we can determine 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:29.109
 the full context of the diarrhea bar while
