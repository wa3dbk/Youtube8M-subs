00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.230
 children so when in fact 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.269
 today we will test this little 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.490
 tablet is a tablet mpman them 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.420
 kids then with a 7 inch screen 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.789
 capacitive which turns so in fact when 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.869
 you can watch it on 4.2.2 of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.490
 at sir android 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.510
 so this is the android jim beam 4.2.2 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.109
 so in fact a pretty tablet 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 nice 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.399
 so we have you here on the part 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 high of the table is so in fact 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.260
 power on / off button 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.620
 the power supply here is the micro usb port 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.989
 here and the microphone on that side 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.360
 have the headphone output oh I do not have the 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.399
 to knock down here you have the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:59.879
 headphone outlet ans with the volume button 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.620
 and that's it and if not you have the webcam 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.309
 so in celebration that is where you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.030
 offer me calm in 640 x 480 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 so what is it worth this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.960
 tablet then you have screen but 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:15.119
 on so actually capacitive 7 inches 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.530
 multitouch you've spent a ton of 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.100
 mono heart is a mono-core processor 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.220
 logic to 2 so you have 4,512 GB of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.290
 ram and 4 gigabytes of storage with the wifi 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.939
 in communication point of view and the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.530
 sensor that allows you to actually 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.450
 capture the movement in the tablet 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.890
 ideal for some applications or 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.140
 days so what is it worth 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.990
 working costs you around 50 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.939
 60 euros this tablet knowing that of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.700
 nowadays it's not that far these 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.880
 limits you take from the game like gta com 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.479
 fish out like that it's practical it's 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.039
 very very limited to see even unplayable 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.000
 here is a little surf kids 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:56.770
 a little bit of video 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 small applications it will be very 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.780
 well 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.240
 so here you have for example 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 the sfr tv app with us we love it 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.830
 this application 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:11.739
 so that's it if you put the television- 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.270
 this is madam then you will arrive 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.130
 yes there is a response time anyway 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.800
 compared a dual core tablet or 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.959
 quad street collar the heart is there is 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.370
 a while when you do 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.720
 something and there you have so you 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.340
 do it come from the children's network 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.760
 do not know why that but always so 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:34.840
 in fact the ham here that's it 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.209
 announced the lawyer see there is a time 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.100
 every time we ask for something 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.170
 thing when palanges I left 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.670
 application so sfr I came back 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.209
 directly so actually 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.239
 oh allah allah are then 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.310
 the youtube app discover so 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.790
 I supported some time to come 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.660
 as well 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.790
 see it's not super super super fast 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:04.709
 but it's okay 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:07.870
 so we're going secura is a I mean 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.120
 if you are in full screen here is 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.860
 leave your here to sign anything so 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.370
 it's a correct match one of the kids 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.260
 would walk but it's like that wake 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.329
 press there and it'll put some 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.519
 time to come to the home 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:24.489
 So that's not bad it's okay 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.500
 children as an accountant is it's 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.000
 heart job but do not have too much of 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.829
 give some of your best whether 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.269
 not too good to give nankin the 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.739
 to indulge the table is my little 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.680
 cloth which you have feeding 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.299
 so in fact who is here then 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.220
 the disadvantage is that we do and then 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.470
 you have a small usb micro usb cord 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.730
 so for free at the cellar at the computer 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.100
 the firm know to put the 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.380
 pictures of videos or directly so in 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.880
 makes applications in Beijing she 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.890
 do not have the country out so that's a 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.000
 small in this tablet but should 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.769
 you can always master by 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.440
 example a mobile market which we have 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.720
 talked about the news ah yes so l 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.700
 another disadvantage if it is that she is 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.239
 obliged to charge by this little 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.350
 adapter 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.360
 so in fact here that second 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.280
 so in fact on the top of the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.750
 tablet and not by the micro port 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.880
 usb so that's actually the problem 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.700
 that's happening it's true not the charge and 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.770
 where you want it here otherwise it's a 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.200
 it is a tablet that is more 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.670
 correct and who will walk the link well 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.890
 you can use it as the 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:25.940
 reader or could use it as a 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.190
 than surf the internet or go on 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.350
 youtube or watch your mind and 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.610
 do some applications hands of 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.770
 Lyon did not ask too much here 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.690
 currently celebrating the end of the year 2013 at 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.940
 sell 50 and 60 euros 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.040
 and it's still a product of 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.480
 more correct here it is a little me 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.370
 who did that the high-depths see 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.360
 as you can see here 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.610
 so it's actually mpman here and it's 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.550
 the 1701 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.230
 this is from one of the models on a 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.820
 table is in fact as we have been able to 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.540
 to see in correct but without more 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.729
 you also have 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.120
 so in fact 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:08.719
 hop see but some tahakro a good 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.520
 that's it and you have here also so in 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.520
 makes a webcam that you can 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:15.169
 notice click here so this is in 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.460
 done that is parked that team before 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.460
 the time that manages anyway so the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.439
 video and the photo is with the system 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.309
 also panoramic but that is not a 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.770
 war lightning 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:26.330
 see there I pressed hop that's not certain 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.949
 time there tackle the tent anyway 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.419
 so if you take me the 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.120
 system optimization or not I know 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.050
 not but so that's it then I was talking about 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.449
 the photo app that is not a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.139
 war lightning since it's 640 x 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:39.439
 480 video and photos we see the 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:41.389
 children 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.969
 so this little tablet so in fact 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:47.659
 is a correct product for 50 60 euros 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:48.349
 for its fine end of this year-end 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:53.899
 end of year period 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:54.289
 so in fact that may be enough for some 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:57.789
 people 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.789
 see you soon
