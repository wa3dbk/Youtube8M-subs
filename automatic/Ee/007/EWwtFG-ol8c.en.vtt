00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 urinating in the pool is harmful to 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.290
 health surely all of us 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.320
 have we ever peed in the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.269
 pool is not very normal but what 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.759
 that I did not suspect is that 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.449
 react substances of urine 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.520
 with chlorine very compounds are generated 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.130
 dangerous to the human being that in the 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.300
 If they are ingested, they can cause 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.539
 serious organ damage 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.850
 to give you an idea the result 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.570
 of 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:37.960
 of the reaction of uric acid with the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.570
 chlorine would be cyanogen chloride and 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.540
 triclosan inah both substances can 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.600
 affect the lungs the heart and the 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.480
 central nervous system according to a 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.520
 survey conducted in the USA a 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.379
 of every five people confessed to having 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.140
 realized his basic need in the 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.800
 pool even the famous swimmer 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.640
 michael phelps who is the winner of the 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.310
 Olympics also confessed that he 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.860
 I had mediated because I thought that 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.450
 the chlorine killed everything you know that the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.760
 chlorine does not destroy the urine in fact this 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.710
 It is combined with urine to create 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.290
 products to create a substance 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.390
 even more dangerous a substance that 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.670
 as I said in the case of being 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.850
 ingested for example by a small child 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 or a person who has swallowed water 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.710
 it can cause a lot of damage
