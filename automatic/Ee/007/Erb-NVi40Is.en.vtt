00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
what the car looks like now this is

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.170 
what the car looks like now this is
where<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.080> real<00:06:13.229> fun<00:06:13.500> is<00:06:13.530> at<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:13.949> course<00:06:17.150> do<00:06:18.150> a

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
where the real fun is at of course do a

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.080 
where the real fun is at of course do a
360<00:06:18.930> view<00:06:19.139> of<00:06:19.320> it<00:06:19.440> again<00:06:19.940> disregard<00:06:20.940> the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
360 view of it again disregard the

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:34.850 
360 view of it again disregard the
shadow<00:06:33.050> you're<00:06:34.050> just<00:06:34.199> going<00:06:34.380> around<00:06:34.440> town

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 
shadow you're just going around town

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:36.620 
shadow you're just going around town
this<00:06:35.160> is<00:06:35.280> fine<00:06:35.520> we're<00:06:36.000> not<00:06:36.120> having<00:06:36.360> the<00:06:36.419> wind

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:36.630 
this is fine we're not having the wind

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.719 
this is fine we're not having the wind
cover<00:06:36.870> on<00:06:37.110> when<00:06:37.500> you're<00:06:37.620> going<00:06:37.770> on<00:06:38.190> a<00:06:38.639> road

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
cover on when you're going on a road

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.150 
cover on when you're going on a road
trip<00:06:39.150> for<00:06:39.419> instance<00:06:39.830> basically<00:06:40.830> what<00:06:40.979> the

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
trip for instance basically what the

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.700 
trip for instance basically what the
wind<00:06:42.150> blocker<00:06:42.479> will<00:06:42.750> do<00:06:42.840> is<00:06:42.960> cover<00:06:43.169> this<00:06:43.440> up

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
wind blocker will do is cover this up

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:44.810 
wind blocker will do is cover this up
down<00:06:44.280> here

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
down here

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.500 
down here
so<00:06:45.060> it's<00:06:45.240> a<00:06:45.300> very<00:06:45.479> aerodynamic<00:06:47.210> thing<00:06:48.210> for<00:06:48.449> the

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
so it's a very aerodynamic thing for the

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.860 
so it's a very aerodynamic thing for the
wind<00:06:48.720> to<00:06:48.960> go<00:06:49.169> over<00:06:50.360> see<00:06:51.360> it<00:06:51.449> from<00:06:51.570> the<00:06:51.690> back

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
wind to go over see it from the back

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.280 
wind to go over see it from the back
here<00:06:52.229> again

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:16.050 

circling<00:07:00.220> all<00:07:00.670> the<00:07:00.880> way<00:07:00.970> around

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:16.060 

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.320 

so<00:07:16.570> again<00:07:16.870> this<00:07:17.260> is<00:07:17.470> the<00:07:17.760> 2005<00:07:18.760> New<00:07:19.150> Beetle

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:19.330 
so again this is the 2005 New Beetle

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:22.770 
so again this is the 2005 New Beetle

and<00:07:23.500> it<00:07:24.250> has<00:07:24.460> served<00:07:24.700> us<00:07:24.910> well<00:07:24.970> over<00:07:25.420> the<00:07:25.600> past

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:25.750 
and it has served us well over the past

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.080 
and it has served us well over the past
few<00:07:26.020> years<00:07:26.160> I'm<00:07:27.160> sure<00:07:27.220> the<00:07:27.460> next<00:07:27.580> Nutter<00:07:27.850> will

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090 
few years I'm sure the next Nutter will

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.840 
few years I'm sure the next Nutter will
enjoy<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.510> just<00:07:28.540> as<00:07:28.780> much
