00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.889
 on the 8th of january 1973 it gets 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
 Sandman competition this song 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.860
 leads the first german episode of the 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:24.090
 exactly at 9:30 in the morning comes that you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:27.869
 children's television future stars 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.720
 ernie and bert are already 35 years old 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.740
 their quarrels cult and of course 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.740
 educational valuable 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.980
 at least that always looked like there 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.700
 I can, for example, well nrw 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.460
 live opposite 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.230
 and I'm so close to 6 sometimes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.280
 over and then I got off my feet 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.239
 set has watched with him as 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.230
 Think if I follow a group today 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.610
 inevitably also at that time actually 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.829
 always look for it and I think so 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 not because you like to be a kid again 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.219
 want to be because the feeling again so 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.590
 nice that one has no worries after 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.130
 this street and accordingly 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.950
 It was gone through that , too 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.230
 only the bavarian radio boycotted 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.930
 The American series is bothering 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.240
 the ghetto atmosphere does not justify that 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.190
 I believe in the scenery then that was 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.530
 everything very spongy mud I saw 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.330
 that resulted in oskar because the 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:22.670
 most hated person in front of Bavarian 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.290
 radio I really have something rad 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.610
 also introduced as a profound one 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.500
 was very important this anyway in 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.670
 bavaria does not continue or works only 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.710
 once a week have very rare 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.229
 nevertheless, it tries to defend against it 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.520
 until sometime the protests so that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.530
 These became so popular of course 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.190
 had has finchen tv lord of BÃ¶defeld 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.250
 and samsung 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.509

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.700

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:57.680
 also make established actors 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:02:00.200
 happy with the children's series that's the 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.570
 agree with Cookie Monster douglas welbat 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.220
 how did they come or did they come? 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.340
 this green monster to speak of 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.460
 reason was probably 1972 when she was on 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.590
 street started 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.120
 my father 's first monastery was then 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.300
 yes 77 died 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.850
 then the Cookie Monster was a few 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.770
 years under the rule of edgard 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.660
 and who died and then 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.740
 there was a big casting and then it was 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.450

 I come very close I am after so 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.610
 that is still far away 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.390
 140 countries declare grobi in children 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.600
 nod world so when I ran close again 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.430
 I am near me is very clear and close 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.740

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.780
 no more 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.430

 figures as it now in the usa remained 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.890

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.360
 even going as ours then so deeply 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.740
