hey everybody its Jason Blaha here and
today<00:00:09.059> I'm<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> teach<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.260> guys<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:10.590> to

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
today I'm going to teach you guys how to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.400 
today I'm going to teach you guys how to
do<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> basic<00:00:11.190> barbell<00:00:11.670> squat<00:00:12.230> this<00:00:13.230> is

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
do a basic barbell squat this is

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.129 
do a basic barbell squat this is
essentially<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.429> high<00:00:14.730> bar<00:00:14.969> squat<00:00:15.389> but<00:00:15.750> some

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
essentially a high bar squat but some

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.510 
essentially a high bar squat but some
people<00:00:16.350> might<00:00:16.500> consider<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:16.980> hybrid<00:00:17.310> squat

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
people might consider two hybrid squat

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.490 
people might consider two hybrid squat
but<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.060> basic<00:00:18.300> barbell<00:00:18.840> squat<00:00:19.170> form

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
but it's just a basic barbell squat form

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.980 
but it's just a basic barbell squat form
and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> think<00:00:19.920> most<00:00:20.100> people<00:00:20.220> need<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.640> start

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:20.990 
and I think most people need to start

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.990 
and I think most people need to start
with<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> basic<00:00:22.320> form<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.160> then<00:00:23.490> find<00:00:23.820> what

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
with a basic form and then find what

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.279 
with a basic form and then find what
works<00:00:24.119> for<00:00:24.300> them<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.689> there<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:25.019> far<00:00:25.230> as

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
works for them from there as far as

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.220 
works for them from there as far as
things<00:00:25.590> like<00:00:25.769> spacing<00:00:26.760> grips<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.449> bar<00:00:27.660> as

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
things like spacing grips on the bar as

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.900 
things like spacing grips on the bar as
far<00:00:28.470> as<00:00:28.560> where<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> grip<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.160> feet<00:00:29.640> with

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
far as where you grip it feet with

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.609 
far as where you grip it feet with
things<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.380> these<00:00:31.439> things

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
things like that a lot of these things

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.139 
things like that a lot of these things
matters<00:00:31.980> far<00:00:32.130> as<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.340> shoulder<00:00:32.700> structure

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
matters far as your shoulder structure

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.880 
matters far as your shoulder structure
your<00:00:33.329> hip<00:00:33.480> structures<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.380> hip<00:00:34.590> structure

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
your hip structures the hip structure

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
your hip structures the hip structure
varies<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> lot<00:00:35.670> from<00:00:35.730> person<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.360> person<00:00:36.510> now

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
varies a lot from person to person now

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.440 
varies a lot from person to person now
for<00:00:37.739> me<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.190> always<00:00:38.370> use<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> very<00:00:38.940> very<00:00:39.210> narrow

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
for me I always use a very very narrow

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
for me I always use a very very narrow
grip<00:00:39.750> because<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.260> previous<00:00:40.469> bicep<00:00:41.070> tear

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
grip because of my previous bicep tear

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.139 
grip because of my previous bicep tear
if<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:42.149> use<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> wide<00:00:42.660> grip<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.379> squats<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.250> won't

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
if I use a wide grip on squats I won't

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.479 
if I use a wide grip on squats I won't
be<00:00:45.239> able<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> do<00:00:45.719> bench<00:00:45.930> presses<00:00:46.260> curls<00:00:47.190> rows

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
be able to do bench presses curls rows

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.760 
be able to do bench presses curls rows
anything<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.120> about<00:00:48.270> two<00:00:48.510> days<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:49.050> all

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
anything for about two days at all

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.900 
anything for about two days at all
because<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.670> puts<00:00:51.000> too<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.239> inflammation<00:00:52.020> on

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
because it puts too much inflammation on

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
because it puts too much inflammation on
my<00:00:53.910> bicep<00:00:54.329> tendon<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:55.020> bicep<00:00:55.440> tendon

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
my bicep tendon and the bicep tendon

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.080 
my bicep tendon and the bicep tendon
gets<00:00:55.800> inflamed<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.550> pulls<00:00:56.760> tight<00:00:56.969> on

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
gets inflamed then it pulls tight on

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
gets inflamed then it pulls tight on
this<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.480> makes<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.780> shoulder<00:00:58.260> tendons

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
this and it makes my shoulder tendons

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.380 
this and it makes my shoulder tendons
get<00:00:58.800> inflamed<00:00:59.160> also<00:00:59.579> and<00:00:59.789> so<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.000> prevents<00:01:00.270> me

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
get inflamed also and so it prevents me

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
get inflamed also and so it prevents me
from<00:01:00.420> being<00:01:00.570> able<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.079> other<00:01:01.260> work<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.770> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
from being able to do other work and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
from being able to do other work and I
usually<00:01:02.879> need<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> have<00:01:03.359> ibuprofen<00:01:04.080> or

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
usually need to have ibuprofen or

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
usually need to have ibuprofen or
something<00:01:04.920> afterwards<00:01:05.220> just<00:01:05.549> because<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
something afterwards just because of the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.880 
something afterwards just because of the
excruciating<00:01:06.479> pain<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.710> will

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
excruciating pain of it actually will

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
excruciating pain of it actually will
bothered<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.369> about<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.880> day<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
bothered me for about a day or two it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.420 
bothered me for about a day or two it
will<00:01:10.200> throb<00:01:10.530> it'll<00:01:10.770> keep<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.010> awake<00:01:11.250> at<00:01:11.400> night

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
will throb it'll keep me awake at night

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.210 
will throb it'll keep me awake at night

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
so I can't do the wide grip but the

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.620 
so I can't do the wide grip but the
things<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.580> want<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> look<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.090> on<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> squat

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
forward lean problem so this like I was

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.020 
forward lean problem so this like I was
talking<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.370> deadlift<00:03:56.700> you<00:03:56.880> want

back just an inch that will set
everything<00:04:05.549> correctly<00:04:06.209> that<00:04:06.329> will<00:04:06.480> get<00:04:06.570> you

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
everything correctly that will get you

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.920 
everything correctly that will get you
