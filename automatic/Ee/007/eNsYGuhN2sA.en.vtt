00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hi to all and the room in this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.490
 video we're going to talk about banishing lio 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.810
 money glitch and gÃ¼tsch rp it's 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.980
 sure to watch my channel every day 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.420
 if you want to miss anything because 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.700
 jean-claude of videos or more per day 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.809
 on gta 5 online you are a lot to me 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.309
 ask how do you do when you 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.020
 wake up one morning and you see 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.910
 your account level 1 or so without 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.109
 money or even banned then I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.000
 proposes to send a request to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.289
 rockstar by explaining the problem of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.560
 time it is due to an error in their 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.119
 share 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 except that most of the time it is 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 rather an error on your part and I 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.779
 go again today you 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.369
 warn 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.840
 even though I know that the life of great at 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.009
 is always present anyway 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.870
 that you are aware of the risks 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.520
 so among the people who contacted me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.469
 I asked a guy named jeff 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.860
 if I could use his screen in 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.350
 video 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.000
 he accepted so thank you jeff I tell you 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 the query that sent him rockstar is the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.969
 answer he got so that's it 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 a good time now 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.930
 well before the 1.17 update that I 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 am stuck at level 1 I thought the 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.800
 problem would be solved after a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.270
 day gta but nothing will change and saw that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.039
 I can not do anything about gta 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.690
 with a level 1 beats so I told myself 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.460
 that it would be nice to report 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.379
 ps i can not buy house anymore 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.120
 was going to buy custom clothing and 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.500
 vehicles change hairstyle and nothing 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 is not indicated on the map 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.890
 apart from the armory the answer he 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.990
 had on behalf of rockstar 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.030
 hello thanks for your message and for 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.200
 your patience after checking your 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.880
 account it appeared that you have 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.470
 used many times 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.420
 unconventional ways to win 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.799
 gta dollars or erp and 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 manipulations can corrupt your 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.250
 game data for example this number 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.420
 rp negative unfortunately we do not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.229
 can not repair the files from 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.970
 corrupted backups 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.770
 people who actively cheat 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 exploit the game will be subject to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 penalties at our discretion 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.900
 the penalty incurred are the placement mode 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.189
 cheats or banishment I was 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.930
 online to know the conditions 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.189
 of use jt online we will 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 recommend reading the articles 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.090
 following etc etc 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.560
 so he used glitches like 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.000
 many do it except that now he 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.619
 is blocked level 1 and his account him 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.939
 no longer really serves you 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.229
 can always decide on glitch and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.670
 nothing prevents you 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 you may pass between 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.880
 mesh of the net maybe there will be no 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.290
 worries for a little while until 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 day when rockstar will decide to drop you 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.509
 above 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.740
 whatever happens I advise you this 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.869
 that I advise you for a moment 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.070
 just what you have 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.390
 can you have glitch there are two 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.770
 months and grog star sites only 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.180
 now to banish you then 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.409
 do not increase the risks I speak 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.509
 of course for the most people 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.950
 wise those who like glitch risks 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.690
 and I think that's the solution that 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.380
 you have to remember one thing 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.030
 rockstar 2 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.280
 nasty only from the moment 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.990
 you touch the rp and the dollar gta for 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.580
 the rest they are much more flexible 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.240
 that's all for this video but I 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.720
 tell you just now 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.720
 ciao
