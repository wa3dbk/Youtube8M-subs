00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.510
 So here in the lab over there in the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.860
 third box because we have the same 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.860
 commercial spot was filmed here 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.150
 says here at this point so here 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.199
 also we have why bigger 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.510
 here presented the city ​​as well 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.939
 that was the clipping here 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.880
 worked and the commercial should just 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.010
 also show where we work and also the 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.150
 People show the caffeine behind 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.500
 project stuck 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.610
 I do not have the commercials that 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 First time I saw him 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.500
 seen quite often and I had to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.290
 always something and what are they holding 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.489
 from the werbespot the commercial spot for me 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.379
 of course a real challenge 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.520
 because it is the first time that one 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.950
 research leader in advertising occurs 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 i 'm schwabe i do not have either 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.120
 just really the High German the 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.829
 get laid cradle and was therefore 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 So also the promise 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.820
 speaking speed that was one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.830
 right challenge and find it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.580
 Well, that bot works because we 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.490
 are already in the sometimes question 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.450
 if he works well 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.990
 she did not ask if I was beautiful 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.689
 find 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.000
 indeed, that was good, I see 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.770
 even the growth curve from the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.750
 I know the advertising but what exactly 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.700
 actually says out here you can go in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.770
 very nice to see what happens when 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.810
 ever in the scalp winter 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.540
 more and more people entice people 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.770
 have a hereditary disposition 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 mostly they entitle unterhaus 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.720
 background of this rejected equipment is 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.189
 a sensitivity of the hair roots 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.079
 against testosterone 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.470
 testosterone is capable of 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.329
 Shorten phases of growth and thus 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.520
 to lose more hair than 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.579
 normal in such a cycle are common 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.500
 as early as possible preventively here in this 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 work zone because I have the best 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.430
 opportunities and that is in a sense here 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320
 represented by the regular 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.190
 application of the protein complex so 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.770
 caffeine 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.610
 zinc and year pull what the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.070
 growth phases then back to that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.500
 normal measure lengthens the caffeine is 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.869
 an active substance that so quickly into the 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.630
 scalp can bring that to us 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.160
 even possible for the first time that was in 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.770
 a shampoo what a short one 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.210
 exposure time has to take effect 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.060
 and that's why we have a group in 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.860
 shampoo develops this only at 120 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.770
 seconds of exposure already the caffeine 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.770
 effect may result in the hair root
