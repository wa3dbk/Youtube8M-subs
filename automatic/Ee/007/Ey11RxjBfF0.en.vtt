doing in the past two videos because it

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.460

just<00:01:08.250> takes<00:01:08.549> too<00:01:08.790> long<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.900> rather<00:01:10.200> have

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
just takes too long and then rather have

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160 
just takes too long and then rather have
you<00:01:10.590> just<00:01:10.860> focus<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.490> boss<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> now<00:01:13.020> we're

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you just focus on the boss so now we're

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.960

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
believe he's going to send out his aw

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.729 
believe he's going to send out his aw
water<00:02:32.819> toad<00:02:33.819> thing<00:02:34.380> because<00:02:35.380> that<00:02:35.590> would<00:02:35.709> just

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
water toad thing because that would just

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.580 
water toad thing because that would just
be<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.069> most<00:02:36.430> logical<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:38.260> we're<00:02:38.380> going<00:02:38.530> to

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
be the most logical so we're going to

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.430 
be the most logical so we're going to
send<00:02:38.769> out<00:02:38.890> snake<00:02:40.620> which<00:02:42.989> yeah<00:02:43.989> a<00:02:44.019> good

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
send out snake which yeah a good

to<00:02:47.380> use<00:02:47.560> grass<00:02:47.980> mixer<00:02:49.470> hopefully<00:02:50.470> it<00:02:51.069> takes<00:02:51.459> it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
to use grass mixer hopefully it takes it
