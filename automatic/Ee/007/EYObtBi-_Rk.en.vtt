let's keep this review going by talking
about<00:01:27.240> utility<00:01:27.779> and<00:01:28.020> i'm<00:01:28.109> actually<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.709> to

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
about utility and i'm actually going to

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.010 
about utility and i'm actually going to
bring<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.700> wire<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.359> side<00:01:30.689> right

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bring out the wire to the side right

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.249 
bring out the wire to the side right
here<00:01:31.579> so<00:01:32.579> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:33.149> wire<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.539> actually

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
here so this is a wire that actually

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.410 
here so this is a wire that actually
comes<00:01:34.529> with<00:01:34.679> it<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> plugs<00:01:35.729> into<00:01:35.909> your<00:01:36.060> media

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
comes with it that plugs into your media

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
possible fit so I just talked about some

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.449 
possible fit so I just talked about some
of<00:02:53.310> features<00:02:54.140> so<00:02:55.140> there<00:02:55.350> is<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> large<00:02:55.830> dynamic

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
of features so there is a large dynamic

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.390 
of features so there is a large dynamic
range<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.360> extremely<00:02:58.170> consistent<00:02:58.950> low

range of extremely consistent low
distortion<00:02:59.880> detail<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.660> clarity<00:03:00.890> there's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
distortion detail and clarity there's

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.920 
distortion detail and clarity there's
extremely<00:03:02.459> low<00:03:02.670> frequency<00:03:02.930> definition

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
extremely low frequency definition

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.460 
extremely low frequency definition
ensures<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.490> base<00:03:05.790> component<00:03:06.780> of<00:03:06.900> your<00:03:07.080> music

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
ensures the base component of your music

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.440 
ensures the base component of your music
is<00:03:07.590> accurately<00:03:08.100> reproduced<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.180> not

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
is accurately reproduced and it's not

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.380 
is accurately reproduced and it's not
lost<00:03:09.780> there's<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.770> transparent<00:03:11.430> reproduction

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
lost there's a transparent reproduction

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.330 
lost there's a transparent reproduction
of<00:03:12.510> high<00:03:12.690> frequencies<00:03:13.380> resulting<00:03:14.220> in<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
of high frequencies resulting in a

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.440 
of high frequencies resulting in a
highly<00:03:14.700> accurate<00:03:14.730> imaging<00:03:15.630> there's<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.620> high

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
highly accurate imaging there's a high

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.560 
highly accurate imaging there's a high

efficiency neodymium 40 millimeter drive

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.259 
efficiency neodymium 40 millimeter drive
so<00:03:22.410> that's<00:03:22.650> actually<00:03:23.130> this<00:03:23.459> right<00:03:23.850> at<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> end

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
so that's actually this right at the end

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.930 
so that's actually this right at the end
of<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.930> cord<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.560> let's<00:03:26.310> say<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.519> don't<00:03:26.790> want

you<00:03:27.450> don't<00:03:27.480> really<00:03:27.780> want<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.200> you<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.620> want

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
you don't really want that you just want

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.610 
you don't really want that you just want
