00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
is like more of a concrete idea is to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.970 
is like more of a concrete idea is to
follow<00:01:52.660> breath<00:01:52.930> my<00:01:53.080> shows<00:01:53.290> this<00:01:53.650> is<00:01:53.770> what<00:01:53.950> I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
follow breath my shows this is what I

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.060 
follow breath my shows this is what I
did<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.660> started<00:01:55.750> developing<00:01:56.530> my

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
did when I started developing my

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.920 
did when I started developing my
designer<00:01:57.400> knowledge<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.090> knowledge<00:01:58.659> of

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
designer knowledge and knowledge of

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.480 
designer knowledge and knowledge of
collections<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.650> seasons<00:02:00.010> and<00:02:00.190> things<00:02:00.370> like

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
collections and seasons and things like

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.960 
collections and seasons and things like
that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
that

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.240 
that
I<00:02:01.000> even<00:02:01.420> Lidge<00:02:01.780> asleep<00:02:02.140> all<00:02:02.320> of<00:02:02.440> my<00:02:02.710> shows<00:02:02.980> I

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
I even Lidge asleep all of my shows I

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.860 
I even Lidge asleep all of my shows I
did<00:02:03.370> that<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:03.820> probably<00:02:04.030> about<00:02:04.300> three<00:02:04.630> years

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
did that for probably about three years

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.260 
did that for probably about three years
like<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.260> would<00:02:05.409> follow<00:02:05.650> it<00:02:05.860> by<00:02:06.310> season<00:02:06.790> as<00:02:07.030> it

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
like I would follow it by season as it

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.860 
like I would follow it by season as it
was<00:02:07.360> happening

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
was happening

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.899 
was happening
it<00:02:08.349> got<00:02:08.560> super<00:02:08.769> stressful<00:02:09.190> and<00:02:09.580> I've<00:02:09.640> spoken

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:09.909 
it got super stressful and I've spoken

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.490 
it got super stressful and I've spoken
about<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.269> before<00:02:10.330> but<00:02:10.840> I<00:02:10.869> think<00:02:10.989> that

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
about this before but I think that

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.580 
about this before but I think that
there's<00:02:12.430> just<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:12.849> much<00:02:13.090> out<00:02:13.300> there<00:02:13.569> now<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
there's just so much out there now and

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.309 
there's just so much out there now and
it<00:02:14.890> is<00:02:15.010> really<00:02:15.190> overwhelming<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.659> got<00:02:16.989> into

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
it is really overwhelming and I got into

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.119 
it is really overwhelming and I got into
kind<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.650> slump

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
kind of a slump

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.430 
kind of a slump
when<00:02:18.580> I<00:02:18.970> realized<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.659> I<00:02:19.930> was<00:02:20.050> doing<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.319> lot

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
when I realized that I was doing a lot

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.170 
when I realized that I was doing a lot
more<00:02:20.470> work<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.010> trying<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.670> keep<00:02:21.819> up<00:02:21.940> with<00:02:21.970> it

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
more work and trying to keep up with it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.670 
more work and trying to keep up with it
a<00:02:22.239> lot<00:02:22.390> more<00:02:22.569> than<00:02:22.750> my<00:02:22.870> peers<00:02:23.170> were<00:02:23.349> actually

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
a lot more than my peers were actually

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.250 
a lot more than my peers were actually
doing<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.099> fashion<00:02:24.489> school<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:26.019> kind<00:02:26.049> of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
doing in fashion school and that kind of

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.350 
doing in fashion school and that kind of
killed<00:02:26.500> my<00:02:26.650> motivation<00:02:27.250> now<00:02:27.640> what<00:02:27.909> I<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.120> is

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
killed my motivation now what I do is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.030 
killed my motivation now what I do is
pretty<00:02:28.930> much<00:02:29.080> wait<00:02:29.290> for<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.560> season<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.010> be
