possibility of losing your items so then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
possibility of losing your items so then
I<00:00:43.469> didn't<00:00:43.680> want<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.789> was<00:00:45.030> like

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
I didn't want to do it but I was like

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.580 
I didn't want to do it but I was like
you<00:00:45.270> know<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.690> gonna<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
you know what I'm gonna just do it and

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.319 
you know what I'm gonna just do it and
we<00:00:46.950> were<00:00:47.070> testing<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:47.879> never<00:00:48.030> really

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
we were testing it and we never really

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
we were testing it and we never really
lost<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.719> items<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.350> let<00:00:49.469> me<00:00:49.530> show<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.710> how

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
lost the items so let me show you how

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.450 
lost the items so let me show you how
this<00:00:49.920> works<00:00:50.449> I'm<00:00:51.449> very<00:00:51.930> important<00:00:52.350> though<00:00:52.500> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this works I'm very important though it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
this works I'm very important though it
only<00:00:53.820> works<00:00:54.800> with<00:00:55.800> items<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.570> use

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
only works with items that you can use

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.680 
only works with items that you can use
without<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.829> crafting<00:00:59.489> table<00:00:59.730> so<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.239> example

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
without a crafting table so for example

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.029 
without a crafting table so for example
if<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:01.350> planks

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
if you have planks

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.039 
if you have planks
I<00:01:02.070> mean<00:01:02.460> logs<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> can<00:01:03.239> make<00:01:03.449> planks<00:01:03.809> if<00:01:03.930> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
I mean logs you can make planks if you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.260 
I mean logs you can make planks if you
have<00:01:04.170> planks<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.890> sticks<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:06.119> you

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
have planks you can make sticks if you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.380 
have planks you can make sticks if you
have<00:01:06.390> Sam<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> can<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.640> sense<00:01:08.640> down<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have Sam and you can make sense down and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.670 
have Sam and you can make sense down and
this<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.659> what<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.110> frying<00:01:10.290> dude<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.560> was

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this is what I was frying dude I was

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
this is what I was frying dude I was
thinking<00:01:11.189> that<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.400> was<00:01:11.490> different<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
thinking that it was different from the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.609 
thinking that it was different from the
other<00:01:12.720> ones<00:01:12.960> where<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.200> can<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.500> actually

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
other ones where you can just actually

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
other ones where you can just actually
craft<00:01:14.130> items<00:01:14.580> or<00:01:14.790> smelt<00:01:15.299> them<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.600> they<00:01:15.720> were

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
craft items or smelt them if they were

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.840 
craft items or smelt them if they were
duplicated<00:01:16.680> because<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.520> trying<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.729> find

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
duplicated because I was trying to find

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.010 
duplicated because I was trying to find
a<00:01:17.909> way<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.060> get<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> guys<00:01:18.390> saying<00:01:18.810> cuz

everybody's really sad about the sand

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.899 
everybody's really sad about the sand
generators<00:01:20.909> not<00:01:21.060> working<00:01:21.590> sorry

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.179 

no<00:01:26.909> but<00:01:27.240> yes<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.380> works<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.890> lot<00:01:29.100> of

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
no but yes so it works for a lot of

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.160 
no but yes so it works for a lot of
things<00:01:29.430> just<00:01:29.490> look<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.090> your<00:01:30.210> crafting

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
things just look at your crafting

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740 
things just look at your crafting
inventory<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> without<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.310> table<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.180> if

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
inventory here without the table and if

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
inventory here without the table and if
you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> items<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.979> they're

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
you have the items and they're

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.179 
you have the items and they're
duplicated<00:01:36.210> then<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.229> can<00:01:37.409> crack<00:01:37.710> any<00:01:38.009> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
duplicated then you can crack any of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
duplicated then you can crack any of
these<00:01:38.369> things<00:01:38.610> okay<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:40.229> example<00:01:40.259> let's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
these things okay so for example let's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.030 
these things okay so for example let's
say<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.790> have<00:01:42.210> pistons<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> don't<00:01:43.890> have

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
say you have pistons but you don't have

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.350 
say you have pistons but you don't have
slime<00:01:44.280> balls<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.790> have<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> couple<00:01:45.210> of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
slime balls but you have a couple of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
slime balls but you have a couple of
slime<00:01:45.600> balls<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.110> at<00:01:46.259> least<00:01:46.380> nine<00:01:46.649> slime

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
slime balls for at least nine slime

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.030 
slime balls for at least nine slime
balls<00:01:47.729> then<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> duplicate<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.409> use

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
balls then you can duplicate and use

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
balls then you can duplicate and use
them<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.670> create<00:01:51.210> sticky<00:01:51.780> pistons<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.350> long<00:01:52.530> as

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
them to create sticky pistons as long as

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.130 
them to create sticky pistons as long as
you<00:01:52.710> have<00:01:52.799> normal<00:01:53.100> Pistons<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.820> make

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
you have normal Pistons you can make

time on each one of these in the hot bar

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.399 
time on each one of these in the hot bar
that's<00:02:28.629> it<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.590> hit<00:02:29.769> Y<00:02:30.129> here<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:32.230> go

that's it now you hit Y here and you go

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.830 
that's it now you hit Y here and you go
down<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.860> line<00:02:33.010> hit<00:02:33.370> Y<00:02:33.670> again<00:02:34.000> hit<00:02:34.269> Y<00:02:34.540> again

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
down the line hit Y again hit Y again

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.780 
down the line hit Y again hit Y again
hit<00:02:35.049> Y<00:02:35.290> again<00:02:37.319> now<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.379> see<00:02:38.739> you<00:02:39.340> have<00:02:39.370> sand

here you have sand here okay again I'm
not<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.099> creative<00:02:42.519> before<00:02:43.209> somebody<00:02:43.510> freaks

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
not in creative before somebody freaks

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.830 
not in creative before somebody freaks
out<00:02:44.340> now<00:02:45.340> all<00:02:45.549> you<00:02:45.670> do<00:02:45.819> is<00:02:45.970> hit<00:02:46.090> Y<00:02:46.359> there<00:02:46.690> is<00:02:46.720> a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
out now all you do is hit Y there is a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.780 
out now all you do is hit Y there is a
chance<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.379> they<00:02:47.650> will<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.400> not<00:02:48.579> work

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
chance that they will it will not work

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.430 
chance that they will it will not work
let's<00:02:49.420> see<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:49.629> that<00:02:49.780> happens<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.489> I<00:02:51.489> hit<00:02:51.639> B

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
let's see if that happens and I hit B

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.530 
let's see if that happens and I hit B
and<00:02:53.440> there<00:02:53.709> they<00:02:53.859> are<00:02:53.889> I<00:02:54.190> got<00:02:54.400> them<00:02:54.579> okay<00:02:54.790> so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
and there they are I got them okay so

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.330 
and there they are I got them okay so
now<00:02:55.720> I'm<00:02:56.139> gonna<00:02:56.260> make<00:02:56.470> sandstone<00:02:59.099> there<00:03:00.099> we<00:03:00.220> go

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
now I'm gonna make sandstone there we go

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.960 
now I'm gonna make sandstone there we go
so<00:03:01.120> now<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.329> used<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.500> glyphs<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.609> I<00:03:03.760> had

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
very first one we hit y and then we go

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:42.210 
very first one we hit y and then we go
down<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.930> line<00:03:41.079> hitting<00:03:41.319> Y<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.739> each<00:03:41.889> one<00:03:42.069> of

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
down the line hitting Y on each one of

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.479 
down the line hitting Y on each one of
these<00:03:42.660> these<00:03:43.660> are<00:03:43.870> all<00:03:44.049> glitched<00:03:44.379> and<00:03:45.010> let<00:03:45.430> me

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
these these are all glitched and let me

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
I'm not gonna be able to mine it because

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.199 
I'm not gonna be able to mine it because
I<00:04:05.470> don't<00:04:05.650> have<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.799> pick<00:04:06.010> let's<00:04:06.699> see<00:04:06.819> it's<00:04:06.970> fine

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
I don't have a pick let's see it's fine

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.670 
I don't have a pick let's see it's fine
and<00:04:07.419> then<00:04:07.690> we'll<00:04:07.810> take<00:04:08.019> you<00:04:08.290> know<00:04:08.379> the<00:04:08.500> nine

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
and then we'll take you know the nine

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.099 
and then we'll take you know the nine
that<00:04:08.889> we<00:04:08.979> would<00:04:09.159> have<00:04:09.220> had<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.879> whatever<00:04:10.690> so

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
that we would have had and whatever so

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.140 
that we would have had and whatever so
this<00:04:11.500> is<00:04:11.620> not<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.829> good<00:04:11.979> example<00:04:12.069> now<00:04:12.519> because<00:04:12.879> I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
this is not a good example now because I

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.020 
this is not a good example now because I
can't<00:04:13.720> make<00:04:14.470> them<00:04:14.650> into<00:04:14.829> things<00:04:15.069> so<00:04:15.669> now<00:04:15.819> let's

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
can't make them into things so now let's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.680 
can't make them into things so now let's
use<00:04:16.680> no<00:04:17.680> it's<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.979> park<00:04:18.250> it's<00:04:18.430> still<00:04:19.269> perfect

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
use no it's the park it's still perfect

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.360 
use no it's the park it's still perfect
just<00:04:20.260> one<00:04:20.560> more<00:04:20.709> example<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.130> then<00:04:21.280> we're

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
just one more example and then we're

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.430 
just one more example and then we're
gonna<00:04:21.489> call<00:04:21.760> it<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:22.000> day

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
gonna call it a day

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.160 
gonna call it a day
so

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170
