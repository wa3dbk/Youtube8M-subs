00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:28.449
 Well, first of all, we are going to prepare the 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:31.789
 sofrito first we're going to put the 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:34.670
 pot with a little oil and honey 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.860
 let's add the onions left let's go 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.239
 to chop the pieces more or less 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
 great because then we're going to 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:43.239
 crush with the blender we put the 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.239
 onion 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.780
 we peel the cloves of garlic 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.910
 also to the pot we do the same with 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.020
 the green pepper we open it we need 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.730
 the seeds 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.829
 and for inside and the tomato because we give it 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.079
 four cut 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.200
 and we put that pot on the fire when the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.440
 sofrito this fact we add a glass 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.290
 of water and grind with the blender 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:18.340
 and that is going to be the background with which we are going 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.340
 to cook this stew the sirloin what 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.700
 we clean well of grease streaks and what 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.230
 troceamos thickness pieces which 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.590
 more we do not like it 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:35.410
 We will add all that meat to the 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.410
 pot where we have the crushed sofrito 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.890
 and we are going to add a glass of wine 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.050
 amontillado and use of marks 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.180
 stew could use the one you want if 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.640
 you do not have thin wine amontillado 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.980
 for inside and to fire medium fire 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.960
 while this is boiling for 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.660
 that the alcohol of the wine evaporates 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.400
 we peel our carrots and we go 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.950
 to chop 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.289
 we do the same with green beans 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.319
 we removed the tips the beans 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.109
 we cut them into pieces 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.849
 and finally the mushrooms I 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.829
 I used a can of mushrooms because 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.980
 you had it in natural pine nuts 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.989
 I would have had natural stamps what 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.879
 I would have laminated and added it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.810
 at this moment because it is much more 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:30.050
 rich that the stew we add all the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.260
 vegetable to the pot 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:36.770
 we remove and now we have to add the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:39.860
 potatoes or potatoes hairs 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.960
 trophies and I'm putting a dish 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.940
 dish per person who is not very 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.330
 grocery store and those are the potatoes that 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.980
 damaged 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.860
 Now she gives me a little salt 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.050
 little bit of pepper we close the pot 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.550
 let's have the fast pot chopping 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.000
 about 20-30 minutes 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.660
 when we finish we open 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 and it 's the whole cooked aspect 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.540
 adding a little more broth 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.200
 we are dry rectified of salt and 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.590
 pepper we give a last mistake 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.230
 and there's our stew ready to 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:19.340
 serve it a very complete dish that 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.930
 take everything and eat, said I hope that
