 they represent the white house the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 President Barack Obama is one of the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.649
 central figures that you're worried about in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.320

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.500
 useful until weeks ago nothing more 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.780
 Eduardo what do you mean when you use 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.970
 all legal avenues to recover to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.340
 Edwards do not see how you're doing 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.530

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.450
 audience of the agenda open on the day of 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.610
 yesterday the president barack obama as already 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.680
 well I mentioned it said they are going to 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.470
 use all legal tools 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.870
 that you have in the USA to find the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.490
 whereabouts of eduard snowden this said it 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.380
 before meeting with businessmen to 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.580
 talk about the benefits of reform 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 migratory that is being discussed 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.460
 also in this country he has said that he 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.380
 will be using all the codes of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.790
 diplomacy to be able to find the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.950
 whereabouts of snowden and is that the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.380
 concern for usa is not minimal 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.510
 especially since it is known that snowden 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.430
 traveled with four computers that 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.250
 contain information that could 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.240
 reveal very interesting things about 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.950
 what does the us in pro say they of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.140
 international security and in the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.300
 combating terrorism yet 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
 here the debate about how much is 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:45.090
 willing to access by the name of that 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.400
 anti- terrorist fight against 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.040
 privacy of the users of 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.600
 telecommunications services 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.880
 is what is in the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.159
 public agenda today especially 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.710
 because citizens are asking 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.470
 still if they have been spied on and the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.450
 government knows that he has made calls 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.640
 who have made some publications in 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.039
 Internet that could put at risk or 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.259
 simply turn them into suspects 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.239
 Yesterday I was already one of the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.580
 spokespersons of the white house saying that 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.620
 there are some issues that are 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.260
 putting in danger and at some risk 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.440
 the relationship with some countries even 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.930
 he was referring to china who said he gave the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.600
 welcome so he could leave from 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.640
 that semi-autonomous territory hong kong 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.530
 edward snowden and has also been 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.080
 already communicated with countries of america 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.630
 Latin and with Russia to ask them not to 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.330

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.500
 the situation and in and then we 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 we will keep an eye on the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.180
 reactions that there are today about 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.549
 whereabouts and of course the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.980
 Search for snowden lourdes well eduardo 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.290
 thank you and we simply say goodbye 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.420
 now so that it does not get interrupted if it's 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.920
 that there are some new statements 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.420
 all the tools will be used 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.569

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.440
 to recover edwards do not hesitate in this 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.120
 former CIA agent who confirmed the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.000
 whole world that through the agency 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.010
 of US security spied on not 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.170
 only to citizens who are in 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.760
 the border of that country but not 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.230
 knew borders that system of 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.690
 espionage are nine the companies of 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.340
 telecommunications that provided support 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.950
 they delivered the data as emails 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.360
 electronic movements on the web and 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.030
 also record calls 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.730
 telephone they remember ape to their 73 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.560
 that weeks ago also reported that 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 20 of its lines in the offices 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.489
 centers had been punctured 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.959
 intervened and that was monitored not 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.630
 only calls but it 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.910
 they recorded everything with the excuse of avoiding 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.830
 terrorist actions this terrorism 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.420
 always appears as an excuse there 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.120
 part of the administration of the house 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.390
 white ' good now also usa said 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.660
 that neither snowden nor any country that 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.060
 support defends liberties ie 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.010
 from there to say that russia china or even 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.190
 of ecuador is a terrorist country there is a 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.410
 very line 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.150
 it's about interpretations you have to 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.420
 be very careful with that we are going to 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.420
 review
