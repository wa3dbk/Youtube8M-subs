00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:14.370
 I'm slippery online here 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:19.350
 there is an expert and there he is 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.650
 chiquita online and what he just 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.680
 do have here is feeding the weapon 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.449
 threatened the cashier a bit 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:35.640
 print 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:38.960
 He clears the money for the cat from the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.329
 sack money you have to shoot a bit 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.770
 and then you have to be in the online zeugin 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.700
 in the playstation store on 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.170
 europe where kate back yes then you come 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
 Get out of the online mode here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.910
 the online store so a playstation 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.090
 store is not buying anything so easy 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.859
 go in to the playstation store 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 then it would be here then go out again 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.010
 come back to the gta online world and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.420
 then everything will be new again 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:22.140
 bond the pigs are gone then that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:24.710
 do the same again so long, for example 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.060
 current games have been here so 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.360
 $ 400,000 has slipped and has become 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.110
 bought the house 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.100
 century and again in the future 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.979
 make money very fast 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.020
 java applets show you again so the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.369
 is something that gives the gt r 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.030
 so lucky I have it in the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.530
 singleplayer campaign 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.539
 cash carrier so what kind of something 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.429
 there have been since in any case that a 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.170
 little video about this gta and language 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.369

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.859
