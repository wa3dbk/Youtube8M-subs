00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.460 
you would collect all the suitcases and
then<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.790> more<00:01:43.970> suitcases<00:01:44.180> he<00:01:44.630> thought<00:01:44.870> it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
then the more suitcases he thought it

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.640 
then the more suitcases he thought it
unlocked<00:01:46.070> cheat<00:01:46.790> codes<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.530> there<00:01:48.530> was<00:01:48.619> a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
unlocked cheat codes and there was a

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.410 
unlocked cheat codes and there was a
cheat<00:01:48.950> code<00:01:48.979> on<00:01:49.310> there<00:01:49.490> where<00:01:49.640> it<00:01:49.940> went<00:01:50.240> and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
cheat code on there where it went and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.030 
cheat code on there where it went and
whenever<00:01:50.540> you<00:01:50.750> killed<00:01:50.990> an<00:01:51.110> enemy<00:01:51.229> in<00:01:51.530> campaign

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
whenever you killed an enemy in campaign

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.400 
whenever you killed an enemy in campaign
tires<00:01:52.880> will<00:01:53.240> fly<00:01:53.450> out<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.630> their<00:01:53.900> body<00:01:54.110> so

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
tires will fly out of their body so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.440 
tires will fly out of their body so
that's<00:01:54.680> that's<00:01:55.040> similar<00:01:55.580> to<00:01:55.640> this<00:01:55.880> except

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
that's that's similar to this except

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.050 
that's that's similar to this except
it's<00:01:56.750> aliens<00:01:57.350> it<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.130> actually<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.520> lot<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.820> fun

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's aliens it is actually a lot of fun

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.880 
it's aliens it is actually a lot of fun
but<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.450> is<00:01:59.479> also<00:01:59.810> distracting<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.830> the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
but it is also distracting that of the

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.639 
but it is also distracting that of the
SSB<00:02:01.190> you're<00:02:02.060> gonna<00:02:02.180> constantly<00:02:02.600> just<00:02:03.140> kind<00:02:03.590> of

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
SSB you're gonna constantly just kind of

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:05.710 
SSB you're gonna constantly just kind of
look<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.040> them<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:04.910> then<00:02:05.090> again<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.509> does

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
look at them and but then again it does

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.450 
look at them and but then again it does
also<00:02:06.200> make<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.560> want<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.830> kill<00:02:07.070> them<00:02:07.220> even

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
also make you want to kill them even

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.120 
also make you want to kill them even
more<00:02:07.700> it<00:02:08.600> is<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> lot<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:08.959> fun<00:02:09.229> so<00:02:09.590> go<00:02:09.860> ahead<00:02:09.979> and
