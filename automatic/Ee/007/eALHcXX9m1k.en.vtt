00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.919
 We are the first swiss museum to show 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.750
 a solo exhibition by alex katz and 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.599
 It is surprising that this is very 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.449
 internationally renowned painters and 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.180
 artist never in a swiss 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.350
 museum was honored 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.120
 and for some it is also very 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.089
 Surprisingly, that's what it is 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.110
 In the museum house constructively happens 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:50.210
 a museum that is right in front of everyone 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.850
 things with the constructive concrete 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.649
 and conceptual art connects and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.530
 this is also the home of our museum 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:01.129
 that's our basis from there we go 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.780
 again and again from there 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.850
 So from the beginning of the twentieth 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.610
 from the 20th century we also develop 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.399
 again and again historical 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.190
 Exhibitions at the same time we provide 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:15.470
 of course this instrumentarium that us 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.190
 the constructive and conceptual art 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.580
 also offers in relationships too 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.640
 young position younger position or 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.209
 but also positions now 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.819
 but they are not constructive per se 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:34.660
 If you are shown here in the house 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.009
 constructively again the possibility 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.000
 get that a new echo room 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.459
 opened 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.709
 In concrete terms, that means that we now 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.979
 in our exhibition lens yellow the 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:48.080
 focus on the landscapes 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:51.259
 but also because that's what it's there 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.929
 so special makes this fine 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.229
 the degree of abstraction he develops in 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:59.630
 his work that we show the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:03.099
 the landscape devised since the end of the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.099
 40s to today 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.950
 alex katz plumbs in his straight in the 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.100
 great formats over and over again this 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.840
 moment is what i see so the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.860
 I can do that with different forms 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:10.160
 I say this is a water lily 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.750
 that's a tree or that's the sky 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.540
 or can i also use this one 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.630
 the world of forms he uses and also 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.460
 certainly also figures selects can I the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.510
 also allow that remains free 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.630
 So I always have to go immediately 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.890
 I can or do interpret that too 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.890
 simply as a shape constellation 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.890
 accept 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.919
 I think his pictures are like that 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.389
 fascinating also because they are the 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.919
 Art history on a very special 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.930
 reflect in a wise way 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.870
 So if we now for example a 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.389
 think important picturesque positions 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.340
 who also earn for the concrete 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.010
 were very important art such 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.510
 example tremble 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:42.510
 this whole de construction of the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.229
 even then he is a painter 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.740
 this in a very special way 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:53.820
 this tradition of taking on 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.310
 Deconstruction of what we mean 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.470
 call reality and in his 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.240
 We can also get pictures 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.110
 say dream reality that is not 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.690
 the right word 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.229
 but we get like a parallel 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.330
 reality also operates in the us 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.060
 is of course our decision 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.130
 can move freely so what 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.320
 he is fascinated by his painting 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.410
 she does not pretend to us 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.889
 she offers us possibilities 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.410
 so referrals and at the same time 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:26.730
 we move freely in that 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.510
 I believe exactly what a painting 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.510
 make up
