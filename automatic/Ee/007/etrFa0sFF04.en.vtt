00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.000
 lexus compact crossover 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.010
 This car was waited for a very long time and now 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.559
 finally she appeared named 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.030
 lexus nx think many will agree with me 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 if I say that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.740
 nx perhaps the most stylish crossover of 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 now present in our market even 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.660
 hard to believe that the model divides 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.970
 one platform with toyota rav4 aspect ratio 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
 body glazing front form 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.189
 front back design all your 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.120
 original optics akin to the youngest 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.920
 models as 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.129
 grille like all modern 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.710
 Lexus massive and aggressive nothing 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 You can not say for the design confident five with 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
 plus in the story about the interior of the new 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.930
 index can talk about design and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.030
 style of architecture 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 front panel about the quality of materials but 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.949
 all this pales in comparison with the chairs 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 Perhaps this is the best seat in which I 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.760
 had a chance to sit lately not 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.050
 despite the fact that it looks sports 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 buckets and they really 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.859
 with a pronounced profile is very hard 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.930
 but nevertheless they seem 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 envelops the body seems to me in these 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.860
 chairs you can drive huge 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.810
 number of kilometers and not get tired what is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.119
 relates directly to the interior in 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 particular front panel 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.610
 intricate in appearance with complex 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 architecture 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.450
 at the same time brand new 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
 lexus corporate identity 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 of course there was a place for branded 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.380
 hours that really look like 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.630
 everything is very expensive with everything 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.490
 in their places all very high quality 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.470
 performed and there is a huge amount 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.450
 all sorts of pleasant things well 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.979
 for example on the central tunnel there 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.790
 such a small cap which if 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.100
 pull the tongue 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.950
 then we can see that it is not easy 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.290
 the lid and this mirror is probably 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.840
 this is a nod to the female half 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.729
 audience who buys this car under 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.829
 the cap itself is a small niche 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 where apparently you can probably put it well 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.630
 I didn't use it to put out lipstick 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.369
 there is such a central armrest 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
 shelf on which you can put 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.610
 the phone is nothing but a wireless 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.470
 charging 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.880
 but true as I understand it for this 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.680
 need to buy extra 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.170
 devices that allow you to charge 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.789
 your phone wirelessly if its 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.240
 assets then we'll find out just 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.800
 a huge boxed velvet that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.510
 you can still say the central display 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.450
 It has a very good quality 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.220
 graphics beautiful animation enjoyable 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.350
 algorithms and usability but 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.760
 it is not touch although in principle to me 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.190
 it seems that it is not very important because 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.959
 that to control all systems 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.550
 use the only one like this 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.190
 selector in more expensive trim levels 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.900
 there may be a touch panel instead 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.390
 beyond that manage different 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.700
 multimedia system features can be at 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.350
 the help of voice commands back sofa is not 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.600
 less beautiful and comfortable than the front 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.430
 chairs with no central 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.780
 the tunnel assumes full 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.030
 Triple occupancy 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.100
 no restrictions on the growth of passengers 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.170
 because as you see I sit now myself 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.540
 for a lot of things here 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.650
 rear passenger seats 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.489
 center deflectors available 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.980
 blowing a massive armrest with pretty 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:05.650
 tricky coasters and even 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.630
 backrest angle adjustment 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.060
 only one but pretty 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.620
 a significant minus is what if you 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.480
 will have to get here on the back sofa 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.970
 be sure to bend your head because 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.890
 chances of hitting badly 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.970
 tilted rear rack in more 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.410
 expensive trim levels 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.690
 rear seat equipped 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 electric drives and the passengers themselves can 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.380
 admiring the panoramic roof from 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.570
 compact crossover in principle not 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.830
 expect record numbers 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.750
 luggage compartment volume but not 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.459
 less have other dignity pretty good 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.739
 regular geometric shape with 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.110
 nice velor trim and there is even 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.239
 no fasteners 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:42.940
 pleasant that the linker managed 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:45.160
 fit under the floor not only with the spare tire and 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.200
 small organizer but even found 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.239
 a place for batteries and such a decision 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.920
 quite logical because under the hood 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.350
 housed hybrid drive system 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.680
 and its batteries are hidden under the rear 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.600
 seat specifications 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.459
 lexus nx 300h 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.100
 length is 4630 millimeters width 1845 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.580
 millimeter 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.490
 height 1600 45 millimeter drive type 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:13.460
 the total power of the power plant 197 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.400
 horsepower maximum speed 180 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.810
 kilometers per hour 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.700
 many wonder why pay 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.500
 more for lexus if there is the same 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.810
 toyota what is the difference 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 I can say that the difference really 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.420
 there is despite the fact that other rav 4 sai 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.360
 the same platform of others will eat more 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.700
 nobly the suspension is slightly better 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.190
 tuned car more pleasantly controlled 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.170
 clearer and more transparent 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.750
 there really is this feeling 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.270
 high prices and nobility nx on which 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.000
 i'm on my way now he's a hybrid this version 300 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.710
 hey and again there is also his 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.050
 advantage despite the fact that the car 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.240
 goes like a three-liter at the very 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.070
 there are less powerful less 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.760
 surround engine which allows 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:00.380
 develop the same power but when 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.840
 more economical that this 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.180
 hybrid version and says flap 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:07.580
 instrumentation left side which should 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.220
 being a tachometer is actually 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.600
 icon meter displays mode here 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.280
 hybrid transmission works 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.530
 accordingly you can adjust 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.650
 mode either economical or 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.380
 maximum power mode if 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.330
 set the sport mode selector to 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.210
 the place to the subway will appear familiar 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.220
 tachometer from the red zone will appear red 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.630
 onboard computer display backlight 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.300
 what will say about what you 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.340
 use not economical but sporty 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.630
 hybrid installation mode consists of 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.860
 two bedrooms and a liter petrol 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.270
 155 horsepower engine 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.640
 68 horsepower electric motor 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:45.650
 forces which actually leads to 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.440
 the movement of the rear wheels and is responsible for 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.880
 all-wheel drive and for in x 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.460
 managed to surprise and on 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:54.800
 impassable course harsh frol you 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.410
 he is contraindicated but on the virgin snow 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.840
 he crawled forward confidently without a hint of 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.670
 slipping it is possible that the secret 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.920
 lies in the back connection speed 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.990
 wheels 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.670
 if you continue to compare nx rav 4 then 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.280
 it is logical that their equipment is related 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.710
 and hence the price of Lexus is already in the base 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.830
 picking offered LED 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.150
 Headlights including anti tumanki 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.190
 It provides all-sky cameras and 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.440
 many other electronic chips and 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.720
 assistants here are just for all this 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.720
 will have to pay and after the recent 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.430
 price increases a lot of base mx with 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.950
 front wheel drive and two-liter engine 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:34.380
 will cost 1 million seven hundred and ninety 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:36.960
 two thousand rubles the most expensive 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.330
 hybrid in picking exclusive already 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.230
 two million eight hundred ninety-seven 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.450
 thousand rubles 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:44.640
 what can you say nx like all last 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.500
 lexus and really nice stylish 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.360
 charismatic comfortable excellent 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:50.370
 managed by me it seems an interest in this 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.580
 the car can be undermined unless the new 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.580
 price tag
