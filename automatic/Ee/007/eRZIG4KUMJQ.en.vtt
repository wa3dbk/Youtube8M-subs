why did that not click the rope but

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.780 
why did that not click the rope but
agility<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.660> easy<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:29.550> even

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
agility really is easy it's not even

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.360 
agility really is easy it's not even
that<00:02:30.060> hard<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.540> mean<00:02:30.750> all<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.860> do<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.340> just

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
that hard I mean all you do is you just

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.130 
that hard I mean all you do is you just
click<00:02:32.730> on<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.000> obstacles<00:02:33.570> it's<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.900> bit

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
click on the obstacles it's a bit

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.920 
click on the obstacles it's a bit
repetitive<00:02:34.470> though<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.580> really<00:02:35.820> does<00:02:36.209> get

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
repetitive though so it really does get

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.100 
repetitive though so it really does get
annoying<00:02:37.080> maybe<00:02:37.650> after<00:02:38.190> two<00:02:39.180> hours<00:02:39.330> or<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.720> but

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
annoying maybe after two hours or so but

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.580 
annoying maybe after two hours or so but
it's<00:02:40.380> not<00:02:40.709> too<00:02:40.890> bad<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.989> on<00:02:42.989> what<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.320> actually

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
because this community has really

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.459 
because this community has really
dwindled<00:03:47.639> down<00:03:47.700> in<00:03:48.239> numbers<00:03:48.510> over<00:03:49.109> the<00:03:49.230> years

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:49.469 
dwindled down in numbers over the years

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:51.530 
dwindled down in numbers over the years
and<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:49.950> kind<00:03:50.639> of<00:03:50.730> depressing<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.329> seat

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
and it's kind of depressing the seat

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.089 
and it's kind of depressing the seat
because<00:03:51.750> I've<00:03:51.959> been<00:03:52.019> playing<00:03:52.439> since<00:03:52.799> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.860 
pretty cool but I personally would not
mind<00:04:30.900> if<00:04:31.260> they<00:04:31.770> put<00:04:32.159> a<00:04:32.190> new<00:04:32.430> server<00:04:32.699> I<00:04:33.060> probably

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
mind if they put a new server I probably

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.839 
mind if they put a new server I probably
still<00:04:34.320> be<00:04:34.349> playing<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.919> EOC<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.729> know

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849 
still be playing the EOC but you know

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.790 
still be playing the EOC but you know

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.040 
once in a while I I'd hop on those
service<00:04:38.220> because<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.760> really<00:04:39.449> do<00:04:39.659> miss<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
service because I really do miss the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.129
