a<00:01:23.340> little<00:01:23.490> bit<00:01:23.640> more<00:01:23.790> dangerous<00:01:23.939> because<00:01:24.270> if

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
a little bit more dangerous because if

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.670 
a little bit more dangerous because if
you<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:24.630> get<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.170> their<00:01:25.320> head<00:01:25.470> they

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you don't get it over their head they

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
you don't get it over their head they
may<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> able<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.430> smash<00:01:27.150> an<00:01:27.360> overhead<00:01:27.720> back<00:01:27.990> at

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
may be able to smash an overhead back at

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.649 
may be able to smash an overhead back at
you<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> also<00:01:29.250> have<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.729> option<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.180> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
you and you also have the option to just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.899 
you and you also have the option to just
keep<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.990> rally<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.369> when<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
keep a rally going but when you do that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.520 
keep a rally going but when you do that
you<00:01:33.090> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> keep<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.600> low<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.259> net

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
you want to keep it low to the net

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.460 
you want to keep it low to the net
really<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.329> trouble<00:01:36.509> going

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
really when you get in trouble going

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.679 
really when you get in trouble going
baseline<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.189> volley<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.540> get

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
baseline to volley is that when you get

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
baseline to volley is that when you get
these<00:01:40.140> shots<00:01:40.350> up<00:01:40.590> around<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.009> players

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
these shots up around this players

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.800 
these shots up around this players
shoulder<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.000> I'm<00:01:42.119> hitting<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.420> shot<00:01:42.450> up

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
shoulder so if I'm hitting a shot up

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.810 
shoulder so if I'm hitting a shot up
here<00:01:42.990> around<00:01:43.110> my<00:01:43.350> shoulders<00:01:43.799> or<00:01:43.979> my<00:01:44.070> head<00:01:44.340> as<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
here around my shoulders or my head as a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.240 
here around my shoulders or my head as a
volley<00:01:45.210> er<00:01:45.360> well<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:45.960> can<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.229> ahead<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.649> slam

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
volley er well I can go ahead and slam

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
volley er well I can go ahead and slam
that<00:01:47.460> shot<00:01:47.670> away<00:01:47.880> very<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.240> easily<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
that shot away very very easily if I

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.749 
that shot away very very easily if I
have<00:01:49.470> to<00:01:49.590> hit<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> shot<00:01:49.770> that's<00:01:50.159> low<00:01:50.430> by<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
have to hit a shot that's low by the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.510 
have to hit a shot that's low by the
ground<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.960> easy<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.409> clip<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> net<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
ground very easy to clip the net and I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.429 
ground very easy to clip the net and I
also<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.970> hit<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.090> softer<00:01:54.540> return<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
also have to hit a softer return so

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
also have to hit a softer return so
those<00:01:55.619> are<00:01:55.770> other<00:01:55.890> strategies<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.880> today

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
those are other strategies but today

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.109 
those are other strategies but today
let's<00:01:57.780> focus<00:01:58.110> specifically<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.700> passing

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
let's focus specifically on the passing

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.459 
let's focus specifically on the passing
shot<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.719> get<00:02:00.840> back<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.140> those<00:02:01.259> other

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
shot and we can get back to those other

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.719 
shot and we can get back to those other
ones<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.219> future

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
ones in the future

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.700 
ones in the future
so<00:02:03.149> let's<00:02:03.630> imagine<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:04.079> players<00:02:04.320> up<00:02:04.530> here

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
so let's imagine this players up here

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.789 
so let's imagine this players up here
and<00:02:04.890> they've<00:02:05.369> hit<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> volley<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.770> your

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
and they've hit a volley to your to your

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
and they've hit a volley to your to your
forehand<00:02:08.310> side<00:02:08.489> nice<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:08.910> easy

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
forehand side nice and easy

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.570 
forehand side nice and easy
nothing<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.739> aggressive<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
nothing really really aggressive and

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.339 
nothing really really aggressive and
because<00:02:12.390> they<00:02:12.540> were<00:02:12.599> hitting<00:02:12.900> from<00:02:12.989> this<00:02:13.170> side

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
because they were hitting from this side

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.460 
because they were hitting from this side
of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.900 
of
kort<00:02:13.740> maybe<00:02:13.950> they're<00:02:14.160> a<00:02:14.190> little<00:02:14.460> bit<00:02:14.730> out<00:02:14.880> of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
kort maybe they're a little bit out of

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.910 
kort maybe they're a little bit out of
position<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.450> not<00:02:15.960> cut<00:02:16.170> off<00:02:16.290> your<00:02:16.440> shot<00:02:16.680> so

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
position to not cut off your shot so

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.980 
position to not cut off your shot so
they're<00:02:17.430> either<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.180> leaning<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.960> little

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
they're either here or leaning a little

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.630 
they're either here or leaning a little
bit<00:02:19.230> more<00:02:19.530> toward<00:02:19.800> this<00:02:19.950> side<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.370> court

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
bit more toward this side of the court

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
bit more toward this side of the court
what<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.300> is<00:02:21.420> going<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.020> is

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
what this is going to do is this is

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.260 
what this is going to do is this is
going<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.320> leave<00:02:22.500> an<00:02:22.620> opening<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.700> go<00:02:23.820> down<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
going to leave an opening to go down the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.030 
going to leave an opening to go down the
line<00:02:24.420> for<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.920> be

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
line for you but one thing to be

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.000 
line for you but one thing to be
conscious<00:02:26.760> of<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.690> thing<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.260> serving

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
conscious of one thing that the serving

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
conscious of one thing that the serving
volley<00:02:29.190> players<00:02:29.490> do<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.330> prey<00:02:30.600> on<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:31.050> they

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
volley players do to prey on is they

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.680 
volley players do to prey on is they
want<00:02:31.710> you<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.950> be<00:02:32.040> aggressive<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:33.120> know<00:02:33.390> that

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
want you to be aggressive they know that

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.240 
want you to be aggressive they know that
if<00:02:34.020> you're<00:02:34.200> going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> pass<00:02:34.620> them<00:02:34.890> down<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
if you're going to pass them down the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.700 
if you're going to pass them down the
line<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:36.180> net<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.630> higher<00:02:36.900> closer<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
line the net is higher closer to the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.640 
line the net is higher closer to the
line<00:02:37.890> you<00:02:38.580> also<00:02:38.760> have<00:02:39.090> less<00:02:39.330> distance<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.140> make

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
line you also have less distance to make

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.040 
line you also have less distance to make
this<00:02:40.830> shot<00:02:41.100> rather<00:02:42.060> than<00:02:42.270> going<00:02:42.420> cross-court

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
this shot rather than going cross-court

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.420 
this shot rather than going cross-court
so<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.380> a<00:02:43.410> longer<00:02:43.710> distance<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.250> go

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so you have a longer distance to go

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.790 
so you have a longer distance to go
cross<00:02:44.670> court<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.720> lower<00:02:45.930> net<00:02:46.200> it's<00:02:46.590> much

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
cross court and a lower net it's much

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.170 
cross court and a lower net it's much
easier<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.160> go<00:02:47.310> cross<00:02:47.550> court<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.970> make<00:02:48.060> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
easier to go cross court and make the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.210 
easier to go cross court and make the
shot<00:02:48.390> much<00:02:49.020> more<00:02:49.230> difficult<00:02:49.680> to<00:02:49.770> go<00:02:49.890> down<00:02:50.100> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
shot much more difficult to go down the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.949 
shot much more difficult to go down the

that inside cone our opponent is still
gonna<00:04:36.060> have<00:04:36.270> to<00:04:36.300> lunge<00:04:36.570> over<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.080> try<00:04:37.229> to<00:04:37.259> hit

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
gonna have to lunge over and try to hit

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.110 
gonna have to lunge over and try to hit
with<00:04:37.560> his<00:04:37.650> backhand<00:04:38.160> which<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.669> not<00:04:38.850> an<00:04:39.030> easy

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.480 
with his backhand which is not an easy
shot<00:04:39.360> so<00:04:40.229> he's<00:04:40.350> probably<00:04:40.500> going<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.860> make<00:04:41.280> the

ten times and not make an error that's a
good<00:05:06.960> way<00:05:07.110> to<00:05:07.169> think<00:05:07.260> about<00:05:07.530> it<00:05:07.770> because<00:05:08.310> we

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
good way to think about it because we

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.770 
good way to think about it because we

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
conservative shots put the pressure back

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.390 
conservative shots put the pressure back
on<00:05:12.870> our<00:05:13.080> opponent<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.650> then<00:05:14.160> we're<00:05:14.310> gonna

create<00:05:37.169> some<00:05:37.410> topspin<00:05:37.949> we<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.370> to<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.550> very

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
create some topspin we have to be very

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.790 
create some topspin we have to be very
consistent<00:05:39.060> so<00:05:39.300> we<00:05:39.479> can<00:05:39.630> hit<00:05:39.780> that<00:05:39.810> spot<00:05:40.260> nine

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
consistent so we can hit that spot nine

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.050 
consistent so we can hit that spot nine
out<00:05:41.010> of<00:05:41.099> ten<00:05:41.310> times<00:05:41.340> and<00:05:41.729> that's<00:05:41.849> what<00:05:41.970> we're

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
out of ten times and that's what we're

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.939 
out of ten times and that's what we're
gonna<00:05:42.180> go<00:05:42.330> over<00:05:42.630> in<00:05:42.810> the<00:05:43.199> topspin<00:05:43.740> forehand

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
gonna go over in the topspin forehand

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:45.950 
gonna go over in the topspin forehand

with your forehand and in this video

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.990 
with your forehand and in this video
we're<00:06:25.800> gonna<00:06:25.889> talk<00:06:26.280> about<00:06:26.310> how<00:06:26.580> to<00:06:26.639> use<00:06:26.849> the

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
we're gonna talk about how to use the

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.820 
we're gonna talk about how to use the
lower<00:06:27.180> body<00:06:27.449> correctly<00:06:27.810> to<00:06:28.500> get<00:06:28.620> some

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
lower body correctly to get some

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.350 
lower body correctly to get some
leverage<00:06:29.070> from<00:06:29.310> the<00:06:29.460> ground<00:06:29.669> really<00:06:30.060> create<00:06:30.330> a

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
leverage from the ground really create a

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.969 
leverage from the ground really create a
lot<00:06:30.479> of<00:06:30.599> power<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:31.080> as<00:06:31.409> you<00:06:31.530> start<00:06:31.710> ripping

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
lot of power so as you start ripping

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:33.469 
lot of power so as you start ripping
some<00:06:32.340> of<00:06:32.400> those<00:06:32.490> four<00:06:32.729> hands<00:06:32.909> not<00:06:33.150> only<00:06:33.180> with

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
some of those four hands not only with

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.750 
some of those four hands not only with
topspin<00:06:34.020> with<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.530> lot<00:06:34.740> of<00:06:34.860> speed<00:06:35.099> so<00:06:35.520> let's<00:06:35.669> go

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
topspin with a lot of speed so let's go

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.909 
topspin with a lot of speed so let's go
ahead<00:06:35.820> an<00:06:35.940> get<00:06:36.000> started<00:06:36.560> okay<00:06:37.560> so<00:06:37.620> this<00:06:37.770> video

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 
ahead an get started okay so this video

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.500 
ahead an get started okay so this video
is<00:06:38.099> about<00:06:38.219> the<00:06:38.400> lower<00:06:38.520> body<00:06:38.909> as<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.210> mentioned

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:39.510 
is about the lower body as I mentioned

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:40.190 
is about the lower body as I mentioned
and<00:06:39.570> we're<00:06:39.719> going<00:06:39.840> to<00:06:39.870> talk

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
and we're going to talk

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.540 
and we're going to talk
about<00:06:40.290> how<00:06:40.380> to<00:06:40.440> leverage<00:06:40.950> the<00:06:41.100> ground<00:06:41.340> for

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
about how to leverage the ground for

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.340 
about how to leverage the ground for
some<00:06:41.670> power<00:06:41.880> and<00:06:42.300> it's<00:06:42.570> a<00:06:42.660> motion<00:06:42.960> that<00:06:42.990> called

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:43.350 
some power and it's a motion that called

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.040 
some power and it's a motion that called
the<00:06:43.530> power<00:06:43.740> you<00:06:44.220> so<00:06:44.790> basically<00:06:45.270> your<00:06:45.480> hips<00:06:45.750> and

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
in a lot more speed so let's go ahead

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:00.500 
in a lot more speed so let's go ahead
and<00:06:59.010> get<00:06:59.070> started<00:06:59.520> on<00:06:59.640> the<00:06:59.940> basic<00:07:00.300> motion

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
and get started on the basic motion

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:02.570 
and get started on the basic motion
first<00:07:00.960> so<00:07:01.170> as<00:07:01.380> you're<00:07:01.950> waiting<00:07:02.190> for<00:07:02.220> the<00:07:02.430> ball

tall and then as you begin your forward

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.780 
tall and then as you begin your forward
momentum<00:07:07.140> you<00:07:07.980> always<00:07:08.220> want<00:07:08.370> to<00:07:08.400> be<00:07:08.460> moving

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:08.790 
momentum you always want to be moving

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 
to contact if at all possible as we

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.120 
to contact if at all possible as we
start<00:07:13.200> our<00:07:13.290> forward<00:07:13.560> momentum<00:07:13.710> we're<00:07:14.040> gonna

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
start our forward momentum we're gonna

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.710

and<00:07:17.490> they're<00:07:17.910> making<00:07:18.030> the<00:07:18.330> first<00:07:18.570> half<00:07:18.870> of

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
and they're making the first half of

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.770 
and they're making the first half of
this<00:07:19.200> you<00:07:19.530> type<00:07:19.830> shape<00:07:20.160> now<00:07:20.850> as<00:07:21.030> I<00:07:21.120> begin<00:07:21.390> the

this you type shape now as I begin the

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.930 
this you type shape now as I begin the
forward<00:07:22.200> swing<00:07:22.470> with<00:07:22.590> my<00:07:22.710> racket<00:07:23.250> now<00:07:23.700> my
