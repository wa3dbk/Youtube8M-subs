number of reasons the first is that

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.880 
number of reasons the first is that
because<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.660> transactions<00:03:22.290> happen<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.799> a

real-time trading environment it's

difficult to benchmark second this is

difficult to benchmark second this is
compounded<00:03:28.739> by<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.100> fact<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.790> agencies

you<00:03:32.910> see<00:03:33.150> there's<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.450> dispute<00:03:34.019> about<00:03:34.230> both

you see there's a dispute about both
