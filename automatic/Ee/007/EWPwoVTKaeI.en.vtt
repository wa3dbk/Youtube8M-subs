much about dripping paint like on a
sidewalk<00:04:37.080> if<00:04:37.979> you're<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:38.669> the<00:04:38.820> grass<00:04:39.060> it

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
sidewalk if you're in the grass it

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.020 
sidewalk if you're in the grass it
doesn't<00:04:39.720> matter<00:04:39.930> as<00:04:40.169> much<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:41.310> might<00:04:41.550> need<00:04:41.760> to

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
doesn't matter as much you might need to

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.110 
doesn't matter as much you might need to
pull<00:04:42.270> some<00:04:42.600> of<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.810> grass<00:04:43.050> away<00:04:43.680> and<00:04:44.100> if<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
pull some of the grass away and if you

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.670 
pull some of the grass away and if you
want<00:04:46.130> sometimes<00:04:47.130> you're<00:04:47.340> on<00:04:47.370> a<00:04:47.490> slope<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
want sometimes you're on a slope so the

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.540 
want sometimes you're on a slope so the
grade<00:04:50.070> is<00:04:50.600> running<00:04:51.600> on<00:04:51.750> an<00:04:51.930> angle<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:53.310> might

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
grade is running on an angle you might

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.960 
grade is running on an angle you might
want<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.910> just<00:04:54.090> take<00:04:54.330> some<00:04:54.630> masking<00:04:54.840> tape<00:04:55.169> and

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
want to just take some masking tape and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.520 
want to just take some masking tape and
tape<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.000> bottom<00:04:57.600> that'll<00:04:57.930> give<00:04:58.080> you<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.229> nice

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
tape the bottom that'll give you a nice

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.870 
tape the bottom that'll give you a nice
clean<00:04:59.039> line<00:04:59.570> so<00:05:00.889> you<00:05:01.889> know<00:05:02.010> rather<00:05:02.250> than<00:05:02.400> have

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
clean line so you know rather than have

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.659 
clean line so you know rather than have
a<00:05:02.910> ragged<00:05:03.630> line<00:05:04.500> you'll<00:05:04.740> have<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.889> nice<00:05:05.130> clean

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
a ragged line you'll have a nice clean

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.950 
a ragged line you'll have a nice clean
line<00:05:06.060> down<00:05:06.840> at<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.169> bottom<00:05:08.060> so<00:05:09.060> you've<00:05:09.720> done

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
line down at the bottom so you've done

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.550 
line down at the bottom so you've done
that<00:05:10.260> if<00:05:11.039> you<00:05:11.280> use<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.850> stuff<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:13.289> probably

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
that if you use this stuff you probably

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 
would say bring a little bit of water in

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.529 
would say bring a little bit of water in
case<00:05:54.780> you<00:05:55.020> drip<00:05:55.320> on<00:05:55.530> concrete<00:05:56.210> concrete<00:05:57.210> is<00:05:57.330> so

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
case you drip on concrete concrete is so

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.110 
case you drip on concrete concrete is so
porous<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:59.280> you<00:05:59.490> know<00:05:59.610> you<00:05:59.669> can<00:05:59.910> take

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
porous that it you know you can take

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.839 
porous that it you know you can take
your<00:06:00.360> rag<00:06:00.630> and<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.260> know<00:06:01.950> if<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.160> got<00:06:02.250> a<00:06:02.310> spill

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
your rag and you know if you got a spill

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.230 
your rag and you know if you got a spill
it<00:06:03.950> it<00:06:04.950> would<00:06:05.160> probably<00:06:05.400> be<00:06:05.639> easier<00:06:05.910> to<00:06:06.030> clean

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
it it would probably be easier to clean

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.959 
it it would probably be easier to clean
it<00:06:06.389> up<00:06:06.510> if<00:06:06.720> you<00:06:06.810> had<00:06:06.900> some<00:06:07.169> water<00:06:07.470> so<00:06:10.610> we<00:06:11.610> really

on<00:06:17.009> hydrants<00:06:18.009> we<00:06:18.910> can<00:06:19.120> have<00:06:19.300> these<00:06:19.449> hydrants

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:20.099 
on hydrants we can have these hydrants

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:25.320 
on hydrants we can have these hydrants
sandblasted<00:06:21.810> primed<00:06:22.810> and<00:06:23.819> finished<00:06:24.819> coded

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.330 
sandblasted primed and finished coded

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.680 
sandblasted primed and finished coded
for<00:06:25.720> about<00:06:25.990> like<00:06:27.030> $180<00:06:28.030> per<00:06:28.710> hydrant<00:06:30.690> so

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.690 
for about like $180 per hydrant so

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.860 
for about like $180 per hydrant so
obviously<00:06:32.530> we<00:06:33.000> we<00:06:34.000> have<00:06:34.150> to<00:06:34.270> be<00:06:34.419> good<00:06:34.599> stewards
