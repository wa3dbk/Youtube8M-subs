00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.650
 Good day we lost in Köthen to you gladly the Global Process that suffers 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.069
 and how they can solve the requirements 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.700
 Here we install the Nova Rocks in nursing homes you can see here 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.320
 some keywords which answers you can easily cover 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.210
 The Nova Rocks Appliance next to him went the appropriate tasks 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.470
 because of the weakest Lucas we like to give you more cells 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.000
 they built Fortuna 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.220
 we have the patient with appropriate emergency push buttons 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.770
 we have a weakest reputation system of ávalos and are loud the Nova Rocks 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.290
 which hardly make the signal 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.810
 below that you can see the Mitel telephony system which also provides the signaling 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.920
 serves the and phone via tramp down sister directly 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.250
 Now the patient presses on his way the appropriate emergency call becomes this 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.910
 automatically signaled to Novarock 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.120
 Signaling the female takes place fully automatically by this Kleinsteuber 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:31.080
 Box and that over the Mitel Telefonie directly to the charges in the scene 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.080
 as well as the mobile terminal sister 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.010
 Now a sister takes the stage and criticized locally 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.619
 how lives the corresponding connection fully automatically also protected and the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.100
 Signaling service counts as by far the weakest one 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.860
 the processing of such a thing you are amazed at served one thing 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 Notebooks decapitate as the whole thing is live now we go through 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 presented to my colleagues 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.450
 we have that's meaning we've built one on one live 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.770
 Here you can see the Mitel telephone system with the associated firmly discouraged 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.249
 and mobile app advice 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:16.949
 Here they see the Nova Rocks in the background they see that was great 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.199
 ohb system with the typical components of a halo system 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.829
 I will now trigger an emergency call in the patient room 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:32.029
 the telephony starts to ring with the information would be the emergency call 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:36.999
 I have now triggered criticism because call back directly in the finish area 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:42.629
 and the phones will automatically stop ringing the alarm is over 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.439
 you can also see this scenario can be easily realized with a box
