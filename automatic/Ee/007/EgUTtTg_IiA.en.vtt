walls<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:23.160> stone<00:00:23.640> material<00:00:24.630> would

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
walls that we want stone material would

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.550 
walls that we want stone material would
I'll<00:00:26.099> share<00:00:26.340> how<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.609> works<00:00:27.230> we<00:00:28.230> can't<00:00:28.410> get

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
I'll share how it works we can't get

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
I'll share how it works we can't get
diamond<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:28.980> course<00:00:29.250> but<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.510> good

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
diamond of course but this is good

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.010 
diamond of course but this is good
enough<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> think<00:00:32.420> so<00:00:33.420> yeah<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.719> put<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
enough I think so yeah I just put a

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690 
enough I think so yeah I just put a
piece<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> red<00:00:34.500> bull<00:00:34.649> there<00:00:34.829> Chuck<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> torch

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
piece of red bull there Chuck the torch

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
piece of red bull there Chuck the torch
on<00:00:35.910> top<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.690> redstone<00:00:37.050> torch<00:00:37.260> I'll

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
on top of it the redstone torch I'll

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.869 
on top of it the redstone torch I'll
break<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.399> we've<00:00:38.879> got<00:00:39.030> white<00:00:39.239> wall<00:00:39.390> um

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
break it and we've got white wall um

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.520 
break it and we've got white wall um
chance<00:00:41.879> film<00:00:42.210> white<00:00:42.420> wall<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.050> most<00:00:43.260> common

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
chance film white wall the most common

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.709 
chance film white wall the most common
one<00:00:45.590> let's<00:00:46.590> make<00:00:46.770> green<00:00:47.420> Chuck<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> water

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
one let's make green Chuck the water

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.619 
one let's make green Chuck the water
there<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.320> we've<00:00:50.219> got<00:00:50.370> green<00:00:51.260> on<00:00:52.550> me<00:00:53.629> Ricky

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
there and we've got green on me Ricky

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.069 
there and we've got green on me Ricky
now<00:00:54.870> as<00:00:55.020> well<00:00:55.399> when<00:00:56.399> we're<00:00:56.579> making<00:00:56.670> stone<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
now as well when we're making stone we

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.910 
now as well when we're making stone we
just<00:00:58.289> use<00:00:59.059> two<00:01:00.059> slabs<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.690> any<00:01:00.960> material<00:01:01.170> just

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
just use two slabs of any material just

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.070 
just use two slabs of any material just
using<00:01:02.280> cobblestone<00:01:02.820> likewise<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
using cobblestone likewise because it's

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.830 
using cobblestone likewise because it's
just<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.409> common<00:01:04.880> what's<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> line<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.210> with<00:01:06.540> it

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
just so common what's it line up with it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.950 
just so common what's it line up with it
lines<00:01:07.080> up<00:01:07.229> with<00:01:07.380> yellow<00:01:08.750> there<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.840> go<00:01:10.790> and

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
lines up with yellow there we go and

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
lines up with yellow there we go and
would<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.229> always<00:01:13.740> end<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.310> making<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> same

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
would you always end up making the same

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.249 
would you always end up making the same
type<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.330> wood<00:01:15.689> anyway<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.650> just<00:01:16.770> oak<00:01:18.259> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
type of wood anyway it's just oak so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.310 
type of wood anyway it's just oak so
I've<00:01:19.350> just<00:01:19.380> put<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.770> there<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
I've just put that there like that and

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.820 
I've just put that there like that and
now<00:01:22.710> we've<00:01:22.830> got<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> piece<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.460> wood<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:25.680> way

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
now we've got that piece of wood the way

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.300 
now we've got that piece of wood the way
it<00:01:25.950> works<00:01:26.119> it's<00:01:27.650> we're<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.770> changing<00:01:29.040> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
it works it's we're not changing the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.460 
it works it's we're not changing the
block<00:01:29.729> itself<00:01:30.030> we're<00:01:30.750> changing<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.140> data

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
block itself we're changing the data

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.499 
block itself we're changing the data
type<00:01:31.860> values<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.790> block<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.240> also

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
type values of the block it's also

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.420 
type values of the block it's also
referred<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.680> damage<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.369> block

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
referred to as the damage of the block

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
referred to as the damage of the block
so<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.329> way<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.990> water<00:01:40.229> acts<00:01:40.650> as<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> medium

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
so the way the water acts as a medium

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.020 
so the way the water acts as a medium
that<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.780> data<00:01:43.020> values<00:01:43.590> changed<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:44.850> what<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that the data values changed now what I

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
that the data values changed now what I
mean<00:01:45.299> by<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.649> distance<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
mean by that is the distance that the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.069 
mean by that is the distance that the
water<00:01:47.970> travels<00:01:48.799> dictates<00:01:49.939> how<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.780> block

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
water travels dictates how the block

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.010 
water travels dictates how the block
will<00:01:52.259> end<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.530> looking<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.750> there

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
will end up looking so put that there

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
will end up looking so put that there
and<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.189> way<00:01:56.310> that<00:01:56.549> works<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.659> see

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
and the way that works it you can see

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.499 
and the way that works it you can see
when<00:01:59.040> we've<00:01:59.219> got<00:01:59.640> water<00:01:59.850> like<00:02:00.090> that<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
when we've got water like that it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.709 
when we've got water like that it
changes<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.250> flowing<00:02:02.759> with<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.360> hype

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
changes as it's flowing with the hype

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.440 
changes as it's flowing with the hype
and<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.320> different<00:02:04.740> data<00:02:04.979> values<00:02:05.450> alright

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
and that's different data values alright

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.089 
and that's different data values alright
so<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:08.239> when<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.509> water<00:02:09.840> passes<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
so and when the water passes to the

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.550 
so and when the water passes to the
redstone<00:02:11.459> torch<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.910> data<00:02:12.180> value<00:02:12.660> is<00:02:12.930> Carrie

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
redstone torch that data value is Carrie

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.740 
redstone torch that data value is Carrie
over<00:02:13.890> into<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.250> wall<00:02:14.520> block<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:17.599> yeah<00:02:18.599> that's

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
over into the wall block so yeah that's

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.050 
over into the wall block so yeah that's
everything<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.610> also<00:02:20.730> make

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
everything to that we can also make

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.860 
everything to that we can also make
these<00:02:21.599> colored<00:02:21.989> walls<00:02:22.200> they're<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:23.010> one

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
these colored walls they're just one

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.180 
these colored walls they're just one
there<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.080> opposite<00:02:25.380> direction<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.980> one

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
there in the opposite direction and one

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.610 
there in the opposite direction and one
book<00:02:26.370> higher<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.690> that's<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> only<00:02:28.020> thing<00:02:28.470> you

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
book higher so that's the only thing you

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.130 
book higher so that's the only thing you
got<00:02:28.860> to<00:02:28.890> keep<00:02:29.040> in<00:02:29.190> mind<00:02:29.220> um<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.989> should

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
got to keep in mind um and that should

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.559 
got to keep in mind um and that should
make<00:02:31.290> us<00:02:31.349> what<00:02:32.540> brown<00:02:33.540> yes<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.590> brown

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
make us what brown yes it's brown

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.420 
make us what brown yes it's brown
alright<00:02:36.569> and<00:02:36.720> I'll<00:02:37.440> show<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.680> how<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:37.950> sticky

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
alright and I'll show you how the sticky

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.580 
alright and I'll show you how the sticky
piston<00:02:38.819> mechanism<00:02:39.569> works<00:02:39.750> behind<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.290> that's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
piston mechanism works behind it that's

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
piston mechanism works behind it that's
very<00:02:40.709> easy<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.250> see<00:02:42.769> okay<00:02:45.650> all<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.540> we've

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
very easy to see okay all it is is we've

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.229 
very easy to see okay all it is is we've
got<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.690> redstone<00:02:49.019> torch<00:02:49.140> their<00:02:49.819> piece<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.850> wire

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
got a redstone torch their piece of wire

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.220 
got a redstone torch their piece of wire
another<00:02:52.080> wire<00:02:52.319> wire<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:54.540> leads<00:02:54.930> I'll

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
another wire wire and that leads I'll

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.400 
another wire wire and that leads I'll
break<00:02:55.500> torch<00:02:55.890> actual<00:02:56.310> you<00:02:56.790> can<00:02:56.910> see<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.410> that

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
break torch actual you can see it that

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.830 
break torch actual you can see it that
leads<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.010> a<00:02:59.160> piston<00:02:59.849> that's<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.299> deep<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.720> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
leads to a piston that's one deep in the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.660 
leads to a piston that's one deep in the
ground<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.380> it's<00:03:01.500> got<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.650> block<00:03:01.920> connected<00:03:02.549> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
ground and it's got a block connected to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.120 
ground and it's got a block connected to
it<00:03:02.819> that<00:03:03.780> Pistons<00:03:04.260> where<00:03:04.440> we<00:03:04.560> put<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.950> wall

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
it that Pistons where we put the wall

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.089 
it that Pistons where we put the wall
and<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.890> left<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:09.049> where<00:03:10.049> we<00:03:10.200> put<00:03:10.950> the

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
and to left of it is where we put the

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.280 
and to left of it is where we put the
torch<00:03:11.340> there's<00:03:12.299> another<00:03:12.510> sticky<00:03:12.900> piston

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
torch there's another sticky piston

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.750 
torch there's another sticky piston
they're<00:03:13.440> all<00:03:13.560> sticky<00:03:13.920> pistons<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> that's

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
they're all sticky pistons and that's

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.449 
they're all sticky pistons and that's
got<00:03:14.880> a<00:03:14.910> block<00:03:15.180> on<00:03:15.299> it<00:03:17.359> yeah<00:03:18.359> break<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.989> wood

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
got a block on it yeah break the wood

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.410 
got a block on it yeah break the wood
there<00:03:20.459> we<00:03:20.519> go<00:03:21.290> um<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.829> always<00:03:23.190> get<00:03:23.549> white<00:03:24.150> as

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
there we go um you always get white as

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.630 
there we go um you always get white as
the<00:03:24.570> default<00:03:24.780> wall<00:03:25.290> as<00:03:25.530> well<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.459> can

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the default wall as well and you can

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.940 
the default wall as well and you can
also<00:03:27.350> create<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.709> block<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.489> can't<00:03:29.790> make

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
also create a block that you can't make

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.330 
also create a block that you can't make
normally<00:03:31.950> arm<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.940> a<00:03:32.970> double<00:03:34.040> slab<00:03:35.040> of

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
normally arm this is a double slab of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.729 
normally arm this is a double slab of
smooth<00:03:35.880> stone<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.900> can<00:03:37.049> see<00:03:37.260> that<00:03:37.500> it's

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
smooth stone and you can see that it's

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.400 
smooth stone and you can see that it's
got<00:03:38.040> a<00:03:38.190> line<00:03:38.790> going<00:03:39.150> through<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.720> there<00:03:39.959> but<00:03:40.290> we

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
got a line going through it there but we

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.199 
got a line going through it there but we
don't<00:03:40.620> want<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:40.859> now<00:03:41.280> you<00:03:41.850> can't<00:03:42.090> usually

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
don't want that now you can't usually

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.259 
don't want that now you can't usually
make<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.859> but<00:03:43.859> with<00:03:44.280> this<00:03:44.459> mechanism<00:03:45.000> you

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
make that but with this mechanism you

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.259 
make that but with this mechanism you
can<00:03:45.569> so<00:03:45.840> put<00:03:46.139> two<00:03:46.290> slabs<00:03:47.989> go<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.139> that<00:03:50.269> chuck

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
can so put two slabs go like that chuck

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.559 
can so put two slabs go like that chuck
it<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.600> fair<00:03:51.989> distance<00:03:52.290> away<00:03:52.700> I'll<00:03:53.700> remove<00:03:54.389> the

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
it a fair distance away I'll remove the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.970 
it a fair distance away I'll remove the
water<00:03:54.840> and<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:56.790> can<00:03:56.940> see<00:03:57.150> we've<00:03:57.389> got

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
water and you can see we've got

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.830 
water and you can see we've got
perfectly<00:03:58.980> legitimate<00:03:59.459> way<00:03:59.819> of<00:04:00.090> getting<00:04:00.630> a

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
perfectly legitimate way of getting a

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.349 
perfectly legitimate way of getting a
block<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.769> usually<00:04:02.359> unattainable

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
block that is usually unattainable

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.860 
block that is usually unattainable
unless<00:04:04.049> you've<00:04:04.230> got<00:04:04.260> hacks<00:04:04.709> running<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:05.870> yeah

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
unless you've got hacks running and yeah

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.449 
unless you've got hacks running and yeah
that's<00:04:07.079> everything<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:07.889> this<00:04:08.069> how<00:04:08.400> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
that's everything to this how to

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.220 
that's everything to this how to
transform<00:04:08.970> blocks<00:04:09.269> in<00:04:09.450> Minecraft<00:04:09.480> it's

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
transform blocks in Minecraft it's

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.050 
transform blocks in Minecraft it's
