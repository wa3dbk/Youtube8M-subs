00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
second highest range armor period you

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.000 
second highest range armor period you
need<00:01:08.520> level<00:01:09.000> 90<00:01:09.450> defense<00:01:10.250> or<00:01:11.250> 90<00:01:11.670> range<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:13.010> as

you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.280> see<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.640> expensive<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:16.290> also

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
you can see it's expensive and it's also

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.179 
you can see it's expensive and it's also
a<00:01:16.680> very<00:01:17.009> rare<00:01:17.280> drop<00:01:17.640> obviously<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:20.070> just

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
a very rare drop obviously and you just

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.740 
a very rare drop obviously and you just
don't<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.549> them<00:01:20.729> quickly<00:01:21.000> which<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
don't get them quickly which is kind of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.010 
don't get them quickly which is kind of
annoying<00:01:22.400> I<00:01:23.400> haven't<00:01:24.060> gotten<00:01:24.240> one<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:24.689> I'm<00:01:24.810> on

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
annoying I haven't gotten one and I'm on

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.010 
annoying I haven't gotten one and I'm on
about<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> hundred<00:01:25.650> kills<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.280> far<00:01:27.979> so<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> mean

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
about a hundred kills so far so I mean

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
about a hundred kills so far so I mean
of<00:01:31.020> course<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.409> also<00:01:31.590> need<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.890> Slayer

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
of course you also need the Slayer

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.569 
of course you also need the Slayer
levels<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.470> attack<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.680> these<00:01:34.860> like<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.400> think

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
levels to attack all these like I think

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.950 
levels to attack all these like I think
these<00:01:36.000> are<00:01:36.060> level<00:01:36.540> 78<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:38.540> darkbeast<00:01:39.540> also

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
these are level 78 and darkbeast also

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.319 
these are level 78 and darkbeast also
dropped<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.470> in<00:01:40.939> Legion<00:01:41.939> i'ts<00:01:42.140> do<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.290> well

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
dropped them in Legion i'ts do as well

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:47.389 
dropped them in Legion i'ts do as well
obviously<00:01:45.740> darkbeast<00:01:46.740> are<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> lot<00:01:47.100> harder<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
obviously darkbeast are a lot harder to

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.780 
obviously darkbeast are a lot harder to
kill<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.850> chose<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.600> sista<00:01:48.869> test<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.610> as<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
kill I chose a sista test this out as it

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
kill I chose a sista test this out as it
right<00:01:50.909> now<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:51.270> many<00:01:51.390> people<00:01:51.689> are<00:01:51.780> less<00:01:52.320> than

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.839 
so realistically I don't know the drop
ratio<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.829> notch<00:02:18.189> on<00:02:18.370> trying<00:02:18.640> to<00:02:18.700> keep

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
ratio of this notch on trying to keep

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.899 
ratio of this notch on trying to keep
track<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:20.049> as<00:02:20.409> I<00:02:20.500> said<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.829> about<00:02:20.980> at<00:02:21.310> 100

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
track so as I said I'm about at 100

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:27.360 
track so as I said I'm about at 100
probably<00:02:22.360> like<00:02:22.739> 95<00:02:23.739> so<00:02:24.189> far<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.220> all

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
probably like 95 so far and this is all

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.270 
probably like 95 so far and this is all
I've<00:02:27.489> gotten<00:02:28.290> minus<00:02:29.290> some<00:02:29.500> ruin<00:02:29.799> bolts<00:02:30.159> I

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
I've gotten minus some ruin bolts I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.780 
I've gotten minus some ruin bolts I
don't<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.519> them<00:02:30.640> here<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.329> I<00:02:31.420> mean<00:02:31.720> in<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
don't have them here and I mean in the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.869 
don't have them here and I mean in the
guards<00:02:33.790> no<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.269> didn't<00:02:34.510> have<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.690> money<00:02:34.840> so

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
guards no I didn't have the money so

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.880 
guards no I didn't have the money so
it's<00:02:36.879> not<00:02:36.940> much<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.930> profit<00:02:38.409> obvious<00:02:38.709> than

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
it's not much like profit obvious than

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.119 
it's not much like profit obvious than
this<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.970> um<00:02:40.239> if<00:02:40.870> I<00:02:41.019> guess<00:02:41.260> if<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.650> get<00:02:41.859> you

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:42.129 
this but um if I guess if you get you

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.149 
this but um if I guess if you get you
know<00:02:42.250> five<00:02:42.659> scales<00:02:43.659> per<00:02:44.019> trip<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.769> can<00:02:44.980> make

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
know five scales per trip you can make

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:50.099 
know five scales per trip you can make
it<00:02:45.370> a<00:02:45.400> lot<00:02:47.579> best<00:02:48.579> way<00:02:48.730> to<00:02:48.760> do<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.750> have

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
it a lot best way to do this is to have

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.390 
it a lot best way to do this is to have
a<00:02:50.379> bunny<00:02:50.709> and<00:02:52.230> these<00:02:53.230> swallow<00:02:53.650> whole<00:02:53.920> scrolls

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
a bunny and these swallow whole scrolls

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.490 
a bunny and these swallow whole scrolls
so<00:02:55.329> as<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.569> can<00:02:55.659> see<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:56.019> when<00:02:56.260> you<00:02:56.319> run<00:02:56.470> out

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so as you can see that when you run out

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.690 
so as you can see that when you run out
of<00:02:56.590> food<00:02:56.859> you<00:02:57.700> cannot<00:02:58.139> well<00:02:59.370> so<00:03:00.370> many<00:03:00.430> other

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
of food you cannot well so many other

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.190 
of food you cannot well so many other
with<00:03:00.849> you<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:02.709> all<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:03.040> have<00:03:03.159> to<00:03:03.310> do<00:03:03.459> is<00:03:04.170> use<00:03:05.170> a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
with you you all you have to do is use a

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.809 
with you you all you have to do is use a
scroll<00:03:05.560> in<00:03:05.590> there<00:03:05.829> you<00:03:06.400> can<00:03:06.489> do<00:03:06.609> it<00:03:06.700> on<00:03:06.790> Raw

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
scroll in there you can do it on Raw

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.050 
scroll in there you can do it on Raw
food<00:03:07.269> since<00:03:08.049> these<00:03:08.200> drop<00:03:08.620> raw<00:03:09.310> lobsters<00:03:09.909> and

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
food since these drop raw lobsters and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.899 
food since these drop raw lobsters and
swordfish<00:03:10.450> it's<00:03:11.079> really<00:03:11.349> handy<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.730> way<00:03:12.819> you

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
swordfish it's really handy that way you

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.059 
swordfish it's really handy that way you
can<00:03:13.000> just<00:03:13.060> kill<00:03:13.359> yourself<00:03:13.480> with<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.069> so

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
can just kill yourself with that so

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.640 
can just kill yourself with that so
bring<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.879> I<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.329> brought<00:03:16.510> 200<00:03:16.750> will<00:03:17.560> be

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
bring and I just brought 200 will be

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.909 
bring and I just brought 200 will be
swallowed<00:03:18.040> whole<00:03:18.069> scrolls<00:03:18.519> um<00:03:19.269> which<00:03:20.049> so<00:03:20.889> far

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
swallowed whole scrolls um which so far

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.050 
swallowed whole scrolls um which so far
I've<00:03:21.430> been<00:03:21.579> here<00:03:21.849> and<00:03:22.500> probably<00:03:23.500> about<00:03:24.060> you

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
I've been here and probably about you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.360 
I've been here and probably about you
know<00:03:25.120> 45<00:03:25.750> minutes<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:29.319> about<00:03:29.530> 100<00:03:29.919> kills<00:03:30.129> like

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
know 45 minutes and about 100 kills like

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.150 
know 45 minutes and about 100 kills like
I<00:03:30.430> said<00:03:30.579> maybe<00:03:30.819> a<00:03:30.879> little<00:03:31.030> maybe<00:03:32.160> 105's

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
I said maybe a little maybe 105's

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.309 
I said maybe a little maybe 105's
tomatoes<00:03:33.669> i<00:03:33.699> didn't<00:03:34.150> start<00:03:34.269> taking<00:03:34.629> keeping

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
tomatoes i didn't start taking keeping

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.930 
tomatoes i didn't start taking keeping
count<00:03:35.470> till<00:03:35.709> after<00:03:35.980> probably<00:03:36.160> 20<00:03:36.519> or<00:03:36.549> 30<00:03:36.849> of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
count till after probably 20 or 30 of

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.890 
count till after probably 20 or 30 of
them<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.790> you<00:03:39.790> can<00:03:39.879> see<00:03:40.060> ross<00:03:40.239> sorkin<00:03:40.480> show<00:03:40.810> up

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
them so you can see ross sorkin show up

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.150 
them so you can see ross sorkin show up
I<00:03:41.109> mean<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:42.129> drops<00:03:42.579> aren't<00:03:42.819> all<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> great

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
I mean the drops aren't all that great

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
I mean the drops aren't all that great
the<00:03:45.160> lower<00:03:45.340> drops<00:03:45.639> anyway<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.169> nothing

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
the lower drops anyway so it's nothing

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.050 
the lower drops anyway so it's nothing
it's<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:47.799> like<00:03:47.980> don't<00:03:48.280> expect<00:03:48.609> to<00:03:48.760> come<00:03:48.879> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
it's not like don't expect to come and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.819 
it's not like don't expect to come and
make<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.209> lot<00:03:49.389> of<00:03:49.419> money<00:03:49.510> unless<00:03:50.139> you<00:03:50.379> get<00:03:50.560> the

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
make a lot of money unless you get the

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.659 
make a lot of money unless you get the
scale<00:03:51.220> drops<00:03:52.680> but<00:03:53.680> this<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.069> fastest<00:03:54.519> and

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:54.669 
scale drops but this is the fastest and

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.699 
scale drops but this is the fastest and
easiest<00:03:54.790> because<00:03:55.209> if<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:55.569> go<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> darkbeasts

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
easiest because if you go to darkbeasts

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.270 
easiest because if you go to darkbeasts
it's<00:03:57.489> going<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.940> take<00:03:58.150> a<00:03:58.389> lot<00:03:58.720> longer<00:03:59.280> they're

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
it's going to take a lot longer they're

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.339 
it's going to take a lot longer they're
harder<00:04:00.519> to<00:04:00.549> kill<00:04:00.760> obviously<00:04:01.299> and<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.139> time

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
harder to kill obviously and the time

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:05.399 
harder to kill obviously and the time
required<00:04:02.699> there's<00:04:03.699> a<00:04:03.760> lot<00:04:03.790> more<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.510> I<00:04:04.780> know

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
required there's a lot more so I know

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:07.409 
required there's a lot more so I know
obviously<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:06.040> don't<00:04:06.280> have<00:04:06.430> to<00:04:06.639> mail<00:04:07.060> a<00:04:07.209> these

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
obviously you don't have to mail a these

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:10.500 
obviously you don't have to mail a these
I'm<00:04:07.690> doing<00:04:08.319> them<00:04:08.440> arranged<00:04:08.979> is<00:04:09.159> better<00:04:09.449> but<00:04:10.449> I

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
I'm doing them arranged is better but I

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.270 
I'm doing them arranged is better but I
don't<00:04:11.079> feel<00:04:11.199> like<00:04:11.290> training<00:04:11.500> range<00:04:11.769> since

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
don't feel like training range since

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.490 
don't feel like training range since
attacks<00:04:12.699> my<00:04:13.060> highest<00:04:13.540> training<00:04:13.900> combat<00:04:14.199> skill

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
attacks my highest training combat skill

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.810 
attacks my highest training combat skill
I<00:04:15.489> mean<00:04:16.389> they're<00:04:16.510> all<00:04:16.539> 99<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.320> highest<00:04:18.280> XP

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
I mean they're all 99 but highest XP

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.460 
I mean they're all 99 but highest XP
rate<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.299> try<00:04:19.539> to<00:04:19.570> keep<00:04:19.810> training<00:04:20.079> expand

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
rate so I try to keep training expand

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.779 
rate so I try to keep training expand
that<00:04:20.880> past<00:04:21.880> 99<00:04:22.180> so<00:04:23.139> I<00:04:23.169> just<00:04:23.409> shows<00:04:23.620> that<00:04:23.789> not

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
that past 99 so I just shows that not
