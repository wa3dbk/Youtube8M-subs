really great with the black dress and
then<00:01:20.189> i<00:01:20.220> also<00:01:20.310> decided<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.060> put<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> necklace

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
then i also decided to put a necklace

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
then i also decided to put a necklace
with<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> i<00:01:21.990> wasn't<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.710> first<00:01:22.890> but<00:01:23.250> i

with it i wasn't going to at first but i

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.190 
with it i wasn't going to at first but i
think<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.030> necklace<00:01:24.360> really<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.930> gives<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
think the necklace really just gives it

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.780 
think the necklace really just gives it
another<00:01:25.439> pop<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.070> adds<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.369> bit<00:01:26.520> more

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
because I thought it looked cool that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
because I thought it looked cool that
the<00:02:02.070> denim<00:02:02.430> shirt<00:02:02.640> was<00:02:02.790> just<00:02:02.939> popping<00:02:03.119> out<00:02:03.360> a

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the denim shirt was just popping out a

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.929 
the denim shirt was just popping out a
little<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.830> had<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.820> bit

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
little bit and that it had a little bit

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.310 
little bit and that it had a little bit
coming<00:02:06.180> out<00:02:06.270> of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.509> sleeves<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:07.020> well<00:02:07.049> I

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
coming out of the sleeves as well I

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.529 
coming out of the sleeves as well I
think<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.830> denim<00:02:08.100> just<00:02:08.280> really<00:02:08.550> plays<00:02:09.300> well
