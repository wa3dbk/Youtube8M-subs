if<00:04:10.880> you're<00:04:11.000> going

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.699 

so<00:04:14.540> when<00:04:14.660> you're<00:04:14.810> strumming

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
so when you're strumming

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.710 
so when you're strumming
the<00:04:17.190> whole<00:04:17.400> corage<00:04:17.850> you're<00:04:18.000> gonna<00:04:18.090> leave<00:04:18.419> the

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the whole corage you're gonna leave the

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.990 
the whole corage you're gonna leave the
second<00:04:19.169> finger<00:04:19.500> out<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:19.949> then<00:04:20.310> as<00:04:20.699> you're

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
second finger out and then as you're

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
second finger out and then as you're
strumming<00:04:21.419> you're<00:04:22.259> gonna<00:04:22.380> place<00:04:22.680> it<00:04:22.889> down<00:04:23.039> so

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
strumming you're gonna place it down so

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.659 
strumming you're gonna place it down so
you<00:04:23.400> can<00:04:23.490> go

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:31.360 

and<00:04:29.330> with<00:04:29.509> this<00:04:29.689> one<00:04:29.960> you're<00:04:30.800> going<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.009> like<00:04:31.280> I

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.830 
and with this one you're going to like I
said<00:04:31.580> before<00:04:31.699> you<00:04:31.939> can<00:04:32.060> add<00:04:32.180> a<00:04:32.210> pinky<00:04:32.629> on<00:04:32.719> the

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
said before you can add a pinky on the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.940 
said before you can add a pinky on the
bottom<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:33.229> you<00:04:33.349> can<00:04:33.469> be<00:04:33.560> like

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.890 

see<00:04:41.610> as<00:04:41.760> I<00:04:41.940> was<00:04:42.060> doing<00:04:42.300> there<00:04:42.450> with<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.600> pinky

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900

and<00:04:45.890> then<00:04:46.520> on<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.700> third<00:04:46.730> with<00:04:47.510> the<00:04:47.630> sea<00:04:47.920> you

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
and then on the third with the sea you

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.520 
and then on the third with the sea you
can<00:04:49.100> strum<00:04:49.370> the<00:04:49.520> C<00:04:49.760> chord<00:04:50.120> and<00:04:50.390> then<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.380> can
