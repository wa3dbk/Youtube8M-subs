00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 this samsung galaxy s 4g has arrived 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:08.639
 313 that has a failure that does not 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.710
 the microphone works have already tried to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.940
 adapt him a microphone here would be very 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.860
 easy those who already have experience 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 simply by placing a microphone 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.359
 original and they would have a solution is a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 more complicated case because it has two of 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 its damaged tracks are reached to see 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 but they are not as they should be like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.609
 is here completely that we are going to 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.759
 need to repair a A microphone 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.870
 normal universal we're going to need a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:41.430
 resistance can serve 1.5 up 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.829
 4.7 k that resistance is 2.7 k and 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.649
 let's see if with it this one works 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 well as we look for resistance very 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.440
 easy of any board that we have of 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.480
 spare in our local s much voice yes 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 we have a multimeter we put the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.739
 shoulder measurement scale in this case 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.110
 Well, these smd tweezers are ideal because 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.840
 I'm just playing and where the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.509
 value is to the guard to be able 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.090
 then here we see for example we are going to 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.789
 s look at how much is each time if we served 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.789
 and it's between the range that I said here 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.200
 we check this one has 10 here it does not work 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.670
 I'm still testing all the resistances 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.780
 until finding one that is between 1.5 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.580
 to 4.7 k 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.010
 depending on how we get the audio 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.380
 the microphone then we decided if the 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:39.520
 we leave or if we look for one that 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.440
 approximate let's say to 4.7 here for example 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.370
 let's review this other one that takes 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.370
 how much do you brand us 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.829
 depending on the components that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.229
 you are close then you will not vote or 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.289
 the reading will try us this does not mark 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.179
 which is 91 k then do not serve us well 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.810
 successively until we find the 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.030
 correct 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.439
 here I will use then as I explained 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.439
 2.7k 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:12.700
 2,698 thousand kilos then 2.7 here the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.190
 pull out from here next to this 300's 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.450
 here this side and that in which they abuse 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.610
 then we started doing the 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.120
 repair is very simple 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.950
 and what we need to do to weld the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.650
 universal microphone but for that 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.820
 you will need a resistance that is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.590
 between the positive of the microphone then 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.870
 How are we going to do it? 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.569
 the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.909
 as we do not have the pizza remember that 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.879
 here we do not have the pizza because it would be 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:45.430
 place the resistance between these two 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:47.560
 contacts and weld the positive of the 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.629
 microphone here and the negative here to this 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.620
 part as we do not have the clue 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.810
 correctly 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.180
 this has continuity that condenser 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.150
 then which tells me that there 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.159
 I'm going to be able to solder the capacitor because 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.459
 has continuity with the track that is 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.470
 deteriorated then if in case such 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.130
 get to a case of these difficult them 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.400
 I would play 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.890
 or out of the ordinary because it would be normal 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
 that would just put the resistance 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.520
 between this point between that other weld 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.120
 the positive of the microphone and the negative 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.630
 here we go then here apply more 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.630
 tin 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.550
 to that resistance 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.980
 so that it is well welded 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.890
 and we see that it was welded however 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:46.290
 I retired part kevin soldier says now 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.200
 let's grab the positive 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:52.600
 of the microphone we're going to stretch it up 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.610
 that touches the resistance 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:58.300
 the positive of the microphone 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.710
 we place it here 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.710
 and we release it to the base 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.660
 we will put that resistance there 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.990
 remember and we are going to apply a little 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.600
 more than welding that ran 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.720
 and I 'm ready, I have the positive 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.170
 soldier here I have the resistance in a 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.600
 bridge 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:25.590
 from here to the condenser because it's the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.000
 same line here and now we are going here to 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.000
 weld this to the negative part 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.710
 let's solder what the negative part 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.419
 here this microphone should work 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.619
 however, I will check very well that everything 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.619
 has been well welded 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.549
 when I speak that way 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.549
 to try 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.020
 ready 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:03.600
 if everything went well here to sound here 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:06.810
 I have a speaker this provisionally 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.110
 to be able to prove it 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.720
 you have to record 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.530
 by the ball taping to service the yes 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.530
 Hello Hello hello HELLO 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.360
 Hello Hello hello 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.800
 ready here we recorded it like this 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.070
 hello and we can see that he has 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.770
 the work that has been done well 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.539
 we have here 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.400
 to do the stoppage and for what then 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:42.900
 fit the microphone well then 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.870
 we have to lift the basic 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.139
 protective she brings there and with a scalpel 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:52.830
 make the last of the microphone make a 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:54.720
 box so that it fits perfectly 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.520
 microphone there and it will not stay 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.259
 hindering the time to close the 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.849
 shell and you remember it and the service
