prototype<00:00:21.250> of<00:00:21.579> just<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:21.910> demonstrator<00:00:22.480> really

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
prototype of just a demonstrator really

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.380 
prototype of just a demonstrator really
so<00:00:23.470> what<00:00:23.590> you're<00:00:23.680> looking<00:00:23.949> at<00:00:24.039> is<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.310> front<00:00:25.150> lip

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
so what you're looking at is a front lip

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.119 
so what you're looking at is a front lip
there's<00:00:25.719> a<00:00:25.809> translating<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.680> being<00:00:26.919> light

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:27.129 
there's a translating and being light

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:31.049 
there's a translating and being light
lit<00:00:27.399> display<00:00:29.279> with<00:00:30.279> what<00:00:30.430> I'd<00:00:30.550> call<00:00:30.759> a<00:00:30.820> pretty

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
lit display with what I'd call a pretty

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:32.459 
lit display with what I'd call a pretty
reasonable<00:00:31.239> refresh<00:00:31.869> rate<00:00:32.050> this<00:00:32.140> is<00:00:32.230> running

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
reasonable refresh rate this is running

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.170 
reasonable refresh rate this is running
through<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.649> demo<00:00:32.890> right<00:00:33.129> now<00:00:33.309> so<00:00:33.520> let's<00:00:33.670> wait

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
through a demo right now so let's wait

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.650 
through a demo right now so let's wait
it<00:00:34.390> actually<00:00:34.840> comes<00:00:35.649> to<00:00:35.890> a<00:00:36.270> good<00:00:37.270> part<00:00:37.450> that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
it actually comes to a good part that

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.119 
it actually comes to a good part that
demo<00:00:37.870> so<00:00:38.079> there<00:00:38.230> you<00:00:38.320> can<00:00:38.469> see<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.770> refresh

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
demo so there you can see the refresh

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.819 
demo so there you can see the refresh
rate<00:00:39.250> on<00:00:39.550> it<00:00:39.699> okay<00:00:40.420> this<00:00:40.690> is<00:00:40.809> not<00:00:40.960> 25<00:00:41.410> frames<00:00:41.680> a

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
rate on it okay this is not 25 frames a

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.530 
rate on it okay this is not 25 frames a
second<00:00:42.250> but<00:00:42.400> it's<00:00:42.550> actually<00:00:42.640> way<00:00:43.090> way<00:00:43.329> way

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.540 
second but it's actually way way way

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.060 
second but it's actually way way way
faster<00:00:43.810> than<00:00:44.079> anything<00:00:44.530> you'll<00:00:44.650> see<00:00:44.829> on<00:00:44.950> an

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
faster than anything you'll see on an

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.639 
faster than anything you'll see on an
e-ink<00:00:45.190> display<00:00:45.370> right<00:00:45.880> now<00:00:46.230> I'm<00:00:47.230> not<00:00:47.470> sure

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
e-ink display right now I'm not sure

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.740 
e-ink display right now I'm not sure
they<00:00:47.800> can<00:00:47.829> backlight<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.880> as<00:00:49.000> well<00:00:49.270> but<00:00:49.570> it's

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
they can backlight it as well but it's

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.530 
they can backlight it as well but it's
even<00:00:50.020> with<00:00:50.320> the<00:00:50.440> front<00:00:50.680> light<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.820> i'm<00:00:52.180> here

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
even with the front light and i'm here

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.260 
even with the front light and i'm here
in<00:00:52.720> I<00:00:52.960> mean<00:00:53.620> pretty<00:00:53.890> low<00:00:54.130> ambient<00:00:54.370> light<00:00:54.880> and<00:00:55.210> I

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:55.270 
in I mean pretty low ambient light and I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.150 
in I mean pretty low ambient light and I
can<00:00:55.420> actually<00:00:55.540> read<00:00:55.840> that<00:00:56.020> pretty<00:00:56.470> well

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
can actually read that pretty well

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.360 
can actually read that pretty well
and<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:59.180> viewing<00:00:59.570> angles<00:00:59.930> are<00:01:00.250> reasonable<00:01:01.250> I

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and the viewing angles are reasonable I

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.070 
and the viewing angles are reasonable I
mean<00:01:01.579> viewing<00:01:02.180> angle<00:01:02.450> there<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:02.720> pretty<00:01:02.840> good

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
mean viewing angle there is pretty good

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.079 
mean viewing angle there is pretty good
doing<00:01:03.530> hanging<00:01:03.830> from<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.040> top<00:01:04.220> not<00:01:04.489> so<00:01:04.699> good<00:01:04.850> a

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
doing hanging from the top not so good a

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.430 
doing hanging from the top not so good a
look<00:01:05.390> at<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.540> form<00:01:05.780> factor<00:01:05.960> they've<00:01:06.260> chosen

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
look at the form factor they've chosen

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.790 
look at the form factor they've chosen
to<00:01:06.740> do<00:01:06.860> the<00:01:07.010> prototype<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.880> so<00:01:08.479> this<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.720> a<00:01:08.800> 5.6

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
to do the prototype in so this is a 5.6

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.910 
to do the prototype in so this is a 5.6
inch<00:01:10.040> display<00:01:10.690> 5.7<00:01:11.690> inch<00:01:11.750> display<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:12.800> it

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
inch display 5.7 inch display and it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.800 
inch display 5.7 inch display and it
fits<00:01:13.160> absolutely<00:01:13.760> perfectly<00:01:14.150> into<00:01:14.330> one<00:01:14.510> hand

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
fits absolutely perfectly into one hand

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.590 
fits absolutely perfectly into one hand
it<00:01:15.200> weighs<00:01:15.470> I<00:01:15.770> don't<00:01:15.920> know<00:01:15.979> 300<00:01:16.670> grams<00:01:16.880> maximum

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
it weighs I don't know 300 grams maximum

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.109 
it weighs I don't know 300 grams maximum
and<00:01:17.830> I<00:01:18.830> think<00:01:19.220> this<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> sort<00:01:19.790> of<00:01:19.880> size<00:01:20.090> and

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
and I think this is the sort of size and

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.060 
and I think this is the sort of size and
form<00:01:20.510> factor<00:01:20.810> I<00:01:20.840> think<00:01:20.930> will<00:01:21.260> be<00:01:21.410> always

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
form factor I think will be always

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.790 
form factor I think will be always
perfect<00:01:22.880> for<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.119> e-book<00:01:23.420> market<00:01:23.530> it's<00:01:24.530> good

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
perfect for the e-book market it's good

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.560 
perfect for the e-book market it's good
enough<00:01:24.979> for<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:25.250> one<00:01:25.430> meter<00:01:25.640> video<00:01:25.970> experience

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
enough for a one meter video experience

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.650 
enough for a one meter video experience
it's<00:01:27.200> good<00:01:27.380> enough<00:01:27.590> for<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:28.460> single<00:01:29.150> page<00:01:29.330> or

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
it's good enough for a single page or

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.510 
it's good enough for a single page or
web<00:01:29.869> experience<00:01:30.410> and<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.130> good<00:01:31.250> enough<00:01:31.460> for

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
web experience and it's good enough for

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.999 
web experience and it's good enough for
a<00:01:31.790> one-handed<00:01:32.450> reading<00:01:32.930> reading<00:01:33.290> experience

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
a one-handed reading reading experience

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:37.930 
a one-handed reading reading experience
no<00:01:34.940> two<00:01:35.000> handed<00:01:35.660> one<00:01:36.350> kilo<00:01:36.800> worries<00:01:37.280> for<00:01:37.759> this

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
no two handed one kilo worries for this

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.600 
no two handed one kilo worries for this
this<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.840> reason<00:01:39.050> i<00:01:39.350> think<00:01:39.649> the<00:01:40.220> dual

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
this is the reason i think the dual

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.109 
this is the reason i think the dual
