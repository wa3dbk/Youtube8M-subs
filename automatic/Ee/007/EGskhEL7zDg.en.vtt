 Letter (English): Corey Maddox. Fix: Matheus Lynar. Original artist: FLOW 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.350
 To change the world, including myself, I have to believe what I can achieve 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.850
 And that belief will always be inside of me 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 I'm scared because the world is getting worse 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.550
 So I just looked the other way 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.550
 I do not faint anymore, I do not worry anymore 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.800
 I do not tremble anymore, because I can choose 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.300
 Because you gave me the courage to resist 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.950
 You gave me hope that I will never lose 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.300
 Once my soul was so dark, like the night 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 But then you entered my soul with your light 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.550
 I see the sun, my heart does not have some limits 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
 Today, I will live life again 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.450
 I will open all my windows to see the blue sky 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.450
 To change the world, including myself, I have to believe what I can achieve 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.300
 And that belief will always be inside of me 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.100
