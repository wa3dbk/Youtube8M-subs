00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
first reason why I hate them all is the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.819 
first reason why I hate them all is the
stores<00:00:35.969> don't<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.630> much<00:00:36.780> merchandise<00:00:37.140> as

the online stores do usually a store
will<00:00:42.239> have<00:00:42.270> an<00:00:42.510> online<00:00:42.660> store<00:00:43.050> because<00:00:43.530> it's

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
will have an online store because it's

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.979 
will have an online store because it's
just<00:00:43.860> easier<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.610> like<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> shop<00:00:45.750> online

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because it's literally at the click of a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
because it's literally at the click of a
