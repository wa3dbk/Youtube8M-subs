00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:39.890
 in the early stages it will be necessary to 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.699
 the dog remained in place can be done 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.699
 here so allow 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.140
 it is very important during training to 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.070
 dog you have worked with delivery to 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.340
 the dog worked with zeal with desire 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.199
 the dog must be hungry for well-fed 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:03.250
 no one will work the stomach 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:07.180
 man with all his intelligence with 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.240
 with all my supreme, once rationality 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.880
 with all reasonableness and seriousness 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.850
 life approach on a full stomach is 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.729
 work no one wants to be 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.399
 incentive and the dog and man no one 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's check there forward money is not 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.990
 pays at work a salary outflow 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.310
 the results of the work done because 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.350
 what should be an incentive if with such 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.170
 options are problematic even with 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.180
 man of work that he would have a stimulus 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.500
 doesn't want to do anything to animals 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:45.009
 more for animal stimulus is food 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.380
 for food they kill for food 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:48.850
 they gnaw at each other's throats for food 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.140
 they are all life in search 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.760
 it is therefore very important to stimulate 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.790
 the food you use is not in 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.790
 segments of nutrition and daily food and 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.560
 some treats for the dog to it 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.770
 it was like pleasure that she 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.570
 understood that the difference between lag oats 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.600
 received for a good job done 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.400
 and just food every day 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.200
 life support 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.000
 what can be used as 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.000
 goodies but there are ready there and 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.480
 branded delicacy can be used 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.250
 there are slices of chopped cheese some 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.920
 use sausages I am against it easier 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:31.390
 sausages for humans is poison for dogs 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.600
 all the better the incentive for the dog is 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.000
 a piece of fresh meat for a piece of fresh meat 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.579
 you will have a dog if it is relative 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.549
 hungry she will always work 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.350
 and in general she gives nothing for free 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.360
 the dog must not earn everything 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.330
 any piece you give should 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.090
 earn some kind of team like this 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.250
 listening to some action for free 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.960
 give nothing can be grown otherwise 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.450
 bolts new lego review 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.520

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.410
 you will have this very big 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.900
 problems so every bit 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:17.610
 which we give to our pet jim 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:28.010

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:28.010

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.530
 all kinds of kinds but the best 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.890
 encouragement then a piece of fresh meat that is 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.420
 take beef meat cut into pieces 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.880
 I personally pre-freeze her 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.240
 chamber freezer for 20 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.880
 days 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.970
 that is, I did not weld it I donâ€™t give it to me 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.510
 it does not give paryu not cook raw bought 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:52.340
 prefrozen if dog 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.840
 does not want to work for a fresh piece of meat 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.980
 it means you have something wrong 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.060
 either the dog is unwell or you are not 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.090
 properly built 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.280
 labrador diet is generally 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.010
 very hungry in nature but there are 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.260
 they also press such genetic 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.040
 hungry do not want more for a piece of meat 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.140
 do something 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.510
 it means the training process is set 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:16.490
 wrong or the dog does not understand what 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.020
 you want or cannot 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.030
 some kind of physical ability this 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.740
 do or something something something something 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:26.690
 hippo have in principle here are 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.490
 basic principles should know all that 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.490
 going to train by yourself
