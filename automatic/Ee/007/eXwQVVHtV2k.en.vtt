00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.770 
co-owner team and say hi and look at you
you're<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> co-owner<00:04:24.680> so<00:04:25.680> now<00:04:26.639> if<00:04:26.910> if<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.539> can

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
you're a co-owner so now if if you can

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.830 
you're a co-owner so now if if you can
get<00:04:28.020> really<00:04:28.410> complex<00:04:28.919> on<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.599> make

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
get really complex on you can make

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.279 
get really complex on you can make
certain<00:04:31.560> commands<00:04:32.250> available<00:04:32.970> for<00:04:33.690> each<00:04:33.840> rank

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
certain commands available for each rank

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.439 
certain commands available for each rank
but<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.860> think<00:04:35.159> you<00:04:35.250> should<00:04:35.729> just<00:04:36.090> make<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
but I think you should just make that

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.060 
but I think you should just make that
the<00:04:36.510> rule<00:04:36.870> if<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.229> don't<00:04:37.440> know<00:04:37.560> how<00:04:37.680> to<00:04:37.800> do<00:04:37.919> it

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
the rule if you don't know how to do it

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.610 
the rule if you don't know how to do it
not<00:04:38.310> even<00:04:38.639> I<00:04:38.789> I<00:04:39.090> know<00:04:39.330> I<00:04:39.750> don't<00:04:40.229> even<00:04:40.320> know<00:04:40.440> how

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
