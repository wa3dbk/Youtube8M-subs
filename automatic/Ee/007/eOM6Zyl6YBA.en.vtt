00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.440
 everyone 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.580
 Cluster spike is a practice 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.270
 cultural that applies to all 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.340
 Commercial varieties of table grapes 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.400
 the purpose is to give the size of the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.699
 cluster that the market prefers 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.330
 too long bunches are not good 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.550
 accepted in the market on the other hand 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:58.940
 Another advantage of blunting the bunch is 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.360
 give enough cluster load the 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.699
 optimum load to achieve the size and 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.640
 Maturity is a complement to all 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.760
 other jobs that are thinning and 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.330
 selection of bunches in this case the 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.940
 blunting is done in this variety of 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.740
 to 14 centimeters or it may vary according to 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.409
 Year according to loading and unloading 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.550
 average bunches each has 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.680
 box the lowest load of bunches 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.250
 you can choose to leave them longer for 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.370
 compensate a little for the lack of bunches in 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.770
 the case of other varieties can be 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.140
 even shorter since I know they are 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.180
 varieties of longer shoulders so 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.300
 so much with a blunt 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.930
 more aggressive the load could be achieved 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.930
 enough 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 and 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380
