with a collection the reason they did
this<00:01:49.680> probably<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.189> because<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> added

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this probably is because if you added

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200 
this probably is because if you added
individual<00:01:51.509> songs<00:01:52.130> from<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> music<00:01:53.670> catalog

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
individual songs from the music catalog

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.179 
individual songs from the music catalog
your<00:01:54.840> collection<00:01:55.350> would<00:01:55.409> get<00:01:55.560> really<00:01:55.829> long

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
your collection would get really long

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.959 
your collection would get really long
and<00:01:56.399> may<00:01:56.490> be<00:01:56.549> hard<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.140> navigate<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.759> good

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
and may be hard to navigate so it's good

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.039 
and may be hard to navigate so it's good
that<00:02:00.090> they<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.479> option<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> guess

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
that they have that option but I guess

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.660 
that they have that option but I guess
the<00:02:04.200> main<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:04.380> when<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the main thing when it on what is the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340 
the main thing when it on what is the
main<00:02:05.939> reason<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.210> signed<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.110> slide

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
main reason I signed up on for the slide

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.990 
main reason I signed up on for the slide
is<00:02:07.500> for<00:02:07.710> movies<00:02:08.039> like<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.640> big

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
is for movies like I'm a really big

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.930 
is for movies like I'm a really big
movie<00:02:09.209> fan<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:11.069> really<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:11.610> horror<00:02:11.879> movies

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
but they have a ton of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.570 
but they have a ton of
options<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:15.350> yeah<00:02:16.350> like<00:02:16.530> pretty<00:02:17.010> I'm<00:02:17.490> not

going<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.790> run<00:02:17.910> through<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.150> genres<00:02:18.540> of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
going to run through the genres of

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
going to run through the genres of
movies<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.020> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.380> figure

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
movies because you can probably figure

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380
