00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:17.210 

fancy<00:01:08.690> machines<00:01:09.140> finally<00:01:09.710> finished

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.300 

the<00:01:18.210> cable<00:01:19.140> friend

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the cable friend

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.490 
the cable friend
tires<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.149> all<00:01:22.840> the

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
tires and all the

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.670 
tires and all the
electrical<00:01:25.500> wire<00:01:25.649> that<00:01:25.979> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:40.510 

that<00:01:29.680> limit<00:01:30.040> bitches

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.240 

kind<00:01:40.789> of<00:01:40.909> see<00:01:41.530> eventually<00:01:42.530> I'm<00:01:42.859> going<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.070> use

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
kind of see eventually I'm going to use

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.040 
kind of see eventually I'm going to use
it<00:01:43.460> for<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.700> plasma<00:01:44.299> cutter<00:01:44.509> as<00:01:44.840> well

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
it for a plasma cutter as well

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.430 
it for a plasma cutter as well
and<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.590> guess<00:01:47.070> slats<00:01:47.940> underneath<00:01:48.780> here<00:01:49.170> I

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
and I guess slats underneath here I

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.210 
and I guess slats underneath here I
finished<00:01:50.190> putting<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> slide

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
finished putting on the slide

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.590 
finished putting on the slide
but<00:01:51.730> eventually<00:01:52.120> all<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.810> slats<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.500> end

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
but eventually all the slats of the end

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.350 
but eventually all the slats of the end
top<00:01:55.780> of<00:01:55.930> those<00:01:56.020> slacks<00:01:56.580> are<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.759> ready<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.090> cut

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
top of those slacks are you ready to cut

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.860 
top of those slacks are you ready to cut
the<00:01:58.740> metal<00:01:59.740> with<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.100> plasma<00:02:00.340> cutter

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.920 

and<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.380> is<00:02:03.560> my

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.560 

up<00:02:05.990> that<00:02:06.170> I'm<00:02:06.320> basically<00:02:06.710> running<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.570> the

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
up that I'm basically running the the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.840 
up that I'm basically running the the
control<00:02:09.380> software<00:02:09.710> from<00:02:10.450> so

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
control software from so

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.850 
control software from so
pretty<00:02:13.390> much<00:02:13.570> it<00:02:14.250> my<00:02:15.250> homemade<00:02:15.610> control<00:02:16.150> box

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
pretty much it my homemade control box

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.530 
pretty much it my homemade control box
my<00:02:17.860> e<00:02:19.290> stop<00:02:20.290> on<00:02:20.590> it

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
my e stop on it

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:45.780 
my e stop on it
30<00:02:23.110> mar<00:02:23.349> sure

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790

okay<00:02:46.790> here's<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.180> couple<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:48.160> circles<00:02:49.160> that

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
okay here's a couple of the circles that

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.540 
okay here's a couple of the circles that
I<00:02:49.430> cut<00:02:49.670> out<00:02:49.819> a<00:02:50.440> couple<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.590> tests<00:02:51.830> circles<00:02:52.280> just

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
I cut out a couple of tests circles just

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.930 
I cut out a couple of tests circles just
like<00:02:52.670> one<00:02:52.970> on<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.240> other<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.980> then<00:02:54.980> that's

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
like one on the other and then that's

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.520 
like one on the other and then that's
just<00:02:56.030> kind<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.360> like<00:02:56.510> some<00:02:56.750> little<00:02:57.050> goofy

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
just kind of like some little goofy

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.430 
just kind of like some little goofy
spiral<00:02:58.160> pattern<00:02:58.580> that<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.819> was<00:02:58.990> goofing<00:02:59.990> around

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
spiral pattern that I was goofing around

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.380 
spiral pattern that I was goofing around
with<00:03:00.530> just<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.989> play<00:03:02.989> around<00:03:03.020> with<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.590> but

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
with just to play around with it but

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.060 
with just to play around with it but
yeah<00:03:05.390> so<00:03:06.040> anyway<00:03:07.040> here<00:03:07.280> it<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.489> all<00:03:07.819> done
