hi guys

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:13.915
first of all thanks for views/comments 
you've left on TDI related episodes

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:22.425
I'm proud to say, that those episodes reached 0.5 million views

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:27.556
i'm proud of that. That's a good appreciation for job we did.

00:00:27.556 --> 00:00:39.302
taking that into account, a most popular question  is regarding fuel consumption

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:43.514
did it change after the upgrade, became better/worse?

00:00:43.514 --> 00:00:53.004
I thought why wouldn't I make an episode dedicated to fuel consumption

00:00:53.024 --> 00:00:54.339
approach is very simple

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.135
I have this car for 2 years

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:01.119
I tank 2-3 time a month

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:09.191
every time I tank, I record number of driven km

00:01:09.191 --> 00:01:12.110
during 2 years I got about 60 data points

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.850
as you can see, an average fuel consumption is around 6.5L/100km

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.708
you can see some peaks, which correspond to track days

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.626
these are my measurements

00:01:26.626 --> 00:01:33.008
than I thought why wouldn't I record an interactive video

00:01:33.008 --> 00:01:42.915
I switched on fuel consumption meter

00:01:42.915 --> 00:01:48.171
and did some experiments ;-)

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.507
the results are also quite nice

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:52.967
and I'm quite happy with that

00:01:52.967 --> 00:01:55.429
let me show one thin

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:04.815
imagine flat surface, 120 km/h, 0.6 bar boost.

00:02:04.815 --> 00:02:09.194
fuel consumption would be 4.5-5.5 L/100 km

00:02:09.194 --> 00:02:12.094
another interesting thing is a drag start

00:02:12.094 --> 00:02:17.850
I just went to a ... drag strip ;-)

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.644
the car was like it is now

00:02:19.644 --> 00:02:25.232
18 inch wheels + Continental Contact Sport3 tires

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:31.657
backup wheel in, back seats in = full weight

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:35.223
14.25 seconds - it was quite OK

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.787
the best time for this car was 14.0 sec

00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:18.581
I'm quite sure it  can be better

00:03:18.643 --> 00:03:25.381
another video is a normal run 0-250 km/h

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:58.382
all in all I'm very happy with fuel consumption of this great car

00:04:58.382 --> 00:05:01.378
I hope you've heard and seen what you wanted

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.891
I understand that this is not the most complicated way

00:05:05.891 --> 00:05:09.061
to tell you about a fuel consumption

00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:13.858
this is the closest to reality

00:05:13.858 --> 00:05:15.505
how you would experience it, if you would drive

00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:19.802
I hope you like it and learned something.

00:05:19.802 --> 00:05:22.930
thanks for watching, rating, commenting.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:33.671
stay TDI!
