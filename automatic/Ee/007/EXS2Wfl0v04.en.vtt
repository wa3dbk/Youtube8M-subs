00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.579
 that you will be met with stranger people that you will never win in the morning jacket 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:49.520

 andy schleck was a swallow farm 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.309
 and that you show so much as if you are really into it 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.119
 with that crushed hair from the sauna that you then walk to the bar and the 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:24.119
 orders and ginger juice 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.599

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.999
 hot tub that is always so late to the ground there are people with a body and 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.620

 You also do that you always do just right on the beautiful and 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.709
 and then you stand by the bubble bath and you can't be someone like that for a good year 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.719
 a handy haha ​​yes 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.959
 and they also have no champagne criticism 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.879
 that is sometimes a chair under water that is another hole where you can then 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.510
 lie and falls so you don't know where you have the tour with your paw 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.659
 not such a show trap that if you go in how thompson 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.439
 the caller 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.979
 you lie in the water once 

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:10.239
 is everything conquered they are nice and precise again when they asked where do I think 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:10.850
 you think you are 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.610
 once I have an alcoholic police station 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.650
 and it is also difficult to get off the ground 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.109
 I've been a little depressed lately and attitude those things 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.510
 if the bin are sitting watching it runs on a perk that coming week 

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:23.880
 Amsterdam known 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.880
 if it's stick with the bathtubs for hours 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:32.129
 but well you at nec I think you are in debates all those people go with hard 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.579
 Hand chopping off handy 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.239
 I care and about that sentence I actually have too early but also 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.149

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.640
 what a surprise also the sunlight 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.640
 and that works pretty well 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.560
 and if you want something with honest people who don't 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.889
 once you are in the bath everything around the room is not agreed 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:51.290
 million euros 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.390
 although this moment the union is alive and kicking 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.549
 it is a bit we pretend it is not bad tidy 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.570
 Hey 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.510
 is a bit odd and and and from dander not to be nice in the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.209
 london 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.429
 it's that you just have to adjust the tactics look earlier that I knew 

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.939
 well that I used to have sex with link at the bottom of my mind 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:11.399
 akram i am very sorry about equipment but very good 

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:14.469

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.840
 can win 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.689
 However, we have to look for we are not paying attention 

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:23.479
 to put kaká paper 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.450
 impossible 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.060
 just change your tactics you have no problem just like this one just 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.090
 claim on top 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.830
 and looked at gouda then they would have been back if he used to as before 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.830
 they get dordrecht 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.010
 and this is years old that is evident and that you decide if you can reach 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.010
 niamey 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.770
