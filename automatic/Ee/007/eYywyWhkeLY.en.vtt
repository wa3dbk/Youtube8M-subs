because<00:01:26.150> since<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.570> lip<00:01:27.840> balm<00:01:28.049> versus

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
because since it is a lip balm versus

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.859 
because since it is a lip balm versus
lips<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> rather<00:01:29.939> than<00:01:30.060> lipstick<00:01:30.630> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
lips you know rather than lipstick it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.410 
lips you know rather than lipstick it
comes<00:01:31.110> off<00:01:31.350> on<00:01:32.310> your<00:01:32.549> lips<00:01:32.759> rather<00:01:33.030> blotchy

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
comes off on your lips rather blotchy

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.990 
comes off on your lips rather blotchy
like<00:01:34.140> as<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:34.979> I'm<00:01:35.100> wearing<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.319 
like as you can see like I'm wearing the
fig<00:01:36.570> jam<00:01:36.810> right<00:01:37.140> now<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.329> exactly

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
fig jam right now and it's not exactly

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.569 
fig jam right now and it's not exactly
even<00:01:39.630> it's<00:01:40.049> pretty<00:01:40.500> blah<00:01:40.770> tea<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.400> have

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
even it's pretty blah tea and I have

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.999 
even it's pretty blah tea and I have
about<00:01:41.850> 10<00:01:42.240> coats<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.869> it<00:01:42.990> on<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.829> this

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
about 10 coats of it on to get this

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.429 
about 10 coats of it on to get this
color<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.180> do<00:01:45.360> end<00:01:45.570> up<00:01:45.659> using<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:46.110> lot<00:01:46.290> of

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
color so you do end up using a lot of

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.520 
color so you do end up using a lot of
product<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.159> get<00:01:48.020> pigmentation<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.110> your<00:01:49.320> lips

product to get pigmentation on your lips

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.440

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and also it tends to wear off pretty

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.630 
and also it tends to wear off pretty
quickly<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.040> used<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.430> be

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
definitely be lollipop since that's the

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.710 
definitely be lollipop since that's the
most<00:02:23.470> pigmented<00:02:24.069> into<00:02:24.400> fun<00:02:24.700> bright<00:02:25.420> color

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
most pigmented into fun bright color

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.170 
most pigmented into fun bright color
with<00:02:25.900> us<00:02:26.020> estimators<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.830> lot<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.670> colors<00:02:28.000> to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
with us estimators a lot of colors to

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.780 
with us estimators a lot of colors to
choose<00:02:28.360> from<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.750> lot<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.110> them<00:02:29.260> are<00:02:29.470> very<00:02:30.310> sheer

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.640 
choose from a lot of them are very sheer
though<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.690> i<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.110> they<00:02:32.230> wouldn't<00:02:32.500> really

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
though and i think they wouldn't really

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.010 
though and i think they wouldn't really
show<00:02:32.980> up<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.430> a<00:02:33.459> lot<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.730> people<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.750> if<00:02:34.930> you're

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
show up on a lot of people so if you're

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
maybe you could go with lighter colors

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.840 
maybe you could go with lighter colors
but<00:02:38.530> i<00:02:38.590> would<00:02:38.950> if<00:02:39.430> you're<00:02:39.580> looking<00:02:39.819> for

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
bucks with the promotion so that's why I

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.580 
bucks with the promotion so that's why I
went<00:03:09.489> ahead<00:03:09.610> and<00:03:09.850> tried<00:03:10.000> these<00:03:10.330> two<00:03:10.600> on<00:03:10.810> but

went ahead and tried these two on but

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.940 
went ahead and tried these two on but
overall<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.540> think<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.440> would<00:03:14.620> rate<00:03:14.769> this

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
