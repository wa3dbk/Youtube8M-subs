00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.840
 Welcome to this fighter and are today's topic 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.589
 College for elderly care 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:13.339
 because the so urgently needed consequently we had so far deputy 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.270
 Head of the technical schools the heart of us can say so this the 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.509
 three-year training as a state-recognized geriatric nurse all the way to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.909
 negotiate 

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.909
 of course one asks what a film ml 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.919
 Employees make but what mediate the hand taken training 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.699
 that's a very versatile OpenTV, again it's the core requirement 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:34.540
 that's OK 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.650
 so we need it 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.400
 So it's just theory to convey so the core is directed so theory 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.940
 the care process 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.309
 a controller 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.980
 that is, the processual approach to the care of the elderly but one 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:51.289
 is ordered in front of highly complex situation in practice 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.890
 So it's about old people and people again and again so it works 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.440
 to diseases and it also involves the support of diagnostics and 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.470
 therapy 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.220
 and that's why our training is designed to give you the Fed Cup 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.000
 also provide practical instruction 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.320
 so of course on the basis of dirty money 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.970
 and that is very demanding 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.480
 where often very much value is that the students themselves learn so that 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.280
 learn self-organized 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.870
 easy 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.660
 well prepared for the idea of ​​being situations 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.680
 who meet him there in practice, but you know you are divided and always 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.780
 enough Puke about Colombia and juvenile medicine are being practiced 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.490
 ongoing debates 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.329
 her daughter is designed to be in the same place again 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.500
 Practice focus steering wheel is a put 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.770
 outside of this school n very different facilities so 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.270
 before the psychiatry 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.040
 outpatient 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.190
 Care and inpatient care facility 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.990
 and here on the spot 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.470
 1 0 in the lead 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.940
 the imparting of theoretical knowledge Richter but also the 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.510
 practical instruction 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.480
 and go see them here in this room where the simple solution is equipped 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.570
 there are four 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.729
 about materials the students also available 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.869
 in the facilities when getting to know and thus be confronted 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.369
 Denzel both medical devices 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:18.239
 as well as percent leadership to the line 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.280
 All those they face now need to put their work 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.110
 if you look at the rebels sitting on the ground scheduled flights patient 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.980
 have percent then we will look who such fundamental things apparently 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.049
 Dwindling such simple things are also devoted to researching 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.499
 Oxygen cylinder he has to play a miracle in medicine we have 

00:02:37.499 --> 00:02:41.930
 shared, so to speak, would continue to spread between fundamental ones 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:45.459
 yes he has a square active 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.629
 them and has nothing to do with Chrysler 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.379
 The work reminds of the beginnings, that means there are both medical ones 

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.849
 The Indian must be taught as well as would be the reason of many fish 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.069
 Things are good 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:59.779
 Fiege treatment care 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.129
 so you can do that too no and percent 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.219
 it's just that you can not separate that from each other because he's in one 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:07.439
 Nursing home it is also like that a man 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.559
 before situation is asked where 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:13.579
 Both are worked for Conficker treasure diver treatment error 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.029
 must of course also depends on others so far from the training level 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.029
 So any year of training is the trainee 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:24.969
 that is to say after three years in the criticism because his manager is 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.439
 Of course, then too 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.419
 with percent 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.499
 more demanding activities 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.689
 when Birgit Simon Blümcke hut 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.719
 That's why Siemens is already receiving a shortage of labor 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:39.939
 Years ago and was created there they would say 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:43.950
 that they should already have 15% prior experience 

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.329
 ready practical vests 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.620
 So we recommend and should 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.729
 also to prove that they are doing an internship 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.859
 in the social institution that would be fine if this is actually in 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.709
 the care facility doing in the inpatient care facility or 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:03:59.379
 outpatient 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.949
 either go 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.969
 and that at least six weeks so at some point I really want one 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.019
 Overview invented them 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:09.740
 he is that extra work the 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.989
 is more fun with me here 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.389
 yes you excuses world 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.959
 and Danny grew up so it's not very demanding anymore 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.439
 Activity, then 

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:24.110
 it is stressful Meppen so 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.439
 of course also physically burden 

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:30.169
 and psychologically burdened one should certainly also make a picture of whether 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.960
 to cope with it has grown from the requirements at all 

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:36.150
 on 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.430
 a missing one has to bear the high responsibility 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.279
 must of course also be trained professionally 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:46.279
 to let those crops destroy crops 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:48.729
 Century into the communities
