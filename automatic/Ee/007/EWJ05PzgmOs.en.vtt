00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
having an assemble of tack that really

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.939 
having an assemble of tack that really
goes<00:03:44.940> together<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.810> cell<00:03:46.019> is<00:03:46.049> one<00:03:46.319> thing<00:03:46.590> but

you really want to get it optimized with
the<00:03:50.599> appropriate<00:03:51.599> gear<00:03:52.019> as<00:03:52.230> well<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.590> are

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
the appropriate gear as well that are

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410 
the appropriate gear as well that are
very<00:03:52.799> supple<00:03:53.430> you<00:03:53.669> know

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
very supple you know

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.960 
very supple you know
to<00:03:54.840> have<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.230> tech<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.770> really<00:03:56.250> much<00:03:56.459> is<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
to have the tech that really much is the

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.140 
to have the tech that really much is the
design<00:03:57.330> like<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.099> angle<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.370> rehearsing<00:03:59.970> is

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
design like the angle of rehearsing is

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.010 
design like the angle of rehearsing is
specifically<00:04:01.140> Cylon<00:04:01.770> the<00:04:01.890> angle<00:04:02.870> where<00:04:03.870> the

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 
specifically Cylon the angle where the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.800 
specifically Cylon the angle where the
cursor<00:04:04.650> shape<00:04:05.510> engagers<00:04:06.510> really<00:04:07.470> much<00:04:07.650> is<00:04:07.830> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
cursor shape engagers really much is the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.750 
cursor shape engagers really much is the
it's<00:04:09.810> like<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:09.989> package<00:04:10.770> sugar<00:04:11.010> and<00:04:11.370> we<00:04:11.459> really

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
it's like a package sugar and we really

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.660 
it's like a package sugar and we really
made<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.300> be<00:04:12.420> together<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.470> again<00:04:14.280> you're<00:04:14.520> all
