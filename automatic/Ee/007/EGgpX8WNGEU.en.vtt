00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
time to get this special dragon here

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
time to get this special dragon here
which<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> supersonic<00:00:45.030> dragon<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.660> it's

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
which is the supersonic dragon and it's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.360 
which is the supersonic dragon and it's
just<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.170> coming<00:00:46.590> along<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> other

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
just not coming along and the other

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
just not coming along and the other
dragon<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.879> not<00:00:48.030> coming<00:00:48.420> along<00:00:48.690> either<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.289> I'm

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
dragon is not coming along either so I'm

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
dragon is not coming along either so I'm
not<00:00:49.590> really<00:00:49.920> sure<00:00:50.449> how<00:00:51.449> if<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.890> percent<00:00:53.820> they

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
not really sure how if what percent they

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.799 
not really sure how if what percent they
have<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.260> guess<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.460> as<00:00:56.780> time<00:00:57.780> goes

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
have it at but I guess that as time goes

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.380 
have it at but I guess that as time goes
they're<00:00:58.530> gonna<00:00:58.680> increase<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.850> chance<00:01:00.180> to

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
they're gonna increase or your chance to

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.420 
they're gonna increase or your chance to
get<00:01:00.570> these<00:01:00.719> dragon<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.440> better<00:01:01.829> but

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
get these dragon which is better but

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.640 
get these dragon which is better but
right<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.210> just<00:01:03.480> not<00:01:03.660> coming<00:01:03.989> along<00:01:04.379> I
