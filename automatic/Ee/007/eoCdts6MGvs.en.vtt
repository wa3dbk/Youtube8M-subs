00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 light there are incrustations from the 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 usually now I'll try to get them out and 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.080
 try to die 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.509
 here 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 here there is always here there is always the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.490
 bolts of the disassembled motor that then 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.230
 I'm going to clean this was the door 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.830
 old brushes 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.170
 these are the old brushes that between 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.280
 the other one was also broken this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:59.010
 this for angel is therefore not done 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 other than ordering a brush holder 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.080
 new of the space of 9 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:17.270
 are the eggs and the washers of 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:25.610
 brass sliding motor from 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:28.130

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.080
 available on the market 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.340
