00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.099
 or not 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.860
 and now yes girls it's time to 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.380
 change those jeans and the typical shirt 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.090
 white but give it a little touch 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.740
 glamor here we are going to tell you how 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.540
 because what alex proposes to us on the day of 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.029
 today is that we get to our 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.279
 wardrobe we take that shirt that already 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.500
 we do not use so much and we put 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:27.130
 example a bit of lace see nothing more 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.099
 that feminine that sexy besides being 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.890
 black and white gives the illusion of having 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.470
 more waist an optical illusion than to 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:38.350
 all women suits us very sexy 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.829
 and also very comfortable let's see the former 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.379
 teach us 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.329
 or you get it right you're right 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.670
 shirt is divine in if you are like 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 I love to walk in T-shirt 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.199
 cotton this will fascinate you because 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.750
 because it will give a sexy touch but 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.039
 the time will give you a comfort that 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.379
 you want it to be in a 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.030
 cotton shirt what we need 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.920
 it's your white shirt I know you 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.040
 has at the club several 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.590
 then with the white shirt we're going to 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.200
 wearing a black lace now I tell them the 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.119
 lace that you have at home is a patch 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.340
 of lace what they have to see is that 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.009
 there is contrast between the color of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.380
 T-shirt and lace color my lace 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.890
 it's a little bit narrow lace then 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.720
 I used double the amount and what 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.550
 we're going to do is we're going to put the 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.070
 lace on the shirt 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.040
 we want us to stay doing as a 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 bustier effect then we 're going to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.610
 put just above the bust we go to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.170
 so measure the eyemeter as I say without 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.330
 Take measures to put the shirt on 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.540
 table leave a bit like an inch 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.180
 and then we will measure leaving a 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.120
 inch more and shorten if your lace has 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.880
 a very special design try to measure it 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.460
 so that it is centered 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.149
 like mine had the edge just of a 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.289
 side I took the other part of the lace what 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.019
 uni and cut the same always remember that 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.819
 this fits on the right side of the 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.459
 lace also has right and the reverse 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.230
 and the right side is the prettiest this 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.100
 remember to always have the side 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.910
 right let's go with pins 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:25.330
 mark then ensure better said what 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.940
 is our lace to be able to sew 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.400
 this step of knowing the fit in the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.930
 T-shirt do not have to ignore the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.659
 shirt to do it 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.980
 and open it we're going to put it right on top 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.470
 d 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.200
 the shirt once the health the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.470
 we make sure 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.180
 the pins we are going to sew already 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.090
 I advise the thing in your hand because 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.580
 they are easier and it looks nicer 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.470
 it looks more delicate good the last step 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.690
 to do as I say, loren el 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.560
 little piece there of the waist that they have left 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.510
 so wasp I took a tape can 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.560
 be the width and color that you 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.540
 want and I asked more or less how much I 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 I wore for the waist in the part 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.930
 in front and I made a little nudite and with a 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.819
 tie to make it a little bit sexier 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.690
 then to see what I did was that 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.250
 I marked the bow in the same center with 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:26.970
 a pin 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.970
 how easy and then mark the tips 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.830
 and all they have to do is 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.160
 know everything from the wrong side of the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:42.550
 T-shirt and they will be so cute 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.670
 look how pretty that sexy super super 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.110
 easy and also because they do not try to do 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.300
 today we are going to 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.280
 thanks alex because you can see 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.590
 Wear the glamor and the touch of design 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.110
 even in a garment as simple as 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.040
 a shirt with jeans changes 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.100
 totally 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.080
 we see ourselves without and well it also depends 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.940
 what kind of contrast do you want? 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.920
 do because right now we saw white with 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.600
 black but there are many women who do not 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.700
 is the target we can do then 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.950
 you do not owe the white or you do not like the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.010
 white around here in blunt 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.530
 we teach everything and the trick is that 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.570
 you see my technique and do it to your 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.950
 taste and what looks good to see by 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.570
 example if we want to give our 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.910
 friends who do not dare to contrast 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.800
 as strong as black and white those 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.480
 romantics that go by the pink with that 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.370
 contrast it and look at the pink it would look 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.370
 very cute as with a gray lace and 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.470
 then it makes you the shape because it makes you 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.870
 the waist at the same time but it gives you that touch 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.580
 a little more subtle more romantic than 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.130
 well we all like it I wanted to see 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.290
 for example mixing colors of the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.570
 same palette is to say greens we can 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.280
 make very nice contrast what they have 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.650
 that taking friends into account is that the 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.120
 light color is much much lighter 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.860
 that the color d 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.680
 it is worn on the shirt because we want 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.930
 to be transparent in the lace for 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.030
 that gives the effect and for those that are 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.720
 a little more daring more warriors more 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.490
 at night 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.500
 Well, I really like the combination 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 that it is very fashionable that it is red with 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.860
 black 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.960
 I would make the red shirt with the lace 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.080
 good black and lastly also 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.030
 we can use for example gold or something 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.740
 that is as ideal to go out in the 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.110
 night if I know that all the friends in 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.030
 the house have a lot of lace 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.100
 saved in a good box I have 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.289
 an amount of lace then there should 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.690
 have some silver gold that you 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.800
 you make the shirt in black and you do what 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.900
 which is the bustier not in gold or in 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.330
 silver and it will be divine to you what 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.400
 you can put but I love 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.720
 remember in this case some accessories 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.460
 that go just like the lace does not 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.370
 they need a lot because they already bring it 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.169
 put and ready for the night for the 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.090
 day for whatever thanks 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:51.500
 to accompany us, I hope you have 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:53.810
 enjoyed the program as much as 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.960
 us and that we see each other very soon 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:59.960

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.960
