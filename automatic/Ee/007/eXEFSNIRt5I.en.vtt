your kind of mid-back area of the plates

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.280 
your kind of mid-back area of the plates
hang<00:00:43.579> down<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:44.750> gonna<00:00:44.899> do<00:00:45.050> is<00:00:45.170> allow

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
hang down but that's gonna do is allow

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.650 
hang down but that's gonna do is allow
you<00:00:45.380> to<00:00:45.590> load<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:46.730> like<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:46.940> would<00:00:47.059> a<00:00:47.090> dip<00:00:47.300> or

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
you to load just like you would a dip or

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.049 
you to load just like you would a dip or
chill<00:00:48.130> just<00:00:49.130> you're<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.520> little<00:00:49.670> bit<00:00:49.760> push<00:00:49.910> up

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
chill just you're a little bit push up

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.540 
chill just you're a little bit push up
so<00:00:50.719> it's<00:00:51.200> a<00:00:51.260> great<00:00:51.500> way<00:00:51.680> to<00:00:51.710> use<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.190> bodyweight

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
so it's a great way to use a bodyweight

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.910 
so it's a great way to use a bodyweight
exercise<00:00:53.149> with<00:00:53.899> a<00:00:53.930> substantial<00:00:54.620> amount<00:00:54.800> of

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
exercise with a substantial amount of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.350 
exercise with a substantial amount of
resistance<00:00:55.190> and<00:00:55.610> this<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:55.940> a<00:00:55.969> great<00:00:56.210> way<00:00:56.329> to

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
resistance and this is a great way to

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.840 
resistance and this is a great way to
activate<00:00:56.840> more<00:00:57.140> muscle<00:00:57.410> fibers<00:00:57.610> develop<00:00:58.610> real

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
activate more muscle fibers develop real

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.700 
activate more muscle fibers develop real
functional<00:00:59.390> strength<00:00:59.660> in<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.230> entire<00:01:00.469> upper

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
functional strength in the entire upper

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.549 
functional strength in the entire upper
body<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.579> this<00:01:01.879> one<00:01:02.059> now<00:01:02.840> we<00:01:02.870> see<00:01:03.110> we'll<00:01:03.350> need<00:01:03.469> a

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
body so this one now we see we'll need a

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.840 
body so this one now we see we'll need a
rag<00:01:03.770> for<00:01:03.980> I<00:01:04.039> have<00:01:04.189> the<00:01:04.250> did<00:01:04.399> belt<00:01:04.579> for<00:01:04.820> the

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
rag for I have the did belt for the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850 
rag for I have the did belt for the
plates<00:01:05.210> for<00:01:05.420> but<00:01:05.750> other<00:01:05.930> than<00:01:06.049> that<00:01:06.110> very

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
plates for but other than that very

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.160 
plates for but other than that very
little<00:01:07.070> quicker<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.330> what<00:01:08.780> this<00:01:08.869> can<00:01:09.049> look

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
little quicker so what this can look

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.469 
little quicker so what this can look
like<00:01:09.320> I've<00:01:09.920> got<00:01:09.979> four<00:01:10.610> plates<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:11.030> here<00:01:11.240> I

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
first when you get yourself a position

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.970 
first when you get yourself a position
here<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:26.150> like<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:26.930> set<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.290> plates<00:01:27.530> up<00:01:27.710> against

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
here I like to set the plates up against

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.960 
here I like to set the plates up against
something<00:01:28.220> so<00:01:28.520> that<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:29.560> position<00:01:33.700> yeah<00:01:34.700> it's

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
something so that the position yeah it's

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.840

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.040 
a position with a belt on your lower
back<00:01:37.940> just<00:01:38.120> like<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.540> would<00:01:38.660> with<00:01:38.690> if<00:01:38.930> you're

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
back just like you would with if you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.390 
back just like you would with if you're
doing<00:01:39.260> mention<00:01:39.650> of<00:01:39.740> Surgeons

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
doing mention of Surgeons

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.460 
doing mention of Surgeons
the<00:01:40.970> next<00:01:41.240> step<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:43.150> to<00:01:44.150> get<00:01:44.330> these<00:01:44.780> plate<00:01:45.080> this

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
the next step is to get these plate this

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.130 
the next step is to get these plate this
weight<00:01:45.710> build<00:01:45.950> up<00:01:46.130> higher<00:01:46.370> on<00:01:46.400> your<00:01:46.670> back<00:01:47.140> so

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
weight build up higher on your back so

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.100 
weight build up higher on your back so

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
change the movement a little bit too

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.400 
change the movement a little bit too
much<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.630> when<00:01:59.750> you<00:01:59.810> get<00:01:59.900> the<00:01:59.990> weight<00:02:00.140> in<00:02:00.259> your

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
much so when you get the weight in your

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.620 
much so when you get the weight in your
mid<00:02:01.310> to<00:02:01.460> upper<00:02:01.700> back<00:02:01.880> it's<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.270> much<00:02:02.450> better

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
mid to upper back it's a much better

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.490 
mid to upper back it's a much better
feel<00:02:03.619> not<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.040> exercise<00:02:04.280> so<00:02:05.119> get<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.140> there

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
feel not the exercise so get that there

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.090 
feel not the exercise so get that there
get<00:02:06.860> your<00:02:06.979> hands<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.060> rail<00:02:11.800> now<00:02:12.800> your

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
get your hands on that rail now your

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.120 
get your hands on that rail now your
position<00:02:13.190> where<00:02:13.730> you<00:02:13.790> can<00:02:13.880> get<00:02:13.970> one<00:02:15.130> say

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
position where you can get one say

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:41.080 
position where you can get one say
better<00:02:16.340> your<00:02:16.940> abs<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:17.720> go

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.309 

so<00:02:42.310> movement<00:02:43.720> next<00:02:44.720> time<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:45.020> we've<00:02:45.170> used

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
so movement next time that we've used

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.199 
so movement next time that we've used
less<00:02:45.560> weight<00:02:45.770> because<00:02:46.670> that<00:02:46.819> was<00:02:46.910> only<00:02:47.030> two

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
less weight because that was only two

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.380 
less weight because that was only two
reps<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:48.130> obviously<00:02:49.130> we<00:02:49.220> want<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.459> go<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.970> bit

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
reps and obviously we want to go a bit

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.850 
reps and obviously we want to go a bit
higher<00:02:50.720> reps<00:02:50.959> I<00:02:51.050> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.260> want<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.500> push<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.770> to

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
higher reps I kind of want to push it to

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.470 
higher reps I kind of want to push it to
see<00:02:52.040> how<00:02:52.130> much<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:52.489> do<00:02:52.670> on<00:02:52.819> this

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
see how much I can do on this

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.040 
see how much I can do on this
let's<00:02:53.989> get<00:02:54.110> pretty<00:02:54.380> close<00:02:54.500> to<00:02:54.709> work<00:02:55.030> so<00:02:56.050> I'll

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
let's get pretty close to work so I'll

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.509 
let's get pretty close to work so I'll
do<00:02:57.200> another<00:02:57.319> set<00:02:57.650> here<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.220> second

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
do another set here in the second

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.309 
do another set here in the second
