00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
good for VPAP and pfr but for ats I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.630 
good for VPAP and pfr but for ats I
wouldn't<00:01:18.180> give<00:01:18.360> ATS<00:01:19.229> specific<00:01:19.920> purpose<00:01:20.340> ition

yet<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.090> think<00:01:21.299> over<00:01:21.689> 400<00:01:22.080> hands<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.530> just

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
yet I think over 400 hands I would just

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
yet I think over 400 hands I would just
use<00:01:22.890> overall<00:01:23.460> ATS<00:01:23.939> which<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.390> assuming<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
use overall ATS which I'm assuming is

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.910 
use overall ATS which I'm assuming is
not<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.610> 22%<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.259> fold<00:01:28.259> verse<00:01:28.439> 3<00:01:28.710> bet

so<00:01:53.490> when<00:01:53.640> money<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.000> show<00:01:54.270> down<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> 36%<00:01:55.229> so

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
so when money is show down to 36% so

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
so when money is show down to 36% so
this<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.030> doesn't<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.450> mean<00:01:57.689> much<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.049> me

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this just doesn't really mean much to me

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.380 
this just doesn't really mean much to me
because<00:01:58.320> someone<00:01:58.829> who's<00:01:58.979> running<00:01:59.280> 1310<00:02:00.000> over

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
because someone who's running 1310 over

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.330 
because someone who's running 1310 over
400<00:02:00.810> hands<00:02:01.170> isn't<00:02:01.530> really<00:02:01.860> gonna<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> show

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
400 hands isn't really gonna get to show

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.920 
400 hands isn't really gonna get to show
that<00:02:02.490> very<00:02:02.729> often<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.420> number<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.719> gonna

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that very often so that number is gonna

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.679 
that very often so that number is gonna
be<00:02:04.079> like<00:02:04.409> massively<00:02:05.340> massively<00:02:05.610> variable<00:02:06.479> and

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
be like massively massively variable and

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.570 
be like massively massively variable and
I<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.110> don't<00:02:07.350> even<00:02:07.530> look<00:02:07.799> at<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
I just don't even look at it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.250 
I just don't even look at it
so<00:02:09.030> that's<00:02:09.570> more<00:02:09.750> important<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.170> you're

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
so that's more important if you're

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.880 
so that's more important if you're
planning<00:02:10.410> if<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.710> guy<00:02:10.830> was<00:02:11.010> like<00:02:11.360> 86<00:02:12.360> 62<00:02:13.200> right

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
planning if the guy was like 86 62 right

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.370 
planning if the guy was like 86 62 right
over<00:02:14.220> that<00:02:14.340> same<00:02:14.610> 377<00:02:15.570> hands<00:02:15.750> that<00:02:16.110> dudes

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
over that same 377 hands that dudes

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.470 
over that same 377 hands that dudes
gonna<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> ton<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.340> showdowns<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.240> thus

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
gonna see a ton of showdowns and thus

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.700 
gonna see a ton of showdowns and thus
it's<00:02:18.660> gonna<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.960> more<00:02:19.200> important<00:02:19.530> it's<00:02:19.620> gonna

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
it's gonna be more important it's gonna

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.140 
it's gonna be more important it's gonna
converge<00:02:20.160> quicker<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.850> with<00:02:21.030> this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
converge quicker but with this

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.780 
converge quicker but with this
particular<00:02:21.330> guy<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:22.290> gonna<00:02:22.500> happen<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.640> what

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
particular guy not gonna happen so what

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.220 
particular guy not gonna happen so what

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
but I want you to think for a moment

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.210 
but I want you to think for a moment
about<00:04:02.700> cyma<00:04:03.360> think<00:04:04.200> about<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.620> hands<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.130> this

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
about cyma think about the hands of this

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.240 
about cyma think about the hands of this
person<00:04:05.280> probably<00:04:05.970> has<00:04:06.239> wood<00:04:07.140> this<00:04:07.380> person<00:04:07.860> for

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
person probably has wood this person for

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.250 
person probably has wood this person for
that<00:04:08.280> preflop<00:04:08.880> with<00:04:09.150> kings<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.630> queens<00:04:09.720> I

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
that preflop with kings and queens I

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.229 
that preflop with kings and queens I
think<00:04:10.920> so<00:04:11.100> I<00:04:11.280> think<00:04:11.370> that's<00:04:11.640> that's<00:04:11.880> pretty

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
think so I think that's that's pretty

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.650 
think so I think that's that's pretty
fair<00:04:12.630> to<00:04:12.660> say<00:04:13.340> would<00:04:14.340> they<00:04:14.700> 4-bit<00:04:15.360> preflop

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
fair to say would they 4-bit preflop

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.529 
fair to say would they 4-bit preflop
attends<00:04:16.109> maybe<00:04:16.919> not<00:04:17.220> so<00:04:17.669> let's<00:04:18.090> just<00:04:18.270> say<00:04:18.390> that

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
attends maybe not so let's just say that

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.199 
attends maybe not so let's just say that
they<00:04:18.630> can<00:04:18.930> have<00:04:19.049> full<00:04:19.380> combination

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
they can have full combination

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.090 
they can have full combination
of<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> tens<00:04:20.660> boat<00:04:20.989> okay<00:04:21.620> I<00:04:21.739> think<00:04:21.949> that's

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
of the tens boat okay I think that's

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.980 
of the tens boat okay I think that's
pretty<00:04:22.430> fair<00:04:22.639> to<00:04:22.699> say<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.030> there's<00:04:23.449> a<00:04:23.600> whopping

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
pretty fair to say so there's a whopping

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.260 
pretty fair to say so there's a whopping
three<00:04:24.050> combos<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:25.009> did<00:04:25.699> it<00:04:25.819> have<00:04:25.940> runner

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
three combos of that did it have runner

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.090 
three combos of that did it have runner
quads<00:04:26.690> probably<00:04:27.440> not<00:04:27.590> I<00:04:27.620> don't<00:04:27.800> think<00:04:27.889> this

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
quads probably not I don't think this

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.710 
quads probably not I don't think this
person<00:04:28.430> was<00:04:28.460> calling<00:04:28.789> pocket<00:04:29.270> eights<00:04:29.449> when

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
person was calling pocket eights when

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.620 
person was calling pocket eights when
the<00:04:29.840> board<00:04:30.080> comes<00:04:30.410> like<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.800> on<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.069> flop<00:04:31.630> so

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
the board comes like that on the flop so

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.379 
the board comes like that on the flop so
we're<00:04:32.840> really<00:04:33.110> talking<00:04:33.530> about<00:04:33.979> three<00:04:34.729> combos

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
we're really talking about three combos

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.900 
we're really talking about three combos
of<00:04:35.419> Nut<00:04:35.810> hands<00:04:36.289> and<00:04:36.740> then<00:04:36.919> my<00:04:37.039> question<00:04:37.280> is<00:04:37.639> is

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
of Nut hands and then my question is is

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.689 
of Nut hands and then my question is is
there<00:04:38.210> even<00:04:38.509> like<00:04:38.599> one<00:04:39.199> combo<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.889> ace<00:04:40.099> king<00:04:40.490> he

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:40.699 
there even like one combo of ace king he

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:43.689 
there even like one combo of ace king he
could<00:04:40.880> have<00:04:41.030> here<00:04:41.270> well<00:04:42.259> yeah<00:04:42.919> probably

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:43.699 
could have here well yeah probably

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:46.719 
could have here well yeah probably
in<00:04:44.330> which<00:04:44.479> case<00:04:44.690> cool<00:04:45.169> let's<00:04:45.590> get<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.860> in<00:04:45.979> right

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
in which case cool let's get it in right

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:48.879 
in which case cool let's get it in right
because<00:04:47.030> we're<00:04:47.509> getting<00:04:47.569> three<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:47.960> one<00:04:48.139> we've

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
because we're getting three to one we've

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.070 
because we're getting three to one we've
already<00:04:49.220> found<00:04:49.490> at<00:04:49.880> least<00:04:50.300> one<00:04:50.599> combo<00:04:50.990> of

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
already found at least one combo of

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.350 
already found at least one combo of
something<00:04:51.949> that<00:04:52.160> he'll<00:04:52.340> jam<00:04:52.669> here<00:04:52.940> that's<00:04:53.150> not

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
something that he'll jam here that's not

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.510 
something that he'll jam here that's not
just<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.840> nuts<00:04:54.080> and<00:04:54.710> we<00:04:54.979> beat<00:04:55.220> everything

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
just the nuts and we beat everything

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.550 
just the nuts and we beat everything
that's<00:04:55.789> not<00:04:55.940> just<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.330> nuts<00:04:56.509> so<00:04:56.750> this<00:04:57.320> is<00:04:57.470> the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
that's not just the nuts so this is the

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.680 
that's not just the nuts so this is the
kind<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.770> situation<00:04:58.280> where<00:04:58.430> we<00:04:58.880> need<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.539> be

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
kind of situation where we need to be

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.960 
kind of situation where we need to be
getting<00:04:59.840> this<00:05:00.229> inside<00:05:00.740> we<00:05:01.160> need<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.820> be

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
getting this inside we need to be

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.270 
getting this inside we need to be
calling<00:05:02.300> here<00:05:02.780> honestly<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.740> just<00:05:03.919> would<00:05:04.220> have

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
shoved the river myself I wouldn't have

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.320 
shoved the river myself I wouldn't have
even<00:05:06.020> checked<00:05:06.470> there<00:05:06.710> I<00:05:06.949> don't<00:05:07.759> understand

comes off but you know sometimes we get
into<00:05:12.770> that<00:05:12.949> mode<00:05:13.159> where<00:05:13.220> we're<00:05:13.669> acting<00:05:13.940> a

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
into that mode where we're acting a

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.520 
into that mode where we're acting a
little<00:05:14.240> too<00:05:14.360> fast<00:05:14.570> we<00:05:14.870> don't<00:05:15.050> slow<00:05:15.259> down<00:05:15.289> to

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
little too fast we don't slow down to

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.379 
little too fast we don't slow down to
think<00:05:15.710> about<00:05:15.919> it<00:05:16.070> we<00:05:16.130> just<00:05:16.340> go<00:05:16.460> oh<00:05:16.669> damn<00:05:17.090> it<00:05:17.240> why

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
think about it we just go oh damn it why

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:18.879 
think about it we just go oh damn it why
does<00:05:17.599> the<00:05:17.720> board<00:05:17.930> always<00:05:18.199> pair<00:05:18.470> whatever<00:05:18.770> we

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
does the board always pair whatever we

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:20.950 
does the board always pair whatever we
have<00:05:18.979> a<00:05:19.009> straight<00:05:19.430> blah<00:05:19.639> blah<00:05:19.759> blah<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.780> I

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
have a straight blah blah blah but I

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.210 
have a straight blah blah blah but I
think<00:05:21.199> if<00:05:21.259> we<00:05:21.349> slowed<00:05:21.620> down<00:05:21.800> for<00:05:22.099> a<00:05:22.130> minute

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
think if we slowed down for a minute

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.980 
think if we slowed down for a minute
we'd<00:05:22.490> see<00:05:22.639> okay<00:05:22.940> there<00:05:23.120> just<00:05:23.270> aren't<00:05:23.509> really<00:05:23.960> a

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
we'd see okay there just aren't really a

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.320 
we'd see okay there just aren't really a
ton<00:05:24.229> of<00:05:24.259> combos<00:05:24.800> of<00:05:24.830> hands<00:05:25.490> we<00:05:25.699> should<00:05:25.940> care

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
about in which case this is actually a

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.939 
about in which case this is actually a
very<00:05:28.970> very<00:05:29.270> easy<00:05:29.570> situation<00:05:30.080> for<00:05:30.530> us<00:05:30.560> to<00:05:30.740> jam
