this<00:00:19.850> motor<00:00:20.090> iPhone<00:00:20.420> interesting<00:00:20.960> issue<00:00:21.140> with

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
this motor iPhone interesting issue with

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.290 
this motor iPhone interesting issue with
it<00:00:21.590> this<00:00:21.800> one<00:00:21.949> actually<00:00:22.130> has<00:00:22.369> broken<00:00:22.699> refills

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
it this one actually has broken refills

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.080 
it this one actually has broken refills
and<00:00:23.630> then<00:00:24.520> first<00:00:25.520> time<00:00:25.699> I've<00:00:25.849> seen<00:00:26.029> that

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
and then first time I've seen that

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
and then first time I've seen that
problem<00:00:26.449> with<00:00:27.140> these<00:00:27.259> motors<00:00:27.820> but<00:00:28.930> found<00:00:29.930> in

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
problem with these motors but found in

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.150 
problem with these motors but found in
the<00:00:30.200> lumps<00:00:30.439> in<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.619> 915<00:00:31.579> no<00:00:32.540> problem<00:00:33.020> so

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
the lumps in the 915 no problem so

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.020 
the lumps in the 915 no problem so
able<00:00:34.340> to<00:00:34.370> revert

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
able to revert

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.410 
able to revert
so<00:00:36.450> we<00:00:36.600> got<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> running<00:00:36.990> pretty<00:00:37.230> good<00:00:41.300> I'm<00:00:42.300> not

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
so we got it running pretty good I'm not

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.150 
so we got it running pretty good I'm not
doing<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.720> standing<00:00:43.080> stop<00:00:43.380> start<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.010> because

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
doing a standing stop start here because

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.610 
doing a standing stop start here because
the<00:00:44.460> recoil<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.180> bit<00:00:45.540> stinky<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> guess<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.350> got

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the recoil is a bit stinky I guess I got

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.470 
the recoil is a bit stinky I guess I got
a<00:00:46.650> toiletry<00:00:47.640> setup<00:00:49.460> go<00:00:50.460> ahead<00:00:50.610> get<00:00:50.790> yourself<00:00:50.880> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
a toiletry setup go ahead get yourself a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.930 
a toiletry setup go ahead get yourself a
little<00:00:52.320> 7<00:00:52.680> perhaps<00:00:52.980> like<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> these<00:00:53.670> are<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
little 7 perhaps like this these are a

00:00:59.870 --> 00:00:59.880 
are really good power props has to be a

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.040 
are really good power props has to be a
little<00:01:00.000> bit<00:01:00.150> out<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.270> balance<00:01:00.450> in<00:01:00.720> this<00:01:00.900> one

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
little bit out of balance in this one

00:01:01.050 --> 00:02:26.770 
little bit out of balance in this one
but<00:01:01.260> these<00:01:01.950> motors<00:01:02.250> really<00:01:02.460> pushing<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.880> $10

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780

never<00:02:27.380> bent<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.860> prop<00:02:28.069> is<00:02:28.250> not<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> best

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
never bent the prop is not in the best

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.839 
never bent the prop is not in the best
shape<00:02:29.709> starts<00:02:30.709> vibration

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
shape starts vibration
