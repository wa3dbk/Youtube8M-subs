00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.560
 the dream 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.279
 hi guys but jonas and today i am 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.410
 showing you here a tutorial of the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:37.190
 blender in this class today I go 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.890
 to teach you how to make a house 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.809
 house is enough even here in our 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.230
 model of the first blender you go 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.190
 letting it incubate will increase with s 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.550
 or decrease we will give to the elite modem 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.030
 easy selection mode you will increase 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:58.879
 A little do not know you know me 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.039
 I will do so, they will only increase a little 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.079
 same 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.160
 I'll send an s to increase as well and 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.160
 they will go down a little 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.759
 you want and then a selection of 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.250
 edges selects these four hours 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.250
 here from on an f1 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 here you can now make our door 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.479
 can make our door 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:36.380
 could walk some cuts found r 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:38.890
 could give some cuts here in the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.890
 our door 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:50.439
 an ak walia can stay more or less 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:53.030
 here and another here on the side and another 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.399
 here selecting selection mode from 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.950
 faces of our party our door 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.759
 instruction backwards and I intend to 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.439
 others cross decreases and did not have the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.850
 mold our door is already 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.280
 created 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.000
 he called again we could create 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.320
 a window so that the window only gives a 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 against or 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.150
 can go out the way you do. 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 wants more of mine than I'll leave more - 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.489
 here a window I do not know 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.239
 of the same thing selects against one is 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.450
 back 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.780
 decreases the other is decreases and here they 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.150
 can give up here a little bit is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.659
 object Moorish suggests our door is 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.760
 created 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.489
 good that here at home is very basic even 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.519
 but if you want to give more details 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:55.140
 there in our house and could put what 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:57.359
 I could put you on the floor here 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.230
 can put me here what a plan 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:04.950
 some trees but that comes from maybe 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.209
 teaching in the next video-lessons I'm 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.709
 I'm going to create a plan here to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:14.250
 our home but what a case she has 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.879
 has a character a wall that increases a 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:21.510
 little that's ok 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:24.450
 She has a garage wall. 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.150
 She has a pool, so sign them up here. 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.780
 no way to create a pool also in 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.120
 So our house, what can we do? 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:40.169
 Why in the pool, could not it be? 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:47.120
 several cuts with the mouse ball 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:47.120
 can increase or decrease your cuts ok 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:56.010
 I'm going to leave but we are here and here too. 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.050
 I'll also let you cut good 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.400
 select where access to the pool 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.340
 instruction down 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:09.810
 mine will more or less dream these 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.349
 I'll give here but found r is also 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.480
 good 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.120
 my pool will still you can 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:26.430
 here as if it were a cycle one 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:28.560
 square even you can of instruction 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.389
 down but all offering all 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.800
 faces or even you can 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:38.850
 Accept your swimming pool in such a way 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.389
 that you want to renovate swimming pools 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.389
 round 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.420
 You're doing your swimming pool there. 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.420
 your house your way 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:02.610
 shaq selecting all the facts here 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.710
 I see here that she wants them 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.390
 they have a very round pool 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.360
 so when she has more or less 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.800
 so you want but you give a 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.590
 instruction down 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.000
 decrease instruction decrease extrusion 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:23.060
 decrease instruction decrease already 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.060
 officially founded as I do not know 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.320
 good football and here is our pool 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.900
 You want to give a better state 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:42.110
 you see in the legitimate mode differentiated 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:42.110
 all these facets here all even to 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.150
 selecting 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:56.400
 good rock 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.290
 now you see it here in monte verde 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.950
 I do not know how to do it here but you click 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:04.170
 here and I see in the football way of our 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:07.110
 pool of a better state in it because 

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:09.510
 without her looks like she's going to get one 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:12.060
 z control 

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.670
 This way you look better in another way for me. 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:19.170
 looks better with a non- greasy green glaze 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:22.860
 It's even better if you can see chain 

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:26.610
 in we full of enamel 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.970
 good now, now it 's ok now that 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:35.300
 would be to put a water that something 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:42.240
 in the same list to give a better state 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:56.040
 video lessons that a door found is the 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:07:00.260
 pa - here I will leave here is not to diminish 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.300
 with sda one is diminished uece boy is 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.300
 two doors do not 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:12.480
 Two bridges, one good one at the window is 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:14.430
 rather than a window a selection of 

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.730
 edges and not be this morning a little 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.730
 here 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.410
 It's great or good. 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.210
 So, what was my class? 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.540
 pool house then I can not 

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:35.660
 Teach you how to texturize I'll see 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:38.540
 one should do I do now as a life 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.430
 texturize so I'm finishing my 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:42.050
 violate here if you like a 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:45.730
 young that will help a lot in my 

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:45.730
 channel and thank you
