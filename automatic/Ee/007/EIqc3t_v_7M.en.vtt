00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
a MIDI controller my favorite part about

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.179 
a MIDI controller my favorite part about
this<00:01:54.780> project<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.470> can<00:01:55.680> easily

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
this project is that you can easily

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.730 
this project is that you can easily
upload<00:01:56.520> new<00:01:56.820> samples<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> recharge<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.409> lipo

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
upload new samples and recharge the lipo

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.370 
upload new samples and recharge the lipo

so<00:02:02.380> there<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.950> have<00:02:02.980> it<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.400> compact

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
so there you have it a compact

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.520 
so there you have it a compact
all-in-one<00:02:04.660> soundboard<00:02:05.230> it's<00:02:05.470> really<00:02:06.100> loud

all-in-one soundboard it's really loud
supports<00:02:08.530> WAV<00:02:08.800> samples<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.610> OGG<00:02:09.940> Vorbis<00:02:10.420> you

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
supports WAV samples and OGG Vorbis you

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.270 
supports WAV samples and OGG Vorbis you
can<00:02:10.810> play<00:02:10.960> around<00:02:11.200> with<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:11.410> bunch<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:11.830> samples

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
can play around with a bunch of samples

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.880 
can play around with a bunch of samples
or<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.460> really<00:02:13.090> few<00:02:13.480> high<00:02:13.750> quality<00:02:14.230> audio<00:02:14.410> clips
