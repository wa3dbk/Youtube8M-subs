00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 it's not me it's a character did 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.639
 he is a character 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:12.759
 then the toilet 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.589
 there I mean the truth of everyday life 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:15.969
 the orders at the ro 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.300
 if no witnesses 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.519
 we do not wash our hands 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:23.519
 Quebec and its cabin tour 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.259
 according to which live bullets and work 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.810
 6 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.670
 it's not okay 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.670
 that's why I have soul 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.450
 he looks I see myself very well 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.730
 this former president of reporters 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 because you are subscribed to the second you are so his level 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150
 above men 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.540
 much worse 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.420
 and especially 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.530
 six times more than he does 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.530
 do not believe everyone to go make photocopies by that 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.400
 and if all the members of the eu 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
 you take 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 a gala 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.430
 a ditch 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.810
 the hours clause goes faster 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.130
 and as a bigard 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.590
 all other activists 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.660
 you arrive by the picnic ceiling academic affairs 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
 no one sees anyway for the riders 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.990
 first exchange of a woman ready to the grass she cleans everything and the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
 readings while weaving 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.500
 we believe it's still late that would be the release without the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.510
 disturb people still believe in windows tasks but so long 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.780
 they were 650 positions is lived 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 at the base you should not expect a lot of character 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.009
 rose petals 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.460
 to this of the whole 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.570
 scented candles 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.830
 he was the son of god this debate with pictures of girlfriends 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.430
 in other words, decoration magazines is that you are right 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.229
 it's good time for me 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.229
 far from everyday worries 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.469
 I was invited to the bistro 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.309
 Why 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.309
 m 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.419
 the sarkozy chair is composed carla browned pregnant as she 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:41.419
 despite some rooms 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.159
 m 

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:51.629
 my father contrary to the opportune moment 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:54.709
 because for many 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:57.709
 maybe but that is to say 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.389
 which lovers of good music 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:19.029
 it is the doping products October to October 30 hears very well 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:22.029
 so 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.279
 by what 

00:03:24.279 --> 00:03:27.279
 20 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.700
 On the other hand 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.230
 and it's still the same bank 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.370
 earlier in the day 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.729
 you can be reached 24 hours a day everywhere 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:40.729
 it's always important that we spread in the midst of reflection and change 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.019
 down 2 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.179
 the ump 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:50.709
 a ton of wheat or the phone that rings at the ankle the game 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:54.869
 Yes and so 

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:58.199
 be careful not to carry just 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.769
 the project is ferrand because his polling station 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.730
 a question I'm talking about not to go to the trap at this time 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.979
 these works helped to create 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.979
 at the base of the contracts before the sale 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:15.599
 we are people who are scandalized in the vault 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.449
 from ottawa to morocco 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.900
 when I never suggested you imagine them 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.770
 several ngos and the army 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.370
 reindeer just to manage it 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.409
 However 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:32.179
 the two men meet expectations the doves report was ransacked 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.789
 cyclists for no head 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.470
 you're not in the office it's pal 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.349
 the horror 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.349
 it's their appetite for the contents of the coffee machine 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.689
 do not push 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.349
 I do not know what his office is called joining the team 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:56.450
 is called gerard dubuisson 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.450
 the man who has a killing machine instead of the client 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:03.990
 relationships are now growing more than just patrols 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.749
 we all used 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:11.199
 jackson in I tell you without neglecting like Swiss watches 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:13.749
 they all have their intervention 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:16.739
 at 2:15 everyone watches his watch what everyone knows that 

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:17.650
 14 hours of play 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.650
 the three letters without remorse the sea 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:25.439
 at 14 years old 3d yellow streamers police said the state is going 

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.930
 bring 3 meters 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.889
 the little guy on the door a little more the products on a stretcher with 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:32.150
 an oxygen mask 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.110
 paramedics who land in the east 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.139
 it's simple and that's what is achieved 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:37.999
 and sam 

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:40.419
 you found the cause of the blast 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:43.419
 and I think this project is not realistic 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.259
 in addition to the wound return spring 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.620
 porsche in the corridors in more beautiful effect and then I have not rethought 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:53.619
 complained 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.259
 in his reading 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.619
 the night of the party with him they went down to the parking lot repeating in a 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:01.030
 squat with puppet 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.030
 in vain 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:07.819
 waiting for the jackson estate to talk about it 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.060
 when the helpers arrived because of the water of the expense and who were 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.060
 on track 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.389
 in this sketch of the country that reaches to say what 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.849
 ask the question what is it to say what 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.159
 today we are on the verge of claude allÃ¨gre 

00:06:26.159 --> 00:06:28.550
 we send robots on march 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.110
 it's been 40 years since we walked on the moon 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.429
 but we can still not piss in a clean place
