00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello with you smartphone and on the test with us 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.460
 prestige multipad 2 pro duo 70 is 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.650
 tablet up to $ 127 s &amp; p with display 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.900
 dual core gigabyte processor 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 RAM and battery on 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.560
 4000 milliamp-hours 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.830
 and here is how all this is arranged as 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.269
 working together we'll talk further 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 tablet delivery complemented 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.090
 network cable charger 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.970
 microusb 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.900
 various documentation as well as stylish 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.239
 leather case 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.489
 given the low cost of the tablet 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.190
 case in my opinion looks nice 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.530
 bonus user sorry of course that is not 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.570
 it turned out to add a cable yusb tiji 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.969
 because the corresponding function on board 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.020
 present device despite 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.270
 low price 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 The dominant body material is 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.070
 the metal is made of it the rest 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.629
 panels plus partially lateral edges 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 and here is the front side completely 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.670
 covered with glass of course it is not 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.100
 about gorilla voice or alternative 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.260
 solution but in practice this glass is easy 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.229
 can withstand even friction with the edge of a coin 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.939
 agree that pretty well apart from 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.830
 glass and metal in the case there and 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.350
 plastic but unlike many others 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.630
 tablets in this price range in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.700
 plastic enclosures dominate in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.590
 considered baby of it only 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.650
 thin bezel front panel 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.080
 no more than build quality claims 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 does not cause quite a good fit 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.880
 all elements on the front panel besides 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 Of course, the display itself is located 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.840
 peephole front camera vj camera with 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.750
 the opposite side opens 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.600
 access to the main 2 megapixel here 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.560
 same implemented output built-in speaker 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.720
 at the top 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.820
 if you hold the frontal tablet 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.399
 the camera on the right is the key 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.960
 sound volume control and also 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.079
 power on button 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.720
 tablet on the right side is equipped 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 classic connector 3 5 millimeters and with 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 opposite user panel 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.409
 gets access to the micro sd fleet 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.550
 as well as the classic port microusb and 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.390
 built-in microphone 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.790
 7 inch ips resolution display 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.800
 1280 by 800 points and support 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.410
 touch control using 5 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.900
 fingers simultaneously with sensitivity 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.660
 all good viewing angles can be called 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.970
 mean but extinction during work 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.690
 in bright sunlight above 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.260
 middle 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.050
 although the data remains readable 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.550
 manual backlight adjustment only 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 The manufacturer announced about 8 gigabytes 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.630
 built-in user memory 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.810
 however in practice and and somewhat less 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.120
 total about 6 gigabyte extension 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.850
 regular volume provided by the cards 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.670
 micro-sd memory up to 32 gigabytes 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.740
 inclusive built-in sound volume 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.050
 dynamics multipad 2 pro duo 70 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.450
 quite high but accompanied 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.670
 distortions if you want to see 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.490
 the film without having to go to the headphones 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.190
 you will succeed but personally I would still 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.990
 used an accessory 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.000
 4000 built-in battery capacity 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.220
 milliamper hours before you results 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.239
 testing autonomy through 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.160
 utilities battery go 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.170
 multipad 2 pro duo 70 works under 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.290
 operating system android 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.090
 4 1 1 out of the box about updating the OS to 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.370
 more current release until it is not 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.989
 This situation is going to me personally 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.959
 seems unlikely 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.970
 Although for a 127 dollar tablet 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.910
 even this android release looks 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.890
 interesting results before you 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.360
 performance testing 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.000
 hardware inside dual core processor 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.060
 rmk rt exo 9 which clock frequency 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.180
 one and a half gigahertz and 1 gigabyte 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.340
 RAM and graphics mali 400 m3 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.500
 regarding wireless modules 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.930
 interface in note wifi and wi-fi 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.420
 dork and weepin ' and stuff 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.470
 in addition, the connection is maintained and 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.690
 make and g 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:59.820
 although as we remember the delivery 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.820
 the tablet is devoid of the cable of the same name 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.470
 if you need a compact tablet with 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.990
 quite good iron and performance 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.610
 and ps display and option 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:10.500
 connecting external devices 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.260
 but you are limited in money 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.240
 prestigio multipad 2 pro duo 70 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.660
 interesting candidate for closer 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.660
 dating
