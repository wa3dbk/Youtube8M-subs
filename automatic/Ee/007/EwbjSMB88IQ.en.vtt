a<00:00:08.460> above<00:00:09.120> ground<00:00:09.450> in<00:00:09.780> portal<00:00:10.230> seed<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.710> that's

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
a above ground in portal seed and that's

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.160 
a above ground in portal seed and that's
what<00:00:11.820> I'm<00:00:11.969> actually<00:00:12.269> standing<00:00:12.690> on<00:00:12.990> right

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
what I'm actually standing on right

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
what I'm actually standing on right
outside<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.710> can<00:00:13.860> see<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.219> is<00:00:14.370> above<00:00:14.730> ground

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
outside you can see it is above ground

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.330 
outside you can see it is above ground
well<00:00:15.269> it's<00:00:15.450> actually<00:00:15.870> above<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.710> water<00:00:16.980> but

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
well it's actually above the water but

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.340 
well it's actually above the water but
it's<00:00:17.820> technically<00:00:18.330> above<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> ground<00:00:18.930> in<00:00:19.170> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
it's technically above the ground in I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.050 
it's technically above the ground in I
guess<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:19.650> could<00:00:19.680> consider<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.850> a

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
guess you could consider this a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.269 
guess you could consider this a
above-ground<00:00:21.660> stronghold<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.380> well<00:00:22.949> but<00:00:23.130> it's

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
above-ground stronghold as well but it's

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.130 
above-ground stronghold as well but it's
definitely<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.910> much<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.480> above-ground

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
definitely not as much of a above-ground

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
definitely not as much of a above-ground
stronghold<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:27.060> showcased

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
rooms over there but you're like what

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
rooms over there but you're like what
the<00:01:40.409> heck<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.799> around<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.490> there's<00:01:41.759> no

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
the heck is around there there's no

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.550 
the heck is around there there's no
stronghold<00:01:42.630> around<00:01:42.899> there<00:01:43.079> but<00:01:43.229> if<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.439> look

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
stronghold around there but if you look

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
stronghold around there but if you look
over<00:01:43.740> here<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.670> rest<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.119> strongholds

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
over here the rest of the strongholds

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.179 
over here the rest of the strongholds
actually<00:01:46.049> over<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.470> so<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.920> can<00:01:47.040> see

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
actually over here so as you can see

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.249 
actually over here so as you can see
there's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.640> library<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.570> stuff<00:01:49.020> like<00:01:49.200> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
there's the library and stuff like that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.730 
there's the library and stuff like that
but<00:01:49.500> um<00:01:50.450> there<00:01:51.450> is<00:01:51.659> one<00:01:52.079> thing<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
but um there is one thing that is

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.010 
but um there is one thing that is
connected<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.880> end<00:01:54.149> portal<00:01:54.479> room<00:01:54.720> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
connected to this end portal room and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.170 
connected to this end portal room and
it's<00:01:55.350> right<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.430> there<00:01:56.610> I'd<00:01:56.790> dug<00:01:57.000> down

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
it's right here right there I'd dug down

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.569 
it's right here right there I'd dug down
wrong<00:01:57.450> betta<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.680> stand<00:01:59.159> right<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.490> front

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
wrong betta if you stand right in front

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
wrong betta if you stand right in front
of<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.880> sylvers<00:02:00.210> fish<00:02:00.479> pond<00:02:00.810> or<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.350> step

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
of the sylvers fish pond or so this step

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.010 
of the sylvers fish pond or so this step
right<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.490> dig<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.840> all

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
right here you dig down and don't go all

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.499 
right here you dig down and don't go all
the<00:02:04.170> way<00:02:04.200> down<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.399> should<00:02:05.729> break<00:02:06.060> into

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the way down but you should break into

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.440 
the way down but you should break into
this<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.469> you'll<00:02:08.069> break<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.700> this<00:02:08.910> abandoned

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
this so you'll break into this abandoned

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.240 
this so you'll break into this abandoned
mine<00:02:09.569> shaft<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.259> abandoned<00:02:10.770> mineshaft

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
mine shaft and this abandoned mineshaft

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.400 
mine shaft and this abandoned mineshaft
I'm<00:02:11.640> pretty<00:02:12.510> sure

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I'm pretty sure

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
I'm pretty sure
if<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:14.010> was<00:02:14.190> right<00:02:14.430> from<00:02:14.640> looking<00:02:14.970> at<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.210> x-ray

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
if I was right from looking at the x-ray

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630 
if I was right from looking at the x-ray
glitch<00:02:15.780> whenever<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.230> did<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.680> originally<00:02:17.160> like

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
glitch whenever I did it originally like

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.020 
glitch whenever I did it originally like
let's<00:02:18.240> see<00:02:18.390> let's<00:02:18.660> do<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:19.050> right<00:02:19.700> hey<00:02:20.700> let's<00:02:20.880> do

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
let's see let's do it right hey let's do

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.180 
let's see let's do it right hey let's do
right<00:02:21.270> here<00:02:21.570> see<00:02:21.900> if<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.050> can<00:02:22.200> see<00:02:22.470> it<00:02:22.500> I'm

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
right here see if we can see it I'm

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.010 
right here see if we can see it I'm
pretty<00:02:23.760> sure<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.090> does<00:02:24.330> connect<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
pretty sure it does connect to the

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.920 
pretty sure it does connect to the
stronghold<00:02:25.260> somehow<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:27.090> yet<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.840> can

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
stronghold somehow like a yet as you can

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.300 
stronghold somehow like a yet as you can
see<00:02:28.110> over<00:02:28.350> there<00:02:28.500> there's<00:02:28.830> more<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.220> the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
see over there there's more of the

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
see over there there's more of the
abandoned<00:02:29.790> mine<00:02:29.820> shaft<00:02:30.210> there's<00:02:30.540> more<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
abandoned mine shaft there's more the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.220 
abandoned mine shaft there's more the
stronghold<00:02:31.650> as<00:02:31.860> well<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.570> pretty<00:02:33.780> sure<00:02:34.050> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
stronghold as well so I'm pretty sure it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.590 
stronghold as well so I'm pretty sure it
does<00:02:34.530> connect<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.340> know<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.730> haven't<00:02:36.120> explored

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
does connect you know I haven't explored

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.930 
does connect you know I haven't explored
all<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> don't<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:38.130> about<00:02:38.520> that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
fortress bullets go over here to this

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.860 
fortress bullets go over here to this
ravine<00:02:51.600> now<00:02:52.080> this<00:02:52.230> ravine<00:02:52.590> is<00:02:52.770> located<00:02:53.490> at<00:02:53.870> X

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
ravine now this ravine is located at X

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.430 
ravine now this ravine is located at X
of<00:02:55.290> 32<00:02:55.710> YF<00:02:56.250> 68<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.060> z<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.720> 33<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.350> it's

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
of 32 YF 68 and z of 33 and it's

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840 
of 32 YF 68 and z of 33 and it's
actually<00:02:58.710> really<00:02:58.920> close<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.460> above

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
actually really close to the above

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.300 
actually really close to the above
ground<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.300> Portal<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:01.740> might<00:03:01.920> play<00:03:02.130> now

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
ground in Portal but you might play now

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.980 
ground in Portal but you might play now
that's<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.760> normal<00:03:03.060> looking<00:03:03.300> ravine<00:03:03.810> but

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
that's just a normal looking ravine but

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.930 
that's just a normal looking ravine but
if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.410> down<00:03:04.590> here<00:03:04.890> you'd<00:03:05.070> let<00:03:05.430> us<00:03:05.580> say<00:03:05.730> it

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
if you go down here you'd let us say it

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.800 
if you go down here you'd let us say it
connects<00:03:06.270> to<00:03:06.360> ya<00:03:07.140> another<00:03:07.500> ravine<00:03:07.950> but<00:03:08.220> um

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
connects to ya another ravine but um

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.780 
connects to ya another ravine but um
what's<00:03:09.810> so<00:03:09.990> special<00:03:10.050> about<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.740> ravine<00:03:11.190> eskimo

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
what's so special about a ravine eskimo

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.210 
what's so special about a ravine eskimo
well<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.600> fact<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.020> it<00:03:13.230> connects<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.740> even

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
well the fact that it connects to even

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.880 
well the fact that it connects to even
more<00:03:14.400> ravines<00:03:14.790> uh<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.350> guess<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.860> could

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
more ravines uh it's I guess you could

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.670 
more ravines uh it's I guess you could
sit<00:03:17.310> consider<00:03:17.910> this<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.420> quad<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.870> ravine<00:03:19.410> so

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
sit consider this a quad a ravine so

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.710 
sit consider this a quad a ravine so
it's<00:03:19.830> really<00:03:20.130> awesome<00:03:20.450> definitely<00:03:21.450> really

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
it's really awesome definitely really

give<00:05:06.100> the<00:05:06.220> coordinates<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.700> those<00:05:06.910> diamonds

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
give the coordinates of those diamonds

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.660 
give the coordinates of those diamonds
really<00:05:07.510> quickly<00:05:07.870> so<00:05:07.900> um<00:05:08.350> here's<00:05:09.340> three

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
really quickly so um here's three

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.540 
really quickly so um here's three
diamonds<00:05:09.940> it's<00:05:10.420> north<00:05:11.020> of<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.470> above<00:05:12.340> ground

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
diamonds it's north of the above ground

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.640 
diamonds it's north of the above ground
nether<00:05:13.000> portal<00:05:13.480> or<00:05:13.750> not<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.200> above<00:05:14.440> ground

nether portal or not the above ground
another<00:05:14.830> programmer<00:05:15.400> but<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:15.790> above<00:05:16.000> ground

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
another programmer but the above ground

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.210 
another programmer but the above ground
in<00:05:16.450> portal<00:05:16.780> but<00:05:16.930> um<00:05:17.170> the<00:05:17.710> coordinates<00:05:18.130> to

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
in portal but um the coordinates to

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.340 
in portal but um the coordinates to
these<00:05:18.640> diamonds<00:05:19.120> are<00:05:19.270> X<00:05:19.540> of<00:05:19.750> negative<00:05:20.110> fifty
