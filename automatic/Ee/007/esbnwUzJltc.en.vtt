 ambitious young man who counts well 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
 conquer the capital because he thinks 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.070
 to be a dream physicist and a talent 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:33.149

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 as you could still talk to me 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.530
 otherwise is there any chance of arriving at 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.380
 something with his ego 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.600
 oversized rhetorical question one 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.520
 is there to make fun of his mouth but 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.560
 he seems convinced of his 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.900
 importance and stands in 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.300
 discussion our terraces jean soir 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.610
 that I know I know it's weird to me 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.600
 to see in real life is quite disturbing 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.970
 in front of the light like that we would have 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.420
 almost afraid of getting burned in reality the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.960
 it's god we just got a little bit 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.180
 on top like that these girls do not hesitate 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.540
 not to be compared to god in front of these 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.270

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.280
 [Music] 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.030

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.890
 people like me who are made for 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.260
 to interpose his grace and if you were to 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.380
 to define a quality of the biggest 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.580
 qualities what you can extend 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.630

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:01.840
 realistic pressures to you 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.250

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.630
 so much to counter comes up bid 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.790
 by his arrogance in deciding to 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.220
