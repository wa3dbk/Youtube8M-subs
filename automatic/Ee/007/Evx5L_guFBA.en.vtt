00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
working our way across and supporting

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:34.930 
working our way across and supporting
the<00:01:22.320> big<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.570> have<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:25.040> press

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.580 

I'm<00:01:35.360> not<00:01:35.510> going<00:01:35.690> to<00:01:35.720> scan<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:35.990> clip<00:01:36.380> right

I'm not going to scan a clip right

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.990 
I'm not going to scan a clip right
across<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.100> that's<00:01:37.220> going<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.550> put<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.729> lot<00:01:37.909> of

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
across so that's going to put a lot of

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.210 
across so that's going to put a lot of
pressure<00:01:38.180> on<00:01:38.510> the<00:01:38.690> on<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:39.560> blood<00:01:39.740> vessels<00:01:40.130> and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
pressure on the on the blood vessels and

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:49.789 
pressure on the on the blood vessels and
nerves<00:01:40.930> this<00:01:41.930> way<00:01:42.200> I'm<00:01:42.620> avoiding<00:01:43.100> hurting<00:01:43.490> her

mighty Eunice see that I'm just
progressing<00:02:02.280> through<00:02:03.319> and<00:02:05.360> when<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> beak<00:02:06.630> is

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
progressing through and when a beak is

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.550 
progressing through and when a beak is
this<00:02:06.960> long

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
this long

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.070 
this long
very<00:02:07.799> often<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.190> quick<00:02:08.629> extends<00:02:09.629> down<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> big

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.490 
some birds are more receptive to
communication<00:03:00.120> than<00:03:00.270> others

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500

this<00:03:01.980> for<00:03:02.160> birdie<00:03:02.190> has<00:03:02.580> been<00:03:02.819> through<00:03:03.000> this

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
this for birdie has been through this

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:15.140 
this for birdie has been through this
process<00:03:03.300> before<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:07.190> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.270 

it's<00:03:15.750> getting<00:03:16.049> up<00:03:16.140> to<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:19.280> making

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
it's getting up to there now making

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.330 
it's getting up to there now making
progress<00:03:20.549> I<00:03:24.349> see<00:03:25.349> when<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.709> come<00:03:25.890> across<00:03:26.010> on

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
progress I see when I come across on

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.630 
progress I see when I come across on
this<00:03:26.430> side<00:03:26.700> yet<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:28.530> working<00:03:28.950> across<00:03:29.310> to

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
this side yet now working across to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.229 
this side yet now working across to
about<00:03:29.879> there<00:03:31.099> we<00:03:32.099> can<00:03:32.280> start<00:03:32.519> making<00:03:32.819> some

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
about there we can start making some

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.110 
about there we can start making some
progress<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:34.019> so<00:03:34.319> I'm<00:03:34.440> studying<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.920> beak

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
progress here so I'm studying the beak

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.930 
progress here so I'm studying the beak
against<00:03:36.120> my<00:03:36.299> thumb<00:03:37.099> I'm<00:03:38.099> making<00:03:38.489> sure<00:03:38.700> why<00:03:38.879> I'm

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
against my thumb I'm making sure why I'm

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.009 
against my thumb I'm making sure why I'm
doing<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.269> I'm<00:03:39.510> not<00:03:39.599> putting<00:03:39.840> any<00:03:39.959> pressure

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
doing this I'm not putting any pressure

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.770 
doing this I'm not putting any pressure
on<00:03:40.440> them<00:03:40.590> on<00:03:40.769> them<00:03:41.099> on<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:42.060> chest<00:03:42.299> or<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
respiratory system the way I hold the

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.530 
respiratory system the way I hold the
birdie<00:03:45.900> is<00:03:46.579> critical<00:03:47.579> to<00:03:47.730> this<00:03:47.819> process<00:03:47.910> I'm

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
birdie is critical to this process I'm

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.910 
birdie is critical to this process I'm
having<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:48.840> use<00:03:48.989> quite<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.230> lot<00:03:49.319> of<00:03:49.440> force<00:03:49.650> with

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
having to use quite a lot of force with

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.680 
having to use quite a lot of force with
my<00:03:50.299> right<00:03:51.299> hand<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:53.030> things<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.540> we're

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
my right hand and the things that we're

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.410 
my right hand and the things that we're
making<00:03:54.840> progress<00:03:55.879> right<00:03:58.909> we've<00:03:59.909> got<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.209> far

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
making progress right we've got that far

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.050 
making progress right we've got that far
and<00:04:01.129> now<00:04:02.129> we're<00:04:02.280> going<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> do<00:04:02.609> some<00:04:02.819> tidying

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
and now we're going to do some tidying

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.940 
and now we're going to do some tidying
up

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.550 

I<00:04:08.980> tried<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.970> work<00:04:10.600> down<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:11.080> beat<00:04:11.260> rather

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
I tried to work down the beat rather

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.949 
I tried to work down the beat rather
than<00:04:11.800> up<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.250> be<00:04:13.140> so<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.560> put<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.810> Clippers<00:04:16.810> in

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
than up to be so I put the Clippers in

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.810 
than up to be so I put the Clippers in
that<00:04:17.140> direction<00:04:17.320> rather<00:04:18.040> than<00:04:18.310> doing<00:04:18.670> this

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
that direction rather than doing this

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.460 
that direction rather than doing this
way<00:04:19.030> which<00:04:19.269> is<00:04:19.480> more<00:04:19.690> likely<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.140> create<00:04:20.320> a

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
way which is more likely to create a

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:29.340
