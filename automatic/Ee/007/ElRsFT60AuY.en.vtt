a<00:01:17.090> good<00:01:17.330> idea<00:01:17.479> why<00:01:18.229> cuz<00:01:18.740> number<00:01:19.250> one<00:01:19.490> he<00:01:20.030> has<00:01:20.150> no

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
a good idea why cuz number one he has no

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.760 
a good idea why cuz number one he has no
teeth<00:01:20.600> so<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.020> gonna<00:01:21.140> be<00:01:21.229> hard<00:01:21.260> to<00:01:21.530> chew

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
teeth so it's gonna be hard to chew

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.820 
teeth so it's gonna be hard to chew
number<00:01:22.729> two<00:01:23.030> his<00:01:23.780> body<00:01:24.110> can't<00:01:24.410> even<00:01:24.619> digest

meat yet

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.490 
meat yet
so<00:01:26.150> even<00:01:26.360> if<00:01:26.450> I<00:01:26.570> can<00:01:26.810> get<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.140> to<00:01:27.260> his<00:01:27.380> stomach

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
so even if I can get it to his stomach

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.950 
so even if I can get it to his stomach
he<00:01:27.979> can't<00:01:28.190> do<00:01:28.340> anything<00:01:28.729> with<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:28.940> he's<00:01:29.660> simply
