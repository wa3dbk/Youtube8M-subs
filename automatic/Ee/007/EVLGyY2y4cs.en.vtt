the pieces together because it kind of

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.850 
the pieces together because it kind of
looks<00:01:44.390> honestly<00:01:44.930> it<00:01:45.230> looks<00:01:45.350> better<00:01:45.560> when<00:01:45.710> it's

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
looks honestly it looks better when it's

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.520 
looks honestly it looks better when it's
like<00:01:45.980> destruct<00:01:46.490> destructed<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:48.260> can<00:01:48.380> see

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
like destruct destructed but you can see

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.740 
like destruct destructed but you can see
the<00:01:48.650> buildings<00:01:49.010> do<00:01:49.160> attach<00:01:49.550> piece<00:01:50.510> by<00:01:50.720> piece

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the buildings do attach piece by piece

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.390 
the buildings do attach piece by piece
you<00:01:51.200> can<00:01:51.290> see<00:01:51.470> right<00:01:51.500> here<00:01:51.800> you<00:01:51.920> can<00:01:52.040> take<00:01:52.220> this

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
you can see right here you can take this

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.940 
you can see right here you can take this
apart<00:01:52.870> like<00:01:53.870> that<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.410> if<00:01:54.470> you<00:01:54.560> just<00:01:54.740> want<00:01:54.920> to

right here you can you can put the
pieces<00:02:23.209> together<00:02:23.420> but<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.870> can<00:02:23.990> also<00:02:24.140> no

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
pieces together but you can also no

break them apart and everything so if

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.950 
break them apart and everything so if
you<00:02:27.050> wanted<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.470> really<00:02:27.650> make<00:02:27.860> this<00:02:27.980> look

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
you wanted to really make this look

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.990 
you wanted to really make this look
like<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.440> city<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.040> was<00:02:30.190> just<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.970> know

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000

destroyed by these monsters but it's

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.090 
destroyed by these monsters but it's
pretty<00:02:33.610> cool<00:02:33.820> um<00:02:34.350> again<00:02:35.350> this<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> smaller

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
pretty cool um again this is a smaller

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.370 
pretty cool um again this is a smaller
set<00:02:36.520> but<00:02:36.760> if<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.180> have<00:02:37.300> other<00:02:37.510> figures<00:02:37.990> you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
set but if you have other figures you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.960 
set but if you have other figures you
know<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.740> size<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.520> would<00:02:39.610> look<00:02:39.760> really

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
know this size it would look really

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.680 
know this size it would look really
great<00:02:40.500> like<00:02:41.500> with<00:02:41.650> other<00:02:42.570> figures<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.660> you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
great like with other figures that you

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.150 
great like with other figures that you
can<00:02:43.810> put<00:02:43.960> in<00:02:44.050> with<00:02:44.170> this<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:44.860> we'll<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
can put in with this but we'll get a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.100 
can put in with this but we'll get a
close-up<00:02:45.430> on<00:02:45.640> each<00:02:45.850> little<00:02:46.450> character<00:02:46.930> here

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
close-up on each little character here

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.900 
close-up on each little character here
I'll<00:02:47.410> show<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.650> a<00:02:47.740> quick<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.370> glimpse<00:02:48.760> of

there's no real paint detail going on
with<00:02:57.460> with<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> buildings<00:02:58.540> but<00:02:58.660> they<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:58.960> a

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
with with the buildings but they have a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.930 
with with the buildings but they have a
little<00:02:59.740> bit<00:02:59.830> of<00:02:59.860> detail<00:03:00.250> itself<00:03:00.760> like

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
little bit of detail itself like

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.850 
little bit of detail itself like
sculpted<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:01.540> but<00:03:01.750> just<00:03:02.020> know<00:03:02.140> there's<00:03:02.800> just

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
sculpted and but just know there's just

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.620 
sculpted and but just know there's just
no<00:03:03.100> pain<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.640> would<00:03:03.850> have<00:03:03.970> been<00:03:04.120> really

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
no pain but it would have been really

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.280 
no pain but it would have been really
cool<00:03:04.960> if<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.680> would<00:03:05.860> have<00:03:05.950> gotten<00:03:06.070> some<00:03:07.260> so<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
cool if we would have gotten some so a

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.710 
cool if we would have gotten some so a
little<00:03:08.470> bit<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> paint<00:03:08.950> work<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.480> on<00:03:10.480> these

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
little bit of paint work on on these

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.540 
little bit of paint work on on these
little<00:03:10.900> play<00:03:11.470> sets<00:03:11.740> but<00:03:12.010> there's<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.370> one

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
little play sets but there's this one

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.690 
little play sets but there's this one
over<00:03:12.700> here<00:03:12.730> which<00:03:12.970> is<00:03:13.090> pretty<00:03:13.240> cool<00:03:14.580> again<00:03:15.580> you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
over here which is pretty cool again you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.190 
over here which is pretty cool again you
can't<00:03:15.910> put<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.210> pieces<00:03:16.240> together<00:03:16.660> if<00:03:17.110> you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
can't put the pieces together if you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.890 
can't put the pieces together if you
really<00:03:17.470> wanted<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:17.890> but<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.540> looks<00:03:19.780> better

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
really wanted to but it looks better

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.210 
really wanted to but it looks better
when<00:03:20.110> it's<00:03:20.260> destroyed<00:03:20.410> and<00:03:20.920> then<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.100> get

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
when it's destroyed and then you get

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.140 
when it's destroyed and then you get
these<00:03:21.370> these<00:03:21.910> bridges<00:03:22.410> right<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:23.860> so<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:24.820> a

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
for the size and everything this is so

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.649 
for the size and everything this is so
much<00:05:46.479> better<00:05:46.719> than<00:05:46.900> the<00:05:48.150> other<00:05:49.150> two<00:05:49.240> Godzilla

00:05:49.649 --> 00:05:49.659
