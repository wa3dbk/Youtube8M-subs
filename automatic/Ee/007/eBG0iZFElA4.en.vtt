00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.230
 so recording 5304 body I have the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.119
 film sent in 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.380
 I have cancer can have their homework 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:22.020
 but i can just do it in the movie 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.359
 watching TV at home watch the first ones 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.310
 it is already time to sport 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.029
 go to guest with energy and lead it 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.030
 implement and must first die as 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 fucked up display hud the secret of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 255 times classics is and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.480
 that's why I say like me 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 that does not mean that everywhere 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 it has to be that way or everybody has to do it 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.829
 Almost gives that nice and finds yours 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.930
 own style 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 yes, we can now do so we 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.449
 are always especially after training 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.460
 that's how it was done first 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:01.320
 namely the soma first things 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.119
 reasonably neat because otherwise something in the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.689
 wind a bit trara so that the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.150
 Beginning 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.020
 that's not about the sausage guys 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.799
 comes around the thumb so you learn zack 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 thumb 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:21.689
 So what it looks not so tight 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:25.200
 or on it must be well fixed 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:29.369
 I'll go around the wrist 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.850
 i hope you see good once i think 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 even from deeper twice fed them 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:40.009
 are just going to click away those 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.630
 Bands under have supported that is 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.470
 You do not hurt yourself so fast 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 It starts around the third turn 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.240
 jigsaw can the short why and beat 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 so i am here in between the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:59.610
 go my little finger 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:02:04.110
 you see, and so again that is not 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:07.649
 Gorgeous I see you are just like that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.470
 like hering little fingers on each one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.710
 case 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.710
 So I go back to the wrist 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:24.040
 the same now on the ring finger inboard 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:29.590
 zack there again out control on area 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.230
 free finger so fist make fix so 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.360
 it does not run away again 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:42.010
 angeles hand open middle finger thrust 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:47.770
 the vips ring a fist 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:51.060
 Take your time, that's how slow we are 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.520
 in the outside exceptions anyway 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.440
 so so it looks still 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:06.310
 palm free fix so believe 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:10.180
 some so i go because of the blur there 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.280
 are on slopes so in there so out 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.370
 in principle, the area is still free 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 that the test does not like it too tight 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.360
 because when you 're sweating, they 're pulling 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.180
 live together 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.660
 you can you end blue one knows the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.580
 whole other annoying I must say 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.970
 punishable thing is not sustainable 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.560
 totally lashed so hard now 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.830
 we have a bit left over how to do that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.330
 So we see the piece we use 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.970
 then really just rough times 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.470
 over the ankles to go over there 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.489
 which are very heavily used 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.640
 in the glove once and the rest when 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.670
 you look like a 12 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.170
 So I made the rescue 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.300
 because it really is the most important thing 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.069
 the whole thing that has to hinge 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.250
 to be protected 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:06.830
 that's what it looks like i hope the hand is mine 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:10.770
 say material here so material 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.690
 If I do my fist I have 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.470
 a good feeling the same 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.419
 straps around the fingers they pull nicely 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.680
 together but not too tight 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:24.570
 here I have a certain pressure on it 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.390
 and suggests you notice it 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.760
 Good does not approve how the skin is 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:32.490
 protected and this is really like here 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.710
 if the known lighter in the disco 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.760
 you have this between the fingers 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.470
 cavity no matter where no matter how you finger 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.310
 make a small cavity 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.570
 he is filled 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.570
 practice practicing
