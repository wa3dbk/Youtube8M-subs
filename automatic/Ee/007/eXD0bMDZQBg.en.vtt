00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.160
 today 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.560
 plus 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.870
 let's see 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.170
 let's take a little bit to catch 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.640
 orbs that when he arrived arrived 1500 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.099
 fire 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.099
 all improve the swords 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.089
 all the cheese is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.200
 I guess I have to talk to the guy 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.640
 s with the giant 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.000
 so you can not investigate a 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 bit 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.340
 a letter from the wife don mariner has 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
 done back with you with our son 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.660
 since the attack and destruction of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.640
 aqueduct the crossing this crisis has been 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.640
 difficult tornado I hope you are well 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.460
 for the eye and a pen like here and 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:31.750
 the eye I think that for now I only have one 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.160
 golden good 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.160
 all with boarding the boats 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.310
 carlos a 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.310
 imagine of the other 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.080
 for later I will talk first with the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.650
 type because the Mayan kinematics put that 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.650
 I have to go here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 so 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.870
 let's talk first with this if it's 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.870
 I have heat 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.290
 the practical one of cris a is calm 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.500
 giant captured in the bloodthirsty 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.240
 acronyms of the trillions guide the ships 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 arriving and departing from the marine cave 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.409
 which is the port of haste 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.860
 for this I think it will help me 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.860
 do something 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.310
 so let's talk to the sailors 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 what was there 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.090
 now 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.200
 only the cowards hide bows 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.510
 You know I'm one of the furies that 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:02.410
 forged your link you would have killed me 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.700
 before he spoke, because your speech has 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.830
 led to betray your family 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.050
 your spartan 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.520
 the injustice of your swearing made me 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.340
 doubt them 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.040
 it will be possible that even after 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.680
 suffered so much you do not know why you 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.629
 they chose 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.880
 because you need bars because you 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:28.110
 they still need clear 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.080
 Kratos 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.880
 the god of war takes years 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.850
 conspiring 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.930
 I was born from the union of the god of war and 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.930
 the queen of furies 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.980
 full of anger and madness I will do was expected 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.980
 conceive a warrior 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.040
 but I was just a baradel disappointment 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.459
 my mothers saved me they commissioned me 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.459
 keep the oaths 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.379
 although it was a big burden I was 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.459
 decided to be useful to those who 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.459
 they said love me 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.250
 It was the mission of your bond that 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.550
 questioned my actions 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.550
 family 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.270
 I asked for advice when saying it was she who 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.270
 revealed the conspiracy of ares for 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.190
 dethrone Zeus but he needed to 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.100
 Warrior 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.020
 for this model to destroy the walls 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.020
 from the limbo itself 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.750
 destroy my enemies 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.190
 already 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:05:00.599
 so that only belonged to him xa 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:03.599
 wall and my mother designed three missions 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:05.779
 of blood pour the blood of your 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:05.779
 enemies 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.219
 and the blood 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:21.419
 blood from the past past is by two a 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:25.339
 past that you want to rectify and so what 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.339
 I will do without the help of a fury 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.460
 when these myron agents 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.919
 he realized that he only had to fight 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.670
 against the forces that I corroded in their 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:07.210
 mind 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:09.850
 with his thoughts and clear he turned his 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.530
 anger against the fury that still remained 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.530
 to defeat them
