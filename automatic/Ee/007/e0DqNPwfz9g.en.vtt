have<00:02:08.160> pre-made<00:02:08.550> holes<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:09.239> them

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
have pre-made holes on them

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.230 
have pre-made holes on them
are<00:02:09.830> going<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.010> make<00:02:10.190> some<00:02:10.430> make<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.120> much

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
are going to make some make it so much

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.630 
are going to make some make it so much
easier<00:02:11.480> when<00:02:12.350> you're<00:02:12.470> putting<00:02:12.680> your<00:02:12.920> tutorial

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
easier when you're putting your tutorial

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.370 
easier when you're putting your tutorial
together<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.510> opt<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.900> use<00:02:15.080> other

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
together and you can opt to use other

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.880 
together and you can opt to use other
stones<00:02:15.770> or<00:02:15.950> crystals<00:02:16.370> that<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.610> have<00:02:16.910> as<00:02:17.150> well

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
stones or crystals that you have as well

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.990 
stones or crystals that you have as well
so<00:02:18.890> the<00:02:19.010> first<00:02:19.220> thing<00:02:19.460> you're<00:02:19.670> going<00:02:19.850> to<00:02:19.940> want

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
so the first thing you're going to want

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.690 
so the first thing you're going to want
to<00:02:20.300> do<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:21.170> ahead<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.440> take<00:02:21.950> some<00:02:22.490> of<00:02:22.520> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
to do is go ahead and take some of the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.120 
to do is go ahead and take some of the
clusters<00:02:23.150> from<00:02:23.570> your<00:02:23.930> crystals<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.680> you're

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
clusters from your crystals and you're

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.770 
clusters from your crystals and you're
going<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.550> line<00:02:25.730> them<00:02:25.910> up<00:02:26.030> next<00:02:26.390> to<00:02:26.480> each<00:02:26.600> other

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
going to line them up next to each other

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.570 
going to line them up next to each other
you<00:02:26.960> need<00:02:27.290> about<00:02:27.500> three<00:02:27.950> since<00:02:28.280> these<00:02:28.430> are

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
you need about three since these are

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.780 
you need about three since these are
already<00:02:28.760> pre-cut<00:02:29.480> about<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.140> same<00:02:30.410> size

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
already pre-cut about the same size

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.810 
already pre-cut about the same size
three<00:02:31.790> should<00:02:32.030> fit<00:02:32.330> nice<00:02:33.010> nicely<00:02:34.010> over<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
three should fit nice nicely over the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.140 
three should fit nice nicely over the
top<00:02:35.060> of<00:02:35.090> your<00:02:35.570> ring<00:02:35.810> so<00:02:36.740> now<00:02:36.920> I'm<00:02:37.190> going<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:37.730> cut

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
top of your ring so now I'm going to cut

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.080 
top of your ring so now I'm going to cut
out<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.720> good<00:02:39.110> amount<00:02:39.470> of<00:02:39.680> my<00:02:40.130> gauge<00:02:40.370> wire<00:02:40.700> and

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
out a good amount of my gauge wire and

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.330 
out a good amount of my gauge wire and
I'm<00:02:41.660> simply<00:02:41.990> going<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.380> thread<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.100> through

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
I'm simply going to thread it through

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.010 
I'm simply going to thread it through
and<00:02:43.670> this<00:02:43.820> is<00:02:44.000> why<00:02:44.120> it's<00:02:44.300> so<00:02:44.360> important<00:02:44.900> that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
and this is why it's so important that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.330 
and this is why it's so important that
you<00:02:45.140> get<00:02:45.320> these<00:02:45.530> crystals<00:02:46.040> because<00:02:46.250> they

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you get these crystals because they

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.310 
you get these crystals because they
already<00:02:46.490> have<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:46.880> holes<00:02:47.090> in<00:02:47.330> them<00:02:47.510> so<00:02:48.260> I'm

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
already have the holes in them so I'm

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.720 
already have the holes in them so I'm
going<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.620> kind<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:48.890> place<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.310> crystal

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
going to kind of place the crystal

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.820 
going to kind of place the crystal
somewhere<00:02:50.090> in<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.240> middle<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.470> I'm<00:02:51.560> going

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
somewhere in the middle then I'm going

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.100 
somewhere in the middle then I'm going
to<00:02:51.890> take<00:02:52.160> my<00:02:52.340> ring<00:02:52.580> and<00:02:52.790> I'm<00:02:53.480> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.810> take

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
to take my ring and I'm going to take

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.170 
to take my ring and I'm going to take
one<00:02:54.320> of<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> sides<00:02:54.770> and<00:02:55.040> I'm<00:02:55.370> simply<00:02:55.850> going<00:02:56.060> to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
one of the sides and I'm simply going to

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.380 
one of the sides and I'm simply going to
put<00:02:56.960> my<00:02:57.080> gauge<00:02:57.290> wire<00:02:57.850> through<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.940> hole<00:02:58.970> that

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
put my gauge wire through the hole that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.020 
put my gauge wire through the hole that
is<00:02:59.540> located<00:03:00.110> on<00:03:00.440> the<00:03:00.650> side<00:03:00.920> and<00:03:01.190> you're<00:03:01.910> going

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
is located on the side and you're going

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.790 
is located on the side and you're going
to<00:03:02.060> be<00:03:02.210> doing<00:03:02.390> this<00:03:02.660> to<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.990> opposite<00:03:03.440> side<00:03:03.650> as

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
to be doing this to the opposite side as

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.500 
to be doing this to the opposite side as
well<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.460> should<00:03:04.670> be<00:03:04.790> wrapped<00:03:05.030> like<00:03:05.240> this

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
well and it should be wrapped like this

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.930 
well and it should be wrapped like this
with<00:03:05.960> the<00:03:06.170> gauge<00:03:06.350> wire<00:03:06.650> going<00:03:06.980> through<00:03:07.610> all<00:03:07.910> of

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
with the gauge wire going through all of

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.850 
with the gauge wire going through all of
your<00:03:08.150> crystals<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.080> wraps<00:03:09.290> around<00:03:09.500> the

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
your crystals and it wraps around the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.790 
your crystals and it wraps around the
back<00:03:10.010> now<00:03:10.940> taking<00:03:11.390> your<00:03:11.540> pliers<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.560> are

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
back now taking your pliers you are

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.940 
back now taking your pliers you are
going<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.340> be<00:03:13.900> securing<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.140> gauge<00:03:15.320> wire<00:03:15.650> all

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
going to be securing the gauge wire all

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.500 
going to be securing the gauge wire all
the<00:03:16.310> way<00:03:16.430> around<00:03:16.760> you're<00:03:16.940> going<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.120> be<00:03:17.270> doing

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
the way around you're going to be doing

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.040 
the way around you're going to be doing
so<00:03:17.930> by<00:03:18.650> simply<00:03:19.190> wrapping<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:20.030> gauge<00:03:20.239> wire<00:03:20.630> all

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
so by simply wrapping the gauge wire all

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.800 
so by simply wrapping the gauge wire all
the<00:03:21.110> way<00:03:21.950> around<00:03:22.280> until<00:03:22.430> your<00:03:22.880> gauge<00:03:23.180> wire<00:03:23.510> is

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
the way around until your gauge wire is

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.660 
the way around until your gauge wire is
completely<00:03:24.709> wrapped<00:03:24.920> around<00:03:25.070> there's<00:03:25.459> no

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
completely wrapped around there's no

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.300 
completely wrapped around there's no
more<00:03:25.910> obviously<00:03:26.890> but<00:03:27.890> you're<00:03:28.010> going<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.160> be

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
more obviously but you're going to be

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.710 
more obviously but you're going to be
repeating<00:03:28.760> this<00:03:29.000> make<00:03:29.270> sure<00:03:29.450> you<00:03:29.540> use<00:03:29.690> your

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
repeating this make sure you use your

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.690 
repeating this make sure you use your
pliers<00:03:30.110> as<00:03:30.470> it's<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.920> to<00:03:31.040> make<00:03:31.190> it<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.580> much

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
pliers as it's going to make it so much

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.479 
pliers as it's going to make it so much
easier<00:03:31.970> for<00:03:32.930> you<00:03:33.050> to<00:03:33.080> be<00:03:33.290> able<00:03:33.410> to<00:03:34.070> tighten<00:03:34.430> it

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
easier for you to be able to tighten it

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.729 
easier for you to be able to tighten it
every<00:03:34.790> time<00:03:34.970> that<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.330> wrap<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.720> around<00:03:35.810> and

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
every time that you wrap it around and

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.190 
every time that you wrap it around and
once<00:03:37.520> you<00:03:37.670> get<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.330> very<00:03:38.540> very<00:03:38.870> last

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
once you get to the very very last

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.110 
once you get to the very very last
little<00:03:39.500> piece<00:03:39.739> make<00:03:40.130> sure<00:03:40.280> that<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:40.700> tuck<00:03:40.970> it

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
little piece make sure that you tuck it

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.510 
little piece make sure that you tuck it
in<00:03:41.300> that<00:03:41.600> way<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.810> won't<00:03:42.050> poke<00:03:42.350> you<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:42.830> if

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
in that way you won't poke you and if

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.340 
in that way you won't poke you and if
you<00:03:43.700> need<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.290> move<00:03:45.290> all<00:03:45.739> of<00:03:45.770> your<00:03:46.130> gauge<00:03:46.670> wire

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
you need to move all of your gauge wire

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.900 
you need to move all of your gauge wire
more<00:03:48.350> on<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.620> inside<00:03:49.040> for<00:03:49.280> a<00:03:49.310> cleaner<00:03:49.580> look

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
more on the inside for a cleaner look

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.540 
more on the inside for a cleaner look
you<00:03:50.150> can<00:03:50.360> opt<00:03:50.630> to<00:03:50.810> do<00:03:50.989> that<00:03:51.200> as<00:03:51.440> well<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.400> I'm

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
you can opt to do that as well as I'm

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.660 
you can opt to do that as well as I'm
doing<00:03:52.910> here<00:03:53.330> and<00:03:53.540> I'm<00:03:54.410> going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.739> simply<00:03:55.550> be

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
doing here and I'm going to simply be

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.970 
doing here and I'm going to simply be
repeating<00:03:56.270> the<00:03:56.420> exact<00:03:56.870> same<00:03:57.110> thing<00:03:57.410> on<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
repeating the exact same thing on the

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.550 
repeating the exact same thing on the
opposite<00:03:58.520> side<00:03:58.820> as<00:03:59.060> well

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.990 

so<00:04:05.560> now<00:04:05.710> that<00:04:05.770> my<00:04:06.010> second<00:04:06.400> part<00:04:06.610> is<00:04:06.760> wrapped

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
so now that my second part is wrapped

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.660 
so now that my second part is wrapped
the<00:04:07.270> ring<00:04:07.480> pretty<00:04:07.780> much<00:04:07.990> looks<00:04:08.440> done<00:04:09.040> as<00:04:09.370> you

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
the ring pretty much looks done as you

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.720 
the ring pretty much looks done as you
can<00:04:09.850> see<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.600> end<00:04:10.780> pieces<00:04:11.170> of<00:04:11.770> my<00:04:12.220> gauge<00:04:12.430> wire

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
can see the end pieces of my gauge wire

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.180 
can see the end pieces of my gauge wire
nice<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.270> tucked<00:04:13.450> in<00:04:13.660> it's<00:04:14.500> nicely<00:04:14.770> wrapped

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
nice and tucked in it's nicely wrapped

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.210 
nice and tucked in it's nicely wrapped
and<00:04:15.700> now<00:04:16.510> for<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.870> last<00:04:17.019> step<00:04:17.230> I'm<00:04:17.620> simply

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
and now for the last step I'm simply

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.729 
and now for the last step I'm simply
going<00:04:18.459> to<00:04:18.579> be<00:04:18.790> taking<00:04:19.180> some<00:04:19.320> e6000<00:04:20.320> glue<00:04:20.350> and

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
going to be taking some e6000 glue and

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.970 
going to be taking some e6000 glue and
I'm<00:04:20.980> going<00:04:21.130> to<00:04:21.160> place<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.760> in<00:04:22.330> between<00:04:22.980> the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
I'm going to place it in between the

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.190 
I'm going to place it in between the
ring<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.460> the<00:04:24.850> crystals<00:04:25.330> since<00:04:25.840> you<00:04:25.960> see<00:04:26.080> the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
ring and the crystals since you see the

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.410 
ring and the crystals since you see the
crystals<00:04:26.650> are<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.830> little<00:04:27.100> wobbly<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.850> way<00:04:28.120> it

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
crystals are a little wobbly that way it

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.260 
crystals are a little wobbly that way it
binds<00:04:28.810> the<00:04:29.110> crystals<00:04:29.680> nicely<00:04:30.340> and<00:04:30.520> secure<00:04:31.120> on

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270
