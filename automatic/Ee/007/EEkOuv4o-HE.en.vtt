00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.340 
hunter looks really really nice yeah I
tend<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.210> like<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.540> could<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.140> bit

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
tend to like it could be a little bit

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
tend to like it could be a little bit
too<00:00:37.469> patchy<00:00:37.680> couple<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.280> maybe<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.700> couple<00:00:38.879> of

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
too patchy couple of maybe a couple of

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.580 
too patchy couple of maybe a couple of
different<00:00:39.239> too<00:00:39.390> many<00:00:39.539> colors<00:00:39.960> sort<00:00:40.500> of

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
different too many colors sort of

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.100 
different too many colors sort of
running<00:00:40.740> for<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.040> legs<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.520> don't<00:00:42.240> know<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.630> mean

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
running for the legs I don't know I mean

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.930 
running for the legs I don't know I mean
I<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.290> like<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.160> think<00:00:44.400> maybe<00:00:44.460> they're

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I do like it I just think maybe they're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.500 
I do like it I just think maybe they're
just<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.950> bit<00:00:46.950> too<00:00:47.100> much<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:48.180> really

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
just a little bit too much it's really

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.420 
just a little bit too much it's really
well<00:00:48.660> proportioned<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.829> most<00:00:50.100> assets

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
well proportioned I think most assets

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
well proportioned I think most assets
need<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:50.910> like<00:00:51.150> this<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.620> terms<00:00:52.860> of

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
need to be like this in in terms of

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.880 
need to be like this in in terms of
proportion<00:00:53.670> well<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:55.260> proportion<00:00:55.829> i

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
proportion well I with proportion i

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
proportion well I with proportion i
think<00:00:56.100> they<00:00:56.220> had<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:57.450> on<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.930> shoulder

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
think they had on the on the shoulder

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.330 
think they had on the on the shoulder
from<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.720> cat<00:01:00.720> whatever<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:02.010> may<00:01:02.190> be<00:01:02.250> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
from the cat whatever it is it may be a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.470 
from the cat whatever it is it may be a
little<00:01:02.460> too<00:01:02.610> big<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:02.880> proportion<00:01:03.450> of

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
little too big for proportion of

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.929 
little too big for proportion of
everything<00:01:03.840> else<00:01:03.960> seems<00:01:04.140> okay<00:01:04.519> yeah<00:01:05.519> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
everything else seems okay yeah I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.730 
everything else seems okay yeah I
actually<00:01:06.299> really<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.930> mind<00:01:07.079> I<00:01:07.259> think<00:01:07.380> it's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
actually really don't mind I think it's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.459 
actually really don't mind I think it's
a<00:01:08.040> good<00:01:08.399> model<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.899> don't<00:01:10.079> mind<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> home

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
a good model and I don't mind the home

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:12.260 
a good model and I don't mind the home
on<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.799> although<00:01:11.579> the<00:01:11.700> boots<00:01:11.970> look

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
on this one although the boots look

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.770 
on this one although the boots look
reused<00:01:12.780> they<00:01:13.290> were<00:01:13.440> kind<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:14.510> it<00:01:15.510> could<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.750> a

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
reused they were kind of it could be a

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.770 
reused they were kind of it could be a
bit<00:01:15.900> bigger<00:01:16.110> yeah<00:01:17.150> although<00:01:18.150> looking<00:01:18.450> at<00:01:18.690> this

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
bit bigger yeah although looking at this

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.920 
bit bigger yeah although looking at this
picture<00:01:19.049> now<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.260> just<00:01:19.380> noticed<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
don't know if that is going to be a hint

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.789 
don't know if that is going to be a hint
of<00:01:29.240> either<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.690> tea<00:01:30.869> sets<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.590> color

another<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:36.930> proportioned<00:01:37.610> thing<00:01:38.610> I

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
another really well proportioned thing I

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
another really well proportioned thing I

makes the humans look really huge like
oh<00:01:41.820> yeah<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> orbit<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> white<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:44.130> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
oh yeah like the orbit of white which is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.950 
oh yeah like the orbit of white which is
pretty<00:01:44.430> cool<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:45.270> wouldn't<00:01:45.510> hide<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.780> helm

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080 
sides which is interesting so and maybe
the<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.860> data<00:01:59.100> pool<00:01:59.400> from<00:01:59.580> this<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.909> could

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
the the data pool from this one could

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.030 
the the data pool from this one could
have<00:02:00.180> come<00:02:00.479> out<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> bit<00:02:00.810> bit<00:02:01.170> squared<00:02:01.860> or

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
have come out a bit bit squared or

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.999 
have come out a bit bit squared or
something<00:02:02.310> maybe<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.420> looks<00:02:03.570> like

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
something maybe not and it looks like

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.620 
something maybe not and it looks like
the<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.430> grant<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> second<00:02:06.270> picture<00:02:06.420> in

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the the grant like the second picture in

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.050 
the the grant like the second picture in
from<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.900> left<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:08.009> looks<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.939> an

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
from the left it looks like a like an

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.890 
from the left it looks like a like an
animal<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.659> the<00:02:09.810> boot<00:02:10.909> like<00:02:11.909> a<00:02:11.939> platypus<00:02:12.659> for

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
animal on the boot like a platypus for

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.899 
animal on the boot like a platypus for
our<00:02:13.140> Australian<00:02:13.829> brethren<00:02:14.220> who<00:02:14.549> looks<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
our Australian brethren who looks like a

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.530 
our Australian brethren who looks like a
platypus<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.510> would<00:02:15.750> say<00:02:16.050> that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.179 

but<00:02:19.540> here<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.900> go<00:02:19.930> i<00:02:20.049> think<00:02:20.409> i'll<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.859> into<00:02:21.069> the

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:21.189 
but here we go i think i'll go into the

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:22.379 
but here we go i think i'll go into the
male<00:02:21.340> priests<00:02:21.639> here<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:21.969> i<00:02:21.999> think<00:02:22.239> they've

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
male priests here and i think they've

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.300 
male priests here and i think they've
done<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.569> pretty<00:02:22.810> good<00:02:22.959> job<00:02:23.109> on<00:02:23.230> this<00:02:23.409> one<00:02:23.560> thank

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
done a pretty good job on this one thank

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.610 
done a pretty good job on this one thank
God<00:02:24.549> they<00:02:24.999> redid<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.749> press<00:02:25.989> key<00:02:26.230> because<00:02:26.499> it

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
God they redid the press key because it

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
God they redid the press key because it
looked<00:02:26.769> awful<00:02:27.249> before<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.909> priests<00:02:28.269> needed<00:02:28.780> a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
looked awful before and priests needed a

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.360 
looked awful before and priests needed a
bit<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.019> extra<00:02:29.290> low<00:02:29.469> from<00:02:29.709> in<00:02:29.889> the<00:02:29.980> gear<00:02:30.189> I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
bit of extra low from in the gear I

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.179 
bit of extra low from in the gear I
think<00:02:30.909> I<00:02:31.150> like<00:02:32.079> this<00:02:32.200> one<00:02:32.260> I<00:02:32.650> think<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
think I like this one I think the

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:35.039 
think I like this one I think the
shoulders<00:02:33.639> could<00:02:33.819> potentially<00:02:34.389> be<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.569> little

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
shoulders could potentially be a little

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.319 
shoulders could potentially be a little
bit<00:02:35.230> too<00:02:35.409> big<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.099> I<00:02:36.159> think<00:02:36.459> if<00:02:36.609> it's<00:02:36.819> one<00:02:37.239> of

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:37.329 
bit too big but I think if it's one of

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:39.360 
bit too big but I think if it's one of
those<00:02:37.389> ones<00:02:37.629> where<00:02:37.750> they<00:02:37.989> stay<00:02:38.620> still<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.129> not

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
those ones where they stay still and not

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.160 
those ones where they stay still and not
move<00:02:39.430> with<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:39.939> arm<00:02:40.120> movements<00:02:40.599> yeah<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:41.049> think

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
move with the arm movements yeah I think

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.179 
move with the arm movements yeah I think
that'll<00:02:41.530> be<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.650> lot<00:02:41.920> better<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.189> orb

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:45.189 
that'll be a lot better it's the orb

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:46.890 
that'll be a lot better it's the orb
thing<00:02:45.519> in<00:02:45.819> the<00:02:45.969> shoulders<00:02:46.359> looks<00:02:46.689> like

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
thing in the shoulders looks like

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.750 
thing in the shoulders looks like
there'll<00:02:47.169> be<00:02:47.200> some<00:02:47.530> sort<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.950> animation<00:02:48.579> talk

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
there'll be some sort of animation talk

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.949 
there'll be some sort of animation talk
to<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.329> that'll<00:02:50.109> be<00:02:50.200> cool<00:02:50.409> mmm<00:02:51.040> yeah<00:02:51.189> so<00:02:51.959> we'll

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
to it that'll be cool mmm yeah so we'll

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.099 
to it that'll be cool mmm yeah so we'll
switch<00:02:53.409> over<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.950> female<00:02:54.400> priests<00:02:55.109> which

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
switch over to the female priests which

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.559 
switch over to the female priests which
isn't<00:02:56.560> I<00:02:56.829> don't<00:02:57.579> think<00:02:57.760> they<00:02:57.849> thought<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.329> out

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
isn't I don't think they thought it out

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.770 
isn't I don't think they thought it out
too<00:02:59.439> well<00:02:59.650> because<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.219> shoulders<00:03:01.209> tend<00:03:01.599> to

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
too well because the shoulders tend to

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.360 
too well because the shoulders tend to
run<00:03:02.500> through<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.829> helmet<00:03:03.159> they<00:03:03.370> get<00:03:03.849> in<00:03:03.969> a<00:03:04.060> way

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
run through the helmet they get in a way

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.709 
run through the helmet they get in a way
so<00:03:06.370> I<00:03:06.400> mean<00:03:06.730> I<00:03:06.760> think<00:03:06.849> that's<00:03:07.209> more<00:03:07.359> just<00:03:07.599> a

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
so I mean I think that's more just a

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.050 
so I mean I think that's more just a
visual<00:03:08.169> thing<00:03:08.469> that<00:03:08.650> they<00:03:08.829> may<00:03:09.310> have<00:03:09.430> just

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
visual thing that they may have just

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.909 
visual thing that they may have just
sorta<00:03:10.269> overlooked<00:03:10.689> really<00:03:10.989> quick<00:03:11.199> but<00:03:11.469> I

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919 
sorta overlooked really quick but I

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.339 
sorta overlooked really quick but I
think<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:12.969> this<00:03:13.150> will<00:03:13.359> fit<00:03:13.599> well<00:03:13.810> because<00:03:14.199> if

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
think that this will fit well because if

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.309 
think that this will fit well because if
you<00:03:14.469> look<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:15.090> think<00:03:16.090> those<00:03:16.329> like<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.019> take<00:03:17.199> the

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
you look I think those like we take the

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.929 
you look I think those like we take the
picture<00:03:17.560> on<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.650> left<00:03:17.739> underneath<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.669> orbs

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:18.939 
picture on the left underneath the orbs

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:19.979 
picture on the left underneath the orbs
i<00:03:19.060> think<00:03:19.239> that's<00:03:19.389> supposed<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.810> follow

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
i think that's supposed to follow

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:22.530 
i think that's supposed to follow
through<00:03:20.169> the<00:03:20.409> arms<00:03:20.759> yeah<00:03:21.759> instead<00:03:22.209> of<00:03:22.239> being

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
through the arms yeah instead of being

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.949 
through the arms yeah instead of being
at<00:03:22.659> that<00:03:22.840> far<00:03:23.079> and<00:03:23.849> that<00:03:24.849> allowed<00:03:25.209> bring<00:03:25.780> that

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
at that far and that allowed bring that

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.559 
at that far and that allowed bring that
all<00:03:26.109> squared<00:03:26.500> mmm<00:03:26.919> well<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.120> think<00:03:28.209> priests

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
all squared mmm well and I think priests

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.240 
all squared mmm well and I think priests
got<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.780> nice<00:03:28.989> little<00:03:29.169> bit<00:03:29.349> actual<00:03:29.590> oven<00:03:29.769> they

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
got a nice little bit actual oven they

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.520 
got a nice little bit actual oven they
have<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.609> the<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.540> Voltron<00:03:31.930> bird<00:03:32.169> helmet

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
have like the the Voltron bird helmet

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.819 
have like the the Voltron bird helmet
thing<00:03:32.650> going<00:03:32.979> on<00:03:33.069> again<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.609> think<00:03:34.569> it<00:03:34.720> I<00:03:34.930> like

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
thing going on again I think it I like

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449 
it I love the colors I think it's a

it I love the colors I think it's a
colors<00:03:37.689> I<00:03:37.780> really<00:03:37.989> make<00:03:38.139> it<00:03:38.290> mhm<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.430> that
