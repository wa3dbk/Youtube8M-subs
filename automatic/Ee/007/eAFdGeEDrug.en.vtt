 our website 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.099
 but first we need to create a table 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.969

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:41.599
 separate block where we have news and 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.950
 now here you need to print a loop 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:49.189

 simply specify the sort buy order 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:41.389

 cut it 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:04.590
 point it out and so now 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:09.410
 substitute values from the table here at 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:18.120
 we are going to date we copy the variable 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:23.640
 break the string and indicate the date here 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:27.440
 This field indicates the date but the way we write 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:32.150
 do it further we have this name 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:36.360
 we copy changes and we insert here 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:39.510
 indicate the title here we specify here 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:44.960
 this title and then we have the text 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.960
 description here description here insert 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.960
 text 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:59.090
 so if we save and check that 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:03.000
