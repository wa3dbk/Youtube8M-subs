 playstation 4 here our tables gamers 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 we will try to reach a verdict 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.670
 Which of the two consoles is the best? 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.439
 investment is a better buy from people 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.199
 probably not because 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.390
 because it is very personal but has a 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.000
 very good subject in the adrenaline forum of 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.520
 hurricane was on the problem site there me and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.960
 who does exactly this comparison 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.730
 Thank you for letting anyone else rest 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.230
 because I found the subject sensational 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.329
 We'll have a chat here. 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.950
 about our points of view and such 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.690
 I obviously want to know the opinion of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.969
 I then do a lot of the comments 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 question you eat soon 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.180
 remembering if you want to share 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.370
 this video you help me a lot released 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.800
 social networking on twitter leaving 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.860
 jackson in vain stop talking and 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.420
 let's go to the video leads everything starts that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.399
 the first factor evaluated is the factor 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.590
 sales who sold more than who sold 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.870
 less now at the end of the generation at the end 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.119
 of June at the end of the year is microsoft 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.619
 woke up then put suspended in the sector 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.810
 they started doing a series of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.549
 things to sell more is than 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.570
 thinks Microsoft had committed many 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.600
 pre-release xbox errors the year 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 then type errors speak up to drm 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.580
 that I may be you and esata on the internet 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.470
 to play the console is to implement this 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
 Damn said he plays in the top team . 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 from the video game bridge 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.049
 so they did some things that 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.030
 I particularly many people 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.680
 found unnecessary and that was why 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.299
 that they lost because now at the end 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.369
 with purpose they started putting a 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.229
 bandwidth the hour began to 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.600
 sell white xbox that was something that 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.939
 Do not leave me so they gave a 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 worked best on marketing is 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.189
 relation to the band in relation to the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 games and decided to focus on the games but 0 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.720
 It was very good for microsoft to learn 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.149
 they were very focused on not the xbox is 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.100
 a multimedia center I do not know what it was 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.360
 people who got older market 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.189
 consumer is a gamer 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.469
 then after one year sales of the 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.369
 playstation 4 reaches 13.5 million 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.679
 while those of xbox the year beat 10 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.110
 millions staff is a good difference 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.700
 small but it is in accordance with the 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.900
 microsoft 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.390
 in a few weeks they will 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.010
 sony and I particularly do not 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.500
 I think sony's going to stand still watching 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.019
 this year but think well in 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.120
 rain because the two sold out 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.450
 in this direction was shot that had 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.330
 more success in the history of good games 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.590
 about exclusive releases he has a 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.330
 list complete here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.040
 and comparing each of the games then by 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.230
 Example kinect which a defender 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.870
 because they first because the game is 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.330
 I have 10 raising proinfo famous fire win 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.580
 So if he puts a game and 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.980
 other according to the release date 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.590
 and xbox the year had an extra game 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.390
 the king of master shifu collection ' by 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.700
 while the barcelona snow will launch 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.670
 more effort we'll release more and have already seen 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.099
 that this exclusive issue is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.380
 well contested with the 23 fighter question 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.780
 now be an exclusive of microsoft have 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.829
 purchased the exclusive rights of the 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.140
 tomb Raider 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:10.670
 so so the exclusive war sebben 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.040
 relative also moment I made a 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.220
 ask a forum poll on orkut 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.709
 on exclusive xbox 360 and playstation 3 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.900
 the response of the galley that is more sensible 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.239
 it's always the same is that actually 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.160
 depends on your taste y'know what 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.500
 Do you prefer to play big Paul? 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.170
 planet star was tried on this fans 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.239
 the saints have ghraib will each're 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.790
 connected has much like comparing what is 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.010
 best and what is worse and xbox launch with 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.900
 one more but also squid difference until 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.639
 because it has floral games and that is a game 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.700
 I do not know if it is recommended until 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:45.769
 very cool would recommend the cnec first 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.410
 a picture I practically did not like the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.790
 game so much I liked but not so much 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.799
 finally 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.510
 And you do not like the housekeeper. 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.269
 like but you have to understand you do not have 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.760
 games that really are a matter of 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.650
 I like this year's performance. 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.299
 has much discussed a price of one 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.160
 how it has better hardware and 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.650
 easier to develop the games 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.069
 get a higher resolution on playstation 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:13.430
 4 for example the aeroflot 4 picks up in its 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.099
 foot on playstation 4 and pick up 720p on xbox 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.519
 one the sop code 1080p on 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:21.500
 playstation 4 on 720p xbox one 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.320
 gta get the same thing on both the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.150
 shadow of mormon grabs 1080p on 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.460
 playstation 4 908 good fan then 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:32.620
 It's not not very straightforward, but it's okay. 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.660
 relative also the difference is well it is not 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:38.190
 very blatant so it can only 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.210
 play both in the best of situations 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.580
 here is a section also talks about 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.870
 controversy over everything that Microsoft and 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.280
 sony become involved in a scission law that 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.090
 microsoft really involve more 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.520
 the beginning of controversies then really 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.660
 xbox ended up losing it at the same time 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.000
 time also sony has some 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.610
 lies with relation and 3 and everything else 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.530
 recommend with your husband in the matter and 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.760
 site gives a verdict and I will give the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.889
 my verdict is also on my 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.110
 final opinion that I think the site better 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.280
 considers it a technical draw and I too 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.169
 It's expensive because I think it's a technical draw. 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.850
 whenever an exclusive for one of the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.090
 consoles I'll call him and I practically 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.520
 Do not mind the other one's gta, I have a lot. 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.349
 more friends on playstation 4 and what 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.229
 many of them say that it is more stable 

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:25.630
 but I like to play xbox the year 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.930
 because I think xbox is the most stable year 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:30.849
 and is more stable in relation to 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.490
 game for free i think playstation 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.080
 4 games better than xbox live more 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.099
 xbox live also some good stuff 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.990
 interesting 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.729
 so I really think it's 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.349
 everything very much for I want to know the opinion 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.789
 of you leave the comments if you 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:43.810
 I liked it but I want to work leaving your 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.729
 favorite game 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:50.550
 thank you for having had one so far 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:50.550
 hug the patio until next time and thanks
