00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.640
 freschi is cool because it was 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.130
 listening that there is a numerologist in the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.890

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.130
 with me and the Argentines are stupid 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.899
 because they have the best number to achieve 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.899
 Argentina and do not see it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.380
