00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.220
 would be next 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.400
 but she is the only one at Sony again 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.119
 I'm looking at the hospital 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.909
 the former number 14 is not the last moment 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:27.380
 fia 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.480
 have you seen with me there is quite a bit of layout and articles 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.470
 today was adjusted downwards 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.590
 I have to prepare her it must 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.130
 in the android market 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.350
 with a silent journey what should a person be central during the first 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 quarterly and therefore the only obstacle 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.829
 martijn's had to 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.070
 it goes even further 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.760
 with a proposal 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.890
 also not chosen because I expect a nice one if the recovery is on 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.660
 wall street 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.000
 if you're not that strong a boost 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.220
 is useful to pay attention to 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.220
 feyenoord starts with a very solid basis that is actually for every distance 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.100
 can use with it 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.410
 a tail 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.160
 price tag 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.760
 but for the Netherlands 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.280
 when the bank took over in advance but the volume came makaay small pile 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.320
 state 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.140
 today always consists of 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.920
 it once 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.590
 we do it with a brush 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.420
 to the point of chance all speculation may be seen simultaneously 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 to have 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.600
 and you will regret it 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.360
 and it is also much less easy to erupt 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.369
 once you get into action a few times in the genes 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.929
 and then your creativity can let the hague be adjusted etc 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.650
 ultimately comes to the winter blows 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.650
 what is now off the street 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.340
 put a pin together 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.340
 so can be stated that direction 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.830
 set the road 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.830
 and only then fits down 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.799
 assange sees can still have a stubborn touch here and there 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.639
 you can let that happen that makes it the right owner of deutschland 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:22.259
 whole 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.589
 we see a few all like to use 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.449
 and then know via email
