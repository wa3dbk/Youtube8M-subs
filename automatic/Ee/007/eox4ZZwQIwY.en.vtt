of the round tables for example we can

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.010 
of the round tables for example we can
work<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.110> group<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.880> in<00:01:23.880> small<00:01:24.240> group<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.810> can

work in group and in small group we can

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.359 
work in group and in small group we can
just<00:01:25.680> share<00:01:26.040> what<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.450> learning<00:01:28.369> the

students have misconceptions about
language<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> then<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.250> might<00:01:32.549> say<00:01:32.790> well<00:01:32.970> no<00:01:33.210> it

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
language and then I might say well no it

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.280 
language and then I might say well no it
doesn't<00:01:34.049> work<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.790> check<00:01:35.790> just<00:01:36.290> for

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
doesn't work like that check just for

doesn't work like that check just for
fun

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
fun

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
fun
test<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:39.180> hae-bin<00:01:39.860> ,<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:42.780> how

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
test what I say hae-bin , that see how

many hits you get do it now like right
now<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:47.070> way<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> can<00:01:47.610> actually<00:01:47.909> track<00:01:48.210> via

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
now that way you can actually track via

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.440 
now that way you can actually track via

this idea not EVT I like is still the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.149 
this idea not EVT I like is still the
activity<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.409> write<00:01:58.829> on<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.159> board<00:02:04.159> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
activity where we write on the board you

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.679 
activity where we write on the board you
do<00:02:05.310> something<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> active<00:02:06.509> learning

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
do something in the active learning

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.050 
do something in the active learning
classroom<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:08.129> can<00:02:08.190> go<00:02:08.520> back<00:02:08.700> into<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
classroom it can go back into a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.669 
classroom it can go back into a
conventional<00:02:09.690> classroom<00:02:09.929> after<00:02:10.470> in<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
conventional classroom after in a

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.420 
conventional classroom after in a
different<00:02:11.039> way

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
different way

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.650 
different way
this<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
this is

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.930 
this is
than<00:02:12.810> one<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.380> my<00:02:13.530> most<00:02:13.800> enriching<00:02:14.070> teaching

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
than one of my most enriching teaching

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.850 
than one of my most enriching teaching
experiences<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.930> going<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> introduce<00:02:22.410> the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
experiences I'm going to introduce the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.920 
experiences I'm going to introduce the
model<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.550> start<00:02:23.850> with<00:02:24.060> now<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.570> then<00:02:24.780> what

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
model to start with now and then what

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.320 
model to start with now and then what
we're<00:02:25.050> going<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.260> do<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.560> with<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.640> advent<00:02:27.120> of

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
we're going to do is with the advent of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.000 
we're going to do is with the advent of
the<00:02:27.390> new<00:02:27.720> classrooms<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> we're<00:02:28.680> operating

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the new classrooms that we're operating

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.700 
the new classrooms that we're operating
with<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.930> interaction<00:02:30.930> level<00:02:31.140> has<00:02:31.410> increased

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
with the interaction level has increased

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.760 
with the interaction level has increased
substantially<00:02:32.510> so<00:02:33.510> students<00:02:33.900> now<00:02:34.110> can<00:02:34.470> teach

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
substantially so students now can teach

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.800 
substantially so students now can teach
themselves<00:02:35.100> on<00:02:35.850> three<00:02:36.270> different<00:02:36.630> levels

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
themselves on three different levels

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.050 
themselves on three different levels
first<00:02:37.680> they<00:02:37.890> teach<00:02:38.070> themselves<00:02:38.700> by<00:02:38.820> working

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
first they teach themselves by working

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.220 
first they teach themselves by working
with<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> student<00:02:39.810> that's<00:02:39.870> immediately

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
with the student that's immediately

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.870 
with the student that's immediately
sitting<00:02:40.620> beside<00:02:40.920> them<00:02:41.130> it's<00:02:41.280> structured<00:02:41.730> that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
sitting beside them it's structured that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.130 
sitting beside them it's structured that
way<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.480> see<00:02:42.600> other<00:02:42.750> students

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
way that they can see other students

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.770 
way that they can see other students
work<00:02:43.400> second<00:02:44.400> they're<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.670> modules<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.360> six<00:02:45.630> to

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
work second they're in modules of six to

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
work second they're in modules of six to
eight<00:02:45.930> students<00:02:46.350> around<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.770> table<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.310> they

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
eight students around a table and they

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.770 
eight students around a table and they
all<00:02:47.640> have<00:02:47.880> these<00:02:48.030> discussions<00:02:48.660> about

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
all have these discussions about

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.150 
all have these discussions about
problems<00:02:49.320> that<00:02:49.380> they're<00:02:49.590> coming<00:02:49.800> across<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
problems that they're coming across the

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.550 
problems that they're coming across the
model<00:02:50.340> and<00:02:50.670> then<00:02:51.540> third<00:02:51.810> thing<00:02:52.080> because<00:02:52.440> of

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
model and then third thing because of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.050 
model and then third thing because of
being<00:02:52.710> able<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.010> display<00:02:53.370> everything<00:02:53.550> on<00:02:53.910> the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
screen instantly and the students

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.040 
screen instantly and the students
altogether<00:03:02.910> in<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.210> class<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.690> actually

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
altogether in the class can actually

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.940 
altogether in the class can actually
solve<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.530> problem<00:03:09.500> something's<00:03:10.500> happened

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
solve that problem something's happened

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.830 
solve that problem something's happened
here<00:03:11.160> right<00:03:12.000> what<00:03:12.270> have<00:03:12.360> we<00:03:12.420> done<00:03:12.600> this

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
here right what have we done this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.740 
here right what have we done this
classroom<00:03:13.260> really<00:03:13.410> was<00:03:13.740> great<00:03:14.670> for<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
classroom really was great for a

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.880 
classroom really was great for a
modeling<00:03:16.200> course<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.560> really<00:03:16.740> don't

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
modeling course I really don't

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.080 
modeling course I really don't
understand<00:03:17.280> how<00:03:17.430> it<00:03:17.550> could<00:03:17.640> have<00:03:17.760> been<00:03:17.880> taught

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
understand how it could have been taught

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.380 
understand how it could have been taught
without<00:03:18.590> an<00:03:19.590> interactive<00:03:20.280> dynamic<00:03:20.700> between

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
without an interactive dynamic between

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.970 
without an interactive dynamic between
the<00:03:22.170> professor<00:03:22.620> and<00:03:22.860> students<00:03:24.470> this<00:03:25.470> process

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
the professor and students this process

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.840 
the professor and students this process
of<00:03:26.130> interaction

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
of interaction

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.290 
of interaction
mimics<00:03:27.420> actually<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.870> research<00:03:28.200> process

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
mimics actually the research process

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.770 
mimics actually the research process
quite<00:03:30.300> well

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
quite well

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.290 
quite well
so<00:03:31.110> we<00:03:31.650> teach<00:03:31.920> them<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.220> education<00:03:32.850> or<00:03:33.060> they

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
so we teach them in education or they

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.180 
so we teach them in education or they
think<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.720> education<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:34.470> being<00:03:34.980> wrong

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
think in education that being wrong

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.340 
think in education that being wrong
isn't<00:03:35.490> good<00:03:35.850> actually<00:03:36.450> in<00:03:36.570> this<00:03:36.750> course<00:03:37.020> being

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
isn't good actually in this course being

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.110 
isn't good actually in this course being
wrong<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.920> really<00:03:38.220> good<00:03:38.370> because<00:03:38.700> it<00:03:38.820> actually

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
wrong is really good because it actually

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.900 
wrong is really good because it actually
helps<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.420> learn<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.900> next<00:03:40.170> stage<00:03:40.380> I<00:03:40.910> believe

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
helps you learn the next stage I believe

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.240 
helps you learn the next stage I believe
that<00:03:42.450> people<00:03:42.690> learn<00:03:43.200> modeling<00:03:43.890> through

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
that people learn modeling through

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.030 
that people learn modeling through
experience<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.300> think<00:03:46.260> I<00:03:46.380> actually<00:03:46.620> teach

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
experience I think I actually teach

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.790 
experience I think I actually teach
about<00:03:47.340> 90<00:03:47.790> percent<00:03:48.180> less<00:03:48.239> than<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.290> did<00:03:49.440> before

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
about 90 percent less than I did before

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.300 
about 90 percent less than I did before
and<00:03:50.340> I<00:03:50.820> facilitate<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.930> students<00:03:52.920> learning

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
and I facilitate now students learning

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.580 
and I facilitate now students learning
how<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.489> model<00:03:53.970> themselves<00:03:57.080> it's<00:03:58.080> a<00:03:58.140> real<00:03:58.290> gift

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
how to model themselves it's a real gift

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.750 
how to model themselves it's a real gift
in<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.010> sense<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.340> get<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.550> know<00:03:59.640> your

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
I was able to see how are they were

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.390 
I was able to see how are they were
making<00:04:12.630> connections<00:04:13.320> and<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.160> able

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
been have when they write on the walls

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.150 
been have when they write on the walls
they're<00:04:48.340> accountable<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.990> the<00:04:50.620> room<00:04:50.770> as<00:04:51.100> a

whole for what they've written and they

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.690 
whole for what they've written and they
become<00:04:53.680> responsible<00:04:54.160> for<00:04:54.400> each<00:04:54.490> other's

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
become responsible for each other's

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.610 
become responsible for each other's
learning<00:04:54.910> at<00:04:55.450> certain<00:04:55.870> tables<00:04:56.230> it<00:04:56.320> became

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
learning at certain tables it became

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.620 
learning at certain tables it became
clear<00:04:56.980> that<00:04:57.010> when<00:04:57.340> one<00:04:57.730> person<00:04:57.760> hadn't<00:04:58.420> read

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
clear that when one person hadn't read

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.290 
clear that when one person hadn't read
that<00:04:58.900> that<00:04:59.050> was<00:04:59.260> seen<00:04:59.500> as<00:04:59.850> letting<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:00.940> table

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
that that was seen as letting the table

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.300 
that that was seen as letting the table
do<00:05:01.510> it<00:05:01.840> made<00:05:02.080> them<00:05:02.380> responsible<00:05:03.040> for<00:05:03.220> each

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
do it made them responsible for each

do it made them responsible for each
other's<00:05:03.580> learning<00:05:04.270> in<00:05:04.570> a<00:05:04.630> way<00:05:04.660> that<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:04.990> thought

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
other's learning in a way that I thought

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.500 
other's learning in a way that I thought
was<00:05:05.350> really<00:05:05.530> interesting<00:05:05.970> I've<00:05:06.970> kind<00:05:07.360> of<00:05:07.420> been

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
was really interesting I've kind of been

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.120 
was really interesting I've kind of been

it's<00:05:09.370> been<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.850> class<00:05:10.330> I<00:05:10.480> enjoy<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.930> most

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
it's been the class I enjoy the most

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.650 
it's been the class I enjoy the most
because<00:05:11.530> I'm<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:12.280> most<00:05:12.430> engaged<00:05:12.880> in<00:05:13.120> it<00:05:13.240> I'm<00:05:13.540> a

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
because I'm the most engaged in it I'm a

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.450 
because I'm the most engaged in it I'm a
big<00:05:13.840> supporter<00:05:14.260> of<00:05:14.290> this<00:05:14.770> kind<00:05:14.980> of<00:05:15.040> learning<00:05:15.370> I

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
big supporter of this kind of learning I

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.700 
big supporter of this kind of learning I
think<00:05:15.490> it<00:05:15.760> actually<00:05:15.850> transfers<00:05:16.710> important

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
think it actually transfers important

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.410 
think it actually transfers important
responsibilities<00:05:18.610> back<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.060> student

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
responsibilities back to the student

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.360 
responsibilities back to the student
that<00:05:19.480> I<00:05:19.630> think<00:05:19.930> have<00:05:20.320> sat<00:05:20.890> on<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.040> shoulders

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
that I think have sat on the shoulders

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.500 
that I think have sat on the shoulders
of<00:05:21.400> the<00:05:21.550> professor<00:05:21.970> and<00:05:22.000> I<00:05:22.180> think<00:05:22.360> that's

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
of the professor and I think that's

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.730 
of the professor and I think that's
always<00:05:22.660> a<00:05:22.750> good<00:05:22.930> thing<00:05:22.960> when<00:05:23.140> students<00:05:23.650> are

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
always a good thing when students are

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.320 
always a good thing when students are
more<00:05:23.920> invested<00:05:24.520> in<00:05:24.610> their<00:05:24.760> education<00:05:25.240> and

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
more invested in their education and

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.430 
more invested in their education and
more<00:05:25.510> invested<00:05:25.930> in<00:05:25.990> what<00:05:26.140> they're<00:05:26.290> learning

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
more invested in what they're learning

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.130 
more invested in what they're learning
and<00:05:26.890> this<00:05:27.310> space<00:05:27.550> certainly<00:05:28.110> conduces<00:05:29.110> to

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
and this space certainly conduces to

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:43.239 
and this space certainly conduces to
that<00:05:29.380> kind<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.650> things

00:05:43.239 --> 00:05:43.249
