lesson<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.069> about<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.700> moon<00:00:05.940> phases<00:00:06.420> here<00:00:07.319> we

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
lesson is about the moon phases here we

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.410 
lesson is about the moon phases here we
have<00:00:07.649> a<00:00:07.680> chart<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.400> the<00:00:08.580> earth<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
have a chart with the earth in the

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.690 
have a chart with the earth in the
center<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:09.990> we<00:00:10.110> know<00:00:10.320> that's<00:00:10.519> egocentric<00:00:11.519> but

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
center and we know that's egocentric but

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.060 
center and we know that's egocentric but
the<00:00:12.179> earth<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.750> center<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.799> moon

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the earth is in the center here the moon

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.269 
the earth is in the center here the moon
going<00:00:14.400> around<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:15.210> earth<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:16.199> Sun<00:00:16.529> here

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
going around the earth and the Sun here

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
going around the earth and the Sun here
this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.660> perspective<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.650> how<00:00:19.920> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
this is not the perspective of how you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.670 
this is not the perspective of how you
would<00:00:20.310> see<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.000> moon<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.510> are<00:00:22.109> viewing<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
would see the moon if you are viewing it

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.769 
would see the moon if you are viewing it
from<00:00:22.710> Planet<00:00:23.369> Earth<00:00:23.550> this<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.570> for

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
from Planet Earth this is just for

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
from Planet Earth this is just for
illustration<00:00:25.070> purposes<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.340> we'll<00:00:26.609> explain

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
illustration purposes and we'll explain

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
illustration purposes and we'll explain
why<00:00:27.420> toward<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.080> end<00:00:28.550> the<00:00:29.550> moon<00:00:29.820> starts<00:00:30.720> with

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
why toward the end the moon starts with

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.440 
why toward the end the moon starts with
the<00:00:31.410> very<00:00:31.560> first<00:00:31.980> Crescent<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.969> visible

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
the very first Crescent that is visible

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.830 
the very first Crescent that is visible
in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.140> sky<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.550> called<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.300> new<00:00:36.540> moon

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
in the sky this is called the new moon

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.400 
in the sky this is called the new moon
or<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.230> first<00:00:38.100> Crescent<00:00:39.000> as<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.809> moon<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
illuminated part of the Moon begins to

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.799 
illuminated part of the Moon begins to
grow<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.680> called<00:00:44.030> waxing<00:00:45.030> it's<00:00:45.300> getting

the Crescent the illuminated crescent

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.290 
the Crescent the illuminated crescent
grows<00:00:51.840> larger<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.590> larger<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.850> termed

moon this is the gibbous moon and

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.539 
moon this is the gibbous moon and
because<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.619> getting<00:01:31.950> bigger<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
because it's getting bigger the

illuminated body is getting bigger this

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.819 
illuminated body is getting bigger this
is<00:01:34.380> called<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.979> waxing<00:01:35.610> gibbous<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.590> we

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
is called the waxing gibbous then we

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.499 
is called the waxing gibbous then we
have<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.549> full<00:01:38.909> moon<00:01:39.470> after<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:41.130> full<00:01:41.430> moon

have the full moon after the full moon

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.899 
have the full moon after the full moon
the<00:01:42.509> moon<00:01:42.780> gets<00:01:43.259> smaller<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:44.369> illuminate<00:01:44.759> the

waning half it starts to become a
crescent<00:02:33.209> again<00:02:33.629> however<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.859> a<00:02:35.010> waning

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
crescent again however it's a waning

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.899 
crescent again however it's a waning
crescent<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:36.299> it's<00:02:36.480> getting<00:02:36.719> smaller
