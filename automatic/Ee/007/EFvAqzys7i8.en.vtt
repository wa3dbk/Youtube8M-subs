doing a lot of work on this kind of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.220 
doing a lot of work on this kind of
mixing<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.410> matching<00:00:40.670> with<00:00:41.670> another<00:00:42.510> kit<00:00:42.810> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
mixing and matching with another kit so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.120 
mixing and matching with another kit so
uh<00:00:44.660> also<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.050> wanted<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> film<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> review

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
uh also I wanted to film a review

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.540 
uh also I wanted to film a review
because<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.670> thought<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.810> prime<00:00:49.680> 92s<00:00:50.160> video<00:00:50.460> she

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
because I thought in prime 92s video she

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.180 
because I thought in prime 92s video she
was<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:50.970> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.390> too<00:00:51.750> forgiving<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.829> little

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
was a little bit too forgiving a little

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.670 
was a little bit too forgiving a little
bit<00:00:53.280> too<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> kit<00:00:54.390> because

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
bit too kind of this kit because

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.990 
bit too kind of this kit because
honestly<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.950> kit<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> kind<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.540> mess<00:00:57.750> like

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
honestly the kit is kind of a mess like

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.440 
honestly the kit is kind of a mess like
superglue<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:01.410> kind<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.680> glue<00:01:01.980> is

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
superglue or some kind of glue is

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.850 
superglue or some kind of glue is
definitely<00:01:03.450> required<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.290> kit<00:01:04.589> like

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
definitely required for this kit like

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.280 
definitely required for this kit like
there's<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.000> many<00:01:06.119> parts<00:01:06.450> just<00:01:06.810> falling<00:01:07.140> off

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
there's so many parts just falling off

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
there's so many parts just falling off
all<00:01:07.469> the<00:01:07.590> time<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:08.130> haven't<00:01:09.060> put<00:01:09.270> any<00:01:09.479> glue<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
all the time I haven't put any glue on

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
all the time I haven't put any glue on
the<00:01:10.049> kit<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.620> far<00:01:10.650> yet<00:01:11.250> because<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.420> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
the kit so far yet because I'm going to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.250 
the kit so far yet because I'm going to
be<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.930> taking<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.860> all<00:01:13.920> apart<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:15.020> for<00:01:16.020> all

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
be just taking it all apart and for all

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
be just taking it all apart and for all
the<00:01:16.350> work<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:16.890> doing<00:01:17.010> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
the work I'm going to be doing and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
the work I'm going to be doing and
painting<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.790> whatnot<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.440> didn't<00:01:19.770> bother

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
painting and whatnot so I didn't bother

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.980 
painting and whatnot so I didn't bother
putting<00:01:20.010> any<00:01:20.400> glue<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.640> anything<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> it's

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
putting any glue on anything and it's

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
putting any glue on anything and it's
kind<00:01:22.260> of<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.409> miracle<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.890> I'm<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.310> getting

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
kind of a miracle that I'm just getting

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.370 
kind of a miracle that I'm just getting
it<00:01:23.670> all<00:01:23.820> like<00:01:24.119> held<00:01:24.659> together<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:25.860> pose

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
it all like held together in this pose

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.800 
it all like held together in this pose
just<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.740> of<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.010> weight<00:01:29.190> obviously<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
just because of the weight obviously the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
just because of the weight obviously the
cannon<00:01:32.240> can't<00:01:33.240> stay<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.680> position

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
cannon can't stay and like the position

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.920 
cannon can't stay and like the position
that<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.340> supposed<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.760> there<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:36.840> you

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
that it's supposed to there so that you

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
that it's supposed to there so that you
can<00:01:37.110> put<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.560> legs<00:01:38.250> up<00:01:38.549> or<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.330> leg<00:01:39.510> boosters

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
can put the legs up or the leg boosters

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.020 
can put the legs up or the leg boosters
up<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:40.409> they<00:01:40.560> don't<00:01:40.680> sorry<00:01:41.640> if<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:41.820> can't

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
up because they don't sorry if you can't

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.530 
up because they don't sorry if you can't
see<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.979> hold<00:01:43.979> on<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.790> can't<00:01:44.850> put<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> leg

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
see that hold on you can't put the leg

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
see that hold on you can't put the leg
boosters<00:01:45.960> up<00:01:46.110> like<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.439> because<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.920> don't

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
boosters up like that because they don't

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
boosters up like that because they don't
stay<00:01:47.400> under<00:01:47.759> their<00:01:48.030> weight<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.960> just<00:01:49.170> fall

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
stay under their weight they just fall

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.700 
stay under their weight they just fall
down<00:01:50.000> they're<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.540> held<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.930> by<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.140> poly<00:01:52.409> cap

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
down they're just held on by a poly cap

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700 
down they're just held on by a poly cap
and<00:01:52.979> even<00:01:53.189> though<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> poly<00:01:53.729> cap<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.590> kind<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and even though the poly cap is kind of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.190 
and even though the poly cap is kind of
like<00:01:55.979> hexagonal<00:01:56.880> shaped<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.659> fit<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> like

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
like hexagonal shaped to fit on to like

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.120 
like hexagonal shaped to fit on to like
a<00:01:58.320> hexagonal<00:01:58.790> peg<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.229> guess<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> they<00:02:01.920> went

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a hexagonal peg I guess that they went

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.370 
a hexagonal peg I guess that they went
with<00:02:02.220> that<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.850> try<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.090> make<00:02:03.960> sort<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
with that to try to make sort of a

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.649 
with that to try to make sort of a
locking<00:02:04.590> mechanism<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.880> keep<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> weight

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
locking mechanism to keep up the weight

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.330 
locking mechanism to keep up the weight
but<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.110> just<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.500> even<00:02:07.890> close<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.159> enough

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
but it's just not even close to enough

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.479 
but it's just not even close to enough
like<00:02:08.959> you<00:02:09.959> definitely<00:02:10.409> have<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.769> do<00:02:11.099> some<00:02:11.370> kind

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
like you definitely have to do some kind

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.140 
like you definitely have to do some kind
of<00:02:11.579> gluing<00:02:12.000> or<00:02:12.180> modding<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.750> get<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> legs

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
of gluing or modding to get the legs

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.580 
of gluing or modding to get the legs
up<00:02:15.599> where<00:02:15.900> they're<00:02:16.019> supposed<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.290> be<00:02:16.379> I<00:02:16.439> guess

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
up where they're supposed to be I guess

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.449 
up where they're supposed to be I guess
I<00:02:16.709> keep<00:02:16.860> calling<00:02:17.129> them<00:02:17.189> legs<00:02:17.430> but<00:02:17.760> these<00:02:18.360> lower

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
I keep calling them legs but these lower

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.280 
I keep calling them legs but these lower
boosters<00:02:20.459> up<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.720> where<00:02:21.810> they're<00:02:21.930> supposed<00:02:22.230> to

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
boosters up to where they're supposed to

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.149 
boosters up to where they're supposed to
be<00:02:22.879> it's<00:02:23.879> just<00:02:24.000> not<00:02:24.269> going<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.420> happen<00:02:24.599> so<00:02:25.159> let

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
be it's just not going to happen so let

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:28.160 
be it's just not going to happen so let
me<00:02:26.250> move<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:26.849> now<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.269> cannon<00:02:27.599> is<00:02:27.750> really

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
me move this in now the cannon is really

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.830 
me move this in now the cannon is really
really<00:02:28.319> long<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:29.040> think<00:02:30.030> like<00:02:30.360> prime<00:02:30.720> no

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
really long in I think like prime no

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.240 
really long in I think like prime no
need<00:02:30.989> to<00:02:31.079> shout<00:02:31.290> in<00:02:31.439> her<00:02:31.560> video<00:02:31.799> it<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:31.980> nice

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
need to shout in her video it is nice

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.619 
need to shout in her video it is nice
that<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.609> cannon<00:02:32.909> does<00:02:33.030> come<00:02:33.299> out<00:02:33.329> very

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
that the cannon does come out very

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.449 
that the cannon does come out very
easily<00:02:34.280> like<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.879> ever<00:02:36.030> want<00:02:36.299> to

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
easily like that so if you ever want to

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.679 
easily like that so if you ever want to
store<00:02:38.459> it<00:02:38.579> put<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.239> away

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
store it put it away

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:44.360 
store it put it away
it's<00:02:40.170> very<00:02:40.260> easy<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.709> take<00:02:40.859> that<00:02:41.069> out<00:02:43.370> looks

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
it's very easy to take that out looks

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.970 
it's very easy to take that out looks
come<00:02:45.299> closer<00:02:45.989> here<00:02:49.159> okay<00:02:51.109> so<00:02:52.109> as<00:02:52.409> I<00:02:52.680> move<00:02:52.829> this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
come closer here okay so as I move this

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.960 
come closer here okay so as I move this
around<00:02:53.420> also<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:55.370> plastic<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:57.290> not<00:02:58.670> good<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
around also the plastic is not good the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.300 
around also the plastic is not good the
quality<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.569> not<00:03:00.900> good<00:03:01.139> it's<00:03:01.349> very<00:03:01.849> soft<00:03:02.849> and

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
quality is not good it's very soft and

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.369 
quality is not good it's very soft and
parts<00:03:05.310> especially<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:06.389> the<00:03:06.659> yellow<00:03:07.139> is

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
parts especially like the yellow is

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.140 
parts especially like the yellow is
really<00:03:07.799> brittle<00:03:08.069> there's<00:03:08.549> only<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.790> few<00:03:08.970> pieces

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
really brittle there's only a few pieces

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.129 
really brittle there's only a few pieces
of<00:03:09.329> yellow<00:03:09.629> but<00:03:10.370> it's<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:11.609> soft<00:03:11.909> and<00:03:12.359> brittle<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:13.139 
of yellow but it's so soft and brittle I

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:14.300 
of yellow but it's so soft and brittle I
don't<00:03:13.319> know<00:03:13.409> if<00:03:13.769> that's<00:03:14.040> kind<00:03:14.280> of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
don't know if that's kind of

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.030 
don't know if that's kind of
contradicting<00:03:14.970> but<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:16.109> V<00:03:16.290> fan<00:03:16.500> broke<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
contradicting but the V fan broke I

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.189 
contradicting but the V fan broke I
glued<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.670> back<00:03:18.889> this<00:03:20.359> front<00:03:21.359> part<00:03:21.900> this<00:03:22.139> is

the eye field generator off the chest
just<00:03:25.370> just<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.609> of<00:03:26.730> wrist<00:03:27.000> rests<00:03:27.389> on<00:03:27.510> there

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
just just kind of wrist rests on there

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.610 
just just kind of wrist rests on there
by<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> little<00:03:28.319> hook<00:03:29.870> red<00:03:30.870> part<00:03:31.139> there<00:03:31.349> just

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
by a little hook red part there just

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.509 
by a little hook red part there just
kind<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:32.299> slots<00:03:33.299> onto<00:03:33.659> there<00:03:33.840> that's<00:03:34.139> it

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
kind of slots onto there that's it

the<00:03:35.519> lower<00:03:35.730> one<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:38.239> not<00:03:39.239> much<00:03:39.449> better<00:03:39.690> it's

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
the lower one is not much better it's

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.409 
the lower one is not much better it's
just<00:03:40.290> one<00:03:40.620> poly<00:03:41.579> cap<00:03:41.879> that<00:03:42.060> just<00:03:42.209> kind<00:03:42.389> of

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419 
just one poly cap that just kind of

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.059 
just one poly cap that just kind of
holds<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.780> on<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.379> comes<00:03:43.620> off<00:03:43.769> all<00:03:43.979> the

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069

mechanism<00:03:55.250> is<00:03:55.340> kind<00:03:55.549> of<00:03:55.610> alright<00:03:55.909> but<00:03:56.150> just

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
mechanism is kind of alright but just

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.690 
mechanism is kind of alright but just

details but like on the gun as with the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.660 
details but like on the gun as with the
rest<00:04:11.569> of<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.810> kit<00:04:12.019> a<00:04:12.230> lot<00:04:12.950> of<00:04:13.069> parts<00:04:13.400> just

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
rest of the kit a lot of parts just

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.719 
rest of the kit a lot of parts just
don't<00:04:13.879> fit<00:04:14.090> together<00:04:14.239> well<00:04:15.340> which<00:04:16.340> is<00:04:16.489> why<00:04:16.669> you

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
don't fit together well which is why you

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.930 
don't fit together well which is why you
need<00:04:16.940> a<00:04:16.970> glue<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.859> just<00:04:18.859> be<00:04:19.340> prepared<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.820> do<00:04:19.910> a

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
need a glue and just be prepared to do a

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.310 
need a glue and just be prepared to do a
lot<00:04:20.030> of<00:04:20.180> work<00:04:20.419> to<00:04:20.600> get<00:04:20.690> everything<00:04:20.780> fitting

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
lot of work to get everything fitting

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.640 
lot of work to get everything fitting
well<00:04:21.550> the<00:04:22.550> other<00:04:22.669> problem<00:04:22.880> is<00:04:23.389> that<00:04:26.410> on<00:04:27.410> mine

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
well the other problem is that on mine

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.310 
well the other problem is that on mine
and<00:04:27.949> I<00:04:28.100> don't<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.490> didn't<00:04:28.910> recall<00:04:29.750> if<00:04:29.960> Prime

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
and I don't I didn't recall if Prime

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.029

hobby deep striker it's not a cheap kit
and<00:06:30.810> but<00:06:31.810> I<00:06:31.840> mean<00:06:32.020> for<00:06:32.200> how<00:06:32.320> much<00:06:32.530> is<00:06:32.680> there

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:32.980 
and but I mean for how much is there

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.880 
and but I mean for how much is there
like<00:06:33.550> how<00:06:33.970> much<00:06:34.150> just<00:06:34.870> sheer<00:06:35.290> plastic<00:06:35.770> you're

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
like how much just sheer plastic you're

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.370 
like how much just sheer plastic you're
getting<00:06:36.390> you<00:06:37.390> kind<00:06:37.600> of<00:06:37.630> have<00:06:37.780> to<00:06:37.810> expect<00:06:38.260> a

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
getting you kind of have to expect a

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:39.840 
getting you kind of have to expect a
little<00:06:38.530> bit<00:06:38.650> of<00:06:38.770> a<00:06:38.920> price<00:06:39.160> honestly<00:06:39.700> I<00:06:39.730> think

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:39.850 
little bit of a price honestly I think

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:42.600 
little bit of a price honestly I think
it<00:06:40.150> should<00:06:40.420> be<00:06:41.050> a<00:06:41.440> little<00:06:41.860> bit<00:06:41.980> cheaper<00:06:42.160> now

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:42.610 
it should be a little bit cheaper now

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.880 
it should be a little bit cheaper now
after<00:06:43.060> I've<00:06:43.150> built<00:06:44.080> it<00:06:44.230> and<00:06:44.380> seen<00:06:44.560> the<00:06:44.710> quality

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890 
after I've built it and seen the quality

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.840 
after I've built it and seen the quality
of<00:06:45.220> the<00:06:45.340> kit<00:06:45.630> I<00:06:47.100> think<00:06:48.100> now<00:06:48.250> it's<00:06:48.520> usually

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:48.850 
of the kit I think now it's usually

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.570 
of the kit I think now it's usually
going<00:06:49.240> for<00:06:49.450> around<00:06:49.540> one<00:06:50.470> hundred<00:06:50.590> one<00:06:51.550> hundred

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
going for around one hundred one hundred

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.070 
going for around one hundred one hundred
and<00:06:51.880> ten<00:06:52.030> dollars<00:06:52.210> like<00:06:52.630> that<00:06:52.840> it<00:06:53.050> really

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 
and ten dollars like that it really

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.840 
and ten dollars like that it really
should<00:06:53.620> be<00:06:53.770> more<00:06:53.980> like<00:06:54.280> eighty<00:06:55.150> I<00:06:55.560> think<00:06:56.850> like

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
should be more like eighty I think like

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.270 
should be more like eighty I think like
