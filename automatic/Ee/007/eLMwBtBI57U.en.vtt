 So, who actually stays together with a modern billion Rudolf Rupp?

 Sensitive rules and supple driving is for the data at all 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:31.169

 during this shooting confessed the two wheels of the middle axis the program 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.809
 one millimeter lower than the four other wheels 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.999
 put the locomotive on a smooth surface a rail 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.969

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.759
 so the weight of the DOSB weighs on noon kicked-out wheels 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.739

 he lags behind clearly 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.979
 so it can happen that the locomotive with squealing brakes already 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.499
