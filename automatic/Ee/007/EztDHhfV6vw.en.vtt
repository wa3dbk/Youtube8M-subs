should know that a standard of the video

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
should know that a standard of the video
signal<00:01:13.650> which<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.189> sent<00:01:14.490> over<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.939> fibre<00:01:15.180> are

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
signal which is sent over the fibre are

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.859 
signal which is sent over the fibre are
just<00:01:16.350> industry<00:01:17.070> standard<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.720> be

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
just industry standard and you can be

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.230 
just industry standard and you can be
sure<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.439> all<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.070> units<00:01:20.460> what<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:21.000> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
sure that all the units what you get you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.270

can<00:01:21.450> use<00:01:21.600> at<00:01:21.780> any<00:01:21.930> application<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.130> just

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
can use at any application but it's just

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
can use at any application but it's just
limited<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.119> fantasy<00:01:25.909> not<00:01:26.909> only<00:01:27.330> video

most<00:02:07.129> common<00:02:08.129> applications<00:02:08.869> here<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> can

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
most common applications here you can

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.690 
most common applications here you can
see<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.920> is<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.160> most<00:02:11.370> standard

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
see there is the most standard

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.970 
see there is the most standard
application<00:02:12.629> where<00:02:12.840> is<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:13.410> DV

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
application where is a and DV

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.030 
application where is a and DV
mm<00:02:14.879> unit<00:02:15.239> so<00:02:15.450> that's<00:02:15.629> two<00:02:16.019> cameras<00:02:16.560> over<00:02:16.739> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
mm unit so that's two cameras over the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.890 
mm unit so that's two cameras over the
fiber<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:17.909> can<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.330> at<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.599> remote

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
fiber and then you can see at the remote

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.149 
fiber and then you can see at the remote
side<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.860> two<00:02:20.069> monitors<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.709> here<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> can

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
side the two monitors so here you can

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.550 
side the two monitors so here you can
see<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.879> most<00:02:24.120> standard<00:02:24.560> application

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
see that the most standard application

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.220 
see that the most standard application
and<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:25.920> most<00:02:26.099> standards<00:02:26.670> for<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.120> video<00:02:27.569> so

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
and the most standards for the video so

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.009 
and the most standards for the video so
you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.500> see<00:02:28.560> we<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.129> pal<00:02:29.700> ntsc<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
you can see we have a pal ntsc and a

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.259 
you can see we have a pal ntsc and a
second<00:02:31.440> signal<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.099> the<00:02:32.250> video<00:02:32.549> connector

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
second signal and the video connector

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.039 
second signal and the video connector
are<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> pinisi<00:02:35.000> audio<00:02:36.000> signal<00:02:36.480> transmission

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:37.049 
are the pinisi audio signal transmission

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.710 
are the pinisi audio signal transmission
scenario<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.280> can<00:02:38.549> send<00:02:38.819> all<00:02:39.030> single

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
scenario so you can send all single

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.750 
scenario so you can send all single
direction<00:02:40.200> sound<00:02:40.500> or<00:02:40.829> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.129> send<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.579> bit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
direction sound or you can send a bit

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.880 
direction sound or you can send a bit
directional<00:02:42.360> sound<00:02:42.629> so<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.930> can<00:02:43.019> see<00:02:43.409> here<00:02:43.739> we

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
directional sound so you can see here we

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.520 
directional sound so you can see here we
see<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.310> application<00:02:45.090> where<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.079> camera

our website at wwe.com Taiwan so the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.610 
our website at wwe.com Taiwan so the
data<00:03:13.530> interface<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.430> like<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:15.620> synchronous

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
data interface is like a synchronous

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.539 
data interface is like a synchronous
data<00:03:17.870> rs-232<00:03:18.870> or<00:03:19.079> any<00:03:19.319> other<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.980> synchronous

data rs-232 or any other a synchronous

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.909 
data rs-232 or any other a synchronous
data<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.900> get<00:03:22.049> any<00:03:22.349> assing

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
data you can you can get any assing

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.479 
data you can you can get any assing
interface<00:03:23.549> you<00:03:23.760> ask<00:03:24.180> it's<00:03:25.049> usually<00:03:25.380> used<00:03:26.010> for

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
interface you ask it's usually used for

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.909 
interface you ask it's usually used for
the<00:03:26.609> lens<00:03:26.849> focusing<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:27.810> rotation<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.590> zoom

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:28.919 
the lens focusing and rotation and zoom

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.280 
the lens focusing and rotation and zoom
of<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.400> camera<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.060> that's<00:03:30.239> called<00:03:30.540> PTZ

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
of the camera so that's called PTZ

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.159 
of the camera so that's called PTZ
control<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.489> together<00:03:32.669> with<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.180> video<00:03:33.419> you

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
control so together with the video you

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.190 
control so together with the video you
can<00:03:34.230> get<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.799> signal<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.430> well<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.139> think

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
can get this signal as well so I think

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.289 
can get this signal as well so I think
interface<00:03:37.950> parameters<00:03:38.579> are<00:03:38.730> also<00:03:38.970> standard

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
interface parameters are also standard

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.699 
interface parameters are also standard
another<00:03:42.299> application<00:03:42.780> which<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.230> may<00:03:43.440> need

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
another application which you may need

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
another application which you may need
to<00:03:44.099> send<00:03:44.370> together<00:03:44.790> with<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> video<00:03:45.359> over<00:03:45.810> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
to send together with the video over the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.170 
to send together with the video over the
fibre<00:03:46.169> are<00:03:46.440> Ethernet<00:03:47.130> so<00:03:47.609> you<00:03:47.669> can<00:03:47.940> see

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
fibre are Ethernet so you can see

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.129 
fibre are Ethernet so you can see
together<00:03:48.810> with<00:03:49.319> the<00:03:49.470> video<00:03:49.760> audio<00:03:50.760> or<00:03:51.090> RS<00:03:51.780> data

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
together with the video audio or RS data

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.319 
together with the video audio or RS data
you<00:03:52.470> can<00:03:52.650> send<00:03:52.919> also<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> Ethernet<00:03:54.060> so<00:03:54.269> you

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
you can send also the Ethernet so you

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.479 
you can send also the Ethernet so you
can<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.930> can<00:03:54.959> connect<00:03:55.410> some<00:03:55.590> remote<00:03:55.859> LAN<00:03:56.220> or
