let's<00:04:31.090> try<00:04:31.270> playing<00:04:31.389> in<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.930> right<00:04:32.169> way<00:04:32.320> this

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
let's try playing in the right way this

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.779 
let's try playing in the right way this
time<00:04:33.780> yes<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:35.560> doesn't<00:04:35.770> tell<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.610> how<00:04:36.639> to

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
time yes it doesn't tell you how to

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.999 
time yes it doesn't tell you how to
bring<00:04:37.000> it<00:04:37.090> put<00:04:37.270> them<00:04:37.389> in<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:38.830> just

way<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.259> batteries<00:05:14.590> go<00:05:14.770> so<00:05:16.289> again<00:05:19.289> let's<00:05:20.289> try

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
way the batteries go so again let's try

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.610 
way the batteries go so again let's try
that<00:05:22.949> there<00:05:23.949> it<00:05:24.099> goes<00:05:24.310> I<00:05:24.490> finally<00:05:24.820> got<00:05:25.150> it<00:05:25.210> up

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
that so I'll set it up maybe do a review

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.750 
that so I'll set it up maybe do a review
tomorrow<00:05:32.590> and<00:05:33.419> see<00:05:34.419> you<00:05:34.510> guys
