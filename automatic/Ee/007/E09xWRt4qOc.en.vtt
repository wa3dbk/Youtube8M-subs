know it's like there's a lot of people

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.910

that<00:00:58.790> are<00:00:58.879> going<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.210> do<00:00:59.329> something<00:00:59.920> but

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
that are going to do something but

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.740 
that are going to do something but
probably<00:01:01.550> never<00:01:01.700> come<00:01:01.820> around<00:01:02.059> to<00:01:02.390> it<00:01:02.539> for

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
probably never come around to it for

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.560 
probably never come around to it for
some<00:01:02.930> reason<00:01:02.960> maybe<00:01:03.649> because<00:01:03.980> they're<00:01:04.129> just

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
some reason maybe because they're just

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.940 
some reason maybe because they're just
there<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.600> socialize<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.470> tell<00:01:06.680> people

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
there to socialize and tell people

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.440 
there to socialize and tell people
they're<00:01:07.070> gonna<00:01:07.190> do<00:01:07.369> something<00:01:07.700> you<00:01:07.880> should

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
they're gonna do something you should

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.139 
they're gonna do something you should
just<00:01:08.600> start<00:01:08.869> doing<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:10.009> and<00:01:10.369> not<00:01:10.550> talk<00:01:10.940> too

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
just start doing and and not talk too

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.450 
just start doing and and not talk too
much<00:01:11.270> about<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.630> I<00:01:11.930> think<00:01:12.259> if<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.070> talk<00:01:13.250> too

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
much about it I think if you talk too

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.980 
much about it I think if you talk too
much<00:01:13.490> about<00:01:13.640> something<00:01:14.209> maybe<00:01:14.569> you<00:01:14.720> don't<00:01:14.810> get

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
much about something maybe you don't get

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.180 
much about something maybe you don't get
around<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.289> doing<00:01:15.319> it<00:01:15.560> cuz<00:01:15.740> people<00:01:15.979> like<00:01:16.100> oh

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
around to doing it cuz people like oh

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.419 
around to doing it cuz people like oh
that's<00:01:16.399> such<00:01:16.520> a<00:01:16.550> great<00:01:16.729> idea<00:01:16.819> oh<00:01:17.450> wow<00:01:18.289> and<00:01:18.950> then

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
that's such a great idea oh wow and then

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:20.770 
that's such a great idea oh wow and then
you're<00:01:19.550> like<00:01:19.640> yeah<00:01:19.819> you<00:01:20.060> feel<00:01:20.240> so<00:01:20.420> good<00:01:20.450> you

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
you're like yeah you feel so good you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.510 
you're like yeah you feel so good you
came<00:01:20.869> up<00:01:21.020> with<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.170> great<00:01:21.229> idea<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:21.950> it's

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
came up with this great idea and it's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.029 
came up with this great idea and it's
sort<00:01:22.610> of<00:01:22.759> satisfying<00:01:23.360> enough<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:24.649> just<00:01:24.860> stop

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
sort of satisfying enough to just stop

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.480 
sort of satisfying enough to just stop
there<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.929> think<00:01:27.200> maybe<00:01:27.649> you<00:01:28.250> should<00:01:28.280> just

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
there and I think maybe you should just

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.120 
there and I think maybe you should just
begin<00:01:29.360> your<00:01:29.569> idea<00:01:29.869> begin<00:01:30.319> to<00:01:30.500> write<00:01:30.679> it<00:01:30.800> begin

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
begin your idea begin to write it begin

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.219 
begin your idea begin to write it begin
to<00:01:31.340> look<00:01:31.610> for<00:01:31.880> ways<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.060> do<00:01:32.450> it<00:01:32.630> if<00:01:32.929> you<00:01:33.020> really

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
to look for ways to do it if you really

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.449 
to look for ways to do it if you really
want<00:01:33.470> to<00:01:33.530> make<00:01:33.679> something<00:01:33.950> I<00:01:34.160> think<00:01:34.220> you

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
want to make something I think you

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:36.969 
want to make something I think you
should<00:01:34.490> just<00:01:34.640> make<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.270> think<00:01:35.569> today<00:01:35.979> we

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
should just make it I think today we

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.370 
should just make it I think today we
have<00:01:37.190> the<00:01:37.340> ability<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.880> make<00:01:37.910> things<00:01:38.380> for

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
have the ability to make things for

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.580 
have the ability to make things for
inexpensive<00:01:39.830> you<00:01:40.369> know<00:01:40.459> for<00:01:40.640> less<00:01:40.789> money<00:01:40.819> and

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
inexpensive you know for less money and

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.809 
inexpensive you know for less money and
I<00:01:42.590> think<00:01:42.800> it's<00:01:42.950> important<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.369> use<00:01:43.550> those

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
I think it's important to use those

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.029 
I think it's important to use those
technologies<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.020> things<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.530> be<00:01:45.679> able<00:01:45.890> to

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
technologies and things to be able to

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.490 
technologies and things to be able to
begin<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:46.490> do<00:01:47.179> what<00:01:47.330> you<00:01:47.450> want<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.750> do<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.080> be

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
begin to do what you want to do and be

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.499 
begin to do what you want to do and be
independent<00:01:48.679> you<00:01:49.190> know<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:49.429> like<00:01:49.580> what<00:01:50.360> I've

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
independent you know it's like what I've

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.169 
independent you know it's like what I've
always<00:01:50.690> been<00:01:50.780> told<00:01:51.080> from<00:01:51.410> my<00:01:51.770> family<00:01:52.069> is<00:01:52.369> be

always been told from my family is be

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.919 
always been told from my family is be
independent<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.670> don't<00:01:55.670> sort<00:01:56.509> of<00:01:56.599> give<00:01:56.810> your

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
independent and don't sort of give your

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.410 
independent and don't sort of give your
power<00:01:57.140> away<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.500> somebody<00:01:57.770> else<00:01:58.420> because

power away to somebody else because

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.850
