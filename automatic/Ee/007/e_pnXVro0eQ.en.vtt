00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.059 

we're<00:00:05.340> gonna<00:00:05.490> address<00:00:05.880> this<00:00:06.720> new<00:00:07.710> thing

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
we're gonna address this new thing

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.740 
we're gonna address this new thing
that's<00:00:08.309> going<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.180> internet<00:00:09.540> about

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
that's going on on the internet about

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.840 
that's going on on the internet about
gastric<00:00:10.020> plication<00:00:10.379> and<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.370> risk<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
gastric plication and the risk of

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.740 
gastric plication and the risk of
perforation<00:00:12.559> now<00:00:13.730> we<00:00:14.730> have<00:00:14.910> an<00:00:15.030> accumulated

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
perforation now we have an accumulated

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.960 
perforation now we have an accumulated
experience<00:00:16.380> we've<00:00:16.710> done<00:00:17.009> around<00:00:17.430> 2<00:00:17.759> minutes

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
experience we've done around 2 minutes

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.620 
experience we've done around 2 minutes
30<00:00:18.210> cases<00:00:18.830> Counting<00:00:20.090> today<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.390> will<00:00:21.510> be

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
30 cases Counting today so it will be

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.410 
30 cases Counting today so it will be
around<00:00:21.840> 236<00:00:23.689> our<00:00:25.279> other<00:00:26.279> Mexican<00:00:26.850> experience

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
around 236 our other Mexican experience

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.330 
around 236 our other Mexican experience
is<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.590> 60<00:00:29.810> and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.230> Brazilians<00:00:31.949> are<00:00:32.160> over

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
is up to 60 and the Brazilians are over

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.090 
is up to 60 and the Brazilians are over
300<00:00:33.150> so<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.989> was<00:00:34.199> that<00:00:34.680> would<00:00:34.830> put<00:00:35.010> us

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
300 so that was that would put us

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
300 so that was that would put us
roughly<00:00:35.400> at<00:00:35.699> around<00:00:35.879> 600<00:00:36.360> cases<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
roughly at around 600 cases and the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650 
roughly at around 600 cases and the
interesting<00:00:38.309> thing<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.820> all<00:00:39.000> learned<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
interesting thing is we all learned the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.020 
interesting thing is we all learned the
technique<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.739> very<00:00:40.980> similar<00:00:41.309> way<00:00:41.520> our

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
technique in a very similar way our

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.080 
technique in a very similar way our
technique<00:00:42.690> our<00:00:42.899> suturing<00:00:43.559> technique<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.550> what

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
technique our suturing technique is what

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.410 
technique our suturing technique is what
permits<00:00:45.629> us<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.899> be<00:00:46.820> complication<00:00:47.820> treat<00:00:48.210> and

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
permits us to be complication treat and

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.680 
permits us to be complication treat and
let<00:00:48.719> me<00:00:48.870> explain

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
let me explain

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
let me explain
we<00:00:51.690> have<00:00:51.899> calibrated<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:55.340> know<00:00:56.340> calibrated

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
we have calibrated to know calibrated

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.290 
we have calibrated to know calibrated
tube<00:00:57.270> being<00:00:57.719> introduced<00:00:58.260> into<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> stomach

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
tube being introduced into the stomach

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.270 
tube being introduced into the stomach
now<00:01:00.300> there's<00:01:00.539> reasons<00:01:01.110> there's<00:01:01.500> reasons<00:01:02.070> why

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
now there's reasons there's reasons why

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.939 
now there's reasons there's reasons why
we<00:01:02.550> do<00:01:02.699> two<00:01:03.000> lines<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.539> sutures<00:01:04.110> very

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
we do two lines of sutures very

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:15.200 
we do two lines of sutures very
difficult<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.450> able<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.020> create<00:01:14.210> tubular

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
difficult to be able to create tubular

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.440 
difficult to be able to create tubular
stomach<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.930> want<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.920> with<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.369> lines<00:01:17.670> so

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
stomach we want just with one lines so

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.060 
stomach we want just with one lines so
the<00:01:18.540> first<00:01:18.810> line<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.140> sutures<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> be

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
the first line of sutures is going to be

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.719 
the first line of sutures is going to be
an<00:01:20.159> independent<00:01:20.460> length<00:01:21.740> which<00:01:22.740> means<00:01:22.979> one

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
an independent length which means one

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.100 
an independent length which means one
stitch<00:01:24.509> one<00:01:25.080> knot<00:01:25.350> if<00:01:26.130> they're<00:01:26.310> far<00:01:26.670> apart<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
stitch one knot if they're far apart and

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.490 
stitch one knot if they're far apart and
I'll<00:01:28.229> explain<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.860> minute<00:01:29.930> so<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.350> going

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
I'll explain in a minute so it's going

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.399 
I'll explain in a minute so it's going
to<00:01:31.560> be<00:01:31.710> sparingly<00:01:32.310> through<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.850> hole<00:01:33.409> greater

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
to be sparingly through the hole greater

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.319 
to be sparingly through the hole greater
curvature<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.549> outer<00:01:35.790> edge<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
curvature for the outer edge of the

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.560 
curvature for the outer edge of the
stomach<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.530> second<00:01:38.159> line<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.790> sutures<00:01:39.299> will

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
stomach the second line of sutures will

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.510 
stomach the second line of sutures will
be<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.320> actually<00:01:40.350> contains<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
be the one that actually contains the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.210 
be the one that actually contains the
stomach<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.180> itself<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.799> running

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
stomach in itself and it's a running

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.749 
stomach in itself and it's a running
suture<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:46.020> combination<00:01:46.770> is<00:01:46.979> what<00:01:47.189> creates

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
suture this combination is what creates

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.230 
suture this combination is what creates
a<00:01:48.060> safe<00:01:48.570> gastric<00:01:49.290> plication<00:01:49.500> free<00:01:50.490> from<00:01:51.060> these

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a safe gastric plication free from these

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.569 
a safe gastric plication free from these
gastric<00:01:51.840> perforation<00:01:52.020> now<00:01:52.799> with<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.310> start

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
gastric perforation now with a start

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:54.390 
gastric perforation now with a start

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
surgery

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.260 
surgery
and<00:01:54.490> I'll<00:01:55.090> explain<00:01:55.600> as<00:01:55.780> we<00:01:55.810> go<00:01:55.930> through
