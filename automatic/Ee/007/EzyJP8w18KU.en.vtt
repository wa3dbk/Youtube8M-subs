sits on top like that whenever you want

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.330 
sits on top like that whenever you want
or<00:03:10.750> you<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.049> lift<00:03:11.290> this<00:03:11.440> corner<00:03:11.799> up<00:03:11.950> or

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
or you just lift this corner up or

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.030 
or you just lift this corner up or
corner<00:03:12.670> up<00:03:12.790> go<00:03:13.330> it<00:03:13.480> up<00:03:13.600> to<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.989> PVC<00:03:14.470> pipe<00:03:14.680> and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
corner up go it up to the PVC pipe and

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.120 
corner up go it up to the PVC pipe and
you're<00:03:15.790> good<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.060> go<00:03:16.260> so<00:03:17.260> there's<00:03:17.920> two<00:03:18.100> ways

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
you're good to go so there's two ways

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.120 
you're good to go so there's two ways
you<00:03:18.489> can<00:03:18.730> use<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.320> one<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.500> can<00:03:20.680> imagine

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
you can use this one you can imagine

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.470 
you can use this one you can imagine
this<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.489> your<00:03:21.610> soil<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:21.910> just<00:03:22.090> put<00:03:22.209> your<00:03:22.299> soil

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
this as your soil you just put your soil

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.050 
this as your soil you just put your soil
in<00:03:22.840> there<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.040> go<00:03:24.250> your<00:03:24.400> plants<00:03:24.700> out<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.850> that

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
in there and go your plants out of that

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:31.550 
in there and go your plants out of that
another<00:03:25.840> way<00:03:26.110> which<00:03:27.010> works<00:03:27.310> very<00:03:27.400> well<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:30.450> to

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
another way which works very well is to

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.680 
another way which works very well is to
take<00:03:32.560> a<00:03:32.590> pot<00:03:33.220> or<00:03:33.400> something<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:33.910> run<00:03:34.329> some

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
take a pot or something and run some

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.330 
take a pot or something and run some
wicking<00:03:35.260> material<00:03:35.739> through<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:35.890> bottom<00:03:36.250> of

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
wicking material through the bottom of

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.590 
wicking material through the bottom of
it<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.700> can't<00:03:36.880> really<00:03:37.000> there's<00:03:37.299> a<00:03:37.329> roots<00:03:37.480> on

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
it you can't really there's a roots on

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.120 
it you can't really there's a roots on
this<00:03:37.780> but<00:03:37.930> this<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.079> peel<00:03:38.320> on<00:03:38.470> I<00:03:38.680> ran<00:03:38.920> through

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
this but this is peel on I ran through

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.710 
this but this is peel on I ran through
the<00:03:39.250> bottom<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:40.060> strips<00:03:40.360> they're<00:03:40.630> about

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
the bottom and the strips they're about

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.569 
the bottom and the strips they're about
four<00:03:40.930> inch<00:03:41.049> strips<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.440> they<00:03:41.530> go<00:03:41.680> halfway<00:03:42.280> up

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
four inch strips and they go halfway up

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.150 
four inch strips and they go halfway up
into<00:03:42.790> the<00:03:42.880> media<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> whole<00:03:44.049> thing<00:03:44.260> gets

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
into the media so the whole thing gets

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.240 
into the media so the whole thing gets
nice<00:03:45.430> and<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.820> moist<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.750> keeps<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.019> at

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
nice and and moist and keeps it at

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.380 
nice and and moist and keeps it at
perfect<00:03:48.250> keel<00:03:48.340> capacity<00:03:48.880> and<00:03:48.970> you<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.180> set

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
perfect keel capacity and you just set

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.979 
perfect keel capacity and you just set
these<00:03:49.600> like<00:03:50.670> that<00:03:51.670> and<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.570> you<00:03:52.660> get<00:03:52.810> them

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
these like that and if you get them

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.810 
these like that and if you get them
they'll<00:03:53.530> fit<00:03:53.769> they<00:03:54.220> don't<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.610> know<00:03:54.640> they'll

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
they'll fit they don't you know they'll

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.030 
they'll fit they don't you know they'll
fill<00:03:54.970> the<00:03:55.000> whole<00:03:55.209> thing<00:03:55.239> up<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.720> then<00:03:56.320> I<00:03:56.620> used

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
fill the whole thing up and then I used

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.460 
fill the whole thing up and then I used
to<00:03:57.100> start<00:03:57.280> seed<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:57.970> I'll<00:03:58.870> start<00:03:59.110> my<00:03:59.200> lettuce

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
to start seed so I'll start my lettuce

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.560 
to start seed so I'll start my lettuce
and<00:03:59.590> these<00:03:59.769> plant<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.280> these<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.730> I'll<00:04:01.360> take

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
and these plant and these and I'll take

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.060 
and these plant and these and I'll take
them<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.840> Transplant<00:04:02.320> them<00:04:02.380> to<00:04:02.799> somewhere

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
them and Transplant them to somewhere

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.650 
them and Transplant them to somewhere
else<00:04:03.130> or<00:04:03.549> I'll<00:04:03.670> move<00:04:04.060> them<00:04:04.180> out<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.390> there<00:04:04.480> but

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
else or I'll move them out of there but

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.390 
else or I'll move them out of there but
it's<00:04:04.780> a<00:04:04.810> great<00:04:04.959> way<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:05.110> start<00:04:05.410> see<00:04:06.160> because

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
it's a great way to start see because

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.480 
it's a great way to start see because
you<00:04:06.519> can<00:04:06.700> control<00:04:06.910> the<00:04:07.030> moisture<00:04:07.180> content

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
you can control the moisture content

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.570 
you can control the moisture content
and<00:04:09.710> you<00:04:10.710> know<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.860> can<00:04:11.040> kind<00:04:11.160> of<00:04:11.250> walk<00:04:11.400> away

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
and you know you can kind of walk away

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.290 
and you know you can kind of walk away
and<00:04:11.820> leave<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.120> and<00:04:12.210> let<00:04:12.270> it<00:04:12.360> do<00:04:12.540> its<00:04:12.570> thing

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
and leave it and let it do its thing

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.030 
and leave it and let it do its thing
so<00:04:15.300> that<00:04:15.480> is<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.630> self-watering<00:04:16.170> tray<00:04:16.709> this

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
so that is a self-watering tray this

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.420 
so that is a self-watering tray this
concept<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:17.640> be<00:04:17.670> applied<00:04:18.020> in<00:04:19.100> many<00:04:20.100> many

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
concept can be applied in many many

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.190 
concept can be applied in many many
different<00:04:20.760> situations<00:04:21.000> and<00:04:21.630> pretty<00:04:21.900> much<00:04:21.989> any

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
different situations and pretty much any

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.260 
different situations and pretty much any
size<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.650> can<00:04:22.770> use<00:04:22.800> fabulet<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:23.820> you<00:04:23.910> can<00:04:24.060> use

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
size you can use fabulet so you can use

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.660 
size you can use fabulet so you can use
gutters<00:04:25.230> with<00:04:25.590> trays<00:04:25.920> a<00:04:25.950> gutter<00:04:26.460> with<00:04:26.640> a
