00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that's the first one it's one of the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.880 
that's the first one it's one of the
first<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.550> because<00:00:47.760> obviously<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> ps1

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.180 

maybe<00:03:18.830> just<00:03:19.069> as<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:20.349> mage<00:03:21.349> is<00:03:21.530> bad<00:03:21.739> at<00:03:21.920> loading

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190

that's<00:03:27.110> why<00:03:27.940> but<00:03:28.940> other<00:03:29.239> than<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.690> sometimes

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
that's why but other than it sometimes

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.540 
that's why but other than it sometimes
freezes<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.620> everything<00:03:30.950> on<00:03:31.069> certain<00:03:31.340> games

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
freezes and everything on certain games

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.729 
freezes and everything on certain games
it<00:03:32.239> is<00:03:32.269> a<00:03:32.390> really<00:03:32.810> really<00:03:32.930> good<00:03:33.140> emulator

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
it is a really really good emulator

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.920 
it is a really really good emulator
I<00:03:33.920> very<00:03:34.730> much<00:03:34.819> recommend<00:03:35.120> buying<00:03:35.569> it<00:03:35.750> if<00:03:35.840> you

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
I very much recommend buying it if you

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.080 
I very much recommend buying it if you
if<00:03:36.440> you<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:36.860> playing<00:03:37.069> on<00:03:37.250> additional<00:03:37.880> games

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
there's a zoom up of it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.070 
there's a zoom up of it
it<00:03:39.830> isn't<00:03:40.130> 4:3<00:03:40.550> format<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:41.720> course<00:03:41.959> they

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
it isn't 4:3 format of course they

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.839 
it isn't 4:3 format of course they
didn't<00:03:42.410> have<00:03:42.440> widescreen<00:03:42.890> TVs<00:03:43.340> really<00:03:43.670> back

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
didn't have widescreen TVs really back

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:46.150 
didn't have widescreen TVs really back
when<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.269> PlayStation<00:03:44.780> 1<00:03:44.900> was<00:03:45.049> around<00:03:45.290> so

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
when the PlayStation 1 was around so

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.440 
when the PlayStation 1 was around so
it's<00:03:46.910> probably<00:03:47.269> why<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.860> like<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.730> said<00:03:49.940> very

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
it's probably why and like I said very

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.039 
it's probably why and like I said very
good<00:03:51.549> worth<00:03:52.549> it's<00:03:52.910> very<00:03:53.420> much<00:03:53.599> worth<00:03:53.780> the

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
good worth it's very much worth the

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.759 
good worth it's very much worth the
money<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.470> recommend<00:03:55.340> downloading<00:03:55.459> it<00:03:55.910> and

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
money I recommend downloading it and
