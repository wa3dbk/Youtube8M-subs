00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.839
 happened what way are we going to make a 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 criminal complaint and gentleman with a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.760
 instrumental documentary and 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 quite pretty testimonial 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 overwhelming 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 well a step that was pointed out these 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.789
 girls are the state of excitement and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.500
 total fury 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.879
 function enter 300 friends of them who 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.430
 to which the confederations 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.320
 he had given entrance and good to two 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.060
 hours that were 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.730
 they produced misfortune of quite a trip 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.450
 and how can we quantify those 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.450
 chunks has been quantified 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.400
 temporarily in the 40 thousand pesos but 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.130
 Believe me that for my clients it has not been 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:03.280
 this the worst the operation the moment of 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:07.290
 tension this and absolute consternation 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:11.020
 who lived fortunately for this 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:14.370
 virulence and this aggressiveness in addition to 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.370
 unjustified and illusion 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.360
 two hours begins this simply with 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.920
 the girls having a fight 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 within the place or simply 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 it was about an aggressive celebration 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.730
 because cataloging one can do what 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.020
 that one wants 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:40.370
 the version my client gives me as 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.690
 they arrived I already want in a tone 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.360
 more than aggressive, suing and insulting 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.180
 by the fact that his friends my people 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.220
 Lucian Aymar said they had not 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.670
 guest, here you have to make a 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.830
 parenthesis the agreement 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.920
 I would like to emphasize that in the agreement 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.680
 There was no university or anyone paid or 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.119
 nobody charged anything triple point but of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.520
 agreement with the Argentine confederation 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.080
 that was the one that asked my clients 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.100
 that they lend from the local for the party 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.660
 closing 100 thousand tickets were delivered 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 650 for a bone cancer being already the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.480
 milk and the rest for an hour later 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.790
 then confederations and obviously 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.459
 the anger may have come around 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.260
 because he never tired of repeating and of 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.200
 insult that they had given them five 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.560
 tickets to each use when they arrived a 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 very this one I already say very well in a very 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.620
 attractive 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.170
 the first thing they said they wanted 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.840
 that after knowing that six or ten and another 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.000
 day thing explicitly that they do not leave 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.989
 enter the journalists there were 400 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.459
 americas geneticists 400 of means 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.500
 national and foreign mills 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:59.659
 even if he did not enter and they also had no 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.980
 be with the other delegations or with 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.819
 the people of the confederation itself 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.969
 Argentina although obviously something 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:14.420
 happened between the end of the game and 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:18.440
 when the Castilian that is the something happened 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:23.430
 we assume that some 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.160
 divergence a known difference because 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 instead of arriving with a climate this 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.970
 cash 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.580
 to read called centers arrived 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.230
 insulting and screaming and posing 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.530
 they did not miss their friends 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.760
 and ranting against the confederation 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.830
 created and meet each one and that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.730
 the cooperation had divided the other 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:51.510
 missions and may have to see the 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.920
 alcohol with these exclusive of any 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.350
 way the destruction of 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.150
 no way but there is this added to 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.700
 alcohol to what you mention of something 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.020
 happened not trying to understand what soil 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.590
 be passed by a team that has 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.590
 impeccable behavior 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.460
 to see if you can do a lot of 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.520
 conjectures we are not going to 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:17.800
 manifest anything that we can not prove 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.670
 because we want to have the most 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.790
 it would be that we can objectively I can 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.310
 claim that there were some of the girls 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.200
 who had already taken alcohol when 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:31.450
 they arrived at the premises that on the other hand 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
 logical arrived at 3 in the morning the 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.590
 party ended at 8 o'clock was night 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.020
 If it changes, do not leave. 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.300
 they took something if I do not I will not have 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.970
 an attitude this to tasting to pretend 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.010
 that they drink mineral water that of none 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.990
 way in fact 500 bottles were taken 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.090
 of champagne but that's what we wanted 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.450
 ask sign 500 bottles between 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.050

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:58.150
