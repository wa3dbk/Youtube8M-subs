00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
only assume would be general play which

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.480 
only assume would be general play which
is<00:02:12.060> basic

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
is basic

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.450 
is basic
we<00:02:12.580> you<00:02:13.300> have<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.690> arrows<00:02:13.990> pointing<00:02:14.710> to

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
we you have the arrows pointing to

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.210 
we you have the arrows pointing to
whatever<00:02:15.760> way<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> winds<00:02:16.360> going<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:17.220> the

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
whatever way the winds going and the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.910 
whatever way the winds going and the
speed<00:02:18.580> they're<00:02:18.880> moving<00:02:19.180> at<00:02:19.440> basically<00:02:20.440> judges

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
speed they're moving at basically judges

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.200 
speed they're moving at basically judges
how<00:02:21.220> fast<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.970> winds<00:02:22.150> moving<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.910> how<00:02:24.910> strong

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
how fast the winds moving so how strong

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.570 
how fast the winds moving so how strong
the<00:02:25.330> wind<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.750> will<00:02:26.200> be<00:02:26.470> dependent<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.340> that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
the wind is will be dependent on that

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.300 
the wind is will be dependent on that
rather<00:02:27.820> than<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.300> set<00:02:28.660> wind<00:02:28.990> speed<00:02:29.440> which<00:02:30.280> is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
rather than a set wind speed which is

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.340 
rather than a set wind speed which is
good<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.700> really<00:02:31.300> liked<00:02:31.540> that<00:02:31.690> in<00:02:32.050> rugby

challenge<00:02:32.830> it<00:02:33.160> added<00:02:33.430> an<00:02:33.580> extra<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.940> made<00:02:37.720> it

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
challenge it added an extra it made it

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.360 
challenge it added an extra it made it
more<00:02:37.990> difficult<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.740> your<00:02:38.890> kicking<00:02:39.220> right

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
more difficult to get your kicking right

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.970 
more difficult to get your kicking right
which<00:02:40.300> is<00:02:40.600> something<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.110> is<00:02:41.410> always<00:02:41.620> good

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
which is something that is always good

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.860 
which is something that is always good
