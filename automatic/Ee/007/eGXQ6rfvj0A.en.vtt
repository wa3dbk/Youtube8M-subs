the<00:01:47.330> first<00:01:47.540> question<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:48.320> are<00:01:48.350> you

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.170 
the first question is what are you
digging<00:01:48.680> for<00:01:48.860> so<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:49.520> always<00:01:49.640> add<00:01:49.850> meat<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
digging for so you always add meat the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.510 
digging for so you always add meat the
reason<00:01:50.540> to<00:01:50.630> take<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.900> perception<00:01:51.430> then<00:01:52.430> we

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
reason to take the perception then we

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.700 
reason to take the perception then we
usually<00:01:52.880> say<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.360> dig<00:01:53.540> for<00:01:53.750> cancer<00:01:54.140> we<00:01:54.440> pick

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.190 
usually say we dig for cancer we pick
for<00:01:54.830> global<00:01:55.160> warming<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.610> they're<00:01:55.760> happy

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
for global warming and they're happy

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.810 
for global warming and they're happy
like<00:01:57.200> they<00:01:57.410> cannot<00:01:57.620> just<00:01:57.890> accept<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.610> you

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
