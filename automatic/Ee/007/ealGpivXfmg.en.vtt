a<00:00:46.460> lot<00:00:46.790> of<00:00:46.820> people<00:00:46.970> change<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.660> Rimel<00:00:48.020> which

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
a lot of people change the Rimel which

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.930 
a lot of people change the Rimel which
obviously<00:00:48.590> get<00:00:48.800> some<00:00:48.920> a<00:00:49.130> certain<00:00:49.640> amount<00:00:49.760> of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
obviously get some a certain amount of

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.050 
obviously get some a certain amount of
protection<00:00:50.090> to<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.660> wrist<00:00:50.840> joint<00:00:51.340> okay<00:00:52.340> now

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:53.060 
protection to the wrist joint okay now

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.250 
protection to the wrist joint okay now
with<00:00:53.210> that<00:00:53.330> protection<00:00:53.690> the<00:00:53.840> wrist<00:00:53.990> joins<00:00:54.140> you

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
with that protection the wrist joins you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.010 
with that protection the wrist joins you
hit<00:00:54.440> down<00:00:54.620> that's<00:00:54.830> fine<00:00:55.070> but<00:00:56.000> you're<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:56.960> to

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
hit down that's fine but you're going to

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.120 
hit down that's fine but you're going to
lose<00:00:57.110> a<00:00:57.170> lot<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.320> power<00:00:57.560> so<00:00:57.710> what<00:00:57.920> we're<00:00:58.040> trying

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:58.130 
lose a lot of power so what we're trying

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.620 
lose a lot of power so what we're trying
to<00:00:58.310> do<00:00:58.430> is<00:00:58.490> train<00:00:58.820> the<00:00:59.000> technique<00:00:59.420> correctly

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
to do is train the technique correctly

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.280 
to do is train the technique correctly
so<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.710> formation<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.030> fist<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.960> cotton

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
so the formation of the fist the cotton

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.439 
so the formation of the fist the cotton
fish<00:01:03.470> shall<00:01:03.650> we<00:01:03.740> say<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.129> correct<00:01:04.489> but<00:01:05.269> the

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
fish shall we say is correct but the

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.620 
fish shall we say is correct but the
hand<00:01:05.660> is<00:01:05.810> relaxed<00:01:06.290> this<00:01:07.250> correct<00:01:08.210> alignment

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
hand is relaxed this correct alignment

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.850 
hand is relaxed this correct alignment
to<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.780> wrist<00:01:08.930> will<00:01:09.050> prevent<00:01:09.260> any<00:01:09.470> damage<00:01:09.620> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
to the wrist will prevent any damage to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.520 
to the wrist will prevent any damage to
the<00:01:09.920> wrist<00:01:10.130> joint<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:10.940> when<00:01:11.090> you're<00:01:11.240> hit<00:01:11.530> it's

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the wrist joint so when you're hit it's

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.410 
the wrist joint so when you're hit it's
this<00:01:12.740> way<00:01:12.980> so<00:01:13.280> not<00:01:13.460> performing<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.850> tight<00:01:14.120> fist

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
this way so not performing a tight fist

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.730 
this way so not performing a tight fist
stay<00:01:14.780> relaxed<00:01:15.080> and<00:01:15.140> we're<00:01:15.290> going<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:15.470> lift<00:01:15.590> the

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
stay relaxed and we're going to lift the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.420 
stay relaxed and we're going to lift the
hand<00:01:15.890> up<00:01:16.450> and<00:01:17.450> just<00:01:17.600> drop<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:19.040> in<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.280> bag

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
hand up and just drop down in the bag

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.520 
hand up and just drop down in the bag
okay<00:01:20.170> lift<00:01:22.270> down<00:01:23.270> on<00:01:23.420> the<00:01:23.480> bag<00:01:23.660> what<00:01:24.260> you<00:01:24.380> may

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
okay lift down on the bag what you may

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.560 
okay lift down on the bag what you may
find<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:25.040> this<00:01:25.190> one<00:01:25.430> is<00:01:25.970> very<00:01:26.270> quickly

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
find with this one is very quickly

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.520 
find with this one is very quickly
because<00:01:26.840> you're<00:01:26.930> going<00:01:27.050> with<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> smaller

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
because you're going with a smaller

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.590 
because you're going with a smaller
surface<00:01:27.830> that<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.880> beans<00:01:29.090> inside<00:01:29.450> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
surface that the the beans inside the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.450 
surface that the the beans inside the
bag<00:01:29.720> will<00:01:29.900> split<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.409> separate<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.340> you're

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
bag will split and separate so you're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.550 
bag will split and separate so you're
hitting<00:01:31.700> a<00:01:31.909> lot<00:01:32.330> more<00:01:32.480> down<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.870> the<00:01:32.930> table<00:01:33.110> so

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
hitting a lot more down to the table so

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.540 
hitting a lot more down to the table so
if<00:01:33.620> that<00:01:33.740> happens<00:01:33.980> you<00:01:34.040> may<00:01:34.130> need<00:01:34.190> to<00:01:34.340> shake

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
if that happens you may need to shake

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.790 
if that happens you may need to shake
that<00:01:34.670> a<00:01:34.730> little<00:01:35.000> bit<00:01:35.120> or<00:01:35.450> just<00:01:35.840> possibly<00:01:36.680> even

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
that a little bit or just possibly even

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.430 
that a little bit or just possibly even
fill<00:01:36.980> it<00:01:37.100> slightly<00:01:37.310> more<00:01:37.460> with<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.790> beans

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
fill it slightly more with the beans

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.710 
fill it slightly more with the beans
well<00:01:39.440> computers<00:01:39.710> relax<00:01:40.010> breathe<00:01:40.880> in<00:01:41.030> and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
well computers relax breathe in and

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.120 
well computers relax breathe in and
again<00:01:41.930> I'm<00:01:42.140> not<00:01:42.170> hitting<00:01:42.500> hard<00:01:42.710> I'm<00:01:42.830> dropping

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
again I'm not hitting hard I'm dropping

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.940 
again I'm not hitting hard I'm dropping
the<00:01:43.220> weight<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:44.300> my<00:01:44.780> hand<00:01:45.080> on<00:01:45.229> serve<00:01:45.409> I<00:01:45.530> just

the weight of my hand on serve I just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.810 
the weight of my hand on serve I just
breathe<00:01:46.190> in<00:01:47.440> down<00:01:48.440> if<00:01:49.190> you<00:01:49.340> notice<00:01:49.640> at<00:01:49.729> this

point<00:01:50.060> once<00:01:50.180> I<00:01:50.300> hit<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.479> bag<00:01:50.690> let's<00:01:51.440> say<00:01:51.560> my

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
point once I hit the bag let's say my

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.190 
point once I hit the bag let's say my
hand<00:01:51.800> folds<00:01:52.190> in<00:01:52.310> okay<00:01:52.909> now<00:01:53.120> at<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.630> moment<00:01:53.810> I'm

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
try and maintain that formation if the

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
try and maintain that formation if the
hand<00:02:00.350> comes<00:02:00.530> in<00:02:00.620> this<00:02:00.740> way<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.040> not<00:02:01.190> a

problem okay what we're trying to

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.770 
problem okay what we're trying to
develop<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:04.340> up<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.700> little<00:02:05.360> bit<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.540> a<00:02:05.600> gap

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
develop is just up a little bit of a gap

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.360 
develop is just up a little bit of a gap

breathe n out so then you can start
linking<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.290> sequences<00:02:23.709> together<00:02:24.720> one<00:02:26.430> two

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
linking the sequences together one two

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
you'll see that when we start to do the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.580 
you'll see that when we start to do the
applications<00:02:39.129> later<00:02:39.430> on<00:02:39.700> okay<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:41.019> people

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
but my own preference just prevent any

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.020 
but my own preference just prevent any
injuries<00:04:02.709> is<00:04:03.160> to<00:04:03.310> keep<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:03.579> on<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.879> edge<00:04:03.910> of

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
injuries is to keep it on the edge of

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.780 
injuries is to keep it on the edge of
