00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.400
Harukiya

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.280
Also, in other news tonight...

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040
Groups of unemployed workers who have grown in number 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.300
due to tax reforms enacted by the Former Minster

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240
  are rioting all across the country.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.220
And confusion among members of the Parliment

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.900
sparked by the comments of Finance Minster Takakansi

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.160
during the recent Parliament enquiry,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.036
There seems to be no comprise in sight

00:00:34.036 --> 00:00:35.832
between the government and opposition.

00:00:35.832 --> 00:00:37.660
Hey there, call it.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.420
Give me some. Three peanuts.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.040
Let's see here...

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.600
The clown bastards are herded out on Route # 5.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.940
Damn it! Don't scare like that! Open that damn door quietly!

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.900
You know, you wouldn't so jumpy if you didn't have anything to hide!

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.980
Why don't you see normal drinks for a change? 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.040
How 'bout buying something, for once?!

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.660
This ain't a hangout for damn street gangs! 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.200
Yeah, right! Drink your dog piss?!

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.780
Twin-ceramic rotor drives on each wheel...

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.620
Let's see. And these are...

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.260
Computer-controlled anti-lock brakes!

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.520
Huh...

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.600
200 horsepower at 12,000 RPM...

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.060
You wanna ride it, Tetsuo?

00:01:41.426 --> 00:01:43.426
All right, Let's go!

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.875
I customized that bike for myself.

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.415
It's too wild. You couldn't handle it.

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:53.365
I don't see how you can ride something crazy like that, man!

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.220
Huh. I could!

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.020
Hahah...

00:01:57.022 --> 00:01:59.900
If you want it so bad, then steal one yourself!

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.980
Unbelievable.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.720
School kids these days...

00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.400
Wait! Hey waiter!

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.960
They ran into the alley! After 'em!

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.100
This isn't a game, you idiot!

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.887
Shit...!

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.500
What?!

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:15.700
Haha!

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.300
That's the...

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.600
Huh?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This is Unit 375. We got reports of biker gangs fighting near the intersection of Highway 14 South!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.700
Request immediate assistance! 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.700
Car 375, en route to the scene!

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.000
Again, request immediate assistance!

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.900
It's the cops! What should we do?

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.800
Aw, damn it! My motor-coils were just getting warmed up...

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.900
Bastards! Let's go!

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.200
Tetsuo!

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.600
I'm coming!

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.700
Damn them!

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:14.600
Come on!
