00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
going the exact opposite direction of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.010 
going the exact opposite direction of
this<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> doesn't<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:12.930> like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
this because it doesn't look like

it's too hard to coordinate on veteran
difficulty<00:06:02.919> the<00:06:03.790> locations<00:06:04.360> of<00:06:04.540> all<00:06:04.660> this

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
difficulty the locations of all this

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.830 
difficulty the locations of all this
stuff<00:06:05.200> it's<00:06:05.440> not<00:06:05.620> an<00:06:05.770> uncharted<00:06:06.340> style<00:06:07.240> right
