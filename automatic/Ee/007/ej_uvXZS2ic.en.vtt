00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
be right to me right here 11 plus hours

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.690 
be right to me right here 11 plus hours
you<00:03:48.510> identify<00:03:48.930> 11<00:03:49.380> right<00:03:49.620> 11<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.130> pretty

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
you identify 11 right 11 is a pretty

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.870 
you identify 11 right 11 is a pretty
arbitrary<00:03:50.880> number<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:51.720> is<00:03:51.930> your<00:03:52.470> benchmark<00:03:53.069> so

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
arbitrary number so is your benchmark so

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.390 
arbitrary number so is your benchmark so
my<00:03:54.030> obvious<00:03:54.450> question<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.500> why<00:03:56.099> don't<00:03:56.160> you

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
my obvious question is why don't you

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.080 
my obvious question is why don't you
just<00:03:56.730> quit<00:03:57.060> at<00:03:57.299> 10<00:03:58.260> when<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.099> know<00:03:59.370> that<00:03:59.700> 11

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
just quit at 10 when you know that 11

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.449 
just quit at 10 when you know that 11
plus<00:04:00.299> hours<00:04:00.690> is<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.139> moment<00:04:01.349> that<00:04:01.709> you<00:04:02.190> are

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
plus hours is the moment that you are

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.580 
plus hours is the moment that you are
now<00:04:05.000> slow<00:04:06.000> slopping<00:04:06.569> off<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.930> tapering<00:04:07.440> off

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
now slow slopping off and tapering off

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.020 
now slow slopping off and tapering off
okay<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.549> know<00:04:08.910> that's<00:04:09.269> easier<00:04:10.109> said<00:04:10.169> than<00:04:10.530> done

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
okay I know that's easier said than done

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.129 
okay I know that's easier said than done
so<00:04:12.030> I'm<00:04:12.120> going<00:04:12.209> to<00:04:12.299> give<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:12.480> strategy<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.019> do

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
so I'm going to give you strategy to do

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.500 
so I'm going to give you strategy to do
it<00:04:13.260> you're<00:04:13.440> going<00:04:13.650> to<00:04:13.769> set<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.250> rule<00:04:14.519> right<00:04:15.180> you

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
it you're going to set a rule right you

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.270 
it you're going to set a rule right you
know<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.930> time<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.380> Ivan<00:04:16.680> identified<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
know the time you Ivan identified the

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.060 
know the time you Ivan identified the
problem<00:04:17.579> right<00:04:18.289> use<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.620> classical

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
problem right use the classical

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.529 
problem right use the classical
conditioning<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:20.700> punish<00:04:20.969> yourself<00:04:21.090> set<00:04:21.510> a

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
conditioning to punish yourself set a

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.709 
conditioning to punish yourself set a
rule<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.560> would<00:04:22.740> set<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.039> rule<00:04:23.219> at<00:04:23.370> 8<00:04:23.719> but

00:04:24.709 --> 00:04:24.719 
rule and I would set the rule at 8 but

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.420 
rule and I would set the rule at 8 but
use<00:04:25.260> classical<00:04:25.740> conditioning<00:04:25.950> to<00:04:26.219> punish

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
use classical conditioning to punish

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.710 
use classical conditioning to punish
yourself

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
yourself

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.820 
yourself
if<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.930> don't<00:04:27.170> quit<00:04:27.500> this<00:04:28.130> is<00:04:28.310> the<00:04:29.830> punishment

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
if I don't quit this is the punishment

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.040 
if I don't quit this is the punishment
for<00:04:31.400> my<00:04:31.430> behavioral<00:04:32.330> pattern<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:32.870> you're

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
for my behavioral pattern so you're

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.720 
for my behavioral pattern so you're
essentially<00:04:33.470> forcing<00:04:34.040> yourself<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.400> quit<00:04:34.640> you

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
essentially forcing yourself to quit you

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.100 
essentially forcing yourself to quit you
don't<00:04:34.880> wanna<00:04:35.030> you<00:04:35.600> don't<00:04:35.630> want<00:04:35.870> to<00:04:35.930> give<00:04:36.020> away

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
time you don't quit because that's not

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.760 
time you don't quit because that's not

motivation to change your behavior

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.330 
motivation to change your behavior
that's<00:04:44.480> just<00:04:44.750> an<00:04:44.870> external<00:04:45.380> force<00:04:45.590> an

that's just an external force an

that's just an external force an

authoritative force to change you want

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.590 
authoritative force to change you want
to<00:04:49.250> classically<00:04:49.790> condition<00:04:50.210> yourself<00:04:50.330> to

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
to classically condition yourself to

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.780 
to classically condition yourself to

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
succeed most of the time so maybe what

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.380 
succeed most of the time so maybe what
you<00:04:54.410> can<00:04:54.530> do<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:54.710> make<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:55.040> friendly<00:04:55.970> bet<00:04:56.150> with<00:04:56.360> a

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
you can do is make a friendly bet with a

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:57.940 
you can do is make a friendly bet with a
friend<00:04:56.690> if<00:04:56.840> I<00:04:56.990> don't<00:04:57.170> quit<00:04:57.410> I'm<00:04:57.590> going<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.860> pay

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
friend if I don't quit I'm going to pay

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.770 
friend if I don't quit I'm going to pay
you<00:04:58.010> a<00:04:58.130> big<00:04:58.370> blind<00:04:58.580> so<00:04:58.910> it's<00:04:59.030> like<00:04:59.150> maybe

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
you a big blind so it's like maybe

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.600 
you a big blind so it's like maybe
you'll<00:05:00.020> stay<00:05:00.290> but<00:05:00.740> maybe<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.070> won't<00:05:01.220> you<00:05:01.490> know

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
you'll stay but maybe you won't you know

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.750 
you'll stay but maybe you won't you know
and<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:02.120> want<00:05:02.330> to<00:05:02.420> use<00:05:02.630> this<00:05:02.870> as<00:05:03.140> a<00:05:03.860> positive

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
and you want to use this as a positive

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.600 
and you want to use this as a positive
energy<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.630> change<00:05:06.170> to<00:05:06.500> promote<00:05:06.800> change<00:05:07.160> right

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
energy to change to promote change right

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.460 
energy to change to promote change right
so<00:05:08.420> classical<00:05:08.870> conditioning<00:05:09.050> could<00:05:09.350> be

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
so classical conditioning could be

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.690 
so classical conditioning could be
anything<00:05:09.740> but<00:05:09.980> you<00:05:10.070> want<00:05:10.220> to<00:05:10.250> reward<00:05:10.550> yourself

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
anything but you want to reward yourself

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.160 
anything but you want to reward yourself
for<00:05:11.090> quitting<00:05:11.300> punish<00:05:11.630> yourself<00:05:11.930> when<00:05:12.080> you

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
for quitting punish yourself when you

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.390 
for quitting punish yourself when you
don't<00:05:12.350> figure<00:05:12.530> out<00:05:12.650> your<00:05:12.860> own<00:05:12.890> system<00:05:13.310> that

don't figure out your own system that

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.030 
don't figure out your own system that

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
works the second thing to consider here

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.300 
works the second thing to consider here
is<00:05:16.220> really<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.880> eight<00:05:17.600> hours<00:05:18.050> is<00:05:18.350> what<00:05:19.250> I

is really that eight hours is what I

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.950 
is really that eight hours is what I
would<00:05:19.550> use<00:05:19.760> as<00:05:19.910> a<00:05:19.940> benchmark<00:05:20.270> because<00:05:20.630> it's

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:33.290 
at the point of exhaustion of

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.890 
at the point of exhaustion of
frustration<00:05:34.190> of<00:05:34.340> when<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.270> start<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.780> make

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
frustration of when you start to make

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.840 
frustration of when you start to make
mistakes<00:05:36.040> because<00:05:37.040> you're<00:05:37.160> tired<00:05:37.370> right

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
mistakes because you're tired right

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:39.340 
mistakes because you're tired right
that's<00:05:38.060> the<00:05:38.240> cause<00:05:38.450> of<00:05:38.480> those<00:05:38.810> mistakes<00:05:39.110> that

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
that's the cause of those mistakes that

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.770 
that's the cause of those mistakes that
happen<00:05:39.590> after<00:05:40.040> that<00:05:40.220> period<00:05:40.970> of<00:05:41.270> eleven<00:05:41.660> hours

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
happen after that period of eleven hours

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.110 
happen after that period of eleven hours
so<00:05:42.500> eight<00:05:42.680> hours<00:05:42.950> is<00:05:43.070> a<00:05:43.100> long<00:05:43.280> time<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:43.790> stop

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
so eight hours is a long time so stop

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.790 
so eight hours is a long time so stop
before<00:05:44.360> your<00:05:44.690> play<00:05:44.870> deteriorates<00:05:45.590> and<00:05:45.740> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
before your play deteriorates and the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.730 
before your play deteriorates and the
reason<00:05:46.100> eight<00:05:46.310> is<00:05:46.669> is<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:48.350> number<00:05:48.590> I<00:05:48.650> would

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
reason eight is is the number I would

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.320 
reason eight is is the number I would
pick<00:05:48.979> is<00:05:49.130> it's<00:05:49.310> three<00:05:49.520> hours<00:05:49.640> before<00:05:49.940> but

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
pick is it's three hours before but

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.600 
pick is it's three hours before but
objectively<00:05:51.050> even<00:05:51.950> if<00:05:52.040> you<00:05:52.130> said<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:52.430> could
