 hello friends and andrew nightingales we 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 ifa are on show in Berlin this 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.589
 philips booth where among the dark 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.699
 electric shaver coffee makers and 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.309
 robot vacuum cleaners 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.649
 we found quite interesting 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.350
 gadgets that will be interesting for us 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.480
 with you judging by the level of gadgets 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.850
 presented at the exhibition to surprise 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:45.489
 ordinary TV even curved 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.260
 today it is quite difficult to need some 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:49.480
 trick that would translate it 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.910
 device in a fundamentally new class and 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.010
 it seems that the company philips such a chip 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.320
 found 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.780
 chip is big enough green 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.960
 colors and i think we don't need you 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.239
 explain what it is you probably would 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.030
 burned that we are talking about TV in 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.950
 the future on android and recently we are with you 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 got acquainted with the similar device from 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.510
 supra 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.580
 however, there are all the functions android you rather 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.540
 focused on media entertainment 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.210
 components 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.460
 connected and us watching tv programs and 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.260
 additional services however philips 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.540
 has focused on the game 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.800
 component platform is one of the most 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.410
 interesting chips 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.130
 this particular system is something that 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.870
 here 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.820
 and the mixed application 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.320
 directly from the martini classic 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.960
 smart and which movie pro become 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.880
 your model since 2010 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 but exactly this year came here 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.659
 full android and if you pay 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.119
 Attention 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.069
 the play market icon appeared in the bottom corner 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.899
 from which you can install games and 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:50.819
 applications that is it turns out such 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.679
 curious enough user mixes 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.350
 By and large, should not even think 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.319
 about what program is currently with 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.759
 it interacts either that is either it 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.500
 preinstalled package 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.929
 I put it from the android market for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.099
 management of all this economy 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.509
 there is a special remote control which 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:08.369
 top looks like normal 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.259
 TV remote but inverse 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 hand he turns to virtual 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.069
 more precisely like a virtually real 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.290
 mechanical keyboard divided into 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.239
 two zones under the right and left hand 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.340
 inside this same remote is embedded 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.470
 special controller which allows 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.000
 manage like this from virtual 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.220
 character well and actually all 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.260
 actions that occur in the game as 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.940
 see everything moves quite well and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.230
 including all kinds of races 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.260
 virtual simulators 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.109
 airplanes jumping everything else goes 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.150
 smoothly let's talk about iron what 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:41.250
 hiding inside this device what 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.040
 allowed to achieve such results on 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.660
 in fact, everything is not so simple 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.000
 achieve some kind of specifics 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.829
 representatives of philips unfortunately we do not 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 it turned out we only know that the processor 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:53.660
 which is installed inside this 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.190
 the device has 4 cores and its frequency 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.340
 more than 1 gigahertz exactly the same to us and 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.209
 said in wenn man gigahertz 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.519
 accordingly what kind of processor 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.139
 failed to find anak 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.970
 find out what ram is here 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.060
 hiding in two gigabytes that already 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.709
 inspires respect and permanent memory 4 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.989
 of which the user to install 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.000
 cyber and put the program us under 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:16.260
 Brand about flies and naturally there is 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.069
 expandability with 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.160
 cards 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.200
 up to 64 gigabytes 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.550
 the apparatus itself is representative of it so 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.040
 called 8 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.050
 niki how to be he has a highlight to kill 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.910
 which adjust your color in 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.490
 depending on the image on the screen 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.920
 I took the pray 55 inches but what is the most 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.050
 pleasant resolution is used here 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.640
 4k ultra hd 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.260
 on the side panels device 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.480
 located a lot of beaten word of 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.760
 that allow you to connect including 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.370
 and various game controllers are very 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.810
 interesting tv function 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.410
 hiding at the very bottom under the logo 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.320
 philips 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.970
 This is a camera and this camera can be 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.710
 push and hide if you don't want 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.170
 to the bottom of something cheerful can 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.030
 push and snap if you want 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.190
 chat on skype and the camera here for sure 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.140
 will not interfere here the ranks of the so-called 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.950
 representative of the 8 series as you can see here 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.900
 absolutely flat screen the same apparatus from 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.910
 whom we began our acquaintance with 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.800
 new generation android tv you 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.799
 the film itself representatives of the so-called 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.080
 9 series are flagships that have 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.609
 curved matrix for ganami which 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.550
 also 55 inches 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.130
 same resolution ultra hd but unlike 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.580
 from 8 series here is used processor 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.919
 not 4 a 6 nuclear but I remember 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.570
 philips on ifa not only televisions on 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:36.030
 android those users who 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.070
 do for example photo processing or 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.830
 videos will certainly appreciate this one 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.580
 monitor with a diagonal of 34 inches and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.530
 aspect ratio of 21 to 9 resolution with 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.880
 which the user works 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.040
 no less than 3440 by 1440 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.169
 pixels and also present here 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.540
 curious enough technology so 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.820
 called two independent inputs when 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.250
 2 sources are connected picture can 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.780
 automatically divided into two parts and 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.580
 work as if with two separate 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.340
 level I think that all who are engaged 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.710
 processing a photo or video looking at this 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.710
 monitor can bury right now 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.490
 saliva but here if you prefer 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.260
 mostly spending time before 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.270
 computer kill and in various 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.669
 computer toys most likely 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.830
 here is not so chocolate because 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.060
 not all games support this over 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.100
 wide screen but the monitor with 231 is strong 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.440
 first glance nothing revolutionary of 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.870
 It does not represent itself but it is only on 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.060
 the first thing is that the company philips 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.710
 took and established here is nothing 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.600
 both operating systems android and 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.210
 It turned out when there will be a tablet with 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.400
 with a diagonal of 21 and a half inches where 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.830
 all this farm is equipped with webcams 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.960
 touch multitouch display and works 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.580
 on android 4 2 2 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.320
 jellibin that is by and large 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.290
 it turns out so interesting enough 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.050
 stationary tablet on folding legs 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:01.120
 a diagonal of 21 and a half thoughts but if 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.460
 you don't need it at all here 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.979
 stick computer use it 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.690
 just an external full hd monitor itself 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.419
 philips company and even such a cocktail 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.460
 from android and regular monitor to first 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:15.100
 all useful for smart home he 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.200
 even called smart r &amp; m tunnel 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.870
 how will such a device take root on 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.880
 I really understand our desktops 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.340
 but at least the first step is a company 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.710
 philips already made putting this model 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.620
 for us on this probably today 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.870
 all i will 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.240
 our three ways of the company aviasales for 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.570
 what we flew to ifa and work 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.120
 here 

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.570
 and you for watching mobile x up 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.570
 dating
