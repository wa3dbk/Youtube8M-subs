00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.640 
get my review out there as soon as I
possibly<00:00:11.490> could<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.330> found<00:00:13.049> these<00:00:13.290> at

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
possibly could I found these at

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.720 
possibly could I found these at
Walgreens<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.670> believe<00:00:15.000> they<00:00:15.360> were<00:00:15.560> around<00:00:16.730> $7

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
Walgreens I believe they were around $7

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.429 
Walgreens I believe they were around $7
the<00:00:17.760> interesting<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.779> about<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
the interesting thing about these is

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.340 
the interesting thing about these is
that<00:00:19.830> they<00:00:19.980> are<00:00:20.090> matte<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.990> you're<00:00:22.140> familiar

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
that they are matte if you're familiar

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.920 
that they are matte if you're familiar
with<00:00:22.590> milania's<00:00:23.220> line<00:00:23.519> they<00:00:23.970> have<00:00:24.269> bronzers

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
with milania's line they have bronzers

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
with milania's line they have bronzers
already<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.560> there<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.279> baked

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
already in there they have some baked

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.759 
already in there they have some baked
bronzers<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.720> they're<00:00:27.869> all<00:00:28.019> very<00:00:28.050> shimmery

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
bronzers but they're all very shimmery

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.980 
bronzers but they're all very shimmery
are<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.400> two<00:00:29.640> shades<00:00:29.970> available<00:00:30.269> there's

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
are just two shades available there's

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.729 
are just two shades available there's
zero<00:00:31.500> seven<00:00:32.189> which<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.759> sienna<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.780> zero<00:00:34.410> 8

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
zero seven which is sienna and zero 8

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.549 
zero seven which is sienna and zero 8
which<00:00:35.250> is<00:00:35.280> sunset<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> store<00:00:37.170> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
which is sunset I was in the store it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.560 
which is sunset I was in the store it
was<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.489> hard<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.030> tell<00:00:39.390> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
was just very hard to tell the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
was just very hard to tell the
difference<00:00:39.600> between<00:00:40.079> these<00:00:40.530> two<00:00:40.770> colors<00:00:41.190> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
difference between these two colors I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.880 
difference between these two colors I
mean<00:00:41.340> they<00:00:41.610> looked<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.660> similar<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
mean they looked so similar in that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.369 
mean they looked so similar in that
store<00:00:44.250> lighting<00:00:44.730> kind<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> defies<00:00:45.660> logic<00:00:46.020> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
store lighting kind of defies logic a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.729 
store lighting kind of defies logic a
little<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.200> 0/7<00:00:49.200> shade<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
little bit in that the 0/7 shade is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.590 
little bit in that the 0/7 shade is
actually<00:00:50.100> darker<00:00:50.520> than<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> zero<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.449> see

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
actually darker than the zero and see

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.779 
actually darker than the zero and see
the<00:00:51.780> color<00:00:51.989> difference<00:00:52.250> from<00:00:53.250> these<00:00:53.460> swatches

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the color difference from these swatches

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.180 
the color difference from these swatches
is<00:00:54.390> quite<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.289> more<00:00:55.410> drastic<00:00:55.949> than<00:00:56.070> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is quite a bit more drastic than you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180 
is quite a bit more drastic than you
might<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.399> expected<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:58.320> one<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> deeper

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
might have expected this one this deeper

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.970 
might have expected this one this deeper
one<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> Sienna<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.210> then<00:01:00.870> there's<00:01:01.260> sunset

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
one is Sienna and then there's sunset

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.789 
one is Sienna and then there's sunset
right<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.670> both<00:01:03.570> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.110> golden<00:01:04.680> e

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
right here both kind of golden e

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.649 
right here both kind of golden e
bronzers<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.090> one<00:01:06.240> has<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> lot<00:01:06.630> more

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
bronzers but this one has a lot more

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.800 
bronzers but this one has a lot more
depth<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.270> could<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.630> type

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
depth to it this one could be the type

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.660 
depth to it this one could be the type
of<00:01:09.840> thing<00:01:10.200> that<00:01:10.439> works<00:01:10.619> really<00:01:10.740> great<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.610> a

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
of thing that works really great for a

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.840 
of thing that works really great for a
lighter<00:01:11.939> skin<00:01:12.270> tone<00:01:12.450> they<00:01:13.020> claim<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> be<00:01:13.470> matte

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
lighter skin tone they claim to be matte

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
lighter skin tone they claim to be matte
there<00:01:14.850> at<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> same<00:01:15.450> time<00:01:15.750> not<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.740> really

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
there at the same time not like a really

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.940 
there at the same time not like a really
flat<00:01:17.490> dry<00:01:18.180> looking<00:01:18.659> color<00:01:18.960> just<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> verge

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
flat dry looking color just on the verge

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
flat dry looking color just on the verge
maybe<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.369> semi<00:01:20.759> matte<00:01:21.060> type<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.630> finish<00:01:21.869> is

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
maybe a semi matte type of finish is

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.859 
maybe a semi matte type of finish is
what<00:01:22.290> these<00:01:22.409> hands<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.280> domed<00:01:23.869> classic

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
what these hands have that domed classic

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.200 
what these hands have that domed classic
baked<00:01:25.380> appearance<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:26.549> comes<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
baked appearance it also comes with a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.870 
baked appearance it also comes with a
brush<00:01:27.619> definitely<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.650> thin<00:01:29.070> brush<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.790> would

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
brush definitely a thin brush it would

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.090 
brush definitely a thin brush it would
really<00:01:30.150> cut<00:01:30.720> into<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> product<00:01:31.590> might<00:01:32.070> be

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
really cut into the product might be

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.039 
really cut into the product might be
kind<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.460> tricky<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.630> give<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.930> an

kind of tricky to actually give you an

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.340 
kind of tricky to actually give you an
even<00:01:34.380> application<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> pull<00:01:36.060> in

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
even application so I like to pull in
