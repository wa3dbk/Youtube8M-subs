00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello to all and clash h when we 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.280
 so ends up for a tutorial you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.029
 show how on earth he got 6.0 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.770
 point on the ipod touch 4th generation 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.090
 iphone 4 and iphone 3gs so I am 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.490
 go to the settings with my ipod 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.160
 touch 4 and I'm going in the general for 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.109
 to show you that I am bound in bone 6.0 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.599
 points so and it's really very 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.230
 simple you use the same rhythm as at 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.340
 the habit 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.860
 now you have to put your 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.239
 device in dfu mode for the debris 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 that it works properly 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.830
 you put both buttons during a 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.479
 ten seconds later you 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.760
 let go by bolton and keep in 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:47.070
 bottle until your 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.780
 computer recognize your device 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.379
 and then you will be able to start 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.750
 the jailbreak with redsnow not like I 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.799
 you say you need rhythm 0.9 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.979
 point 15 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.820
 beta 3 or beta 2 1 or the other that 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.860
 works but I advise you 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.799
 to still have the latest beta and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.240
 you also need laios 6.0 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.740
 of your device it is really very 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 important so once you have that 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.330
 you right click sourÃ¨s we go 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 in the compatibility tab is everything 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.920
 simply hooked run a windows 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.570
 xp service pack too much to run as 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.420
 that administrator once it's 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:25.650
 done you can launch the software 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.790
 redsnow once your software and 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.400
 launch you are going to have to go in 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.290
 the extra tab to select your 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.260
 piece become so important to 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.850
 select the 6.0 a ola 6.0 points 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.010
 if not is this new from just you 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.860
 indicate that they do not support 6.0 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.800
 points so once your eyepet s 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.200
 of blue and clothes selected in 6.0 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.420
 have clicked on bricks and then 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.940
 perform the jailbreak so really 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.510
 it's the same compatibility as the 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.380
 jailbreak 6.0 so it's really very 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.700
 simple you do the same 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.740
 manipulations it's just that I held 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.470
 still to make an explanatory video 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 to show you the whole process so 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.180
 it's really the same thing so you 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.299
 see that it remains unrealized on 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.500
 necessary process and then mouse 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:12.540
 he pointed out it's now 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.950
 finished and everything else will happen 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.530
 on your bar and so you see 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.330
 now that is several 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.340
 several manipulations on the device 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.470
 which I accelerated the sequence for what 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.900
 be it super no so you see 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.670
 how does it make the moving applications saas 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.050
 fee that it is very long the moving 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.569
 apply at home it can take 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.830
 up to 5-6 minutes even just maybe 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.230
 ten minutes 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.420
 so let him time it's not 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.500
 a box to what it really is you 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.800
 see that it's now up to finish 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.330
 your device reboots see the small 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
 apple it's not over you 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.140
 will have pop and sidya directly on 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.660
 your springboard so now I 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.800
 will unlock my device you 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.420
 see that the second page 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.980
 normally expose to having six ya 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.300
 now this is not the case so 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.370
 it's not everything now 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.200
 put our device in dfu mode so 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.730
 do the same manipulations 10 seconds 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.590
 on both buttons until time that 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.000
 your device closes and thereafter 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.750
 you let go of the power button is 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.180
 now the home boston up to think 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.709
 that your computer recognize your 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.150
 apparatus 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.319
 so once your manipulations for the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.120
 put in dfu mode are now 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.310
 completed you must leave gatineau and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.959
 relaunch it and you'll see that it's 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.340
 really very simple so once he 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.380
 remains we're going public and in 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.019
 the extra tab you're going to have to still 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.450
 once these years your bones and 6.0 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:29.340

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.290
 you click on just boot and by the 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.380
 following your simply this one is 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.610
 automatically you will see that on 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.530
 after the manipulations smile otherwise 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.400

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.350
