00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.189
 And then folks, I'm here in the soul. 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.260
 dragone who in this video I will show 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.900
 how to make achievements who knows how to do it 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.210
 Dumbness to achievement requires you to win. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 the encounter on the ridge of the wing of death 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.949
 after making the death act already in the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 left right sequence in 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.869
 right then when you start the fight you 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.830
 must kill from the tentacles that remain 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.109
 on the sides 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.150
 after killing them you will see a hole 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.679
 under each of them then all their 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.960
 group should run into a 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.360
 hole on the left wing of the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.399
 early death you will see on the channel 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.920
 shatt a message saying that the act of 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.930
 death perceives players to his left and 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 approximately six seconds later 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.550
 of this message appear in the astro chat 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.860
 of death will spin in that direction and 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.800
 when the subject of death turns all 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.300
 players who are not in the hole will 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.100
 fall and die 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.510
 then you will see on shatt channel 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.940
 message that he turned to the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.090
 then after that you should 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 run to the opposite side on the right and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.320
 stay in the hole and once again wait 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.510
 until the message from the sheik appears to say 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.270
 that goes from the death generated right and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.159
 return to the same hole on the left and 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.350
 I repeat the previous two steps of 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.439
 death form has generated 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.220
 left right right left in this 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.200
 order 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.850
 and then the achievement is that now is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.280
 just a matter of you doing something 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.810
 normally and receive the achievement 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 win the meeting 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.979
 I will now give some additional tips that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.960
 you need to know during this fight that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 It is this first whenever 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 you see a tentacle channeling this 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.560
 orange ray attack the tentacle because 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.450
 this skill they use 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.220
 keep a player stunned 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
 Stunning is only broken if the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.880
 tentacle receives a little damage then 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.579
 always knock sit with those who 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.590
 have attached their allies to you 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.899
 You do not have to kill the tentacles. 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.450
 but you need to hit a few in them 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.100
 tele release their allies 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 another thing you should be careful about 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.390
 it is also when you position yourself in a 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.820
 confirmed by the chat message that 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.740
 the star's death generated do not get too 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.690
 Time standing there waiting, otherwise he will. 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.580
 turn in the same direction then 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.200
 make sure that your group is in 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.660
 tune in comes and goes 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.610
 among whites and if by any chance 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 try with the backing in the hole you 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.120
 is about to go 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.500
 matthew tentacle immediately to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.900
 open a hole for your group if 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.840
 position and now something very important 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.700
 that many players think to be buggy and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.670
 something that happens a lot mainly 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.890
 in groups with few players is the blue 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 of death start to make mysterious twists 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.080
 even all the players being in the middle 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.060
 and this is where the confusion technically 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.340
 there is no means in this fight 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.459
 or you are to the left of the steel of death 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.170
 or you are on the right there is no way 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.930
 then after the criteria to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.760
 achievement are already done make sure 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.620
 divide into your group accordingly and 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 balancing the weight between the two sides 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.970
 to make sure it does not rotate 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.110
 if you have four players put 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.150
 two on each side 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.310
 but if you have an odd number 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.840
 it will probably not be my problem 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.010
 I believe that if the difference was 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.260
 only one player 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.349
 he does not turn but I never have 53 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.569
 players only then I know that 15 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.030
 players it is possible to keep balanced 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.250
 being 13 one side and two in the other but 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.650
 with 13 never tried but of any 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.420
 way if you happen to see a chat that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.790
 He's about to shoot in one direction. 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.650
 You can still cancel his spin. 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.959
 balancing the weight again on the back 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.880
 reversing the direction of rotation 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.620
 but after the message appears in the chat 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.870
 You only have six seconds to 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.670
 correct the positioning of the group before 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.769
 Turn it over so stay on time now. 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.900
 I'll explain how to finish the rest of the 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.549
 fight since the mechanics of this crap is good 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.370
 common every time you kill a 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.200
 tentacle a ghastly malaga is evoked and 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.600
 your tank must maintain at least one 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.329
 of these there are a range of books therefore 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.220
 safe and avoid using damages that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.160
 they would pass passively as 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.170
 for example the legendary covers cdps and in 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.540
 each of the side holes where 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.340
 appear the tentacles will begin to come 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.799
 small furniture called blood 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.530
 corrupted these furniture must be killed 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.359
 always when they die they leave 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.700
 these little bubbles of boiling blood 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:17.760
 on the floor and your tank should cause 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.489
 a fearful amalgam goes over this 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.800
 blood and look at this number that appears 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.080
 next to the samal's picture ranges always 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.340
 how gamma goes over a blood 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.100
 he will win says 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.320
 and when one of them reaches 9 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.750
 tank must carry this amalgam near the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.150
 on the side of death, position the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.820
 amalgam with nine highlights nearest 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.639
 possible from the closest death side 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.250
 possible of his head and then matthew 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.320
 the range made that the armor of death 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.199
 it will rupture and a tendon 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.820
 beneath the escape armature and feet 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.919
 fruit walk before it can 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.970
 finalizing the unit launch will 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.889
 replenish armor 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.930
 then you should not repeat the 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:00.360
 same process two more times to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.800
 win the meeting now some tips 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.780
 for this part of the fight 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:06.120
 if you are a class that has helpers 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.010
 take your helper or the fish in the 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.110
 passive to ensure that they do not go 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.000
 attack their undue programs and 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.400
 note the following during the fight if you 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.560
 Kill all the tentacles and this will 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.450
 cause more blood to appear to 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.490
 you can accumulate the highlights in the 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.039
 love ranges faster this is good 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.440
 but it takes into account that each try 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.949
 with humor makes a new love range 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.260
 be evoked then try to kill your 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:32.130
 programs that have 10 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.990
 highlights 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.090
 and if you have too many salt ranges 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.280
 accumulated next to each other 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.470
 you will have difficulty focusing on new 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.150
 taxis on just one of them and this goes 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.190
 make the fight much longer 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.950
 so try to keep only 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:49.470
 1 or 3 the morgan more alive than 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.510
 are less prominent than the others 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.400
 and a hint for the tank do not be afraid 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.410
 running on the sides if you need 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.570
 make a range go over the blood 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.580
 on the floor and that's it after 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.650
 destroy three tendons by knocking down 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.389
 support cause of death armor 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.099
 you will have achievement as long as you 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.630
 has made it spin in the sequence 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.400
 correct during the fight 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.700
 I hope you have enjoyed it and even 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.700
 next
