00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.650
 After a long wait, it arrives in the west 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.180
 and this respect diverse plus a game 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.250
 of struggle that has the characters 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.860
 LlÃ¡mpara most emblematic magazine 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.930
 playstation 4 playstation3 and pc edit 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.850
 in our analysis we tell us about their 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.850
 main details and characteristics 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.600
 we are probably facing a title of 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.850
 fight where two characters face 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.800
 to two others in ancient scenarios that 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.199
 we can go freely finding 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.059
 also with a support partner here 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.949
 we can use two attack buttons 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.920
 not strong and another weak that we combine 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.629
 to perform different combos there 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.210
 several types of special attacks to 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.920
 use pressing circle r 1 + circle 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.360
 circle and forward although it is also 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.000
 possible to perform other techniques 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.310
 combining r1 with square triangle 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.960
 each special movement spends part of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.610
 the resistance bar having to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.300
 wait for it to automatically recharge 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.069
 or pressing one more x to be a bit with 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.050
 large scenarios is possible 

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.909
 fix the rivals so as not to lose them 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.759
 view although it does not work too well 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.470
 and the camera sometimes gives problems 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.100
 we can also jump run dodge or 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.100
 defend ourselves 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.980
 there is a special transformation called 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.690
 blast of victory that we get to the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.460
 hit our rivals and do that 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.410
 the meter decant towards the side of 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.540
 our team taking it by pressing the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.880
 3 button all members of our 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.100
 group when entering in that way we can 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.790
 execute the definitive movements of 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 each character 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.080
 the supporting character that we have already 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.880
 chosen can help us 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.470
 making a special attack on 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.300
 any time we decide in 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.250
 combat in which after using said 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.330
 movement we have to wait a while 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.330
 until I can call him again 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.980
 There are several different conditions 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.170
 to get the victory though 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:28.180
 normally it is determined by finishing 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.180
 with the enemies a number of times 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.420
 good 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.459
 the characters are very good 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.560
 differentiated counting each of them 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.120
 with unique characteristics despite 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.310
 which is the battle system is very 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.739
 simple finding a total of 39 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.629
 controlled and displaced support this 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.310
 it makes the experience very different 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.159
 depending on our choice being 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.139
 very faithful to their respective annals there 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.730
 certain movements that logically have 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.530
 had to remove as the flight of 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.340
 awareness that they would be very combative 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.340
 unbalanced 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.569
 will kill 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.040
 we have a total of 25 scenarios 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.110
 where to fight based on some of the 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.330
 most representative locations 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.190
 each franchise are totally 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.030
 three-dimensional interactive and with 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.030
 construction elements 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.430
 the most raw 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.469
 fifteen 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.329
 among the game modes we find 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.799
 also a victory where we fight 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.959
 deciding in our next 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.450
 arcade movement with several fights 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.519
 consecutive random free combat 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.920
 deciding whether to fight against the cpu or 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.329
 a friend to split screen and in combat 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.209
 online to participate in battles 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.159
 against players from all over the world the 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.810
 split screen bouts do not work 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.939
 very good since being divided 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.739
 vertically it does not provide too much 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.209
 injury being covered from 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.519
 scenario in addition to the markers 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.260
 we also would have liked that two 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.419
 players could cooperate so 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.540
 local against others from around the world 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.540
 on-line 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.980
 by the most prominent mode is adventure 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.710
 jay where we can choose between four 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.810
 protagonists theoretical light and naruto wichi 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.700
 of each story has its own 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.739
 enemy and mechanical scenarios of 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.540
 combat encountering even battles of 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.970
 one against one even though they do not work 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.040
 too well here we move by 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.900
 a boat mapping developing its 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.210
 history facing rivals and 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.800
 getting objects as you 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.480
 we advance we improve our ship and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.550
 we add new characters to the 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.800
 crew can travel to new 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.810
 places there are several side missions 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.400
 besides several combats against 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.650
 random enemies that will appear 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.480
 by mapping when winning matches 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.340
 we increase the level of the characters 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.500
 that we have used turning the most 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.080
 powerful and unlocking more objects 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.820
 to buy in the store there are letters to 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.100
 equip that give different benefits 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.880
 being very useful for more fighting 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.880
 challenging 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:08.210
 and the artificial intelligence of our 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.800
 fellow being is far from satisfactory 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.599
 quite complicated to get the 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.880
 victory with your help if we face 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.880
 to a couple of online players 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.690
 there is a store where we can spend the 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.759
 points earned in the adventure 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:29.770
 finding objects or new scenarios 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.810
 and characters to buy too 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.910
 we found yale personalization for 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.570
 improve the characters by putting letters 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.570
 in our deck 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.130
 graphically the characters are very 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.870
 faithful to their respective series being 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.389
 very detailed and retaining their 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.099
 most characteristic movements their 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.500
 expressions are improvable but in 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.569
 general are pretty good 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:55.370
 scenarios despite being very broad and 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.650
 be well represented have 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.650
 pretty flat textures and the system 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.940
 physical is not too realistic 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.830
 stand out above all the spectacular 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.280
 definitive movements of each 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.280
 character 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.500
 do not 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:16.630
 and its sound section has effects 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.670
 and achieved even though they are nothing 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.770
 bad the soundtrack can become 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.680
 repetitive missing something 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.690
 of the original sagas the voices by 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.400
 another part are the originals in Japanese 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.740
 although the conversations in the mode 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.360
 history do not have dubbing all 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.070
 comes completely subtitled to the 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.569
 Castilian so you will not miss 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.379
 no detail about its plot 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:39.379
 no no 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:47.460
 in conclusion yei stars vÃ­ctor and versus 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.260
 plus is an entertaining wrestling game 

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.000
 with a pretty combat system 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.220
 simple and designed for fans of 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.960
 Manganime the characters are very 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.760
 varied and well differentiated 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.280
 counting on unique movements and 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:01.350
 transformations the camera gives enough 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.840
 problems believing from sight sometimes 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:05.610
 what happens on the online stage 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:09.740
 it works well even if you miss a 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.740
 most worked local multiplayer mode 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.440
 the characters are very loyal to their 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.540
 respective series with movements and 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.610
 most representative attacks of each 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.460
 but the scenarios could be more 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:26.110
 careful the sound section is not bad 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.110
 highlighting their voices in Japanese 

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:30.209
 if you are green fans of 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.279
 characters of the magazines though 

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:34.080
 appear in this game will keep you 

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:37.159
 entertained a long time although there 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.159
 Several improvable details
