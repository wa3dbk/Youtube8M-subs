00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
okay today and we're gonna talk about

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.130 
okay today and we're gonna talk about
loom<00:00:19.570> knitting<00:00:19.869> with<00:00:20.230> cotton<00:00:20.830> yarn<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:23.050> a

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
loom knitting with cotton yarn it's a

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.450 
loom knitting with cotton yarn it's a
little<00:00:23.410> bit<00:00:23.529> different<00:00:24.070> than<00:00:24.279> your

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
little bit different than your

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.550 
little bit different than your
traditional<00:00:24.609> yarns<00:00:25.480> it's<00:00:25.660> it's<00:00:25.960> quite<00:00:26.289> a<00:00:26.320> bit

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
traditional yarns it's it's quite a bit

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.980 
traditional yarns it's it's quite a bit
softer<00:00:27.099> but<00:00:27.310> when<00:00:27.789> you<00:00:28.089> knit<00:00:28.419> the<00:00:28.749> same

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
softer but when you knit the same

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.529 
softer but when you knit the same
stitches<00:00:29.560> you<00:00:30.220> get<00:00:30.429> a<00:00:30.460> completely<00:00:30.999> different

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
stitches you get a completely different

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.360 
stitches you get a completely different
effect<00:00:31.680> because<00:00:32.680> it<00:00:32.829> doesn't<00:00:33.130> have<00:00:33.310> the<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
effect because it doesn't have the the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.120 
effect because it doesn't have the the
stretch<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.450> recoil<00:00:38.320> I<00:00:38.650> guess<00:00:38.830> you<00:00:38.980> would

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
stretch and the recoil I guess you would

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.210 
stretch and the recoil I guess you would
call<00:00:39.160> it<00:00:39.490> of<00:00:39.580> some<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:39.940> the<00:00:40.090> acrylic<00:00:40.540> yarns<00:00:41.440> you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
call it of some of the acrylic yarns you

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.250 
call it of some of the acrylic yarns you
can<00:00:42.340> see<00:00:42.520> there's<00:00:42.730> like<00:00:42.880> there's<00:00:43.480> no<00:00:43.720> give<00:00:44.050> in

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
can see there's like there's no give in

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.470 
can see there's like there's no give in
this<00:00:44.470> yarn<00:00:44.740> whatsoever<00:00:45.340> but<00:00:45.550> it<00:00:45.610> is<00:00:45.880> very<00:00:46.090> soft

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
this yarn whatsoever but it is very soft

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.420 
this yarn whatsoever but it is very soft
so<00:00:46.870> I've<00:00:47.140> done<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.500> comparison<00:00:48.160> of<00:00:48.250> some

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
so I've done the comparison of some

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.260 
so I've done the comparison of some
stitches<00:00:49.000> and<00:00:49.300> then<00:00:49.900> what<00:00:50.080> I'll<00:00:50.200> do<00:00:50.380> in<00:00:50.560> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
stitches and then what I'll do in the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270 
stitches and then what I'll do in the
deep<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.810> following<00:00:53.320> parts<00:00:53.680> is<00:00:53.890> show<00:00:54.040> you<00:00:54.100> how

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280

00:01:58.379 --> 00:01:58.389 
just a little pattern to it I'll show

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:00.510 
just a little pattern to it I'll show
you<00:01:58.450> how<00:01:58.600> to<00:01:58.719> do<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.990> border<00:01:59.319> stitch<00:01:59.619> these

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
you how to do the border stitch these

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.859 
you how to do the border stitch these
are<00:02:00.729> all<00:02:00.850> really<00:02:01.029> easy<00:02:01.149> because<00:02:01.689> they

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
are all really easy because they

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.580 
are all really easy because they
basically<00:02:02.319> are<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.799> variation<00:02:03.670> of<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:05.380> same

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
basically are a variation of the same

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.279 
basically are a variation of the same
technique<00:02:06.249> now<00:02:06.939> in<00:02:07.179> a<00:02:07.329> comparison<00:02:07.899> this<00:02:08.229> is

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
technique now in a comparison this is

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.320 
technique now in a comparison this is
your<00:02:08.590> traditional<00:02:09.220> stocking<00:02:09.700> that<00:02:09.729> stitch<00:02:10.119> on

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
your traditional stocking that stitch on

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.500 
your traditional stocking that stitch on
it<00:02:10.660> on<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:11.189> illuminator<00:02:12.189> um<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:13.060> can<00:02:13.209> see<00:02:13.360> how

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
it on a illuminator um you can see how

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.780 
it on a illuminator um you can see how
