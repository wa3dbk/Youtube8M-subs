it<00:01:17.820> says<00:01:17.970> all<00:01:18.299> in<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.470> basically

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
it says all in one so that basically

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.370 
it says all in one so that basically
means<00:01:19.860> it's<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> camera<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> control

hefty um I was expecting you know
something<00:03:37.980> a<00:03:38.130> little<00:03:38.550> bit<00:03:38.730> lighter<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.780> I

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
something a little bit lighter but I

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.259 
something a little bit lighter but I
appreciate<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:41.700> it's<00:03:41.820> actually<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> little

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
appreciate that it's actually a little

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.449 
appreciate that it's actually a little
bit<00:03:42.450> heavier<00:03:42.840> because<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:44.130> lets<00:03:44.340> me<00:03:44.400> know

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
bit heavier because that lets me know

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.970 
bit heavier because that lets me know
it's<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> little<00:03:44.910> more<00:03:45.000> durable<00:03:45.980> sometimes

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
it's a little more durable sometimes

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.620 
it's a little more durable sometimes
when<00:03:47.190> they're<00:03:47.310> dead<00:03:47.489> light<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.970> cheap<00:03:48.090> and

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
when they're dead light and cheap and

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.470 
when they're dead light and cheap and
plasticky<00:03:49.320> then<00:03:49.590> they<00:03:50.310> tend<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.910> break<00:03:51.239> easier

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
plasticky then they tend to break easier

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.790 
plasticky then they tend to break easier
this<00:03:54.480> isn't<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.900> actual<00:03:55.050> review<00:03:55.380> we're<00:03:55.620> just
