00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the origin of evil this is a question 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.589
 that many have done and others use it 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.840
 to question goodbye today we will study 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.570
 this topic to be able to discover what is 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.630
 the origin of the evil biblical studies the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.630
 the art of serving we initiate if God is 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.960
 well where did evil because I think 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.960
 God the man capable of sin and in everything 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.570
 case because he was tempted the man is the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.630
 eternal frame with the good there are maybe two 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 deities as Zoroastrianism affirms that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.510
 they are eternal good and bad in 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 eternal struggle with each other in any case if the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.180
 badly had an origin in the fall of 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.860
 lucifer or satanas that produced this fall 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.899
 which is what caused his fall and the 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.230
 first entry of evil in the creation of 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:52.370
 god and if so because God allowed it 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:56.520
 you can add some more questions 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.280
 also why did God decide to create 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.410
 God was in solitude all those 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.199
 are questions that arise frequently 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.760
 and follow some answers that will serve as 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.600
 help to see a solution 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.360
 satisfactory 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 history to these apparent problems the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.310
 Christian response about the origin 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.350
 of evil is satisfactory in the first place 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
 it's not about the origin of an entity 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.729
 positive that it had to appear from 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.830
 somehow by creation what 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.649
 is the obstacle that so many times 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 is presented is rather like 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.750
 we will see later of the destruction 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.080
 of a relationship of something negative the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.080
 The key to the answer is true love 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.000
 a created being can not love unless 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.640
 his adherence to the object of his love is 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.039
 freely given there is no love in the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.649
 automatons programmed for a behavior 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.659
 determined and this is the reason that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.200
 God did not make saints to man or to 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.259
 Angels but is innocent and 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.300
 two very distinct concepts god made to 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.030
 the angels and the first human couple 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.369
 that necessarily depend on him that is 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.100
 the absolute the being that exists in itself 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.130
 same 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.979
 he is the great I am the one that I am in 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.640
 change the angels or human creatures 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.510
 they have come to do before they were not and 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.640
 they could not have been contingent and 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.890
 dependent on him for the full enjoyment of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.230
 all the potential and destiny for which 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.560
 God has created them this brings us to 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.020
 consider the following points 1 god 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.110
 in his tri personality in a single being 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.360
 he is totally self-satisfied no 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.600
 precise of no being outside of itself 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.220
 to enjoy an infinite degree of love 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.350
 communication and communion inasmuch as 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.500
 people who subsist within the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.730
 age only enjoy a tripartite 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.569
 satisfaction of love and communion between 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.060
 yes god was not alone and even more his joy 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.110
 and communion were fully 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:01.910
 satisfactory in the bosom of the deity 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:05.090
 chapter one 11 17 52 the divine decision 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.310
 to create was thus totally free fruit 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.740
 of an unconditioned divine will 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.590
 for any kind of need 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:14.960
 the absolute personal infinite wanted 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.930
 create many beings necessarily 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.730
 finite but in his image and likeness 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.460
 so that they had relationship and communion 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.530
 with him thing made possible also to 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.810
 endow them with the gift of language a 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.190
 reflection of the same eternal nature of 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.290
 the deity juan 1 13 as has already been 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.080
 indicated above was totally 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.390
 necessary that the angelic creatures or 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.360
 human beings possessed the capacity to love 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.940
 but the genuine capacity to love demands 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.330
 by its very nature that is an act 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.760
 free a free adhesion let's not forget 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.890
 that in the case of the love of being created 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.410
 towards the creator it is not about a love 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.240
 of equal to equal but of the love of a being 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:59.180
 contingent and dependent towards the 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.670
 absolute creator and self existent here 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.440
 It is necessary to make an incision making 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.140
 mention of the commandment to love God 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.330
 about all things with the statement 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.790
 that god is a jealous god before 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.430
 those who do not love him have to have 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.290
 consider that this commandment as all 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.400
 the law presupposes that man is 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.829
 sinner who already 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.790
 has fallen into sin in his state of 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.669
 innocence 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.520
 the man did not receive this commandment 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:27.650
 because not because it was not necessary 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.259
 man not fallen not only loved God 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 but he enjoyed feeling has 

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:35.150
 stolen from him he sang praises that 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.490
 they came from a heart full of joy and 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.400
 thank you not only for what you had 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.350
 the fact but also by himself as 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.860
 a lover with his girlfriend or 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.680
 vice versa that happens then that the 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.139
 Falling man becomes enmity with God 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.050
 God goes after man to redeem 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:56.030
 what and starts to run away from God 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.699
 abhorring it and the command to love 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.979
 God given precisely after the 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:02.840
 fall makes the condition of 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.669
 sin in which the man is and 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.630
 that the law can never release him 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:11.000
 but grace 4 let's turn to the fact itself 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.190
 from the fall evil should not be 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.540
 considered as a positive entity 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.270
 as already indicated above 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.340
 it is a deficiency and that by the 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.740
 the very nature of things has to be 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.840
 necessarily possible in case 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.750
 otherwise there would be a love and adhesion 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.970
 true and freely given this 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.130
 deficiency takes place in an attitude 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.560
 that goes from complacency in God to the 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.020
 distrust of disbelief to the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.040
 enmity we know how it was generated in the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.230
 Man distrusting God Genesis 3 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:46.660
 we do not know it so clearly in the case 

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:49.480
 of satan although in writing we are 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.930
 indicates that the sin arose is to say the 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.820
 deficiency in the protective cherub 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.190
 we know, however, that there was a 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.840
 beginning in the sin of satan a 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.810
 sin in which he has all the 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.360
 moral responsibility and that is fallen 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.430
 it was not generated by the same god although 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.650
 God certainly left open said 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.840
 possibility so that it was not 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.730
 impossible the manifestation of love and 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.920
 the adhesion of this love that are 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.110
 natural in a contingent creature 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.060
 towards the fountain of abundant life filled 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.130
 of joy in which the god himself is the 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.200
 object of a love that forgets itself 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.210
 same and that is filled with a joy 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.150
 in contemplation of the object of his 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.220
 love I will not go on to extend myself here in all 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.080
 the question of the promised redemption to 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.180
 man and reached by the same god 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:36.580
 made man who died on the cross and who 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.460
 resurrected and that opened the way to forgiveness 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:41.350
 to the justification to sanctification and 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.750
 to glorification for those who return 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.090
 to him because my object was just to make some 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.030
 reflections about the origin of evil 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.550
 but really it is necessary to mention 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.550
 that the same god not only assumed the cross 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.870
 and our condemnation before his justice 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.360
 self-condemnation necessary in the 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.640
 the very nature of things because of 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.650
 that justice the fact that it does not 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.260
 can avoid the consequences of 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.720
 actions committed could not go through 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.030
 high the sin but also in his 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.860
 life incarnate god the son felt of 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.860
 own and infinitely way 

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.630
 deep all our weaknesses Juan 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.070
