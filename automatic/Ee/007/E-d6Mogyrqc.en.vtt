00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.890 
features of the particular peeler that I
have<00:02:06.040> this<00:02:06.760> is<00:02:06.910> a<00:02:06.940> pampered<00:02:07.300> chef<00:02:07.360> version

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
have this is a pampered chef version

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.840 
have this is a pampered chef version
there<00:02:08.110> are<00:02:08.140> other<00:02:08.259> versions<00:02:08.470> out<00:02:08.800> there

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
there are other versions out there

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.650 
there are other versions out there
I<00:02:10.290> can<00:02:11.290> also<00:02:11.590> hate<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.040> peeler<00:02:12.580> be<00:02:13.090> just<00:02:13.450> a

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
I can also hate this peeler be just a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.690 
I can also hate this peeler be just a
corer<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.260> slicer<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.980> way<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.459> is

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
corer and a slicer the way I do that is

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.040 
corer and a slicer the way I do that is
you<00:02:15.940> just<00:02:15.970> pull<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.450> out<00:02:16.660> of<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.900> way

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
you just pull this out of the way

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.260 
you just pull this out of the way
there's<00:02:17.290> nothing<00:02:17.620> here<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> locks<00:02:18.880> it<00:02:19.090> out

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
there's nothing here that locks it out

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.020 
there's nothing here that locks it out
so<00:02:19.840> that<00:02:19.870> when<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.140> push<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.440> through<00:02:20.910> its<00:02:21.910> not

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
so that when I push it through its not

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.370 
so that when I push it through its not
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.240> go<00:02:22.360> through<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.660> peeler<00:02:22.900> obviously

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
going to go through the peeler obviously

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.449 
going to go through the peeler obviously
it's<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.680> going<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.890> go<00:02:23.980> through<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.250> core

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
it's just going to go through the core

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.930 
it's just going to go through the core
and<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.180> slicer<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.110> you<00:02:26.230> leave<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.530> skin<00:02:26.800> on

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
and the slicer so you leave the skin on

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.979 
and the slicer so you leave the skin on
the<00:02:27.940> other<00:02:28.090> option<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:29.080> to<00:02:29.860> leave<00:02:30.010> this<00:02:30.190> up<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
the other option is to leave this up and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.930 
the other option is to leave this up and
this<00:02:31.989> piece<00:02:32.290> can<00:02:32.770> be<00:02:32.920> moved<00:02:33.130> down<00:02:33.459> out<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
this piece can be moved down out of the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.300 
this piece can be moved down out of the
way<00:02:33.970> down<00:02:34.239> here<00:02:34.630> there's<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.350> little<00:02:35.470> bolt

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
way down here there's a little bolt

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.010 
way down here there's a little bolt
right<00:02:36.489> here<00:02:36.730> that<00:02:37.120> you'd<00:02:37.239> have<00:02:37.390> done<00:02:37.600> that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
right here that you'd have done that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.540 
right here that you'd have done that
you'd<00:02:38.170> loosen<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.890> then<00:02:39.100> that<00:02:39.250> would<00:02:39.370> just

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
you'd loosen and then that would just

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.670 
you'd loosen and then that would just
swing<00:02:39.760> down<00:02:39.910> you<00:02:40.330> tighten<00:02:40.600> it<00:02:40.660> back<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:40.840> then

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
swing down you tighten it back up then

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.830 
swing down you tighten it back up then
it<00:02:42.370> would<00:02:42.550> be<00:02:42.820> just<00:02:43.090> being<00:02:43.360> pushed<00:02:43.690> through

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
it would be just being pushed through

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.710 
it would be just being pushed through
just<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.950> peeler<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:46.060> wouldn't<00:02:46.330> core<00:02:46.600> it

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
just the peeler and you wouldn't core it

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.810 
just the peeler and you wouldn't core it
or<00:02:46.870> slice<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.290> that's<00:02:47.920> pretty<00:02:48.280> handy<00:02:48.489> if

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
or slice it that's pretty handy if

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.920 
or slice it that's pretty handy if
you're<00:02:48.940> doing<00:02:49.180> something<00:02:49.390> like<00:02:49.510> apple<00:02:49.900> pie

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
feeling where you might want larger

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.460 
feeling where you might want larger
chunks<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.900> apples

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
