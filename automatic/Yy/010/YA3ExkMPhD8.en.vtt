okay<00:00:22.180> we're<00:00:22.329> going<00:00:22.419> to<00:00:22.480> try<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.720> find<00:00:23.939> the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
okay we're going to try to find the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.540 
okay we're going to try to find the
exact<00:00:25.509> location<00:00:26.170> of<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.529> bend<00:00:29.160> by<00:00:30.160> having

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
exact location of the bend by having

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.799 
exact location of the bend by having
some<00:00:30.849> sort<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.739> dial<00:00:32.739> indicator<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:34.570> in

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
some sort of a dial indicator which in

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.549 
some sort of a dial indicator which in
this<00:00:34.960> case<00:00:35.260> is<00:00:35.879> just<00:00:36.879> a<00:00:37.059> bar<00:00:37.540> from<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.199> dial

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
this case is just a bar from a dial

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.180 
this case is just a bar from a dial
indicator<00:00:39.070> actually<00:00:40.500> which<00:00:41.500> is<00:00:41.680> enough<00:00:41.979> to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
indicator actually which is enough to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.039 
indicator actually which is enough to
show<00:00:42.430> us<00:00:42.640> where<00:00:42.940> the<00:00:43.119> damage<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.930> I<00:00:45.900> don't<00:00:46.900> know

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
show us where the damage is I don't know

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.439 
show us where the damage is I don't know
if<00:00:47.140> this<00:00:47.290> is<00:00:47.320> very<00:00:47.739> visible<00:00:48.010> but<00:00:48.369> the<00:00:48.820> damage

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
if this is very visible but the damage

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.390 
if this is very visible but the damage
is<00:00:49.690> the<00:00:50.470> center<00:00:50.979> of<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.879> main<00:00:52.089> head<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.659> right

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
is the center of the main head is right

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.329 
is the center of the main head is right
there<00:00:54.400> the<00:00:54.909> bend<00:00:55.180> is<00:00:55.360> about<00:00:56.189> probably<00:00:57.189> an

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
there the bend is about probably an

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.609 
there the bend is about probably an
eighth<00:00:57.580> of<00:00:57.820> an<00:00:57.909> inch<00:00:58.059> or<00:00:58.420> so<00:00:58.570> deep<00:00:59.199> which<00:00:59.470> is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
eighth of an inch or so deep which is

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:03.840 
eighth of an inch or so deep which is
plenty<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.420> throw<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.659> entire<00:01:02.589> wheel<00:01:02.860> out<00:01:03.159> of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
plenty to throw the entire wheel out of

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.210 
plenty to throw the entire wheel out of
round<00:01:04.360> and<00:01:06.240> cause<00:01:07.680> significant<00:01:08.680> problems

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
round and cause significant problems

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.660 
round and cause significant problems
during<00:01:10.290> driving<00:01:11.290> or<00:01:11.470> Auto<00:01:11.830> crossing<00:01:12.400> under

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
during driving or Auto crossing under

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.190 
during driving or Auto crossing under
braking<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.390> cornering<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:16.600> we're<00:01:17.020> going<00:01:17.140> to

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
braking and cornering so we're going to

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.550 
braking and cornering so we're going to
try<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.410> fix<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.920> by<00:01:18.370> pushing<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.560> damaged

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
try to fix this by pushing the damaged

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.230 
try to fix this by pushing the damaged
area<00:01:20.920> out<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.170> simple<00:01:23.680> contraption

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
area out I have a simple contraption

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.990 
area out I have a simple contraption
down<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.450> bottom<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:27.340> from<00:01:27.670> the<00:01:27.850> device

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
down on the bottom going from the device

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710 
down on the bottom going from the device
into<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.120> wheel<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.880> pushing<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.000> out<00:01:34.120> you

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
into the wheel and pushing it out you

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.760 
into the wheel and pushing it out you
can<00:01:34.900> actually<00:01:35.080> make<00:01:35.620> yourself<00:01:36.330> adapters<00:01:37.330> that

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
can actually make yourself adapters that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.790 
can actually make yourself adapters that
will<00:01:39.270> work<00:01:40.270> that<00:01:40.930> might<00:01:41.140> be<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.320> little<00:01:41.530> sharper

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
will work that might be a little sharper

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.010 
will work that might be a little sharper
or<00:01:42.220> a<00:01:42.700> little<00:01:42.970> longer<00:01:43.210> depending<00:01:43.510> on<00:01:43.900> the

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
or a little longer depending on the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.980 
or a little longer depending on the
damage<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:45.640> one<00:01:45.850> works<00:01:46.030> great<00:01:46.390> for<00:01:46.420> me<00:01:46.720> it's

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
damage this one works great for me it's

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.480 
damage this one works great for me it's
a<00:01:47.080> stock<00:01:47.409> scissor<00:01:48.280> jack<00:01:49.260> from<00:01:50.260> a<00:01:50.350> car<00:01:50.650> and<00:01:50.950> it

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
a stock scissor jack from a car and it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.860 
a stock scissor jack from a car and it
gives<00:01:51.640> me<00:01:51.790> plenty<00:01:52.030> of<00:01:52.240> adjustability<00:01:52.960> and

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
gives me plenty of adjustability and

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.800 
gives me plenty of adjustability and
also<00:01:55.870> precision<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.729> let's<00:01:58.210> try<00:01:58.479> if<00:01:58.540> this

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
also precision so let's try if this

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:34.289 
also precision so let's try if this
works

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:37.959 

this<00:02:35.299> is<00:02:35.510> where<00:02:35.689> the<00:02:35.810> damage<00:02:36.200> was<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.700> had

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
this is where the damage was and we had

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.440 
this is where the damage was and we had
about<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.920> eighth<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:40.159> an<00:02:40.250> inch<00:02:40.370> gap<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.299> there

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
about a eighth of an inch gap in there

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:51.710 
about a eighth of an inch gap in there
before<00:02:41.709> which<00:02:42.709> was<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.069> imperfection

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:20.110 

you

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.440 

okay<00:03:21.120> here<00:03:21.330> we<00:03:21.480> have<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.960> wheel<00:03:22.319> that<00:03:22.710> was<00:03:23.450> fixed

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
okay here we have a wheel that was fixed

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.680 
okay here we have a wheel that was fixed
at<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.620> local<00:03:26.280> shop<00:03:28.370> today<00:03:29.370> actually<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.300> picked

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
at a local shop today actually I picked

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.680 
at a local shop today actually I picked
it<00:03:30.780> up<00:03:30.900> today<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.130> see<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.850> burn<00:03:33.150> marks

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
it up today you can see the burn marks

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.960 
it up today you can see the burn marks
and<00:03:36.140> there's<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.200> lot<00:03:37.380> of<00:03:37.500> sanding<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.370> lot<00:03:38.400> of

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
and there's a lot of sanding a lot of

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.560 
and there's a lot of sanding a lot of
grinding<00:03:39.300> actually<00:03:40.050> on<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:41.760> wheel<00:03:42.120> which

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
grinding actually on this wheel which

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.170 
grinding actually on this wheel which
was<00:03:43.070> really<00:03:44.070> unnecessary<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.880> mean<00:03:45.090> this

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
was really unnecessary I mean this

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.720 
was really unnecessary I mean this
wasn't<00:03:45.480> bent<00:03:45.870> this<00:03:46.110> was<00:03:46.260> actually<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.730> wheel

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
wasn't bent this was actually the wheel

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.160 
wasn't bent this was actually the wheel
that<00:03:47.970> was<00:03:48.170> somewhat<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.319> best<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.870> this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
that was somewhat the best this is this

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.900 
that was somewhat the best this is this
is<00:03:52.320> a<00:03:52.350> wheel<00:03:52.680> that<00:03:52.950> I<00:03:52.980> will<00:03:53.190> be<00:03:53.310> using<00:03:53.340> for

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
is a wheel that I will be using for

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.660 
is a wheel that I will be using for
national<00:03:54.360> competition<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.520> the

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
national competition this is the

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.220 
national competition this is the
straightest<00:03:57.860> one<00:03:58.860> that<00:03:59.550> I<00:03:59.580> had<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.300> thought<00:04:01.200> I

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
straightest one that I had and thought I

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.530 
straightest one that I had and thought I
had<00:04:01.470> it<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.860> would<00:04:02.250> have<00:04:02.519> it<00:04:02.670> perfected<00:04:03.030> at<00:04:03.390> the

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
had it I would have it perfected at the

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.050 
had it I would have it perfected at the
shop<00:04:03.830> but<00:04:04.830> as<00:04:05.280> you<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.610> see<00:04:07.640> there's<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.700> lot<00:04:08.910> of

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
shop but as you can see there's a lot of

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.640 
shop but as you can see there's a lot of
burn<00:04:09.239> marks<00:04:09.660> which<00:04:09.840> doesn't<00:04:10.290> affect<00:04:10.350> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
burn marks which doesn't affect the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.800 
burn marks which doesn't affect the
performance<00:04:10.800> there's<00:04:11.430> still<00:04:11.670> some<00:04:11.880> chipping

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
performance there's still some chipping

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.220 
performance there's still some chipping
and<00:04:12.989> things<00:04:13.350> like<00:04:13.500> that<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:14.209> but<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.420> worst

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
and things like that but but the worst

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.349 
and things like that but but the worst
part<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.650> this<00:04:17.070> I<00:04:19.519> don't<00:04:20.519> know<00:04:20.730> if<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.880> can<00:04:21.030> see

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
part is this I don't know if you can see

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.469 
part is this I don't know if you can see
it<00:04:21.510> but<00:04:22.190> that<00:04:23.190> wheel<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.700> not<00:04:24.600> straight<00:04:26.479> they

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
it but that wheel is not straight they

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.510 
it but that wheel is not straight they
don't<00:04:27.690> use<00:04:27.840> a<00:04:27.870> spinning<00:04:28.620> technique<00:04:29.010> like<00:04:29.220> this

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
don't use a spinning technique like this

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.020 
don't use a spinning technique like this
they<00:04:29.760> just<00:04:29.790> use<00:04:30.150> forms<00:04:31.130> which<00:04:32.130> will<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.640> show

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
they just use forms which will not show

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.810 
they just use forms which will not show
every<00:04:33.570> little<00:04:33.840> defect<00:04:34.250> if<00:04:35.250> you<00:04:35.490> have<00:04:35.640> the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
every little defect if you have the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.320 
every little defect if you have the
wheel<00:04:36.030> mounted<00:04:36.660> solidly<00:04:37.200> on<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.800> surface

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
wheel mounted solidly on the surface

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.159 
wheel mounted solidly on the surface
just<00:04:39.330> like<00:04:39.450> this<00:04:41.270> you<00:04:42.270> could<00:04:42.419> definitely<00:04:42.690> see

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
just like this you could definitely see

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.080 
just like this you could definitely see
a<00:04:43.200> lot<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.560> the<00:04:43.800> imperfections<00:04:44.550> in<00:04:44.790> a<00:04:44.820> lot<00:04:45.000> of

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
a lot of the imperfections in a lot of

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.090 
a lot of the imperfections in a lot of
the<00:04:45.180> bins<00:04:46.010> much<00:04:47.010> easier<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:47.940> anyway<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:49.040> try<00:04:50.040> to

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the bins much easier so anyway I try to

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.390 
the bins much easier so anyway I try to
attempt<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:51.570> finish<00:04:52.250> straightening<00:04:53.250> this

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
attempt to finish straightening this

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:03.990 
attempt to finish straightening this
wheel

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.899 

this<00:05:05.000> was<00:05:05.270> caused<00:05:05.539> by<00:05:05.960> hitting<00:05:06.770> a<00:05:07.129> either<00:05:07.759> a

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:07.909 
this was caused by hitting a either a

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:10.300 
this was caused by hitting a either a
transition<00:05:08.719> on<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:08.990> course

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
transition on the course

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.749 
transition on the course
sometimes<00:05:11.030> there's<00:05:11.300> transition<00:05:11.960> between

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
sometimes there's transition between

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.059 
sometimes there's transition between
between<00:05:13.759> concrete<00:05:14.629> or<00:05:14.960> between<00:05:15.500> a<00:05:15.620> concrete

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:16.069 
between concrete or between a concrete

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:17.200 
between concrete or between a concrete
and<00:05:16.340> an<00:05:16.430> asphalt

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
and an asphalt

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.439 
and an asphalt
section<00:05:18.669> usually<00:05:19.669> found<00:05:19.909> on<00:05:20.210> an<00:05:21.139> airport<00:05:21.949> site

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
section usually found on an airport site

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:25.179 
section usually found on an airport site
so<00:05:23.449> this<00:05:23.719> this<00:05:24.050> is<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.409> type<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.710> damage<00:05:25.009> that

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:25.189 
so this this is the type of damage that

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:29.080 
so this this is the type of damage that
will<00:05:25.490> see<00:05:25.819> during<00:05:26.689> an<00:05:27.050> autocross<00:05:27.939> here<00:05:28.939> I'm

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
will see during an autocross here I'm

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.209 
will see during an autocross here I'm

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
inside the wheel and I'm just going to

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:55.490 
inside the wheel and I'm just going to
push<00:05:44.599> it<00:05:44.750> out<00:05:44.840> really<00:05:45.319> gently<00:05:45.770> and<00:05:46.330> heat<00:05:47.330> up

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
little bit more there we need about

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:28.140 
little bit more there we need about
another<00:06:24.880> sixteenth<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.810> an<00:06:25.930> inch<00:06:27.150> I'm

of the wheel the bead section of the rim
is<00:06:57.700> quite<00:06:58.060> straight<00:06:58.450> now<00:07:00.420> there's<00:07:01.420> a<00:07:01.510> very

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:01.750 
is quite straight now there's a very

is quite straight now there's a very
slight<00:07:02.340> bump<00:07:03.340> and<00:07:03.730> if<00:07:04.030> that<00:07:04.330> bump<00:07:04.630> is<00:07:04.810> actually

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:05.380 
slight bump and if that bump is actually

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.760 
slight bump and if that bump is actually
where<00:07:06.280> the<00:07:06.460> wheel<00:07:06.670> was<00:07:06.910> fixed<00:07:07.390> at<00:07:07.810> the<00:07:08.500> shop

which<00:07:09.190> is<00:07:09.370> right<00:07:09.610> there<00:07:15.900> the<00:07:16.900> little<00:07:17.050> Bend

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
which is right there the little Bend

which is right there the little Bend
that<00:07:18.010> you<00:07:18.070> see<00:07:18.430> on<00:07:18.610> the<00:07:18.730> lip<00:07:18.940> of<00:07:19.150> the<00:07:19.240> rim<00:07:19.600> is

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980 
that you see on the lip of the rim is

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:25.590 
that you see on the lip of the rim is
just<00:07:20.980> a<00:07:21.100> small<00:07:21.430> area<00:07:22.140> right<00:07:23.140> there<00:07:24.300> and<00:07:25.300> if<00:07:25.480> you

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:25.600 
just a small area right there and if you

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.060 
just a small area right there and if you
can<00:07:25.780> see<00:07:25.990> that<00:07:26.140> you<00:07:26.230> probably<00:07:26.470> can't<00:07:26.830> see<00:07:27.040> it

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
can see that you probably can't see it

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.040 
can see that you probably can't see it
from<00:07:27.370> this<00:07:27.490> angle<00:07:27.670> but<00:07:28.000> there's<00:07:28.210> where<00:07:28.900> the

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050
