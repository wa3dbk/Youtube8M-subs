were doing good at this point um d

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.240 
were doing good at this point um d
chains<00:01:24.960> are<00:01:25.110> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.290> slacking<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:28.590> looked

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
chains are kind of slacking so I looked

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
chains are kind of slacking so I looked
up<00:01:29.400> armadale<00:01:29.880> Helms<00:01:30.270> they<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:30.720> terrible<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
up armadale Helms they were terrible and

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.810 
up armadale Helms they were terrible and
thing<00:01:31.530> we're<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.799> 5k<00:01:32.400> profit<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:33.030> 10k<00:01:33.210> profit

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
thing we're like 5k profit or 10k profit
so<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> ended<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.240> doing<00:01:36.299> Furies<00:01:36.930> they're

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
so I ended up doing Furies they're

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.480 
so I ended up doing Furies they're
actually<00:01:37.409> doing<00:01:37.530> really<00:01:37.619> good<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.100> flip<00:01:38.310> for

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
actually doing really good they flip for

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.560 
actually doing really good they flip for
like<00:01:38.610> 300<00:01:39.000> k<00:01:39.439> so<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.470> end<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:40.979> Furies<00:01:41.700> most

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
like 300 k so I end up doing Furies most

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.060 
like 300 k so I end up doing Furies most
of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.750> majority<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.170> the<00:01:43.229> time<00:01:43.470> here<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> the

during this video hmm Robbins ended up
slacking<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.570> bit<00:01:48.990> down<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.350> hill<00:01:49.680> or<00:01:49.890> debit

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
slacking a bit down the hill or debit

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.319 
slacking a bit down the hill or debit
down<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.549> road<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.640> of<00:01:53.729> cancel<00:01:54.090> doing

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
down the road so I kind of cancel doing

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.980 
down the road so I kind of cancel doing
Robbins<00:01:55.310> um<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> think<00:01:57.479> yeah<00:01:57.600> after<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
Robbins um so I think yeah after this

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.770 
Robbins um so I think yeah after this
you<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.259> seem<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.530> cancel<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:58.890> rod<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.100> some

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
you can seem to cancel the rod and some

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.600 
you can seem to cancel the rod and some
took<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.869> while<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.049> these<00:02:01.409> things<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.649> sell<00:02:01.920> um

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.820 

so

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so
Robbins<00:02:07.830> weren't<00:02:08.039> working<00:02:08.250> good<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.670> said

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
Robbins weren't working good like I said

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.330 
Robbins weren't working good like I said
out<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> canceled<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.770> decided

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
out there so I canceled them I decided

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.460 
out there so I canceled them I decided
to<00:02:11.459> just<00:02:11.520> go<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:12.380> D<00:02:13.380> chains<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:14.220> Furies

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
to just go with D chains and Furies

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.420 
to just go with D chains and Furies
majority<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> Furies<00:02:16.980> though<00:02:17.190> because

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
majority of the Furies though because

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.270 
majority of the Furies though because
they're<00:02:17.880> flippin<00:02:18.150> 300k<00:02:18.569> each<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.010> each<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
they're flippin 300k each so each one I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.180 
they're flippin 300k each so each one I
would<00:02:20.370> make<00:02:20.580> 300<00:02:20.790> k<00:02:21.950> hmmm<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.650> soon<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.830> Robin

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
would make 300 k hmmm so soon as a Robin

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.800 
would make 300 k hmmm so soon as a Robin
sill<00:02:26.459> I<00:02:26.760> was<00:02:27.030> not<00:02:27.239> going<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.450> buy<00:02:27.600> anymore

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
sill I was not going to buy anymore

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.690 
sill I was not going to buy anymore
because<00:02:28.290> they<00:02:28.410> were<00:02:28.560> going<00:02:29.100> slow<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.610> I'd

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
because they were going slow and I'd

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.729 
because they were going slow and I'd
rather<00:02:29.819> use<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.090> space<00:02:30.810> for<00:02:31.260> something<00:02:31.590> else

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
rather use that space for something else

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.240 
rather use that space for something else
I<00:02:32.750> thought<00:02:33.750> I'd<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.319> doing<00:02:34.680> some<00:02:35.100> more

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250
