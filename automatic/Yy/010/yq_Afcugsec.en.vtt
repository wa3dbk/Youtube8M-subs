of the explosion these are temporary
concrete<00:00:50.940> barriers<00:00:51.359> and<00:00:52.100> the<00:00:53.100> plan<00:00:53.339> is<00:00:53.780> for

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
concrete barriers and the plan is for

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.939 
concrete barriers and the plan is for
the<00:00:55.889> hero<00:00:56.249> to<00:00:56.639> come<00:00:56.670> along<00:00:56.999> and<00:00:57.530> blow<00:00:58.530> holes<00:00:58.799> in

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
the hero to come along and blow holes in

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.189 
the hero to come along and blow holes in
them<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.609> I've<00:00:59.760> marked<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.420> where

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
them so I've marked on the back where

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.260 
them so I've marked on the back where
the<00:01:01.729> explosive<00:01:02.729> will<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:03.260> we<00:01:04.880> drilled<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the explosive will go we drilled out and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.330 
the explosive will go we drilled out and
a<00:01:06.299> charge<00:01:06.570> placed<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.020> there<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:08.070> depth<00:01:08.250> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
a charge placed in there the depth so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
a charge placed in there the depth so
we're<00:01:08.430> gonna<00:01:08.549> use<00:01:08.789> our<00:01:09.149> specialist<00:01:09.869> debts<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
we're gonna use our specialist debts for

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
we're gonna use our specialist debts for
miniature<00:01:10.979> model<00:01:11.189> making<00:01:11.520> quite<00:01:12.329> often<00:01:12.479> used

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
miniature model making quite often used

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
miniature model making quite often used
with<00:01:12.810> square<00:01:13.140> bullet<00:01:13.439> hits<00:01:13.590> as<00:01:13.740> well<00:01:13.770> there

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
with square bullet hits as well there

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.359 
with square bullet hits as well there
d66<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:15.270> micro<00:01:15.810> debts<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.380> non<00:01:16.619> fragmenting

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
d66 is micro debts and non fragmenting

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.359 
d66 is micro debts and non fragmenting
debts<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.509> can<00:01:18.859> run<00:01:19.859> them<00:01:19.979> in<00:01:20.100> and

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
debts and so we can run them in and

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.069 
debts and so we can run them in and
thread<00:01:20.579> them<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.000> little<00:01:21.600> holes<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.899> put

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079 
thread them into little holes we put

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.109 
thread them into little holes we put
into<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> model<00:01:22.549> whether<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.700> one<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:23.939> two

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
into the model whether it's one or two

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
into the model whether it's one or two
will<00:01:24.359> it<00:01:24.479> will<00:01:24.689> affect<00:01:24.930> whether<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.259> get

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
will it will affect whether we do get

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.810 
will it will affect whether we do get
like<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> partial<00:01:26.009> blowout<00:01:26.340> or<00:01:26.549> whether<00:01:26.729> we

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like a partial blowout or whether we

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.389 
like a partial blowout or whether we
have<00:01:26.969> iterator<00:01:27.560> another<00:01:28.560> effect<00:01:28.859> is<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.280> a
