00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.260
 hello everyone is welcome in 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.030
 my kitchen 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 so I present you today a 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.639
 crisp idea to get in 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.190
 appetizers 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.109
 they are triangles or laminates 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.699
 call them as you want to 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.100
 ricotta and chives 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 simple fast besides being a delight 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.539
 so we start the preparation I'm going 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.630
 start with seasoning marie quotas 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.759
 and with a little pepper and salt 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.329
 you can replace the ricotta not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.430
 made fresh goat cheese or 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.420
 any cheese they are 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.730
 talented or not too strong so we will 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.670
 also take the sheets of brick on 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.739
 has no son or will be cut into 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.180
 sale for art or you have it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.449
 cut with scissors like you 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.850
 see and we'll take each wine 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.850
 go and brush with melted butter 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.450
 I spend in the corner we go a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.180
 tablespoon of ricotta 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.750
 and then I begin to bend to form a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.910
 triangle 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.760
 so it's simple 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.150
 fold by folding each time the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.700
 point left or right to form 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.340
 a triangle is halfway you insert 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.040
 a sprig of chives and you continue 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.080
 to bend up but so on 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.200
 until we have a little bit of 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.160
 because we are going to insert into oblivion for 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.160
 close the triangle 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.790
 once complete drop them on a 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.580
 caen plate was inducted at 210 Â° 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
 for eight to ten minutes after he 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.360
 Still, to taste is crispy 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.850
 melting on the inside is really 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.040
 tasty I hope you liked it 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.360
 you will try at home I tell you 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.360
