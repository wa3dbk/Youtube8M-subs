00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
smooth as possible and then I put a

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.480

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
white gloss on and it did okay I think

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.410 
white gloss on and it did okay I think
I'm<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.280> continue<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> sanding

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I'm going to continue with the sanding

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.399 
I'm going to continue with the sanding
because<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> went<00:01:30.840> much<00:01:31.020> faster<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:33.409> think

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
because it went much faster and I think

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.300 
because it went much faster and I think
the<00:01:34.619> results<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.700> are<00:01:36.270> adequate<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.070> think

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the results are are adequate and I think

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.350 
the results are are adequate and I think
if<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:40.579> good<00:01:41.579> basic<00:01:41.970> job<00:01:42.180> on

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
if I can get a good good basic job on

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.630 
if I can get a good good basic job on
the<00:01:42.450> white<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.799> paint<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
the white I think when I paint the the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.100 
the white I think when I paint the the
stripe<00:01:44.939> built<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.390> each<00:01:45.420> side<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.960> on<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
stripe built on each side and on the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.819 
stripe built on each side and on the
front<00:01:46.380> red<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:47.909> that'll<00:01:48.180> really<00:01:48.829> really

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
front red I think that'll really really

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.190 
front red I think that'll really really
look<00:01:50.009> nice

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.240

afternoon all right we like I said

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.260 
afternoon all right we like I said
earlier<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.720> went<00:02:36.990> from<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:38.490> stripping<00:02:38.910> method

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
earlier I went from the stripping method

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.000 
earlier I went from the stripping method
of<00:02:39.360> getting<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> paint<00:02:39.900> off<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.320> sanding<00:02:40.860> and

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
of getting the paint off to sanding and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.380 
of getting the paint off to sanding and
sanding<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.970> green<00:02:42.260> went<00:02:43.260> pretty<00:02:43.410> fast<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.610> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
sanding the green went pretty fast it I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.800 
sanding the green went pretty fast it I
think<00:02:45.690> it<00:02:45.780> had<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.290> primer<00:02:46.770> under<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.810> we

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
think it had a primer under it and we

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.530 
think it had a primer under it and we
just<00:02:48.840> scented<00:02:49.380> it<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.650> best<00:02:49.860> we<00:02:50.070> could<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:51.270> has

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
just scented it the best we could it has

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.100 
just scented it the best we could it has
a<00:02:51.570> texture<00:02:52.110> on<00:02:52.290> it<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.920> diamond<00:02:53.610> shape

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
a texture on it and in the diamond shape

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.660 
a texture on it and in the diamond shape
so<00:02:55.110> he<00:02:55.140> just<00:02:55.770> sanded<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.450> best<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.600> could<00:02:57.840> and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
so he just sanded that best we could and

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.110 
so he just sanded that best we could and
mashed<00:02:59.670> it<00:02:59.940> off<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:01.310> painted<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.459> late

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
mashed it off and painted it late

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.479

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's a rust-oleum I think it said two
eggs<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.550> think<00:03:11.580> it<00:03:11.820> was<00:03:11.940> supposed<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.239> be<00:03:12.680> twice

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
eggs I think it was supposed to be twice

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.950 
eggs I think it was supposed to be twice
the<00:03:13.920> coverage<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.910> did<00:03:15.180> pretty<00:03:15.360> well

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.200 

all<00:03:20.960> right<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.200> haven't<00:03:21.470> taken<00:03:22.400> any<00:03:22.610> videos<00:03:22.970> in

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
all right I haven't taken any videos in

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.390 
all right I haven't taken any videos in
a<00:03:23.300> few<00:03:23.510> days<00:03:23.660> so<00:03:23.690> here's<00:03:24.319> a<00:03:24.380> little<00:03:24.650> update<00:03:24.890> on

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
a few days so here's a little update on

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.780 
a few days so here's a little update on
what's<00:03:25.730> been<00:03:25.910> going<00:03:25.940> on<00:03:26.360> I've<00:03:27.020> got<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.160> red

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
what's been going on I've got the red

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.309 
what's been going on I've got the red
painted<00:03:29.300> on<00:03:30.290> both<00:03:30.620> sides<00:03:30.890> in<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.310> front<00:03:31.610> I

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
painted on both sides in the front I

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.500 
painted on both sides in the front I
think<00:03:33.319> that's<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.980> final<00:03:34.790> coat<00:03:35.030> I<00:03:35.060> put<00:03:35.360> two

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
think that's the final coat I put two

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.410 
think that's the final coat I put two
good<00:03:35.660> coats<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.920> red<00:03:37.160> went<00:03:37.400> on<00:03:37.550> pretty<00:03:37.880> pretty

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
good coats the red went on pretty pretty

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.680 
good coats the red went on pretty pretty
good<00:03:38.660> pretty<00:03:39.020> heavy<00:03:39.890> pretty<00:03:40.610> thick<00:03:40.850> coat<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:41.480> I

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
good pretty heavy pretty thick coat so I

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.330 
good pretty heavy pretty thick coat so I
think<00:03:42.470> that's<00:03:42.680> what's<00:03:42.890> going<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.070> work<00:03:43.280> and

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
think that's what's going to work and

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.310 
think that's what's going to work and
got<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.370> coat<00:03:46.670> of<00:03:46.910> white<00:03:47.300> on<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.720> back<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.260> I

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
got a coat of white on the back and I

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.030 
got a coat of white on the back and I
think<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:49.150> that's<00:03:50.150> going<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.540> be<00:03:50.980> good<00:03:51.980> I

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
think that that's going to be good I

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.740 
think that that's going to be good I
might<00:03:52.400> need<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.700> touch<00:03:52.910> up<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.180> little<00:03:53.390> bit<00:03:53.480> more

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
might need to touch up a little bit more

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.300 
might need to touch up a little bit more
I<00:03:54.130> got<00:03:55.130> the<00:03:55.310> back<00:03:56.020> painted<00:03:57.610> white<00:03:58.610> and<00:04:00.310> so

glad<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.000> found<00:04:35.240> that<00:04:35.479> it<00:04:35.630> was<00:04:37.000> what<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.330> way

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
glad I found that it was what it the way

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.360 
glad I found that it was what it the way
it<00:04:38.570> was<00:04:38.750> so<00:04:39.080> I<00:04:39.110> could<00:04:39.200> go<00:04:39.440> ahead<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.680> get<00:04:40.310> that

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
it was so I could go ahead and get that

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.290 
it was so I could go ahead and get that
fixed<00:04:40.760> get<00:04:41.570> one<00:04:41.750> piece<00:04:42.110> of<00:04:42.320> pack<00:04:42.500> in<00:04:42.650> there
