it's the reason for the epic hair the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.810 
it's the reason for the epic hair the
next<00:00:18.300> day<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:19.140> first<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> foremost<00:00:20.220> has<00:00:20.609> to

be the twist and the braids at night I
have<00:00:24.150> found<00:00:24.480> that<00:00:24.840> brazen<00:00:25.350> twist<00:00:25.800> especially

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
have found that brazen twist especially

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.240 
have found that brazen twist especially
during<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:27.119> in-between<00:00:27.990> stage<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.859> short

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
during my in-between stage and short

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.730 
during my in-between stage and short
hair<00:00:29.310> stage<00:00:29.789> basically<00:00:30.539> I<00:00:30.750> found<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
hair stage basically I found that the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.580 
hair stage basically I found that the
braids<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:33.000> twists<00:00:33.300> worked<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.380> much

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
braids and the the twists worked so much

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
braids and the the twists worked so much
better<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.520> tight<00:00:35.969> braids<00:00:36.510> or

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
better it's not like tight braids or

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.110 
better it's not like tight braids or
tight<00:00:36.989> twist<00:00:37.290> -<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.040> do<00:00:38.160> braid<00:00:38.610> outs<00:00:38.940> it's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
tight twist - to do braid outs it's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.330 
tight twist - to do braid outs it's
response<00:00:39.600> but<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:39.960> just<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.829> keep<00:00:41.100> my

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
response but it's just like to keep my

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.180 
response but it's just like to keep my
ends<00:00:41.820> from<00:00:42.180> tangling<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> twists

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
ends from tangling with the twists

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010 
ends from tangling with the twists
because<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.789> hair<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.059> long<00:00:45.360> nice<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.899> this

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because my hair is long nice in this

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049 
because my hair is long nice in this
medium<00:00:46.410> stage<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:47.070> no<00:00:47.160> longer<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> just

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
medium stage I no longer have to just

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.770 
medium stage I no longer have to just
six<00:00:48.300> twists<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> only<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.910> two<00:00:50.910> big<00:00:51.329> twists

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
six twists I can only do two big twists

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.240 
six twists I can only do two big twists
and<00:00:51.899> then<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> low<00:00:52.980> bun<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:54.620> braids<00:00:55.620> same

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
thing two braids and I just do a little

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.380 
thing two braids and I just do a little
bit<00:00:58.859> other<00:00:59.039> thing<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> also<00:00:59.879> find<00:01:00.239> very

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
bit other thing that I also find very

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.500 
bit other thing that I also find very
important<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.379> keeping<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:02.280> hair<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.210> way

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
important is keeping my hair in a way

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
important is keeping my hair in a way
that<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.589> has<00:01:04.619> less<00:01:05.100> movement<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.439> find<00:01:07.439> that

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that it it has less movement I find that

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.890 
that it it has less movement I find that
the<00:01:07.710> less<00:01:07.950> movement<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> has<00:01:09.060> or<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.600> less

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
the less movement it has or the less

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.830 
the less movement it has or the less
friction<00:01:10.549> even<00:01:11.549> if<00:01:11.820> it's<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.210> set<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
friction even if it's on a set and

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.160 
friction even if it's on a set and
pillow<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:14.250> less<00:01:14.490> friction<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.150> has<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
pillow the less friction it has the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.679 
pillow the less friction it has the
better<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.830> looks<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.250> next<00:01:17.580> day<00:01:17.850> I<00:01:18.090> find<00:01:18.509> that

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
better it looks the next day I find that

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
better it looks the next day I find that
to<00:01:18.930> avoid<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.530> movement<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.220> my<00:01:20.369> hair<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.700> would

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to avoid the movement of my hair I would

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.840 
to avoid the movement of my hair I would
have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> wrap<00:01:21.509> up<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.900> hair<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.650> set<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.670> it

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
have to wrap up my hair with a set on it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.910 
have to wrap up my hair with a set on it
the<00:01:24.270> same<00:01:24.540> applies<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:25.080> my<00:01:25.229> moisturizing

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
the same applies with my moisturizing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.760 
the same applies with my moisturizing
system<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:27.000> night<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
system at night I do not want to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.140 
system at night I do not want to
moisturize<00:01:28.950> during<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.549> day<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> avoid

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
moisturize during the day to avoid

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.190 
moisturize during the day to avoid
tangling<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.229> takes<00:01:31.920> too<00:01:32.189> much<00:01:32.310> time<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.200> my

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
tangling it takes too much time and my

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.130 
tangling it takes too much time and my
hair<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.560> low<00:01:35.130> porosity<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.180> doesn't<00:01:36.780> dry

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
hair is low porosity so it doesn't dry

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.679 
hair is low porosity so it doesn't dry
quickly<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:38.340> just<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.240> too<00:01:39.540> much

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
quickly it's just it's it's too much

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
quickly it's just it's it's too much
work<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:39.960> rather<00:01:40.470> do<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:40.920> night<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.340> it

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
work so rather do it at night and it

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.649 
work so rather do it at night and it
sinks<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.540> better<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.700> know<00:01:44.729> gradually

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
sinks in better and you know gradually

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
sinks in better and you know gradually
just<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> way<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.649> hair<00:01:46.860> likes<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
just the way your hair likes it

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.750 
just the way your hair likes it
and<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:48.810> next<00:01:49.079> morning

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
and the next morning

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.690 
and the next morning
it's<00:01:49.880> just<00:01:50.120> or<00:01:50.480> just<00:01:50.540> saying<00:01:50.960> you<00:01:51.410> know<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.250> and

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's just or just saying you know so and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.940 
it's just or just saying you know so and
obviously<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.390> feels<00:01:53.660> supple<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.290> soft<00:01:54.560> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
obviously it feels supple and soft and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.000 
obviously it feels supple and soft and
not<00:01:55.220> tangled<00:01:55.760> and<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.480> very<00:01:56.780> last<00:01:57.050> one<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.770> for

and especially if he's following xcg
method<00:02:03.920> or<00:02:04.460> all<00:02:04.910> these<00:02:05.270> other<00:02:05.450> different

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
method or all these other different

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.889 
method or all these other different
types<00:02:06.260> of<00:02:06.440> methods<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.280> stuff<00:02:07.460> like<00:02:07.610> that<00:02:07.899> try

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
types of methods and stuff like that try

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.430 
types of methods and stuff like that try
and<00:02:09.110> implement<00:02:09.490> hide<00:02:10.490> buns<00:02:11.020> instead<00:02:12.020> of<00:02:12.170> high

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and implement hide buns instead of high

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.160 
and implement hide buns instead of high
pops<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.550> it<00:02:13.700> doesn't<00:02:14.090> tangle<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.840> makes

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
pops so that it doesn't tangle it makes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.790 
pops so that it doesn't tangle it makes
a<00:02:15.530> huge<00:02:16.430> difference<00:02:16.990> at<00:02:17.990> least<00:02:18.050> in<00:02:18.410> my<00:02:18.560> life

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
a huge difference at least in my life

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.980 
a huge difference at least in my life
you<00:02:19.100> didn't<00:02:19.400> implement<00:02:19.790> that<00:02:20.150> see<00:02:20.600> if<00:02:20.840> it

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
you didn't implement that see if it

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.900 
you didn't implement that see if it
works<00:02:21.230> for<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.710> basically<00:02:22.160> all<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.430> do<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.880> I

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
works for you basically all I do is I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.690 
works for you basically all I do is I
put<00:02:23.450> my<00:02:23.600> hair<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:23.990> front<00:02:24.170> wrap<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.280> is<00:02:25.370> about<00:02:25.580> my

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
put my hair in front wrap it is about my

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.730 
put my hair in front wrap it is about my
basses<00:02:26.030> with<00:02:26.150> pineapple<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.900> then<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.410> just

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
basses with pineapple and then I just

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.340 
basses with pineapple and then I just
tuck<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.520> the<00:02:29.060> rest<00:02:29.300> of<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.630> hair<00:02:29.870> at<00:02:30.020> the<00:02:30.140> back

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
tuck in the rest of the hair at the back

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.740 
tuck in the rest of the hair at the back
and<00:02:30.680> there<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.580> go<00:02:31.760> it's<00:02:32.000> really<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.720> simple

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
and there you go it's really that simple

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.410 
and there you go it's really that simple
so<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.280> get<00:02:34.460> as<00:02:34.640> creative<00:02:34.850> as<00:02:35.330> possible

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
so you can get as creative as possible

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.040 
so you can get as creative as possible
just<00:02:35.960> think<00:02:36.830> about<00:02:37.430> doing<00:02:38.150> more<00:02:38.630> with<00:02:38.810> your

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
just think about doing more with your

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.040 
just think about doing more with your
night<00:02:39.320> routine<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.100> less<00:02:40.880> during<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.510> day<00:02:41.690> so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
night routine and less during the day so

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.340 
night routine and less during the day so
that<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.410> also<00:02:42.740> avoids<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.400> frizz<00:02:43.730> I<00:02:44.350> find

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
that that also avoids the frizz I find

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.900 
that that also avoids the frizz I find
that<00:02:45.440> the<00:02:45.590> less<00:02:45.830> friction<00:02:46.100> you<00:02:46.400> have<00:02:46.580> during

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
that the less friction you have during

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:47.949 
that the less friction you have during
the<00:02:47.060> night

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
the night

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.750 
the night
depending<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.680> how<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.890> prepped<00:02:49.250> your<00:02:49.490> hair

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
depending on how you prepped your hair

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.480 
depending on how you prepped your hair
you<00:02:50.390> can<00:02:50.570> actually<00:02:50.690> enjoy<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.440> hair<00:02:51.740> more

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
you can actually enjoy your hair more

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.410 
you can actually enjoy your hair more
like<00:02:52.790> you<00:02:52.880> can<00:02:53.030> have<00:02:53.350> second<00:02:54.350> day<00:02:54.470> third<00:02:55.010> day

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
like you can have second day third day

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.180 
like you can have second day third day

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
9:13 for me it's not about redoing my

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.699 
9:13 for me it's not about redoing my
hair<00:02:58.489> every<00:02:59.300> single<00:02:59.630> night<00:02:59.750> it's<00:03:00.350> really

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
hair every single night it's really

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.220 
hair every single night it's really
about<00:03:00.860> how<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.040> keep<00:03:01.520> it<00:03:01.760> share<00:03:02.330> whatever<00:03:02.840> else

about how I keep it share whatever else
