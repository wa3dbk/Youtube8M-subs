Soviets<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.270> closest<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.780> actually

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
Soviets are the closest we can actually

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.300 
Soviets are the closest we can actually
get<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.290> just<00:02:13.440> by<00:02:13.560> taking<00:02:13.740> out<00:02:13.920> this<00:02:14.070> one<00:02:14.220> I'm

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
get it's just by taking out this one I'm

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.880 
get it's just by taking out this one I'm
putting<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.580> a<00:02:14.640> red<00:02:14.820> block<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:16.260> messed<00:02:16.830> around

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
putting in a red block I messed around

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.110 
putting in a red block I messed around
with<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.190> couple<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.550> styles<00:02:17.820> but<00:02:17.910> it<00:02:17.970> just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
with a couple of styles but it just

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.660 
with a couple of styles but it just
becomes<00:02:18.450> too<00:02:18.810> big<00:02:18.990> and<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:20.220> doesn't<00:02:20.459> look

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
becomes too big and it doesn't look

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.699 
becomes too big and it doesn't look
quite<00:02:20.790> right<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.330> they've<00:02:21.450> got<00:02:21.600> level<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.200> have

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
quite right so they've got level I have

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.500 
quite right so they've got level I have
that<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.070> section<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:23.640> okay<00:02:24.330> and<00:02:24.360> then

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
that kind of section now okay and then

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
that kind of section now okay and then
what<00:02:24.600> you're<00:02:24.690> gonna<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.080> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.290> come<00:02:25.440> to

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
what you're gonna do is if you come to

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.590 
what you're gonna do is if you come to
the<00:02:25.590> front<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.980> come<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:26.220> by<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.580> block<00:02:26.790> here

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
the front just come in by one block here

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.930 
the front just come in by one block here
with<00:02:27.720> your<00:02:27.840> glass<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:29.250> go<00:02:29.370> free<00:02:29.640> across

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
with your glass and just go free across

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.510 
with your glass and just go free across
like<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> when<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:31.950> actually<00:02:32.010> go<00:02:32.220> inside

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
like that so when you actually go inside

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.949 
like that so when you actually go inside
it<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.670> can't<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.270> right<00:02:33.600> into<00:02:33.810> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
it you can't really get right into the

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.220 
it you can't really get right into the
front<00:02:34.140> of<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.440> shave<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.070> one

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
front of it and shave on this one

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.570 
front of it and shave on this one
see<00:02:37.230> what<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> mean<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> do<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.340> kind<00:02:38.520> of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
see what I mean so you do get kind of

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.850 
see what I mean so you do get kind of
stuck<00:02:38.820> here<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.290> still<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.530> little<00:02:40.770> bit

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
stuck here there is still a little bit

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.150 
stuck here there is still a little bit
of<00:02:40.920> room<00:02:41.070> right<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> back<00:02:42.980> because<00:02:43.980> it's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
of room right the back because it's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.410 
of room right the back because it's
quite<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> small<00:02:44.489> helicopter<00:02:45.060> that's<00:02:45.150> kind<00:02:45.390> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
quite a small helicopter that's kind of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.050 
quite a small helicopter that's kind of
why<00:02:45.570> I<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.930> kind<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.430> can't<00:02:47.430> do<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:47.910> then

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
why I have to kind of can't do so then

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.850 
why I have to kind of can't do so then
behind<00:02:48.570> this<00:02:48.660> glass<00:02:48.810> put<00:02:49.170> three<00:02:49.410> blocks<00:02:49.650> like

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
behind this glass put three blocks like

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.190 
behind this glass put three blocks like
this<00:02:50.070> one<00:02:50.760> two<00:02:50.880> three<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.510> wanna<00:02:51.720> keep<00:02:51.900> free

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this one two three and wanna keep free

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.010 
this one two three and wanna keep free
and<00:02:53.130> come<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.610> here<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.030> go<00:02:54.150> six<00:02:54.480> neither<00:02:54.810> one

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
and come in here and go six neither one

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.990 
and come in here and go six neither one
two<00:02:55.440> three<00:02:55.770> four<00:02:56.070> five<00:02:56.340> six

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
two three four five six

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
two three four five six
there's<00:02:57.420> one<00:02:57.660> block<00:02:57.840> on<00:02:57.870> top<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.440> come<00:02:58.830> back

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
there's one block on top and come back

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.120 
there's one block on top and come back
by<00:02:59.190> one<00:02:59.430> so<00:02:59.640> this<00:02:59.700> is<00:02:59.850> greatest<00:03:00.239> tail<00:03:00.450> piece

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
by one so this is greatest tail piece

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
by one so this is greatest tail piece
right<00:03:02.130> here<00:03:02.190> if<00:03:02.430> your<00:03:02.580> fence<00:03:02.880> just<00:03:03.660> on<00:03:03.780> this

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
right here if your fence just on this

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.100 
right here if your fence just on this
end<00:03:04.110> piece<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.709> up<00:03:04.830> by<00:03:04.950> one<00:03:05.510> also<00:03:06.510> add<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.810> spot

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
end piece go up by one also add one spot

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.620 
end piece go up by one also add one spot
and<00:03:08.010> on<00:03:08.280> each<00:03:08.400> side<00:03:08.700> we're<00:03:09.030> going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> do<00:03:09.420> is

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and on each side we're going to do is

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.509 
and on each side we're going to do is
when<00:03:09.840> perhaps<00:03:10.019> density<00:03:10.620> and<00:03:10.950> put<00:03:11.370> these<00:03:11.459> on

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
when perhaps density and put these on

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.370 
when perhaps density and put these on
sites<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.150> this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
sites like this

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.500 
sites like this
right<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.190> this<00:03:15.310> side<00:03:15.550> just<00:03:15.819> put<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.090> button<00:03:16.390> to

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
right on this side just put a button to

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.600 
right on this side just put a button to
finish<00:03:16.750> off<00:03:16.900> that<00:03:17.110> section<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.370> now<00:03:18.459> we're

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
finish off that section and now we're

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.410 
finish off that section and now we're
going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> do<00:03:18.850> is<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.030> just<00:03:19.060> going<00:03:19.270> to<00:03:19.330> finish

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
going to do is it just going to finish

the<00:03:21.310> top<00:03:21.580> and<00:03:21.880> put<00:03:22.390> a<00:03:22.420> lot<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.690> free<00:03:23.680> blocks<00:03:23.890> for

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
the top and put a lot of free blocks for

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.620 
the top and put a lot of free blocks for
the<00:03:24.100> time<00:03:24.310> being<00:03:24.520> take<00:03:24.790> up<00:03:24.910> the<00:03:25.000> first<00:03:25.240> one<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
the time being take up the first one and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.059 
the time being take up the first one and

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
switch that one out for a gray piece of

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.280 
switch that one out for a gray piece of
wool<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.459> put<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.300> trapdoor<00:03:28.540> on<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.870> pundit<00:03:29.170> it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
wool and put a trapdoor on the pundit it

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.979 
wool and put a trapdoor on the pundit it
and<00:03:29.560> then<00:03:30.069> grab<00:03:30.370> your<00:03:30.400> own<00:03:30.940> passes<00:03:31.569> put<00:03:31.810> one

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
and then grab your own passes put one

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.710 
and then grab your own passes put one
right<00:03:32.410> on<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.560> top<00:03:32.739> here<00:03:33.450> with<00:03:34.450> stone<00:03:34.690> slabs

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
right on the top here with stone slabs

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:35.790 
right on the top here with stone slabs
you're<00:03:35.170> just<00:03:35.290> going<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.440> go

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
you're just going to go

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.000 
you're just going to go
one<00:03:36.069> right<00:03:36.370> on<00:03:36.489> the<00:03:36.580> top<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.660> then<00:03:37.930> do<00:03:38.500> it's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
one right on the top and then do it's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.199 
one right on the top and then do it's
got<00:03:39.130> free<00:03:39.340> rotors<00:03:39.730> there's<00:03:39.910> a<00:03:39.940> couple<00:03:40.090> ways

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
got free rotors there's a couple ways

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.760 
got free rotors there's a couple ways
you<00:03:40.300> can<00:03:40.420> do<00:03:40.600> it<00:03:40.690> I<00:03:40.720> find<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.200> this<00:03:41.350> way<00:03:41.530> looks

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
you can do it I find that this way looks

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.830 
you can do it I find that this way looks
the<00:03:41.920> best<00:03:42.100> just<00:03:42.400> on<00:03:42.520> wall<00:03:42.730> cardboard<00:03:43.180> two

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
the best just on wall cardboard two

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.990 
the best just on wall cardboard two
diagonal<00:03:44.470> ones<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.950> sides<00:03:45.160> just

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
diagonal ones going to the sides just

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400 
diagonal ones going to the sides just
add<00:03:46.180> several<00:03:46.450> blocks<00:03:46.720> here<00:03:46.959> so<00:03:46.989> you<00:03:47.170> know<00:03:47.230> one

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
add several blocks here so you know one

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.910 
add several blocks here so you know one
two<00:03:47.650> three<00:03:47.980> four<00:03:48.250> five<00:03:48.550> six<00:03:48.760> seven<00:03:49.620> now<00:03:50.620> come

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
two three four five six seven now come

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.229 
two three four five six seven now come
to<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.100> side<00:03:51.310> what<00:03:51.459> windows<00:03:51.790> just<00:03:52.030> need<00:03:52.150> a

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
to the side what windows just need a

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.300 
to the side what windows just need a
diagonal<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.900> always<00:03:53.230> go<00:03:53.350> one<00:03:53.650> lower<00:03:53.920> than<00:03:54.190> this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
diagonal I always go one lower than this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.540 
diagonal I always go one lower than this
one<00:03:54.519> here<00:03:54.550> can<00:03:55.420> hear<00:03:55.780> on<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:55.930> xbox<00:03:56.260> you<00:03:56.590> might

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
one here can hear on the xbox you might

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.809 
one here can hear on the xbox you might
have<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.880> do<00:03:58.000> it<00:03:58.500> up<00:03:59.500> here<00:03:59.860> which<00:04:00.280> will<00:04:00.550> still

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
have to do it up here which will still

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.440 
have to do it up here which will still
be<00:04:00.940> absolutely<00:04:01.300> fine<00:04:01.510> or<00:04:02.910> yeah<00:04:03.910> if<00:04:04.090> you<00:04:04.209> go<00:04:04.300> on

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
be absolutely fine or yeah if you go on

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.320 
be absolutely fine or yeah if you go on
the<00:04:04.569> expose<00:04:04.810> do<00:04:04.959> it<00:04:05.050> up<00:04:05.110> here<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:06.239> think<00:04:07.239> what

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
the expose do it up here I think what

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.420 
the expose do it up here I think what
you<00:04:07.390> can<00:04:07.630> do<00:04:07.840> as<00:04:07.989> well<00:04:08.200> if<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> need<00:04:08.680> if<00:04:09.220> you

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
you can do as well if you need if you

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.009 
you can do as well if you need if you
want<00:04:09.610> to<00:04:09.760> have<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.000> kind<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.239> the<00:04:10.360> same<00:04:10.540> way<00:04:10.720> is

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
want to have it kind of the same way is

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.630 
want to have it kind of the same way is
you<00:04:11.650> build<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.920> block<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.250> then<00:04:12.340> you<00:04:12.370> actually

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
you build a block and then you actually

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.059 
you build a block and then you actually
place<00:04:12.819> a<00:04:12.850> block<00:04:12.970> there<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:14.680> really<00:04:14.800> up<00:04:14.950> to

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
place a block there it's really up to

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.289 
place a block there it's really up to
you<00:04:15.190> so<00:04:15.370> then<00:04:15.489> we're<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.760> thing<00:04:15.880> a<00:04:15.970> seven

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
you so then we're just thing a seven

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.620 
you so then we're just thing a seven
diagonal<00:04:16.780> so<00:04:16.900> you're<00:04:17.049> one<00:04:17.200> two<00:04:17.709> three<00:04:18.630> four

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
diagonal so you're one two three four

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.270 
diagonal so you're one two three four
five<00:04:20.620> six<00:04:21.340> and<00:04:21.700> seven<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.890> I<00:04:23.890> go<00:04:24.010> to<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.190> other

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
five six and seven and I go to the other

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.860 
five six and seven and I go to the other
side<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.640> this<00:04:24.700> is<00:04:24.790> act<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.060> same<00:04:25.210> one<00:04:25.479> two

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
side and this is act the same one two

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.110 
side and this is act the same one two
three<00:04:26.590> four<00:04:27.450> five<00:04:28.450> six<00:04:29.430> seven<00:04:30.430> like<00:04:30.729> that<00:04:30.940> so

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
three four five six seven like that so

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.400 
three four five six seven like that so
that<00:04:31.270> finishes<00:04:31.660> up<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.870> head<00:04:32.020> you<00:04:32.080> got<00:04:32.200> to<00:04:32.320> is

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
that finishes up the head you got to is

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.469 
that finishes up the head you got to is
a<00:04:32.440> pretty<00:04:32.680> simple<00:04:32.890> one<00:04:33.100> but<00:04:34.060> hopefully<00:04:34.419> you

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
a pretty simple one but hopefully you

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:35.940 
a pretty simple one but hopefully you
