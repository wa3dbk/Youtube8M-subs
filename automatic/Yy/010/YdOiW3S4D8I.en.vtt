00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 today in the channel how is it done we are going to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.559
 preparing a ensaimada let 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.860
 to see the ingredients in the first place 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.960
 to make this recipe here I have 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.930
 angel hair that we have done this 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.820
 a few days ago and I'll leave you a link 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.860
 for those who want to learn to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.840
 to do so we will also use flour 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.500
 cold water force I have put some 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.200
 cubes to keep sugar cold 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.930
 normal icing sugar that also exposes a 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.630
 link for those who want to learn to 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.620
 make the sugar glas lard 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.850
 salt two eggs and fresh yeast 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.420
 then we will proceed to create the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:49.430
 recipe in our mixer we dump in 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.430
 First place the flour the cold water 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.040
 the eggs 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.739
 the sugar and the salt and we proceed to beat 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.290
 as you have realized the yeast 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.600
 we have not gotten it right now we're going 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.630
 to knead a few minutes and when we see 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 that the mass is already 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.540
 as tense as bright then in 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.450
 this moment we are going to add the yeast 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.010
 we can add it directly as in 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.620
 my case because I put a couple of 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.420
 water droplets very little water or 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:25.090
 I would even tell you not to put it on 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.800
 you have directly with your hand the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.140
 tincture is a little bit and the add 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.960
 when a few minutes have passed we can 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.050
 to have the dough again smooth and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.000
 bright at this time we add in the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.610
 table where we will work a little bit 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.130
 of oil and we breathe it well on the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.990
 surface and dump the dough 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.750
 let's make a few clicks to the center 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.289
 to give it some tension and we're going to 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.590
 make a ball for it because we go back 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.590
 mass 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.140
 and we work a little bit and then the 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.159
 we cover with a film paper and the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.159
 we will leave at rest 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.620
 we'll let rest about 20 minutes 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.150
 at 20 minutes we will have seen that he has 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.629
 fermented a little 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.269
 and we will continue with the work in this 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.000
 case what we are going to do is make 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:26.310
 divide it and make balls of about 250 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 grams approximately 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.500
 we will get about 3 or 4 pieces 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.520
 in this case, we will also go to 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.470
 flip the ball we give a few turns 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.520
 boleando until we see that the mass is 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.520
 we also remain smooth 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:50.599
 and this we would put in a bowl 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.930
 we cover it and leave it later in the 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:52.930
 fridge 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.000
 30 minutes in the refrigerator and this 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:02.860
 we will have done with all the pieces 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.890
 once we have taken it out of the fridge 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 we put back a drop of oil is 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:11.770
 very little we breathe it on the table and 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:14.170
 let's make a kind of rectangle 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.230
 well with your hands 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.680
 then move on to stretch it as much as possible 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.680
 possible 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.640
 we are going to use a larger clock already 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.640
 I see that it is too small 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.830
 once we have it a little extended 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.230
 at this moment is when really 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.780
 we had to put lard 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.330
 when we have it a little extended 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.090
 I did it at the end but I 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.930
 I advise that at this time when the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.780
 we have a little extended 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.930
 here is the time to add butter 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.930
 of pork 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.159
 and then we stretch with our hands 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.159
 because we have to have one left 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.319
 dough as thin as possible for this with 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:06.590
 a little bit of care trying not to 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.230
 we break the mass then we go 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.390
 stretching 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.000
 but it is easy for us to be broken by some 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.000
 site because it is a very very thin mass 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.840
 and I'm going to add the lard 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.400
 As you can see I am moving but you 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.220
 I advise that before stretching it with the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.300
 hands that you add the lard 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.689
 so we extend it on 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.089
 about our mass 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:36.279
 it would also be important that we do it 

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:37.959
 with the hand then now with 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.849
 soft movements we extend it by 

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:42.550
 all 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.500
 to distribute it well and in that moment 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.960
 let's add angel hair 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.910
 this goes according to the amount that 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.230
 we want but if we are 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.810
 generous we will get a rich and a 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.850
 Ensaimada rich angel hair 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.340
 so now we fold where we have 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:04.670
 put the angel hair we make a 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.550
 fold and little by little we go rolling 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:11.180
 when we roll more prettier we're going 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.340
 to be after the extreme and richer 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.580
 since we are talking about a mass 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.580
 puff 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.370
 then little by little we're going 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.370
 rolling 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:32.930
 and here we have the roll we can 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.780
 Stretch a little 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:40.780
 with your hands or just leave it 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:40.780
 rest about 20 or 30 minutes 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:47.360
 at the end of that month of rest, yes 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.710
 that we are going to try to stretch to the maximum 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.630
 the ensaimada 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.340
 trying not to break us but yes 

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:55.890
 that we will stretch everything we can 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.990
 when more finite and elastic we are left 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:06:00.140
 Well, better because then we're going to do 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.970
 a spiral and then when more 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.180
 extended we have it then longer goes 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.180
 To be 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:10.830
 since we have it stretched to the maximum in 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.740
 a baking tray and a paper of 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.740
 baking because we will make a spiral 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.470
 and we would have to stay more or less 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.470
 this form 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.550
 let's let it rest in one place 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:32.720
 quiet about 12 hours 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.720
 I'm going to use the oven 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.280
 After 12 hours to see that the 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.970
 ensaimada has doubled its size has 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.670
 fermented well and we light the oven to 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:49.890
 200 degrees Celsius once what 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:52.170
 we have at that temperature that he already 

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.990
 Chivatito tells us that we have reached 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.810
 200 degrees centigrade we put the 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.050
 oven tray and we will have it 17 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.810
 minutes approximately the last step 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.150
 I would add icing sugar 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:08.250
 then we can is to go back up 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.950
 of icing sugar for a touch 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.100
 nicer and here we have the result 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:16.200
 final and the ingredients below 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:19.400
 then see you soon in new 

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.400
 tutorials see you soon
