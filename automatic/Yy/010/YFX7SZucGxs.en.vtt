00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 good afternoon my dear I cook today 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.549
 Cottage cheese casserole with pasta I 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.859
 rather large macaroni 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.099
 so the casserole turned out like this 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.010
 here 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.960
 lacy lace roll like that 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.969
 can be baked with other pasta 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.980
 you can cook it not only sweet 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.529
 but in salt form so let's start for 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.740
 the recipe we need flour kind of me 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.320
 pasta here is such a pretty big one 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.000
 diameter it create the whole process 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 post creation will leave behind the scenes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.500
 because but here everything is clear when 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.960
 curd mass we need two 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.350
 packs of cottage cheese I have such a cottage cheese 9 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 the percentage weight of each pack is 200 grams 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.860
 trademark does not advertise 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.140
 because every time I buy different 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 unity when choosing cottage cheese I will press on 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.539
 a pack and looked so that the curd was not 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.640
 very liquid cottage cheese knead mask 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.129
 the decoction is sold fairly homogeneous it 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 no need to scroll through the meat grinder and you don't 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.199
 need to wipe through a sieve 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:03.960
 it's enough just to knead 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.489
 the yard beat up a couple of eggs kneading if 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 will cook a sweet casserole 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 option add sugar to taste 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.020
 I added 4 tablespoons bag 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 vanilla sugar for ears like this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.380
 the casserole can be cooked not only 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.420
 after all, you can cook sweet it in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
 salty so instead of sugar you can 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 put a little salt also casserole 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.939
 you can add a little melted 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.549
 butter 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.820
 I added about a third of tea 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.100
 spoons of not extinguished soda and a tablespoon with 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.030
 very, very good gourd sour cream 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.710
 That turned out to be a liquid mass 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 light 20 percent but you can take 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.140
 sour cream of any fat content and further we need 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.320
 I want to thicken the curd mass 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.479
 it took me 3 tablespoons 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.070
 with a hill of dry semolina 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.220
 you may need plus or minus 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.360
 since different consistencies from the enemy 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.310
 steam can be liquid fields in mini liquid 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.140
 we need curd mass thickened but in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 same time a lot of monkey add not 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.119
 worth as casserole get 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.789
 dense instead of mark you can of course take 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.000
 flour but with flour casserole like 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.050
 look less as a result of not 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.960
 it turned out curd 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.360
 with it is not thick but at the same time and not 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.730
 liquid must give curd mass 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
 stand for 20 minutes to mark 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 I managed to swell and did not feel ready 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.000
 casserole meanwhile pasta me 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 opened hot pasta add 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.700
 a little butter stir and 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.740
 until we leave a long time to cool 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.390
 prepare the form this time casserole 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.140
 I will prepare a split mold for 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.420
 cakes diameter 24 centimeters bead shape 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.840
 I'll grease with butter then spilled 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.330
 flour or rusks to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.480
 no casserole grabbed and whistled 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.410
 baking paper is superfluous and 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.610
 shake off and our form is prepared 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.260
 pasta, meanwhile, had time to cool down 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.670
 pasta for a bundle i'm driving a raw egg 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.680
 you know in my case it is not very 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.600
 Actually I would help it and not do 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.320
 because I have a large diameter pasta 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.480
 long 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 but if you will be cooking the casserole 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.620
 let's say with horns or with others 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.990
 pasta that you will spread 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.270
 layer it is imperative to do it 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.550
 binds the pasta between themselves and casserole 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.880
 will not fall apart when cutting 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.670
 and then curd casserole need 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.459
 collect do differently usually her 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.310
 collected in layers alternating the curd layer and 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.920
 a layer of pasta taken to the first and 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.700
 the last layer was pasta and more 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.310
 take turns 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.590
 as a line option you can pasta just 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.720
 mix with curd mass and bake 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.920
 single layer in this case of course 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.660
 no need to whip eggs in garon 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.640
 By the way for this casserole can 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.370
 use absolutely any can be taken 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.010
 And you can take different types of pasta 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.600
 diameter you can even take vermicelli 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.090
 this vermicelli casserole is even 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.160
 Homemade faithful Shiva can for example 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.590
 take colored pasta now sold 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.989
 green and red pasta 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.260
 Here is such a casserole very nice 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.260
 looks in the section like children 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.519
 they are happy children 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.980
 of pockets could also be 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.680
 different, I took 200 grams of dry posts then 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.900
 I have 400 grams of cottage cheese and 200 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.060
 gram posts but you can use equal 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.169
 quantities that is, take 400 grams 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.550
 cottage cheese and pasta 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.879
 everything is here too 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.830
 solely at your request , I personally 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:33.720
 when I cook such a casserole weaved 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.060
 see it take a little pasta 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.150
 smaller and when I cook in salty 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:43.319
 I take the form of approximately equal quantities 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.620
 cottage cheese and pasta collected casseroles 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.180
 top lubricate sour cream need 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.949
 one or two tablespoons 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.560
 this is necessary in order for pasta to 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:55.349
 the process of baking but dried up with it and not 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:59.789
 became so brittle tough and were 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:03.440
 soft top you can still casserole 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.440
 sprinkle with melted butter 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.729
 if you want you can not do this much 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.960
 oil is not necessary around the table somewhere 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:15.539
 spoon and then casserole set warmed 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.139
 up to 180 degrees Celsius oven about 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.069
 somewhere for 30-40 minutes to easy 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:23.400
 reddening 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:25.889
 and setting the curd mass to wait 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.319
 bright blush is not worth otherwise casserole 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.259
 just dry out enough so she 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:33.840
 slightly blushed after baking 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:38.130
 casseroles let stand 10 10 minutes 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.639
 right in the form I take off the form and you can 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580
 to file 

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:44.279
 casserole with sour cream and jam fall 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.880
 with honey and condensed milk, you can just 

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:50.219
 I would also like to show you well 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.690

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:57.120
 air and macaroni perfectly kept 

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.159
 and inside the casserole and on top they don't 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.400
 fall apart not fall out 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:05.180
 and quite easily cut casserole not 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.409
