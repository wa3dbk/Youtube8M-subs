00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:09.580
 It is season to plant 4 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:12.940
 If you go to the stores, you will find various types of vegetables sold 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 There is one thing that bothers me 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:22.920
 Do you not wonder why there is a difference in price though it is the same vegetable 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.970
 2 Tsua' Zheng on the type of head vegetables 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:30.630
 There is a costume and without following no Izu 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:38.309
 I feel it is the same, but no costumes glance 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:46.960
 It is actually here if you look closely if you look closely after growing up from seed and not growing up 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:55.780
 I'm going to the lower part, but I use a cocoon to grow toughly on this tomato on this tomato 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:58.510
 I'm saying that I don't know what to say next time, but I'm saying this kind of seedling and two things don't come next 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:05.590
 There are seedlings of vegetables 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:09.220
 If you want to grow with a planter for the first time, you don't have to go to chapter 3 but you also made vegetables last year 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:15.480
 If you say that you made tomato 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.400
 If possible, it is better to grow using grafted seedlings instead of in 3 provinces 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:21.700
 How is that? 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.000
 It is easier to grow stronger in the region 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:32.800
 And saying that the seedling is coercion 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 It is said sideways with traditional farming disorder that disease becomes easy to come out and yield decreases 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:41.440
 If you make 2 times 3 times in the same place because there is 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.540
 It is safer to use live seedlings 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:48.290
 By all means everyone using the next equipment 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:53.360
 Let's grow vegetables but 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:58.880
 If you can make a tomato last year, the tomato is not over 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:04.530
 I must not be relieved, because tomatoes are solanaceous 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:09.030
 You may think of a flower this year, but it is actually summer 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.660
 The target plant Aichinia is the same as a tomato 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.890
 I 'm Nazca, so after the tomato 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:23.760
 Pechinia is I'm not discouraged really 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.590
 There may be a flower instead of a side or a side, but the same thing can be made 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.099
 By 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:33.849
 I think it is better not to receive and grow 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.849
 Let's also check the area and choose vegetables
