00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.680 
that what we as drivers actually see is
the<00:02:25.390> most<00:02:25.600> amazing<00:02:25.870> thing

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.180 

driving<00:02:29.440> at<00:02:29.500> night<00:02:29.650> just<00:02:29.680> like<00:02:29.920> you're<00:02:30.070> going

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
driving at night just like you're going

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.970 
driving at night just like you're going
twice<00:02:30.400> as<00:02:30.580> fast<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:31.930> lose<00:02:32.140> almost<00:02:32.740> all<00:02:32.860> your

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
twice as fast you lose almost all your

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.650 
twice as fast you lose almost all your
references<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:34.000> just<00:02:34.180> sort<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.420> drive

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
references and you just sort of drive

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.030 
references and you just sort of drive
blind<00:02:34.990> at<00:02:35.110> that<00:02:35.230> point

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.429 

shift<00:02:40.700> 2<00:02:40.879> unleashed<00:02:40.909> as<00:02:41.540> an<00:02:41.750> incredible<00:02:42.290> new

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
shift 2 unleashed as an incredible new

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.059 
shift 2 unleashed as an incredible new
view<00:02:42.709> it's<00:02:42.920> called<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.250> helmet<00:02:43.549> cam

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
view it's called the helmet cam

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.170 
view it's called the helmet cam
definitely<00:02:46.069> realistic<00:02:46.549> feature<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:46.969> the<00:02:47.030> game

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
definitely realistic feature of the game

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.390 
definitely realistic feature of the game
and<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.379> biggest<00:02:48.560> part<00:02:48.829> of<00:02:48.859> that<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:49.010> think<00:02:49.280> is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
and the biggest part of that I think is

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.520 
and the biggest part of that I think is
the<00:02:49.760> head<00:02:49.909> movement<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:50.480> a<00:02:50.870> look<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.230> apex

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
the head movement and a look to the apex

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.589 
the head movement and a look to the apex
which<00:02:51.829> if<00:02:52.159> you<00:02:52.280> look<00:02:52.549> at<00:02:52.790> helmet<00:02:53.209> cam<00:02:53.329> video

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
which if you look at helmet cam video

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:03.430 
which if you look at helmet cam video
we'll<00:02:54.260> see<00:02:54.409> that's<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.739> same<00:02:54.980> motions

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.800 

and<00:03:04.130> drifting<00:03:04.550> we're<00:03:04.970> actually<00:03:05.060> looking<00:03:05.420> out

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
and drifting we're actually looking out

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.380 
and drifting we're actually looking out
the<00:03:06.290> side<00:03:06.320> windows<00:03:06.980> so<00:03:07.490> once<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:07.940> car<00:03:08.150> gets

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
the side windows so once the car gets

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.000 
the side windows so once the car gets
sideways<00:03:08.630> and<00:03:09.050> you're<00:03:09.170> turning<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.770> move
