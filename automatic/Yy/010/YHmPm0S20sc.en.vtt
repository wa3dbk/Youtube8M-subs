XO<00:02:06.329> zombie<00:02:06.780> I'm<00:02:06.930> trying<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.200> focus<00:02:07.290> at<00:02:07.649> first

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
XO zombie I'm trying to focus at first

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.100 
XO zombie I'm trying to focus at first
and<00:02:08.160> sometimes<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.879> XO<00:02:09.209> zombie<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.840> doesn't

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and sometimes the XO zombie it doesn't

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.809 
and sometimes the XO zombie it doesn't
even<00:02:10.200> hit<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.890> sometimes<00:02:11.459> it's<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
even hit you sometimes it's just the

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.910 
even hit you sometimes it's just the
area<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.450> effect<00:02:12.599> you<00:02:12.989> like<00:02:13.110> an<00:02:13.230> EMP<00:02:13.590> grenade

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
area of effect you like an EMP grenade

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.130 
area of effect you like an EMP grenade
going<00:02:14.190> off<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.610> basically<00:02:14.790> takes<00:02:15.360> out<00:02:15.630> your<00:02:15.810> XO

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
going off it basically takes out your XO

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.750 
going off it basically takes out your XO
for<00:02:16.380> a<00:02:16.410> temporary<00:02:16.740> amount<00:02:17.310> of<00:02:17.370> time<00:02:17.550> and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
for a temporary amount of time and

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.650 
for a temporary amount of time and
you're<00:02:17.790> probably<00:02:18.000> thinking<00:02:18.239> all<00:02:18.480> it's<00:02:18.569> going

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
you're probably thinking all it's going

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.089 
you're probably thinking all it's going
to<00:02:18.720> come<00:02:18.840> back<00:02:19.050> but<00:02:19.319> once<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.770> later

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
to come back but once you get to later

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.979 
to come back but once you get to later
round<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.580> starts<00:02:20.819> affecting<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.510> movement

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
round it starts affecting the movement

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.690 
round it starts affecting the movement
and<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.440> it's<00:02:22.590> affecting<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.069> like<00:02:23.250> this<00:02:23.430> once

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
and so it's affecting you like this once

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.770 
and so it's affecting you like this once
I<00:02:23.760> start<00:02:23.970> getting<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.270> later<00:02:24.390> rounds<00:02:24.569> it

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
I start getting to the later rounds it

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.240 
I start getting to the later rounds it
made<00:02:24.900> me<00:02:24.989> jump<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.560> made<00:02:25.680> me<00:02:25.709> fall<00:02:26.010> down
