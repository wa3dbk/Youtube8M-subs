okay<00:00:00.570> welcome<00:00:00.810> to<00:00:00.960> unit<00:00:01.319> five<00:00:01.650> before<00:00:02.610> I<00:00:02.929> go

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay welcome to unit five before I go

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.590 
okay welcome to unit five before I go
into<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.319> rhythm<00:00:05.009> section<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:06.120> want<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.390> talk<00:00:06.569> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
into the rhythm section I want to talk a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.140 
into the rhythm section I want to talk a
little<00:00:06.810> bit<00:00:07.049> about<00:00:07.290> some<00:00:07.740> some<00:00:08.460> theory<00:00:08.849> stuff

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
little bit about some some theory stuff

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.910 
little bit about some some theory stuff
and<00:00:09.990> the<00:00:10.080> first<00:00:10.290> thing<00:00:10.410> I<00:00:10.500> want<00:00:10.620> to<00:00:10.710> talk<00:00:10.860> about

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
and the first thing I want to talk about

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.539 
and the first thing I want to talk about
is<00:00:11.340> how<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:11.969> form<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.780> triad<00:00:13.440> now<00:00:13.740> I'm<00:00:14.370> going<00:00:14.490> to

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is how to form a triad now I'm going to

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.029 
is how to form a triad now I'm going to
teach<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> separate<00:00:15.719> ways<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.379> forming<00:00:16.949> a

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
teach you to separate ways of forming a

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.519 
teach you to separate ways of forming a
triad<00:00:17.520> okay<00:00:18.060> so<00:00:18.480> let's<00:00:18.630> start<00:00:18.869> with<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.500> first

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
triad okay so let's start with the first

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.370 
triad okay so let's start with the first
way<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.730> first<00:00:20.970> way<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.210> form<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.570> triad<00:00:21.840> is<00:00:22.080> if

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
way the first way to form a triad is if

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.609 
way the first way to form a triad is if
we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> C<00:00:23.570> major<00:00:24.570> triad<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we're going to do a C major triad is to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.550 
we're going to do a C major triad is to
just<00:00:26.010> start<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.789> c<00:00:27.119> major<00:00:27.630> five<00:00:28.170> finger

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
just start with the c major five finger

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.279 
just start with the c major five finger
scale<00:00:28.880> remember<00:00:29.880> starting<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.510> note<00:00:30.720> go<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.199> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
scale remember starting a note go up a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.979 
scale remember starting a note go up a
whole<00:00:31.470> step<00:00:31.500> up<00:00:32.430> another<00:00:32.700> whole<00:00:32.940> step<00:00:32.969> go<00:00:33.750> up<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
whole step up another whole step go up a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.840 
whole step up another whole step go up a
half<00:00:34.140> step<00:00:34.200> right<00:00:34.860> that's<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.219> half<00:00:35.399> step<00:00:35.670> and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
half step right that's a half step and

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.830 
half step right that's a half step and
one<00:00:36.570> more<00:00:36.780> whole<00:00:37.020> step

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.380 

that<00:00:40.380> is<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.680> C<00:00:40.920> major<00:00:41.190> five<00:00:41.610> finger<00:00:42.060> try<00:00:42.330> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that is your C major five finger try it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
that is your C major five finger try it
all<00:00:43.170> right<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.410> think<00:00:43.620> about<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.250> it<00:00:44.400> try

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
all right now think about what is it try

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.010 
all right now think about what is it try
it<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.000> triad<00:00:45.630> try<00:00:46.440> t<00:00:46.890> RI<00:00:47.070> means<00:00:47.520> three<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.390> triad

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
it a triad try t RI means three a triad

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.160 
it a triad try t RI means three a triad
is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.380> three<00:00:49.830> note<00:00:50.100> chord<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.730> seventh<00:00:51.600> chord<00:00:51.660> or

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
is a three note chord a seventh chord or

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.040 
is a three note chord a seventh chord or
block<00:00:52.500> chord<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.070> four<00:00:53.880> note<00:00:54.090> chord<00:00:54.390> we're

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
block chord is a four note chord we're

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.650 
block chord is a four note chord we're
going<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> deal<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.590> triads<00:00:56.010> for<00:00:56.250> right<00:00:56.400> now

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
going to deal with triads for right now

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.150 
going to deal with triads for right now
so<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.840> we<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.170> C<00:00:58.530> major<00:00:58.770> five

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
so now if we take that C major five

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.280 
so now if we take that C major five
finger<00:00:59.520> pattern<00:00:59.970> and<00:01:00.510> we<00:01:00.629> number<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> notes

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
finger pattern and we number the notes

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
finger pattern and we number the notes
one<00:01:01.830> two<00:01:02.280> three<00:01:02.550> four<00:01:03.239> five<00:01:03.920> if<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.040> play<00:01:05.270> 13

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
one two three four five if we play 13

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.350 
one two three four five if we play 13
and<00:01:06.630> five<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> same<00:01:07.800> time<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.970> gives<00:01:09.210> us

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and five at the same time that gives us

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.910 
and five at the same time that gives us
our<00:01:09.600> C<00:01:10.020> major<00:01:10.610> triad<00:01:11.630> now<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.320> make<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.619> minor

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
our C major triad now to make it minor

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.270 
our C major triad now to make it minor
all<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.550> to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:14.940> take<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.570> third<00:01:15.869> and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
all we got to do is take the third and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.990 
all we got to do is take the third and
flat<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.490> third<00:01:18.619> okay<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> see

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
flat the third okay and you can see

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.139 
flat the third okay and you can see
that's<00:01:21.180> also<00:01:21.509> one<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.140> five<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.860> our

00:01:23.139 --> 00:01:23.149 
that's also one three and five from our

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.710 
that's also one three and five from our
C<00:01:24.149> minor<00:01:24.479> five<00:01:25.110> finger<00:01:25.350> pattern<00:01:26.310> okay<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
C minor five finger pattern okay so the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.389 
C minor five finger pattern okay so the
only<00:01:27.869> difference<00:01:27.960> between<00:01:28.380> major<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.130> minor

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
only difference between major and minor

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.960 
only difference between major and minor
in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.390> five<00:01:30.720> finger<00:01:31.140> pattern<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.970> flattening

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
in the five finger pattern is flattening

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
in the five finger pattern is flattening
the<00:01:33.119> third<00:01:33.390> okay<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.470> third<00:01:34.680> now

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the third okay it's just the third now

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.770 
the third okay it's just the third now
when<00:01:35.399> we<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> whole<00:01:35.910> scale<00:01:36.270> there<00:01:36.630> are

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
when we do the whole scale there are

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.420 
when we do the whole scale there are
some<00:01:37.020> differences<00:01:37.200> between<00:01:37.619> major<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> minor

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
some differences between major and minor

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.670 
some differences between major and minor
besides<00:01:38.910> the<00:01:39.149> third<00:01:39.390> but<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.080> first<00:01:40.440> five

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
besides the third but on first five

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.230 
besides the third but on first five
notes<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.190> only<00:01:41.369> difference<00:01:41.700> between<00:01:41.820> major

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
notes the only difference between major

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.169 
notes the only difference between major
and<00:01:42.479> minor<00:01:42.690> is<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.350> third<00:01:43.800> third<00:01:44.729> becomes

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
and minor is that third third becomes

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.410 
and minor is that third third becomes
flatted<00:01:45.920> okay<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.340> let's<00:01:47.520> try<00:01:47.729> let's<00:01:48.209> try

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
flatted okay so let's try let's try

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.350 
flatted okay so let's try let's try
doing<00:01:48.750> some<00:01:49.050> more<00:01:49.229> triads<00:01:49.970> well<00:01:50.970> let's<00:01:51.209> try

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
doing some more triads well let's try

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.520 
doing some more triads well let's try
doing<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.840> okay<00:01:53.000> start<00:01:54.000> by<00:01:54.390> figuring<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> a

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
doing a okay start by figuring out the a

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.710 
doing a okay start by figuring out the a
major<00:01:56.340> five<00:01:56.700> finger<00:01:57.030> scale<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.479> there's<00:01:57.660> a

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
major five finger scale so there's a

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.240 
major five finger scale so there's a
whole<00:01:57.899> step<00:01:58.229> we<00:01:58.440> need<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.649> go<00:01:58.770> another<00:01:58.950> whole

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
whole step we need to go another whole

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
whole step we need to go another whole
step<00:01:59.280> then<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.179> could<00:02:00.300> go<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> half<00:02:00.690> step<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
step then we could go a half step and

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.090 
step then we could go a half step and
then<00:02:01.800> one<00:02:02.039> more<00:02:02.220> whole<00:02:02.459> step<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.509> there's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
then one more whole step so there's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.940 
then one more whole step so there's
a<00:02:05.159> major<00:02:05.970> five<00:02:06.750> finger<00:02:06.960> scale<00:02:07.350> number<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
a major five finger scale number the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.690 
a major five finger scale number the
notes<00:02:08.810> 135<00:02:09.810> play<00:02:10.289> them<00:02:10.440> together<00:02:10.800> there<00:02:11.459> we<00:02:11.550> go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
notes 135 play them together there we go

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180 
notes 135 play them together there we go
to<00:02:12.180> do<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.420> in<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.660> left<00:02:12.900> hand<00:02:13.170> it's<00:02:13.500> five

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
to do it in the left hand it's five

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.340 
to do it in the left hand it's five
three<00:02:14.819> and<00:02:15.000> one<00:02:15.420> okay<00:02:17.720> there's<00:02:18.720> your<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:19.020> major

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
three and one okay there's your a major

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.190 
three and one okay there's your a major
triad<00:02:19.770> let's<00:02:20.670> try<00:02:20.850> doing<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.330> more<00:02:21.959> difficult

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
triad let's try doing a more difficult

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
triad let's try doing a more difficult
one<00:02:22.680> likes<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:23.100> b-flat<00:02:24.890> put<00:02:25.890> your<00:02:26.010> thumb<00:02:26.190> on

one likes a b-flat put your thumb on

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.800 
one likes a b-flat put your thumb on
e-flat<00:02:26.670> now<00:02:27.180> if<00:02:27.300> you're<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.569> do<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
e-flat now if you're going to do the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.110 
e-flat now if you're going to do the
scale<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.830> Fivefinger<00:02:29.280> scale<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:29.850> okay<00:02:30.060> to

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
scale the Fivefinger scale it's okay to

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.970 
scale the Fivefinger scale it's okay to
just<00:02:30.390> use<00:02:30.630> all<00:02:30.900> five<00:02:31.230> fingers<00:02:31.470> like<00:02:31.800> we've

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
just use all five fingers like we've

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.340 
just use all five fingers like we've
been<00:02:32.160> doing<00:02:32.520> but<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.060> you're<00:02:33.209> going<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.480> do<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
been doing but if you're going to do the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.770 
been doing but if you're going to do the
whole<00:02:34.560> scale<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.489> wouldn't<00:02:35.819> put<00:02:36.060> your<00:02:36.120> thumb

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
whole scale you wouldn't put your thumb

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.630 
whole scale you wouldn't put your thumb
on<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.080> black<00:02:37.410> note<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.800> that<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.310> since

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
on a black note like that but since

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.890 
on a black note like that but since
we're<00:02:38.760> just<00:02:38.940> doing<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.209> Fivefinger<00:02:39.569> scale

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
we're just doing the Fivefinger scale

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.840 
we're just doing the Fivefinger scale
it's<00:02:40.110> okay<00:02:40.350> for<00:02:40.410> right<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.739> so<00:02:41.519> start<00:02:41.790> an

flat G and B flat and we do that all

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.100 
flat G and B flat and we do that all
with<00:03:04.410> one<00:03:04.620> hand<00:03:04.920> ok<00:03:05.640> B<00:03:06.090> flat<00:03:06.330> G<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.780> B<00:03:06.810> flat

with one hand ok B flat G and B flat
that's<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.590> flat<00:03:07.830> major<00:03:08.069> triad<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:09.269> left<00:03:09.480> hand

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's a flat major triad the left hand

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.619 
that's a flat major triad the left hand
maybe<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.250> got<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.459> kind<00:03:12.819> of<00:03:12.940> get<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.330> finger

together as well you know go through all
the<00:03:46.230> different<00:03:46.349> triads<00:03:47.010> okay<00:03:49.430> all<00:03:50.430> right<00:03:50.690> you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the different triads okay all right you

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.990 
the different triads okay all right you
can<00:03:51.720> arpeggiate<00:03:52.709> them

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.270 

right<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.870> all<00:03:56.020> our<00:03:56.230> peji<00:03:56.470> eight<00:03:56.710> means<00:03:56.920> is<00:03:57.160> to

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
right and all our peji eight means is to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.840 
right and all our peji eight means is to
break<00:03:57.520> them<00:03:57.580> up

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
break them up

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:08.040 
break them up
you<00:03:59.420> can<00:03:59.570> operate<00:03:59.900> one<00:04:00.410> into<00:04:00.980> the<00:04:01.100> other

pedal down there right the sustain pedal

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.710 
pedal down there right the sustain pedal
I'll<00:04:27.580> hold<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.970> pedal<00:04:28.210> down<00:04:28.300> for<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.570> whole

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
I'll hold the pedal down for the whole

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.310 
I'll hold the pedal down for the whole
thing

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320

flub up there at the top so nice sound

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.920 
flub up there at the top so nice sound
if<00:04:40.879> I<00:04:40.999> do<00:04:41.059> it<00:04:41.239> on<00:04:41.330> d

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
right and then you know you can use that

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.070 
right and then you know you can use that
within<00:04:55.460> your<00:04:55.580> pieces<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.389> music<00:04:56.509> you<00:04:56.840> can<00:04:56.960> use

within your pieces of music you can use

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.749 
within your pieces of music you can use
that<00:04:57.229> as<00:04:57.350> an<00:04:57.470> ending<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.860> a<00:04:57.919> song<00:04:58.130> okay<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.610> it's

00:04:58.749 --> 00:04:58.759 
that as an ending of a song okay if it's

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:03.159 
that as an ending of a song okay if it's
in<00:04:58.880> major<00:04:59.120> just<00:05:01.449> you<00:05:02.449> know<00:05:02.570> and<00:05:02.780> your<00:05:02.990> song

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
in major just you know and your song

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.090 
in major just you know and your song
like<00:05:03.380> that<00:05:03.910> alright<00:05:04.910> so<00:05:05.389> that's<00:05:05.870> major<00:05:06.500> triads

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
like that alright so that's major triads

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.840 
like that alright so that's major triads
and<00:05:07.340> minor<00:05:08.030> triads<00:05:08.479> let's<00:05:08.870> do<00:05:09.020> one<00:05:09.259> more<00:05:09.400> b<00:05:10.400> b

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
and minor triads let's do one more b b

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.159 
and minor triads let's do one more b b
is<00:05:11.030> kind<00:05:11.360> of<00:05:11.449> sometimes<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.870> little<00:05:11.990> bit

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
is kind of sometimes a little bit

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.439 
is kind of sometimes a little bit
difficult<00:05:12.470> so<00:05:13.100> let's<00:05:13.910> start<00:05:14.060> with<00:05:14.150> the<00:05:14.270> thumb

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:14.449 
difficult so let's start with the thumb

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.320 
difficult so let's start with the thumb
on<00:05:14.660> be<00:05:14.870> let's<00:05:15.410> go<00:05:15.560> up<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.830> whole<00:05:15.979> step<00:05:16.150> let's<00:05:17.150> go

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
on be let's go up a whole step let's go

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.050 
on be let's go up a whole step let's go
up<00:05:17.449> another<00:05:17.690> whole<00:05:17.990> step<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.490> half<00:05:19.759> step

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
up another whole step to a half step

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.230 
up another whole step to a half step
right<00:05:20.360> at<00:05:20.599> e<00:05:20.840> and<00:05:21.080> then<00:05:21.349> one<00:05:21.560> more<00:05:21.770> whole<00:05:21.979> step

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:33.159 

and<00:05:27.449> then<00:05:28.050> play<00:05:28.289> 1<00:05:28.650> 2<00:05:28.949> 3<00:05:29.430> 4<00:05:29.910> 5<00:05:30.449> &amp;<00:05:30.900> 3<00:05:30.930> &amp;<00:05:31.229> 5<00:05:31.819> dobby

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
and then play 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 dobby

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.689 
and then play 1 2 3 4 5 &amp; 3 &amp; 5 dobby
solido<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.919> other<00:05:35.069> thing<00:05:35.220> you<00:05:35.250> can<00:05:35.400> do<00:05:35.520> is<00:05:35.610> you

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
solido the other thing you can do is you

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.210 
solido the other thing you can do is you
can<00:05:35.729> also<00:05:35.940> solfege<00:05:36.630> you're<00:05:36.870> trying<00:05:37.199> heads<00:05:37.440> and

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
can also solfege you're trying heads and

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.850 
can also solfege you're trying heads and
then<00:05:38.669> we<00:05:38.759> make<00:05:38.880> it<00:05:39.030> minor<00:05:39.270> dome<00:05:40.050> ace<00:05:40.789> olmedo

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
then we make it minor dome ace olmedo

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.430 
then we make it minor dome ace olmedo
right<00:05:44.000> that's<00:05:45.000> may<00:05:45.330> all<00:05:45.780> right<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.110> flatted

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
right that's may all right the flatted

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.809 
right that's may all right the flatted
third<00:05:47.270> now<00:05:48.500> let<00:05:49.500> me<00:05:49.530> briefly<00:05:50.099> give<00:05:50.430> you<00:05:50.669> an

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
third now let me briefly give you an

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.420 
third now let me briefly give you an
introduction<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.740> inversions<00:05:52.740> I'm<00:05:53.099> not

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
introduction to inversions I'm not

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.580 
introduction to inversions I'm not
talking<00:05:53.639> about<00:05:53.940> this<00:05:54.210> more<00:05:54.569> in<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.380> book<00:05:55.560> to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
talking about this more in the book to

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.960 
talking about this more in the book to
DVD<00:05:56.490> but<00:05:57.380> here's<00:05:58.380> our<00:05:58.560> root<00:05:58.770> position<00:05:58.979> okay<00:05:59.789> if

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
DVD but here's our root position okay if

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.059 
DVD but here's our root position okay if
we<00:06:00.090> take<00:06:00.270> this<00:06:00.449> bottom<00:06:00.840> note<00:06:01.020> C<00:06:01.409> and<00:06:01.710> we<00:06:01.860> bring

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:02.069 
we take this bottom note C and we bring

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.550 
we take this bottom note C and we bring
it<00:06:02.190> up<00:06:02.280> to<00:06:02.400> the<00:06:02.520> top<00:06:02.729> we<00:06:03.720> get<00:06:03.870> that<00:06:04.110> I'm<00:06:04.380> going

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
it up to the top we get that I'm going

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.249 
it up to the top we get that I'm going
to<00:06:04.620> play<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:04.979> all<00:06:05.220> with<00:06:05.520> one<00:06:05.699> hand<00:06:06.030> okay<00:06:06.840> this

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 
to play that all with one hand okay this

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:09.439 
to play that all with one hand okay this
is<00:06:07.409> what<00:06:07.530> we<00:06:07.620> call<00:06:07.800> first<00:06:08.159> inversion<00:06:08.550> and<00:06:08.970> see

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:09.449 
is what we call first inversion and see

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:11.749 
is what we call first inversion and see
the<00:06:09.569> fingers<00:06:09.900> that<00:06:10.020> I'm<00:06:10.139> using<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:10.710> then<00:06:11.639> if

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 
the fingers that I'm using and then if

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.909 
the fingers that I'm using and then if
we<00:06:11.909> do<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.300> same<00:06:12.479> thing<00:06:12.690> again<00:06:12.960> bring<00:06:13.470> this<00:06:13.620> up

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
we do the same thing again bring this up

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.719 
we do the same thing again bring this up
there<00:06:15.440> this<00:06:16.440> is<00:06:16.590> what<00:06:16.710> we<00:06:16.800> call<00:06:17.009> second

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
there this is what we call second

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:22.550 
there this is what we call second
inversion<00:06:18.259> okay<00:06:19.259> so<00:06:19.800> G<00:06:20.159> C<00:06:20.699> and<00:06:21.060> E<00:06:21.330> and<00:06:21.569> then

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
inversion okay so G C and E and then

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.010 
inversion okay so G C and E and then
finally<00:06:23.009> back<00:06:23.280> to<00:06:23.490> me<00:06:23.610> position<00:06:23.970> there's<00:06:24.900> only

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
finally back to me position there's only

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.790 
finally back to me position there's only
two<00:06:25.440> inversions<00:06:26.130> 4<00:06:27.090> triads<00:06:27.630> so<00:06:28.319> we<00:06:28.440> have<00:06:28.590> root

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
two inversions 4 triads so we have root

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.710 
two inversions 4 triads so we have root
position<00:06:29.009> which<00:06:29.580> is<00:06:29.610> not<00:06:29.849> an<00:06:30.030> inversion<00:06:30.330> then

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
position which is not an inversion then

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.360 
position which is not an inversion then
we<00:06:30.810> have<00:06:30.960> first<00:06:31.199> inversion<00:06:31.560> and<00:06:31.860> second

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
we have first inversion and second

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.760 
we have first inversion and second
version<00:06:32.520> root<00:06:33.180> position<00:06:33.440> first<00:06:34.440> inversion

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
version root position first inversion

inversions but we're not doing with
sevens<00:06:42.030> just<00:06:42.300> yet<00:06:42.479> but<00:06:42.750> just<00:06:43.139> so<00:06:43.259> you<00:06:43.349> know

know what let me just show you the

00:06:48.659 --> 00:06:50.180 
know what let me just show you the
inversions<00:06:49.199> in<00:06:49.289> the<00:06:49.380> left<00:06:49.590> hand<00:06:49.770> just<00:06:49.979> so<00:06:50.099> you

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
inversions in the left hand just so you

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.070 
inversions in the left hand just so you
have<00:06:50.310> that<00:06:50.430> fingering<00:06:50.940> so<00:06:51.180> that's<00:06:51.360> pinky

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080

middle thumb and then the first

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.129 
middle thumb and then the first
inversion<00:06:53.820> is<00:06:54.060> still<00:06:54.270> pinky<00:06:54.630> Mittal<00:06:54.750> thumb

the<00:06:55.800> second<00:06:56.190> inversion<00:06:56.490> is<00:06:57.169> pinky<00:06:58.169> second

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
the second inversion is pinky second

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.969 
the second inversion is pinky second
finger<00:06:59.250> thumb<00:06:59.639> and<00:07:00.319> pinky<00:07:01.319> middle<00:07:01.560> thumb<00:07:01.740> and
