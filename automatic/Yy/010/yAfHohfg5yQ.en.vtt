00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
okay on this exercise we're going to

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.019 
okay on this exercise we're going to
work<00:00:04.140> on<00:00:04.380> the<00:00:04.529> five<00:00:04.799> thing<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.279> pattern<00:00:05.759> or<00:00:05.910> you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
work on the five thing of pattern or you

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.000 
work on the five thing of pattern or you
could<00:00:06.180> call<00:00:06.450> it<00:00:06.629> the<00:00:06.839> fine<00:00:07.379> finger<00:00:07.649> technique

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
could call it the fine finger technique

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.870 
could call it the fine finger technique
and<00:00:08.880> we're<00:00:09.630> gonna<00:00:09.870> start<00:00:10.200> it<00:00:10.320> off<00:00:10.610> letting<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
and we're gonna start it off letting the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.770 
and we're gonna start it off letting the
right<00:00:12.090> hand<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.139> then<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.309> gonna<00:00:14.400> man<00:00:15.360> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
right hand and then we're gonna man the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.180 
right hand and then we're gonna man the
left<00:00:16.020> hand<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:16.500> we're<00:00:16.650> gonna<00:00:16.740> do<00:00:16.949> both

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
left hand and then we're gonna do both

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.880 
left hand and then we're gonna do both
hands<00:00:17.490> together<00:00:17.730> going<00:00:18.180> up<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:19.109> it's<00:00:19.680> kind

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
hands together going up it's it's kind

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
hands together going up it's it's kind
of<00:00:19.980> similar<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:21.210> pattern<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.900> use

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
of similar to the pattern that you use

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.660 
of similar to the pattern that you use
going<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.590> doing<00:00:22.920> some<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.279> hand<00:00:23.490> and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
going up doing some of the hand and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.870 
going up doing some of the hand and
stuff<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.150> it's<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.170> nother<00:00:25.880> exercise

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
stuff but it's just a nother exercise

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.620 
stuff but it's just a nother exercise
another<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.609> challenge<00:00:30.330> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
another way to to to to challenge the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.939 
another way to to to to challenge the
fingers<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.109> do<00:00:31.230> some<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> things<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
fingers to do some of the things you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.100 
fingers to do some of the things you
want<00:00:32.130> them<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.430> do<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.390> is<00:00:33.450> more<00:00:33.930> less

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
want them to do and this is more less

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.530 
want them to do and this is more less
definitely<00:00:34.559> for<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.370> beginner<00:00:35.760> beginner<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
definitely for the beginner beginner so

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.690 
definitely for the beginner beginner so
the<00:00:37.260> goal<00:00:37.500> here<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:37.829> we're<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.160> start<00:00:38.550> at

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
the goal here is we're gonna start at

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610 
the goal here is we're gonna start at
middle<00:00:39.000> C<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:39.930> work<00:00:40.200> our<00:00:40.440> way

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
middle C and we're gonna work our way

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.700 
middle C and we're gonna work our way
out<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:41.129> octave<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:42.300> bring<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> number<00:00:43.440> one

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
out one octave so bring the number one

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
out one octave so bring the number one
of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.250> right<00:00:44.460> hand<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.850> gonna<00:00:45.030> start<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.450> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
of the right hand is gonna start on the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.119 
of the right hand is gonna start on the
middle<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.870> scene<00:00:46.079> we're<00:00:46.410> gonna<00:00:46.500> work<00:00:46.770> our<00:00:46.980> way

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
middle of scene we're gonna work our way

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.450 
middle of scene we're gonna work our way
up<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.300> middle<00:00:48.780> C<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.620> octave<00:00:49.980> up<00:00:50.160> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
up to the middle C one octave up and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.700 
up to the middle C one octave up and
think<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> number<00:00:51.809> five<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.260> men<00:00:52.469> men

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
think of number five of the men men

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
think of number five of the men men
don't<00:00:52.949> start<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.910> middle<00:00:54.300> C<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.719> octave<00:00:55.050> down

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
don't start in middle C one octave down

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.040 
don't start in middle C one octave down
for<00:00:55.410> middle<00:00:55.649> C<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.940> yeah<00:00:57.449> on<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
for middle C it's not it yeah on the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840 
for middle C it's not it yeah on the
pattern<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.890> all<00:00:59.010> useful<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.670> to

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
pattern that with all useful to get to

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
pattern that with all useful to get to
the<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> middle<00:01:01.079> C<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.890> see<00:01:02.160> what

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the to the middle C here so you see what

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.570 
the to the middle C here so you see what
I'm<00:01:02.370> talking<00:01:02.670> about<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.589> let's<00:01:04.589> get<00:01:05.189> started

first and I'm gonna go up a cup of

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.870 
first and I'm gonna go up a cup of
patterns<00:01:10.619> up<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> then<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.130> gonna<00:01:11.310> stop<00:01:11.670> them

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
patterns up and then I'm gonna stop them

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.550 
patterns up and then I'm gonna stop them
do<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> left<00:01:12.330> hand<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.659> couple<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.990> patterns<00:01:13.200> up

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
do the left hand a couple of patterns up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the fingers for the left hand just

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240 
the fingers for the left hand just
remember<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> finger<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.380> for<00:01:37.530> that<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.860> this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
remember the finger and for that is this

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
remember the finger and for that is this
is<00:01:38.400> playing<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> one<00:01:38.850> two<00:01:39.090> three<00:01:39.119> four<00:01:39.659> five<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
is playing a one two three four five so

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.819 
is playing a one two three four five so
we<00:01:40.860> don't<00:01:41.009> call<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.880> finger<00:01:42.299> numbers

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
we don't call not the finger numbers

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.770 
we don't call not the finger numbers
basically<00:01:43.829> instead<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.729> me<00:01:44.880> calling<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.479> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.069 
basically instead of me calling out the
V<00:01:46.409> are<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.979> notes<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.460> keys<00:01:47.759> itself<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.509> to

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
V are the notes to the keys itself so to

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.560 
V are the notes to the keys itself so to
me<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.710> faster<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> doing<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
me that's just a faster way of doing it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.999 
me that's just a faster way of doing it
okay<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.479> his<00:01:54.479> finger<00:01:54.869> one<00:01:55.110> on<00:01:55.350> C<00:01:55.740> it's

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
okay so now his finger one on C it's

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.399 
okay so now his finger one on C it's
gonna<00:01:56.189> go<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:57.390> we're<00:01:57.540> not<00:01:57.659> gonna<00:01:57.840> skip<00:01:58.170> any

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
gonna go and we're not gonna skip any

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.460 
gonna go and we're not gonna skip any
notes<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:58.920> it's<00:01:59.009> gonna<00:01:59.189> go

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.940 

and<00:02:03.980> must<00:02:04.160> keep<00:02:04.340> any<00:02:04.580> notes<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:05.540> gonna<00:02:05.660> be

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
and must keep any notes so it's gonna be

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.640 
and must keep any notes so it's gonna be
one<00:02:06.950> two<00:02:07.370> three<00:02:07.400> four<00:02:08.740> three<00:02:09.740> two<00:02:09.830> one<00:02:11.650> one

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
one two three four three two one one

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.490 
one two three four three two one one
minute<00:02:13.400> number<00:02:13.550> one<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.030> D<00:02:14.210> 1<00:02:14.870> 2<00:02:15.260> 3<00:02:15.680> 4<00:02:16.220> 5<00:02:16.610> 4<00:02:17.150> 3<00:02:17.510> 2<00:02:17.990> 1

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
minute number one to D 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:28.350 
minute number one to D 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
1<00:02:19.000> 1<00:02:20.050> or<00:02:21.050> fing<00:02:21.440> number<00:02:21.710> 1<00:02:21.920> 2<00:02:22.100> e<00:02:22.160> 1<00:02:22.580> 2<00:02:23.300> 3<00:02:23.690> 4<00:02:24.640> 3<00:02:25.640> 2<00:02:25.760> 1<00:02:26.600> 1

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
1 1 or fing number 1 2 e 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.880 
1 1 or fing number 1 2 e 1 2 3 4 3 2 1 1
so<00:02:29.360> that's<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.690> pattern<00:02:30.080> we're<00:02:30.200> gonna<00:02:30.350> use<00:02:30.590> on

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
so that's the pattern we're gonna use on

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.710 
so that's the pattern we're gonna use on
the<00:02:31.070> right<00:02:31.250> hand<00:02:31.490> all<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.970> way<00:02:32.000> until<00:02:32.360> we<00:02:32.420> get

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
the right hand all the way until we get

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.310 
the right hand all the way until we get
to<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:34.670> C<00:02:35.120> which<00:02:35.300> is<00:02:35.450> one<00:02:35.660> octave<00:02:36.020> up<00:02:36.140> from

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
to the C which is one octave up from

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.530 
to the C which is one octave up from
that<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:36.860> go<00:02:37.120> 1<00:02:38.120> 2<00:02:38.390> 3<00:02:38.540> 4<00:02:38.960> 5<00:02:39.800> 4<00:02:40.190> 3<00:02:40.580> 2<00:02:41.030> 1

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
that it's going to go 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.990 
that it's going to go 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1
1<00:02:42.410> 1<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.850> that's<00:02:44.450> how<00:02:44.600> we're<00:02:44.810> going<00:02:45.020> to<00:02:45.110> end<00:02:45.440> it

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
1 1 and that's how we're going to end it

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.560 
1 1 and that's how we're going to end it
so<00:02:47.000> let's<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.690> your<00:02:47.840> left<00:02:48.050> hand<00:02:48.290> middle<00:02:49.250> C

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
so let's do the your left hand middle C

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.850 
so let's do the your left hand middle C
one<00:02:50.570> octave<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.200> middle<00:02:51.500> C<00:02:51.680> it's<00:02:51.860> gonna<00:02:52.040> go

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
one octave up the middle C it's gonna go

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:04.060 
one octave up the middle C it's gonna go
three<00:02:54.860> two<00:02:55.310> one<00:02:55.790> two<00:02:56.570> three<00:03:01.150> move<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.390> e<00:03:02.420> 5<00:03:03.290> 4<00:03:03.710> 3

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
three two one two three move to e 5 4 3

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:18.280 
three two one two three move to e 5 4 3
2<00:03:04.550> 1<00:03:05.030> 2<00:03:05.420> 3<00:03:05.810> 4<00:03:06.320> 5<00:03:09.670> 4<00:03:10.670> 3<00:03:10.970> 2<00:03:11.450> 1<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.900> that's<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
2 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 so that's the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:25.090 
2 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 so that's the
pattern<00:03:18.500> going<00:03:18.980> up<00:03:20.950> ok<00:03:22.150> so<00:03:23.150> now<00:03:23.360> let's<00:03:23.660> do<00:03:24.650> both

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
pattern going up ok so now let's do both

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.490 
pattern going up ok so now let's do both
hands<00:03:25.370> together<00:03:25.580> well<00:03:26.540> because<00:03:26.900> the

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
hands together well because the

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500 
hands together well because the
fingering<00:03:27.980> count<00:03:28.250> on<00:03:28.400> the<00:03:28.550> right<00:03:28.730> hand<00:03:29.300> is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
fingering count on the right hand is

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.060 
fingering count on the right hand is
different<00:03:29.750> than<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.320> finger<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:30.770> come<00:03:30.950> on

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
different than the finger and come on

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.250 
different than the finger and come on
the<00:03:31.160> left<00:03:31.400> hand<00:03:31.610> I'm<00:03:32.209> not<00:03:32.570> going<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.050> be<00:03:33.170> able

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
the left hand I'm not going to be able

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.680 
the left hand I'm not going to be able
to<00:03:33.350> to<00:03:34.070> call<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.550> out<00:03:34.670> I'm<00:03:34.850> just<00:03:34.880> gonna<00:03:35.209> you

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
to to call it out I'm just gonna you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.390 
to to call it out I'm just gonna you
have<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.050> pattern<00:03:36.440> if<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.709> can<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.070> play

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
have the pattern if you can just play

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.430 
have the pattern if you can just play
that<00:03:37.580> pattern<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.150> we<00:03:38.300> like<00:03:38.510> all<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.170> way<00:03:39.260> up

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
that pattern that we like all the way up

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.449 
that pattern that we like all the way up
to<00:03:39.650> to<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.420> C<00:03:41.830> which<00:03:42.830> is<00:03:42.980> one<00:03:43.160> octave

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
to to the to the C which is one octave

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:44.680 
to to the to the C which is one octave
up<00:03:43.580> in<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:43.820> middle<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.060> seeds<00:03:44.239> and<00:03:44.300> play<00:03:44.480> that

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
up in the middle of seeds and play that

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.210 
up in the middle of seeds and play that
pattern<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:47.230> stop<00:03:48.230> once<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.680> get<00:03:48.890> up<00:03:49.010> to

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
pattern and just stop once you get up to

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.370 
pattern and just stop once you get up to
this<00:03:49.370> don't<00:03:49.700> go<00:03:49.850> beyond<00:03:50.269> here<00:03:50.540> unless<00:03:51.080> you

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 
this don't go beyond here unless you

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.110 
this don't go beyond here unless you
just<00:03:51.590> feel<00:03:51.800> adventurous<00:03:51.980> and<00:03:52.610> for<00:03:52.970> your<00:03:53.090> own

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
just feel adventurous and for your own

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.780 
just feel adventurous and for your own
sake<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.840> for<00:03:53.989> your<00:03:54.170> own<00:03:54.200> betterment<00:03:55.130> that's

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
sake and for your own betterment that's

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.699 
sake and for your own betterment that's
what<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.060> want<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.330> do<00:03:56.450> but<00:03:56.989> in<00:03:57.110> anyway<00:03:57.440> this

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
what you want to do but in anyway this

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.199 
what you want to do but in anyway this
is<00:03:57.890> what<00:03:58.070> it<00:03:58.190> should<00:03:58.370> sound<00:03:58.550> like<00:03:58.730> when<00:03:59.090> you

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
is what it should sound like when you

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.000 
is what it should sound like when you
play<00:03:59.420> it<00:03:59.600> so<00:03:59.840> you<00:04:00.320> have<00:04:00.500> enough<00:04:00.830> information

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
play it so you have enough information

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.630 
play it so you have enough information
to<00:04:01.640> to<00:04:02.209> to<00:04:02.989> start<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.890> in<00:04:04.040> enough<00:04:04.310> information

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
to to to start it in enough information

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640 
to to to start it in enough information
to<00:04:04.970> end<00:04:05.390> it<00:04:05.570> so<00:04:05.720> I'm<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:06.019> gonna<00:04:06.200> show<00:04:06.320> it<00:04:06.620> to

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
to end it so I'm just gonna show it to

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.830 
to end it so I'm just gonna show it to
you<00:04:06.830> ok<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.580> you<00:04:07.820> can<00:04:07.910> play<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.300> back<00:04:08.540> at<00:04:08.690> any

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
you ok so you can play this back at any
