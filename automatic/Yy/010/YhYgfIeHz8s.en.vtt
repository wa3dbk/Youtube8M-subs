as you're working and also when you're

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.910 
as you're working and also when you're
finished<00:03:31.840> if<00:03:32.840> you'd<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.350> go<00:03:33.470> ahead<00:03:33.590> and

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
finished if you'd like to go ahead and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.830 
finished if you'd like to go ahead and
measure<00:03:34.130> out<00:03:34.280> your<00:03:34.459> ribbon<00:03:35.030> piece<00:03:35.300> before<00:03:35.600> you

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
measure out your ribbon piece before you

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.050 
measure out your ribbon piece before you
begin<00:03:36.319> so<00:03:36.620> it's<00:03:36.770> not<00:03:36.920> connected<00:03:37.520> to<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.790> reel

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
begin so it's not connected to the reel

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.229 
begin so it's not connected to the reel
I<00:03:38.769> generally<00:03:39.769> recommend<00:03:39.950> about<00:03:40.400> forty<00:03:41.030> three

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
I generally recommend about forty three

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:43.559 
I generally recommend about forty three
inches

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
inches

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.240 
inches
it's<00:03:44.569> definitely<00:03:45.019> better<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.680> have<00:03:45.860> too<00:03:46.069> much

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
it's definitely better to have too much

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.890 
and it is a very sticky adhesive and
would<00:06:48.680> probably<00:06:49.220> get<00:06:50.060> stuck<00:06:50.330> in<00:06:50.480> somebody's

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.360 
would probably get stuck in somebody's
hair<00:06:51.140> so<00:06:51.350> I'm<00:06:51.470> going<00:06:51.620> to<00:06:51.710> go<00:06:51.800> ahead<00:06:51.920> and

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
hair so I'm going to go ahead and

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.120 
hair so I'm going to go ahead and
instead<00:06:52.970> use<00:06:53.510> a<00:06:53.540> small<00:06:54.050> little<00:06:54.080> strip<00:06:54.650> of<00:06:54.860> our

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:55.130 
instead use a small little strip of our

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.410 
instead use a small little strip of our
adhesive<00:06:55.640> tape<00:06:55.850> again

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.690 

feel<00:06:58.960> about<00:06:59.170> backing<00:06:59.500> off<00:06:59.800> of<00:06:59.830> that<00:07:00.160> tape<00:07:00.400> and

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
feel about backing off of that tape and

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.310 
feel about backing off of that tape and
go<00:07:00.970> ahead<00:07:01.180> and<00:07:01.390> apply<00:07:01.660> it<00:07:01.720> drop<00:07:01.930> weight<00:07:02.110> to<00:07:02.230> the

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
go ahead and apply it drop weight to the

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:10.780 
go ahead and apply it drop weight to the
headband

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.390 

simply<00:07:11.790> stick<00:07:12.090> it<00:07:12.240> on<00:07:12.390> and<00:07:12.690> give<00:07:12.870> it<00:07:12.990> a<00:07:13.050> squeeze

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
simply stick it on and give it a squeeze

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.770 
simply stick it on and give it a squeeze
and<00:07:14.400> you<00:07:14.840> have<00:07:15.840> an<00:07:16.140> instant<00:07:16.800> adhesion<00:07:17.780> this

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:18.780 
and you have an instant adhesion this

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.830 
and you have an instant adhesion this
tape<00:07:19.110> actually<00:07:19.470> does<00:07:20.160> cure<00:07:20.640> for<00:07:20.940> around<00:07:21.180> 24

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 
tape actually does cure for around 24

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.260 
tape actually does cure for around 24
hours<00:07:21.870> and<00:07:22.560> so<00:07:22.770> your<00:07:22.920> strongest<00:07:23.490> bond<00:07:23.790> will

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
hours and so your strongest bond will

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:26.120 
hours and so your strongest bond will
take<00:07:24.480> about<00:07:24.750> a<00:07:24.810> day<00:07:25.110> to<00:07:25.140> achieve<00:07:25.740> its<00:07:25.920> maximum

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
take about a day to achieve its maximum

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.500 
take about a day to achieve its maximum
