hey guys welcome back to expose Tuesday
today<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.190> gonna<00:00:02.280> talk<00:00:02.490> about<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.790> module

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
today we're gonna talk about a module

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.700 
today we're gonna talk about a module
that<00:00:03.330> gives<00:00:03.480> us<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.689> better<00:00:03.959> understanding<00:00:04.620> of

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
that gives us a better understanding of

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.530 
that gives us a better understanding of
a<00:00:04.830> battery<00:00:05.130> usage<00:00:05.490> on<00:00:05.670> our<00:00:05.790> system<00:00:06.150> let's

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
a battery usage on our system let's

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.940 
a battery usage on our system let's
check<00:00:06.720> out<00:00:11.870> the<00:00:12.870> module<00:00:13.230> talking<00:00:13.559> about<00:00:13.740> today

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
check out the module talking about today

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.499 
check out the module talking about today
is<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.250> module<00:00:14.610> that<00:00:14.730> allows<00:00:14.790> us<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.480> a

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is a module that allows us to get a

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.120 
is a module that allows us to get a
better<00:00:15.839> understanding<00:00:16.500> of<00:00:16.590> how<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> battery

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
better understanding of how a battery

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.670 
better understanding of how a battery
usage<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.600> currently<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> actual

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
usage is now I currently have the actual

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.170 
usage is now I currently have the actual
module<00:00:19.830> installed<00:00:20.369> we'll<00:00:20.670> go<00:00:20.699> into<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
module installed we'll go into the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.900 
module installed we'll go into the
xposed<00:00:21.869> installer<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.529> look<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> module

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
xposed installer and look for the module

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.019 
xposed installer and look for the module
that<00:00:24.029> says<00:00:24.240> battery<00:00:24.720> history<00:00:25.230> XXL<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.670> name

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that says battery history XXL the name

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.490 
that says battery history XXL the name
pretty<00:00:27.359> much<00:00:27.510> indicates<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.320> going<00:00:28.410> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
pretty much indicates that it's going to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.109 
pretty much indicates that it's going to
be<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> much<00:00:28.830> longer<00:00:29.279> history<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.699> much<00:00:29.910> bigger

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
be a much longer history a much bigger

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
be a much longer history a much bigger
history<00:00:30.570> there's<00:00:31.320> really<00:00:31.439> no<00:00:31.650> user<00:00:31.859> interface

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
history there's really no user interface

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.590 
history there's really no user interface
you've<00:00:32.489> turned<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.210> restart<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
you've turned it on and you restart the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
you've turned it on and you restart the
device<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.140> pretty<00:00:34.320> simple<00:00:34.680> in<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.920> sense

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
device it's pretty simple in that sense

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.610 
device it's pretty simple in that sense
what<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.180> get<00:00:36.390> when<00:00:36.570> we<00:00:36.719> actually<00:00:37.050> want<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
what we do get when we actually want to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.709 
what we do get when we actually want to
use<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.070> will<00:00:38.730> go<00:00:38.850> into<00:00:39.000> our<00:00:39.090> notification

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
use this will go into our notification

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.690 
use this will go into our notification
panel<00:00:39.870> we'll<00:00:40.200> open<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.469> our<00:00:40.620> settings<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.579> go

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
panel we'll open up our settings just go

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.280 
panel we'll open up our settings just go
into<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:42.030> battery<00:00:42.300> normal<00:00:42.809> way<00:00:42.960> whichever

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
into your battery normal way whichever

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.569 
into your battery normal way whichever
way<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.559> normally<00:00:43.739> go<00:00:44.100> into<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.370> system

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
way you normally go into your system

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.029 
way you normally go into your system
this<00:00:45.329> shows<00:00:45.539> us<00:00:45.719> certain<00:00:45.960> normal<00:00:46.500> users<00:00:46.860> now

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this shows us certain normal users now

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.770 
this shows us certain normal users now
again<00:00:47.430> our<00:00:47.670> system<00:00:48.030> hasn't<00:00:48.300> been<00:00:48.420> up<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.690> that

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
again our system hasn't been up for that

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.540 
again our system hasn't been up for that
long<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.469> obviously<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.219> really

the<00:01:29.100> background<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:30.090> did<00:01:30.240> use<00:01:30.420> about<00:01:30.630> 1%

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the background and it did use about 1%

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.600 
the background and it did use about 1%
so<00:01:31.439> that's<00:01:31.710> something<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.100> may<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.520> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
so that's something I may want to be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.039 
so that's something I may want to be
able<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.820> go<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.329> greenify<00:01:33.659> later

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
able to go in there and greenify later

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
able to go in there and greenify later
again<00:01:34.860> some<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.220> things<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.640> don't

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
again some of the things that you don't

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.700 
again some of the things that you don't

want to look into as far as what your

want to look into as far as what your
battery<00:01:45.299> system<00:01:45.659> does<00:01:45.840> I'll<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.200> ahead<00:01:46.259> and

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
battery system does I'll go ahead and

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.020 
battery system does I'll go ahead and
restart<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.770> device<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.520> just<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.880> show

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
restart the device one time just to show

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
restart the device one time just to show
you<00:01:48.090> guys<00:01:48.240> how<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.540> looks<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.290> when

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
you guys how it looks like actually when

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.289 
you guys how it looks like actually when
it's<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.890> actual<00:01:50.250> module<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.700> not<00:01:50.850> turned<00:01:51.119> on

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
it's this actual module is not turned on

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.510 
it's this actual module is not turned on
so<00:01:52.049> system<00:01:52.530> is<00:01:52.649> rebooted<00:01:53.070> we'll<00:01:53.250> go<00:01:53.340> ahead<00:01:53.399> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
so system is rebooted we'll go ahead and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.039 
so system is rebooted we'll go ahead and
go<00:01:53.700> into<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> actual<00:01:54.299> settings<00:01:54.630> itself

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
go into the actual settings itself

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.499 
go into the actual settings itself
battery<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.729> we'll<00:01:57.180> look<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
battery and then we'll look at the

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.209 
battery and then we'll look at the
actual<00:01:57.689> usage<00:01:58.020> itself<00:01:58.560> so<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.829> we<00:01:58.950> scroll<00:01:59.159> down

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
actual usage itself so if we scroll down

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
actual usage itself so if we scroll down
you<00:01:59.579> notice<00:01:59.820> it<00:01:59.939> actually<00:02:00.210> stops<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:00.719> here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
you notice it actually stops right here

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
you notice it actually stops right here
up<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.259> Google<00:02:01.649> search<00:02:01.829> it's<00:02:02.579> about<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.850> 2%

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
up to Google search it's about the 2%

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.760 
up to Google search it's about the 2%
range<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.899> ones<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.259> we<00:02:04.380> had<00:02:04.560> before

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
range all the ones that we had before

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.429 
range all the ones that we had before
were<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.310> 1%<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.630> we're<00:02:07.079> not<00:02:07.200> showing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
were the 1% and so on we're not showing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.919 
were the 1% and so on we're not showing
here<00:02:07.710> anymore<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.310> again<00:02:08.910> this<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.479> generally

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
here anymore so again this is generally

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.449 
here anymore so again this is generally
a<00:02:09.959> much<00:02:10.259> better<00:02:10.440> way<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.709> understanding<00:02:11.069> your

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
a much better way of understanding your

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.260 
a much better way of understanding your
bad

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
bad

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.190 
bad
from<00:02:12.450> what<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.629> guys<00:02:12.720> could<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
from what you guys could see with the

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.750 
from what you guys could see with the
hands<00:02:13.470> on<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.590> module<00:02:13.980> itself<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:14.430> actually

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
hands on the module itself but actually

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.000 
hands on the module itself but actually
extremely<00:02:15.390> simple<00:02:16.019> all<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.379> really<00:02:16.500> does<00:02:16.769> it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
extremely simple all it really does it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.589 
extremely simple all it really does it
expands<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.550> history<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.120> your<00:02:18.300> battery

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
expands the history of your battery

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.240 
expands the history of your battery
usage<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.349> it<00:02:19.620> gives<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.920> ability<00:02:19.980> to

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
usage and it gives you the ability to

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.740 
usage and it gives you the ability to
see<00:02:20.519> all<00:02:20.700> those<00:02:20.879> little<00:02:21.060> culprits<00:02:21.569> that<00:02:21.599> you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
see all those little culprits that you

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
see all those little culprits that you
normally<00:02:22.110> wouldn't<00:02:22.290> see<00:02:22.560> now<00:02:23.220> there<00:02:23.489> are

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
normally wouldn't see now there are

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.100 
normally wouldn't see now there are
other<00:02:23.700> applications<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.450> could<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.959> try

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
other applications you could use to try

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.600 
other applications you could use to try
to<00:02:25.200> get<00:02:25.379> some<00:02:25.650> of<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:25.800> information<00:02:26.010> like

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
to get some of this information like

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.130 
to get some of this information like
wakelock<00:02:27.000> detector<00:02:27.480> or<00:02:27.690> some<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.019> other

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
wakelock detector or some of the other

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.690 
wakelock detector or some of the other
applications<00:02:28.349> that<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.099> give<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.340> basically

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
applications that can give you basically

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.059 
applications that can give you basically
a<00:02:29.819> history<00:02:30.239> but<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.019> puts<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.590> natively

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
a history but this puts it in natively

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.650 
a history but this puts it in natively
into<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.459> actual<00:02:32.819> battery<00:02:33.180> usage

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
into the actual battery usage

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.199 
into the actual battery usage
application<00:02:34.260> or<00:02:34.470> function<00:02:34.950> within<00:02:35.160> our<00:02:35.280> OS<00:02:35.580> so

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
application or function within our OS so

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.490 
application or function within our OS so
if<00:02:36.390> you<00:02:36.510> normally<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.930> into<00:02:37.110> that<00:02:37.290> function

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
if you normally go into that function

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.630 
if you normally go into that function
and<00:02:37.799> look<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.099> you're<00:02:38.190> always<00:02:38.310> kind<00:02:38.519> of

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and look and you're always kind of

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800 
and look and you're always kind of
bummed<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.120> actually<00:02:39.420> gives<00:02:39.540> you<00:02:39.599> such<00:02:39.780> a

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
bummed that it actually gives you such a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.240 
bummed that it actually gives you such a
short<00:02:40.170> list<00:02:40.410> but<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.680> know<00:02:40.799> there's<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.129> many

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
short list but you know there's so many

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.250 
short list but you know there's so many
more<00:02:41.519> things<00:02:41.580> running<00:02:42.090> this<00:02:42.870> definitely

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
more things running this definitely

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.509 
more things running this definitely
gives<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.560> ability<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.069> actually<00:02:44.220> get<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
gives you ability to actually get a

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.400 
gives you ability to actually get a
better<00:02:44.670> view<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.209> now<00:02:45.720> for<00:02:45.989> me<00:02:46.110> when<00:02:46.319> you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
better view of it now for me when you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.690 
better view of it now for me when you
guys<00:02:46.530> saw<00:02:46.739> with<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> hands<00:02:47.220> on<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.519> noticed

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
guys saw with the hands on I noticed

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.670 
guys saw with the hands on I noticed
that<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.060> amazon<00:02:48.420> firetv<00:02:48.630> stick<00:02:48.959> app<00:02:49.410> is

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
that the amazon firetv stick app is

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.900 
that the amazon firetv stick app is
running<00:02:49.980> in<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.280> background<00:02:50.459> for<00:02:50.790> some

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
running in the background for some

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.120 
running in the background for some
reason<00:02:51.180> or<00:02:51.239> another<00:02:51.269> I<00:02:51.569> haven't<00:02:51.959> used<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.380> I

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
reason or another I haven't used it I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.039 
reason or another I haven't used it I
usually<00:02:53.489> use<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.030> actual<00:02:54.299> remote<00:02:54.599> directly

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
usually use the actual remote directly

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.259 
usually use the actual remote directly
on<00:02:55.170> my<00:02:55.260> Amazon<00:02:55.860> fire<00:02:56.010> TV<00:02:56.220> or<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.730> fire<00:02:56.910> TV

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
on my Amazon fire TV or the fire TV

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.789 
on my Amazon fire TV or the fire TV
stick<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.170> interesting<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.650> it's

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
stick so it's interesting that it's

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.350 
stick so it's interesting that it's
trying<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.130> run<00:02:59.489> in<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.700> background<00:02:59.730> for<00:03:00.209> some

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
trying to run in the background for some

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.120 
trying to run in the background for some
reason<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.110> that's<00:03:01.470> one<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.709> those<00:03:01.799> things<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
reason so that's one of those things I

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.680 
reason so that's one of those things I
probably<00:03:02.310> will<00:03:02.519> go<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.790> through<00:03:02.940> greenify<00:03:03.299> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
probably will go in through greenify and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.720 
probably will go in through greenify and
then<00:03:03.840> you<00:03:04.140> know<00:03:04.230> greenify<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.890> app<00:03:05.040> so

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
then you know greenify that app so

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.580 
then you know greenify that app so
overall<00:03:06.180> it's<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.569> very<00:03:06.599> nice<00:03:06.930> simple<00:03:07.170> module

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
overall it's a very nice simple module

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.170 
overall it's a very nice simple module
itself<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.160> does<00:03:08.370> help<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:08.880> does<00:03:09.030> work

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180
