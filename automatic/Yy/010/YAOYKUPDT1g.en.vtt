00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.200 
asleep some time later I was awoken by a
scratching<00:01:12.960> sound<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.860> looked<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:14.939> clock

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
scratching sound I looked at the clock

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.590 
scratching sound I looked at the clock
and<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.750> 11:50<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.640> sound<00:01:17.939> stopped<00:01:18.330> after

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and it was 11:50 the sound stopped after

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.020 
and it was 11:50 the sound stopped after
a<00:01:18.810> few<00:01:18.869> seconds<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.770> because<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.610> was<00:01:20.790> still

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
a few seconds and because I was still

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.130 
a few seconds and because I was still
extremely<00:01:21.330> tired

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
extremely tired

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.469 
extremely tired
I<00:01:22.320> didn't<00:01:22.890> bother<00:01:23.040> looking<00:01:23.400> around<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.299> just

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I didn't bother looking around and just

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.670 
I didn't bother looking around and just
simply<00:01:24.900> went<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> sleep

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
simply went back to sleep

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.820 
simply went back to sleep
I<00:01:26.740> was<00:01:27.730> later<00:01:27.970> awoken<00:01:28.540> by<00:01:28.660> the<00:01:28.720> same<00:01:29.050> sound<00:01:29.410> and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
I was later awoken by the same sound and

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.060 
I was later awoken by the same sound and
it<00:01:30.430> was<00:01:30.550> now<00:01:30.730> 12:40<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:32.350> time<00:01:32.710> it<00:01:33.010> really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
it was now 12:40 this time it really

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.640 
it was now 12:40 this time it really
freaked<00:01:33.640> me<00:01:33.820> out<00:01:33.850> because<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.080> sound<00:01:35.320> didn't

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 
freaked me out because the sound didn't

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.100 
freaked me out because the sound didn't
stop<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.880> thought<00:01:37.150> went<00:01:37.300> across<00:01:37.600> my<00:01:37.690> mind

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
stop the thought went across my mind

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.050 
stop the thought went across my mind
that<00:01:38.410> it<00:01:38.530> was<00:01:38.560> just<00:01:38.890> an<00:01:39.010> animal<00:01:39.220> inspecting

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
that it was just an animal inspecting

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.900 
that it was just an animal inspecting
the<00:01:40.150> car<00:01:40.440> but<00:01:41.440> why<00:01:41.620> would<00:01:41.800> it<00:01:41.830> return<00:01:42.310> almost

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
the car but why would it return almost

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.670 
the car but why would it return almost
an<00:01:43.090> hour<00:01:43.240> after<00:01:43.720> I<00:01:43.750> left<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.290> previous<00:01:44.560> time<00:01:45.070> I

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
an hour after I left the previous time I

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.050 
an hour after I left the previous time I
looked<00:01:47.680> in<00:01:47.800> my<00:01:47.979> rearview<00:01:48.010> mirror<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.000> just

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
looked in my rearview mirror and just

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.940 
looked in my rearview mirror and just
managed<00:01:49.690> to<00:01:49.780> catch<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.200> glimpse<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.680> something

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
managed to catch a glimpse of something

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.570 
managed to catch a glimpse of something
burning<00:01:51.850> away<00:01:51.970> into<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.420> forest<00:01:52.979> now<00:01:53.979> at<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
burning away into the forest now at the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.969 
burning away into the forest now at the
time<00:01:54.820> I<00:01:55.210> thought<00:01:55.750> it<00:01:55.900> was<00:01:56.050> that<00:01:56.229> crazy<00:01:56.590> hook

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
