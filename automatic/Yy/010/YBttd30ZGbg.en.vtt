00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi everyone everybody wants i think so 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.450
 just a very nice smooth 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.849
 flawless like it's just gerbers 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.710
 of course using a number 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.210
 I filter on social media 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.490
 natural ensure that your skin the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.289
 real mirror smooth and floris looks 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.760
 but in real life it is sometimes still possible 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.800
 sometimes a bit disappointing 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 that often has to do with dilation 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.880
 pores 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.010
 here around your nose and a little here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.330
 so towards your cheeks 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.550
 at least I have a little bit 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.180
 bother because I quite a fat 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.940
 have skin 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.760
 and yes hunting was what you get then it is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.950
 then it will accumulate oil in your 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.980
 pores so you actually cool 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.070
 become larger than what is intended 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.480
 but fortunately there are a number 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.520
 products on the market that can make it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.469
 ensure that your pores are just beautiful and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 feyenoorders or just a little smoother and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.739
 looks more even 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 and one of those products is rail 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.590
 goodskin labs and friends sexy 5 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.640
 especially in combination with the seaports and 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.229
 poke finer 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.600
 You really get a very slippery floor 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.960
 there is breast skin that one really wants 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.310
 to have 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.950
 but first I'll leave a little more 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 tell about goosecraft goosecraft 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.369
 is perhaps not very well known yet 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 in the Netherlands because it is only since 2010 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.200
 available on the Dutch market 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.689
 and you can buy it with perfume and glass 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.820
 and it is part of the estÃ©e 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 lauder konbini and they really focus 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.130
 actually most on skin aging 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.869
 but well the products in the rocks 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.509
 boxes that therefore focus primarily on 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.250
 refining and reducing and smaller 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.040
 make the pores so that you have one 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.200
 get smoother skin and it is too 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.670
 will eventually look a little younger 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 and that is of course always beautiful 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.899
 and I actually had that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.610
 dilated pores actually only for 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.979
 came to the somewhat younger people because 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.079
 yes blackheads tubes impurities 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.750
 around this area but it comes true 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.689
 actually beyond the aging skin 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.390
 because you lose elasticity and 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.860
 because so little things accumulate in that 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.110
 pores I can handle it a bit 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.240
 so basically sag at the wat 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.000
 Older people have dilated pores 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.490
 well we want that 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.010
 it not so what has coolskin laughs 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.950
 the gate three sixty 5 and is a serum 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.510
 that works to say your pores 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.610
 reduce and counter at the same time 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.360
 Immediately optically ensures that you 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.610
 pores 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.550
 smaller or finer to see come out 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.700
 it's in this 30 milliliter tube 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.590
 and what I like is always a so so 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.620
 such a tuutje does not have much 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.840
 needed and what I like is that none 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:39.709
 oil is in this formula and that is real 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:43.010
 very light feels cool you know as one 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.840
 as a gel it also gives you very quickly 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.910
 home without sticking and I love 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 don't stick it at all 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.670
 a serum so that you can just during the day 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.700
 apply 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.170
 and at night before going to sleep and what 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.610
 I normally do with a serum 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.920
 that I have a day cream over it 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.500
 but I just notice this 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.630
 mes holy is dating and that it is not 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.860
 really necessary for me to have an extra one 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.360
 day cream to be applied over 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.310
 maybe if you have very dry skin 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.900
 then again you might have that extra 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.850
 nutrition needed but in principle I don't 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.590
 so i use this it is a series but 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.970
 I actually just use it as 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.680
 day cream 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.890
 this serum contains light reflecting 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.260
 particles what is a kind of kind of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.480
 glow or so that makes it the 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.940
 optically just looks smoother 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.540
 but yes this is actually all straight away 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.840
 effect 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.010
 but what I also like the most 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.769
 primers or something that I know that have 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.900
 indeed only that you 're instant ' 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.430
 effect and if you use that primer the pick yes 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.829
 then that effect is simply gone again 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 but because this is a serum and because it is 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.940
 simply contains ingredients for the 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.150
 also ensure a longer term 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.890
 finer skin texture and just yes small 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.570
 the finer pores 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.160
 I just think it's a kind 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.860
 it takes care of two in one product 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.780
 immediately for an instant color but also 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.970
 around four in the longer term 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.620
 weeks you will notice that your pro so you too 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.049
 just some fine come out to see 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.180
 well for the frieze i5 contains one 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.190
 number of key in comedians including 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.940
 I find salicylic acid a whole thing 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.130
 many went 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.900
 knows because it also works well at 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.390
 impurities and I still have 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.440
 suffer from here at that card line 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.090
 especially 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.150
 yes then I always get bothered 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:25.250
 and salicylic acid that thus exfoliates it 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.740
 makes the skin smoother and softer anyway 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.570
 and indeed ensures that 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.980
 You just wear the fine glasses 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.620
 come to see 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.710
 and it helps us with impurities and 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.270
 it stimulates your skin 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.620
 because it keeps the top layer away 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.450
 just to reconnect new cells 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.200
 so I would eventually worry 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:44.990
 in front of 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.670
 blurring of any scars 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.420
 you're just skin smooth out 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.330
 comes to see 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:52.370
 furthermore it also contains hydrolysed 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.590
 soy protein and coconut and they 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.120
 ingredients that are known for it 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.860
 say to absorb the oil 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.320
 So that makes sure the oil does not 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.850
 can sit more in your pores around one 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.210
 cake to hide and bigger too 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.980
 to make 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.860
 but also ensures that you immediately 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.750
 skin just looks dull all day long 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.850
 which makes your skin also just more beautiful and 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.320
 you are going to look all day and have to 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.200
 also say quite a lot 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.940
 shine but now I use a small one 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.290
 week and i just have to say 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.740
 I don't think so at all anymore in the course 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.810
 of the day 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.610
 oh i really have a lot of oil on one 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.200
 in which you just end up also one 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.490
 address as you would like 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.130
 so I don't have that at all anymore 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.850
 this is also pretty good 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.680
 are still uncontrolled 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.400
 much more 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.560
 yes, among other things, a number of vitamins 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.419
 plant extracts antioxidants 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.040
 hyaluronic acid 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.690
 which ensures that your skin is just fine 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.120
 is hydrated and kind of 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:46.160
 boost and like the extra code none 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.630
 is created and that inflammation 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.620
 be prevented 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.870
 so in the actually quite a bit 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.090
 ingredients here in it is actually 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.100
 a kind of vitamin bomb for your skin 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.740
 that also ensures at the same time 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:01.130
 your skin just a nicer look 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.290
 get a smoother and and so blur now 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.320
 this was the gate free sixty-five what 

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:08.810
 is very well combined with deeper and 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.030
 You can really do this This is really pure for 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.250
 the look so this really does it alone 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:16.280
 instant something and not for the longer one 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:17.960
 term what I like is that again 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.950
 is a dessert that it is 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.680
 also a kind 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.780
 skin color is making you yes anyway 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.330
 winnie's still a little concealer 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.539
 I also will like this 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.190
 briefly apply in you like this 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.840
 and this with my face really a first 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.539
 super soft it really feels very soft 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.310
 on and also very matt and that also ensures 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:40.600
 weather for people who reflect light 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.880
 in operation making it all something 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.770
 lies in even looks and in 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.720
 principle if you just have good skin 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:49.000
 have no smooth skin anyway 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.550
 impurities then you could just the 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.580
 out the door and you really have that 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.199
 photoshop perfect but use yourself anyway 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.820
 always one is still a foundation this 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.099
 is my favorite foundation limes 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.900
 silent foundation of her my long and 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.889
 if you are a bit real on airbrush 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.259
 want to create an effect 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.680
 then it is best to use a brush 

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:10.270
 so what i do is what to top one 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.440
 hand and then I dip my 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.759
 brushes in 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.990
 and then that comes with revolving 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:18.520
 movements offer my skin so and after the 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.870
 foundation routine 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.270
 I like to use another beautiful one 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.250
 highlighter like this shimmer bricks

 I would take a selfie for a moment 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.330
 instagram and then I don't do a filter there 

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:48.870
 over it so that I filter the hashtag no 

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.870
