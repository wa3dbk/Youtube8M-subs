00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.060
 in the video today we're going to see the 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.770
 operation of artouz 525 is a 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.320
 educational learning card 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.180
 programming with arduino was created for 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.010
 motivate enthusiastic students of the 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.050
 robotics in the programming of form 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.830
 easy fast and fun with arduino 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.830
 let's see how it works 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.840
 arto 5 originally comes in a kit 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.910
 to assemble the bag we can find 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.550
 printed electronics 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.590
 and adhesives with the drawing of gar 25 for 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 to be able to paste the process of 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.829
 assembly very easy to make and it 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.809
 provides the link to the videos where 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.040
 it shows how step by step is done 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.170
 what is required is a soldering iron that 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.519
 He managed to be able to weld in this way 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.980
 the students feel part of it 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:48.019
 of the project for this very thing comes from 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.210
 white color so they can decorate it 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.070
 as they want in the same way 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.949
 can acquire and assembled with all 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.909
 the welds made to the back 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.339
 We can work in three levels of 

00:00:55.909 --> 00:01:00.920
 programming at the intermediate level that 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.170
 is done with arduino arduino are programmed 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.790
 which is very similar language with 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.979
 that later we can evolve 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.390
 there goes and starts with a program 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.540
 simple that turns on the LEDs of the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.710
 eyes after I sting an eye that does 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.670
 intermittence in the eyes 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.590
 then send laser beams 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.480
 I make a linear sequence on the plate 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.740
 then a circular sequence 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.740
 then change direction 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.810
 then you see the fading to 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.810
 measure intensity of analog ports 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.830
 disco lights our little glasses 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.840
 Police lights 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.210
 You can also program the cell photo 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.300
 to act as an input and create 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.760
 an automatic light when it covered the light it 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.750
 The LEDs light up the light and 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.570
 turn on all led 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.450
 or we can use it to count a 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.180
 Once an LED lights covered the second 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:05.380
 they feel two led the third the fourth 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.380
 and we start again 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.890
 if we can start to automate to 

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:11.140
 count how many houses or elements go 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.180
 passing in this way the students 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.830
 They learn fun and easy way to 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.810
 use the arduino microcontroller 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.260
 they learn programming using the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.610
 cycles it for case and while at the level 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.890
 most basic the students can 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.440
 program with extras for arduino that 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.000
 works by programming blocks that 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.129
 avoids syntax errors is the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.480
 time to program with this ill-fated 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.940
 that what is programmed in the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.910
 computer is reflected on are 25 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.239
 I can turn one of the eyes of the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.930
 another turn off I can turn on the leds 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.640
 of the plate 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.359
 and that's the programming that I want 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.359
 much easier 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.700
 you can also make sequences 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.700
 create intermittent 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.430
 and everything we want with scales for 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.170
 arduino this would be the basic level since 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.329
 for a more advanced level connects a 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.250
 bluetooth module and it is taught to generate 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.220
 applications on android to be able 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.970
 control to give 25 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.970
 straight 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.540
 left 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.820
 Everybody out 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.359
 sequence 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.920
 they are also taught to manage the modules 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.290
 real so that at the same time they go 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.750
 turning on the LEDs of the five are going 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.849
 lighting 110 or 220 volt bulbs 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.400
 this to be able to do automation 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.440
 robotics these projects are already even 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.290
 at university level all 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.400
 projects require an arduino one 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.530
 also works for the mega wheel 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.959
 leonardo or can be adapted for the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.690
 nano arduino and even for a raspberry 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.310
 pi visit the technological dynasty page 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.700
 dotcom so you can buy your kit 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.380
 to assemble by luck 5 and armed and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.830
 ask about the special offers for 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.830
 colleges
