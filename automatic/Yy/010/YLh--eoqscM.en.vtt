make the best possible start yeah the
thing<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:36.930> made<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.319> this<00:02:37.470> surface<00:02:37.709> I'm<00:02:38.430> sure

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
thing is made on this surface I'm sure

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.119 
thing is made on this surface I'm sure
it<00:02:38.819> will<00:02:38.879> do<00:02:39.030> 3.6<00:02:39.750> 262<00:02:40.290> but<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.560> won't<00:02:40.709> do<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.010> on

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
it will do 3.6 262 but it won't do it on

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.899 
it will do 3.6 262 but it won't do it on
this<00:02:41.400> surface<00:02:41.970> will<00:02:42.329> it<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.659> I<00:02:42.900> mean<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:44.340> you

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
this surface will it so I mean if you

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.940 
this surface will it so I mean if you
take<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.360> out<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.930> equation<00:02:46.349> and<00:02:46.620> do<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> roll

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
take that out the equation and do a roll

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.460 
take that out the equation and do a roll
on<00:02:47.099> oricon<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.090> is<00:02:48.209> actually<00:02:48.510> quicker<00:02:48.720> do

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
on oricon this is actually quicker do

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.670 
on oricon this is actually quicker do
you<00:02:49.530> reckon<00:02:49.799> yeah<00:02:50.040> yeah<00:02:51.030> could<00:02:51.989> be<00:02:52.019> alright

the faster car but only by virtue of a

tests<00:03:53.720> it's<00:03:54.200> actually<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> Corvette<00:03:55.010> that's

faster so overall I conclude its honours
