00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.700
 Hello, I have long wanted to take off 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.280
 small video until everything was time 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 spontaneously so shield and show them something 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.860
 what i drive 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:24.279
 the trunk and so means for the washer 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.210
 glass 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:32.010
 his wife gave me a car 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.550
 try it in quality words 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:40.719
 above all but over a hundred hryvnia 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:46.120
 how could i get it about 5 6 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 washer liters already winter to minus 35 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.620
 35 degrees well, this one is here half a liter 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.089
 bottle stands there in my 115 or 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.209
 something 115 hryvnia seems to be above 100 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.679
 wife explained that it is a concentrate 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:07.920
 amway products 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:11.920
 2 markup hot melt glue than the essence of it 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.750
 washer concentrated here here 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.690
 reverse side labels 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.660
 indicated its ratio to demolish if in 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:25.170
 summer time then yes yes -2 then the ratio 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:31.060
 mixing water with this concentrate 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:34.450
 is 95 twenty-five tenths of water 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:42.390
 and 4.75 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:45.070
 here it is the washer if up to -18 it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 50-50 that is half a liter here it is 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.840
 Washer can be diluted with half a liter 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.200
 water but it is in winter 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.070
 well and to 37 we just completely fill in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:05.830
 it's all in the washer well, as if I 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:07.690
 skeptical about here went skeptical 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.579
 reacted initially even as if to this 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.590
 we vat or think well what's the trouble 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.630
 such that it costs 100 hryvnia for 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.010
 half liter 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:19.110
 but when I already used my summer 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.650
 I decided to use the washer 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.480
 this gift and spread with the same 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.900
 ratio as indicated in the summer 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.980
 to minus two degrees 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.860
 This is a teacher at a temperature of minus 2 and 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.380
 but the most and special such washing 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.540
 means i 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.910
 Well, I did not find that there is glass if we 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:47.010
 badly smeared then she can of course my 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:54.150
 brushes work but well not so much but what was 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:58.200
 my surprise when at the big 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:01.970
 the rain room can when the showers I 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.200
 didn't even notice that I didn't turn on the janitor 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.030
 janitors did not turn on for that simple 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.100
 the reason that I have a drop of water 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.380
 windshield simply 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.350
 rolled in different directions already at 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.630
 speeds there are 60 70 kilometers a drop 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.150
 salvation remain unhooked then 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.890
 there is about saying there are not so big 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:25.200
 water flows tax but in general glass 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.180
 transparent go quite possible apricot 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.670
 at speeds of over 100 kilometers so this 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.660
 in general, how lovely all the water flies 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.000
 opposite love of weak glass well and how 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.830
 it seemed as if it were not just a washer 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.460
 windshield and windshield 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.370
 glass 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:50.020
 it's all on the package 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.820
 let's see what is written here read 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.070
 intended for use by any 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.590
 windshield cleaning systems 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.990
 form a layer of polymer not allowing 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.850
 things to pester the glass that 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.680
 increases driving safety and 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.210
 improves visibility through the windshield 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.210
 under any weather conditions 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.940
 how would my wife say thanks again 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.500
 making sure that really 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:22.080
 a gift worth it 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.610
 Well, actually I wish you to try 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.530
 now I will use only the data 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.780
 by color 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.710
 once again this is not an advertisement passed by everyone 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.710
 thanks bye bye
