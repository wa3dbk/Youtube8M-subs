design it was one of the easier ones

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.070 
design it was one of the easier ones
i've<00:01:55.349> used<00:01:55.619> i<00:01:56.009> used<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.880> big<00:01:57.090> end<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.929> look

i've used i used the big end but look
there's<00:01:59.009> some<00:01:59.310> still<00:01:59.610> on<00:01:59.789> there<00:02:01.039> this<00:02:02.039> happens

00:02:02.449 --> 00:02:02.459 
there's some still on there this happens

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.529 
there's some still on there this happens
because<00:02:02.789> my<00:02:03.599> nails<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:03.959> so<00:02:04.110> long<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:05.539> one

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
with as much with pieces basically from

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.490 
with as much with pieces basically from
one<00:02:29.430> stamp<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.690> that<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.870> couple<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.260> times

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
one stamp and do that a couple of times

to<00:02:31.770> fill<00:02:32.010> in<00:02:32.160> all<00:02:32.400> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.820> gaps<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.770> a

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
to fill in all of the gaps so that is a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.470 
to fill in all of the gaps so that is a
tip<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.340> trick<00:02:35.460> if<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.910> longer<00:02:36.150> nails

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
tip or trick if you have longer nails

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.430 
tip or trick if you have longer nails
and<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.380> full<00:02:37.680> stamps<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.209> I<00:02:39.540> can't

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
and the full stamps like this I can't

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.350 
and the full stamps like this I can't
even<00:02:40.590> show<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.860> maybe<00:02:41.660> by<00:02:42.660> line<00:02:42.930> my<00:02:43.140> nail<00:02:43.410> up

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
even show you maybe by line my nail up

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.030 
even show you maybe by line my nail up
next<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.720> see<00:02:46.050> that<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.290> nail<00:02:47.900> is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
next to it you can see that my nail is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.370 
next to it you can see that my nail is
longer<00:02:50.040> than<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.610> stamp<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.300> had<00:02:51.750> to<00:02:51.840> add<00:02:52.020> like

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
longer than the stamp I had to add like

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.270 
longer than the stamp I had to add like
two<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.070> a<00:02:53.100> half<00:02:53.310> rose<00:02:53.760> more<00:02:54.890> it's<00:02:55.890> really<00:02:56.130> not

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
two and a half rose more it's really not

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.010 
two and a half rose more it's really not
that<00:02:56.340> complicated<00:02:56.580> and<00:02:57.360> if<00:02:57.450> you<00:02:57.540> don't<00:02:57.810> mind

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
that complicated and if you don't mind

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.900 
that complicated and if you don't mind
this<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.590> exactly<00:02:59.040> it's<00:02:59.310> not<00:02:59.730> as

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
this one up exactly it's not as

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
this one up exactly it's not as
noticeable<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.600> think<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.959> would<00:03:01.190> like

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
noticeable as you think it would like

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.250 
noticeable as you think it would like
the<00:03:02.310> plaid<00:03:02.640> stamps<00:03:03.360> those<00:03:03.540> are<00:03:03.690> noticeable<00:03:04.170> if

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
the plaid stamps those are noticeable if

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
the plaid stamps those are noticeable if
you<00:03:04.320> don't<00:03:04.470> line<00:03:04.590> them<00:03:04.770> up<00:03:04.860> because<00:03:05.010> there's

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
you don't line them up because there's

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.280 
you don't line them up because there's
such<00:03:05.430> rigid<00:03:05.700> lines<00:03:06.030> but<00:03:06.720> because<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.080> one's

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
such rigid lines but because this one's

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.130 
such rigid lines but because this one's
so<00:03:07.470> zigzaggy<00:03:08.040> if<00:03:08.310> you're<00:03:08.459> off<00:03:08.640> just<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.330> little

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
so zigzaggy if you're off just a little

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.310 
so zigzaggy if you're off just a little
bit<00:03:11.270> you<00:03:12.270> know<00:03:12.300> it's<00:03:12.630> not<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:12.989> end<00:03:13.020> of<00:03:13.260> the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
bit you know it's not the end of the

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.070 
bit you know it's not the end of the
world<00:03:13.590> so<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.580> recommend<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:15.600> for<00:03:15.840> an
