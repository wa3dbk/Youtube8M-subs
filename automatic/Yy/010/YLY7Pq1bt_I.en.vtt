00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and that's something we've been working

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.550 
and that's something we've been working
towards<00:01:14.509> on<00:01:14.600> next-gen<00:01:14.960> but<00:01:15.110> we<00:01:15.170> haven't<00:01:15.320> had<00:01:15.530> a

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
towards on next-gen but we haven't had a

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.170 
towards on next-gen but we haven't had a
chance<00:01:15.590> to<00:01:15.800> get<00:01:15.979> to<00:01:16.130> yet<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.909> always<00:01:17.000> feel

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
chance to get to yet and I always feel

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.760 
chance to get to yet and I always feel
like<00:01:17.300> we've<00:01:17.450> mastered<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.140> know<00:01:18.350> these

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
like we've mastered it so you know these

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:19.870 
like we've mastered it so you know these
are<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:19.070> to<00:01:19.130> have<00:01:19.220> full<00:01:19.369> control<00:01:19.550> you're

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
are going to have full control you're

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.700 
are going to have full control you're
going<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> see<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.180> lot<00:01:20.270> of<00:01:20.450> user<00:01:20.750> user<00:01:21.320> control

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
going to see a lot of user user control

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.240 
going to see a lot of user user control
juice<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:22.070> lot<00:01:22.190> of<00:01:22.310> user<00:01:22.460> break<00:01:22.729> down<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.060> year

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.749 

inside<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.979> branch<00:01:31.190> and<00:01:31.340> animation

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
inside the branch and animation

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.400 
inside the branch and animation
technology<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.330> huge<00:01:32.539> factor<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:33.229> what

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
technology is a huge factor and what

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.419 
technology is a huge factor and what
we're<00:01:33.560> able<00:01:33.679> to<00:01:33.800> do<00:01:33.920> this<00:01:34.070> year<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.369> that's

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
we're able to do this year and that's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:35.430 
we're able to do this year and that's
going<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.729> result<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.179> lot<00:01:35.360> of

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
going to result in a lot of

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.719 
going to result in a lot of
responsiveness<00:01:36.440> but<00:01:36.830> the<00:01:37.280> biggest<00:01:37.520> thing

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
responsiveness but the biggest thing

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.130 
responsiveness but the biggest thing
you're<00:01:38.000> going<00:01:38.090> to<00:01:38.149> see<00:01:38.360> there<00:01:38.570> with<00:01:38.780> with<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
you're going to see there with with the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.900 
you're going to see there with with the
technology<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.830> that<00:01:40.009> everything<00:01:40.520> still

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
technology is that everything still

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.130 
technology is that everything still
looks<00:01:40.940> smooth<00:01:41.390> even<00:01:41.539> though<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:41.720> have<00:01:41.929> full

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
looks smooth even though you have full

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.870 
looks smooth even though you have full
control<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.979> some<00:01:43.160> games<00:01:43.369> have<00:01:43.520> to<00:01:43.700> make<00:01:43.850> a

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
control and some games have to make a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.940 
control and some games have to make a
choice<00:01:43.970> between<00:01:44.179> being<00:01:45.020> very<00:01:45.289> responsive<00:01:45.800> or

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
choice between being very responsive or

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.469 
choice between being very responsive or
looking<00:01:46.280> really<00:01:46.490> good<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:47.149> don't<00:01:47.300> have<00:01:47.390> to

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
looking really good we don't have to

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:48.639 
looking really good we don't have to
make<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.659> choice<00:01:47.810> and<00:01:48.259> that's<00:01:48.320> what<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
make that choice and that's what the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.200 
make that choice and that's what the
branching<00:01:48.950> technology<00:01:49.429> gives<00:01:49.640> us<00:01:49.789> allows<00:01:50.030> us

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
branching technology gives us allows us

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.850 
branching technology gives us allows us
to<00:01:50.330> really<00:01:50.780> smoothly<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.380> easily<00:01:51.500> move<00:01:51.830> from

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
to really smoothly and easily move from

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.830 
to really smoothly and easily move from
animation<00:01:52.460> animation<00:01:52.850> without<00:01:53.509> losing

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
animation animation without losing

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.510 
animation animation without losing
control<00:01:56.649> those<00:01:57.649> sideline<00:01:58.069> catches<00:01:58.460> that

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
control those sideline catches that

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.679 
control those sideline catches that
people<00:01:58.729> had<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.880> problem<00:01:59.149> with<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.450> the<00:01:59.509> past

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
people had a problem with in the past

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.569 
people had a problem with in the past
was<00:02:00.049> you<00:02:00.470> know<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.649> had<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.799> catch<00:02:01.040> animation

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
was you know we had a catch animation

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.560 
was you know we had a catch animation
player<00:02:01.790> would<00:02:01.880> catch<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.060> ball<00:02:02.360> on<00:02:02.479> the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
player would catch the ball on the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.330 
player would catch the ball on the
sideline<00:02:02.990> by<00:02:03.500> the<00:02:03.590> time<00:02:03.799> he<00:02:03.950> was<00:02:04.040> done<00:02:04.159> playing

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340

so<00:03:42.400> mid-air<00:03:43.400> collision<00:03:43.790> I<00:03:43.879> mean<00:03:44.030> is<00:03:44.239> something

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
so mid-air collision I mean is something

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.640 
so mid-air collision I mean is something
that<00:03:44.569> we've<00:03:44.720> added<00:03:44.900> issue<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:45.230> year<00:03:45.290> as<00:03:45.500> well

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
that we've added issue this year as well

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.410

thing<00:03:49.579> is<00:03:49.610> we<00:03:49.819> wanted<00:03:50.150> to<00:03:50.180> have<00:03:50.420> that<00:03:50.450> next

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
thing is we wanted to have that next

thing is we wanted to have that next
level<00:03:51.110> we<00:03:51.650> spent<00:03:51.890> a<00:03:51.950> lot<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.129> time<00:03:52.250> working<00:03:52.610> on

I'm improving our captioning our user
catching<00:03:55.159> we<00:03:55.280> really<00:03:55.459> again<00:03:55.700> put<00:03:55.879> the<00:03:56.030> game

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
catching we really again put the game

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.270 
catching we really again put the game
back<00:03:56.720> in<00:03:56.780> the<00:03:56.930> hands<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.260> user<00:03:57.470> but<00:03:58.159> we

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
back in the hands of the user but we

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.410 
back in the hands of the user but we
also<00:03:58.459> wanted<00:03:58.849> to<00:03:58.909> make<00:03:59.090> sure<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.269> everything

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
also wanted to make sure that everything

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.179 
also wanted to make sure that everything
we<00:03:59.810> did<00:03:59.959> this<00:04:00.109> year<00:04:00.290> from<00:04:00.409> an<00:04:00.530> AI<00:04:00.620> perspective

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
we did this year from an AI perspective

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.860 
we did this year from an AI perspective
from<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.459> gameplay<00:04:01.640> perspective<00:04:01.819> we<00:04:02.720> had<00:04:02.840> a

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
from a gameplay perspective we had a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.599 
from a gameplay perspective we had a
counter<00:04:03.200> to<00:04:03.230> that<00:04:03.470> and<00:04:03.680> so<00:04:04.189> you<00:04:04.430> know<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
counter to that and so you know the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.860 
counter to that and so you know the
mid-air<00:04:04.849> collision<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.329> that<00:04:05.480> counter<00:04:05.810> if

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
mid-air collision is that counter if

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.970 
mid-air collision is that counter if
we've<00:04:05.989> got<00:04:06.109> guys<00:04:06.290> if<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.590> go<00:04:06.709> up<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:06.890> make

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
we've got guys if you go up and make

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.860 
we've got guys if you go up and make
spectacular<00:04:07.189> catches<00:04:07.700> will<00:04:08.329> make<00:04:08.450> possession

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
spectacular catches will make possession

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.179 
spectacular catches will make possession
catches<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.319> want<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.709> able<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.890> counter

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
catches we want to be able to counter

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:11.710 
catches we want to be able to counter
that<00:04:10.310> by<00:04:10.370> being<00:04:10.970> able<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.239> knock<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.540> ball

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
that by being able to knock the ball

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.940 
that by being able to knock the ball
loose<00:04:11.780> and<00:04:12.109> that's<00:04:12.230> what<00:04:12.349> made<00:04:12.470> our<00:04:12.500> equations

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
loose and that's what made our equations

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.500 
loose and that's what made our equations
come<00:04:13.159> in<00:04:13.340> and<00:04:13.760> we've<00:04:13.879> done<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.030> nice<00:04:14.209> job<00:04:14.269> of

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
come in and we've done a nice job of

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:15.580 
come in and we've done a nice job of
making<00:04:14.720> sure<00:04:14.870> there's<00:04:15.200> not<00:04:15.290> a<00:04:15.349> lot<00:04:15.560> of

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
making sure there's not a lot of

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.620 
making sure there's not a lot of
penetration<00:04:16.070> in<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.699> players<00:04:16.940> one<00:04:17.299> answered

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
penetration in the players one answered

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:24.260 
penetration in the players one answered
orphanage<00:04:18.049> play<00:04:18.320> examination

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.250 

so<00:04:25.270> now<00:04:25.360> you<00:04:25.420> have<00:04:25.570> all<00:04:25.630> those<00:04:25.750> cool<00:04:25.960> tech

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
so now you have all those cool tech

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.720 
so now you have all those cool tech
backing<00:04:26.680> up<00:04:26.800> the<00:04:26.920> gameplay<00:04:27.310> at<00:04:27.490> branch

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
backing up the gameplay at branch

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.580 
backing up the gameplay at branch
animations<00:04:28.390> you<00:04:28.750> have<00:04:28.870> all-new<00:04:29.110> collision

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
animations you have all-new collision

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.170 
animations you have all-new collision
detection<00:04:29.860> so<00:04:30.160> obviously<00:04:30.520> these<00:04:30.610> guys<00:04:30.790> got<00:04:31.060> to

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
detection so obviously these guys got to

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.910 
detection so obviously these guys got to
be<00:04:31.270> smarter<00:04:31.780> second<00:04:32.050> possibly<00:04:32.500> on<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.710> field

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
be smarter second possibly on the field

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.890 
be smarter second possibly on the field
so<00:04:33.220> this<00:04:33.760> year<00:04:33.970> we've<00:04:34.390> gone<00:04:34.600> through<00:04:34.810> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
so this year we've gone through and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.360 
so this year we've gone through and
enhance<00:04:35.200> all<00:04:35.470> the<00:04:35.590> a<00:04:35.620> is<00:04:35.860> what<00:04:36.130> she<00:04:36.250> our

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
enhance all the a is what she our

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.580 
enhance all the a is what she our
cornerbacks<00:04:36.880> um<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:38.350> know<00:04:38.440> especially

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
cornerbacks um you know especially

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.620 
cornerbacks um you know especially
cornerback<00:04:39.010> play<00:04:39.130> you<00:04:39.220> can't<00:04:39.430> throw<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:40.540> know

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
cornerback play you can't throw you know

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.210 
cornerback play you can't throw you know
a<00:04:40.810> lot<00:04:41.140> of<00:04:41.200> slot<00:04:41.470> receivers<00:04:41.860> are<00:04:41.950> open<00:04:42.130> wide

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
a lot of slot receivers are open wide

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.530 
a lot of slot receivers are open wide
open<00:04:42.280> last<00:04:42.520> year<00:04:42.670> we<00:04:42.760> cut<00:04:42.940> all<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.150> stuff

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540 
open last year we cut all that stuff

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.820 
open last year we cut all that stuff
that<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:43.780> went<00:04:43.900> through<00:04:43.990> rain<00:04:44.470> pants

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
that we went through rain pants

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.050 
that we went through rain pants
everything<00:04:45.160> made<00:04:45.370> sure<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.610> all<00:04:45.790> with<00:04:45.940> the

Michael Vick and you run them back and
forth<00:05:21.670> on<00:05:21.850> sideline<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.270> couple<00:05:22.540> of<00:05:22.600> times<00:05:22.690> in

the<00:05:22.930> pocket<00:05:23.320> you're<00:05:23.680> gonna<00:05:23.800> be<00:05:23.980> more<00:05:24.160> tired

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
the pocket you're gonna be more tired

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.340 
the pocket you're gonna be more tired
than<00:05:24.520> next<00:05:24.730> play<00:05:24.910> we've<00:05:25.750> made<00:05:25.960> sure<00:05:25.990> we've

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 
than next play we've made sure we've

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:27.480 
than next play we've made sure we've
added<00:05:26.500> things<00:05:26.710> like<00:05:26.830> animations<00:05:27.460> that

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
added things like animations that

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.550 
added things like animations that
actually<00:05:27.820> show<00:05:28.030> off<00:05:28.270> that<00:05:28.600> a<00:05:28.960> player's<00:05:29.230> tired

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
actually show off that a player's tired

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.380 
actually show off that a player's tired
so<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:30.400> run<00:05:30.550> a<00:05:30.580> player's<00:05:30.820> a<00:05:30.910> few<00:05:31.060> times<00:05:31.270> you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:31.390 
so you run a player's a few times you

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.790 
so you run a player's a few times you
can<00:05:31.510> see<00:05:31.660> them<00:05:31.810> come<00:05:31.960> back<00:05:32.140> on<00:05:32.290> a<00:05:32.350> story<00:05:32.680> with

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
can see them come back on a story with

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.860 
can see them come back on a story with
more<00:05:33.010> slow<00:05:33.220> down<00:05:33.820> they've<00:05:34.360> added<00:05:34.630> some<00:05:34.660> nice

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
more slow down they've added some nice

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.000 
more slow down they've added some nice
rest<00:05:35.110> animations<00:05:35.650> where<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.830> guys<00:05:35.980> are

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010

much

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:46.320 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.390 

then<00:05:47.320> it's<00:05:47.650> fatigue<00:05:47.920> system<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.280> actually

then it's fatigue system is actually

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.790 
then it's fatigue system is actually
