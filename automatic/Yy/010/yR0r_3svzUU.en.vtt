source<00:00:03.810> so<00:00:04.319> my<00:00:04.440> last<00:00:04.620> video<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:04.950> talked<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.430> a

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
source so my last video I talked about a

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.280 
source so my last video I talked about a
tarball<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.509> lot<00:00:06.660> of<00:00:06.690> people<00:00:07.020> are<00:00:07.140> like

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
tarball and a lot of people are like

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.930 
tarball and a lot of people are like
what<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.040> don't<00:00:08.280> want<00:00:08.550> to<00:00:08.610> be<00:00:08.700> tarred

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
what is that I don't want to be tarred

what is that I don't want to be tarred
and<00:00:09.090> feathered<00:00:09.179> when<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.900> trying<00:00:10.080> to

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
and feathered when I was trying to

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.310 
and feathered when I was trying to
compute<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.240> actually<00:00:12.240> it's<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.690> lot<00:00:13.019> cooler

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
compute and actually it's a lot cooler

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.440 
compute and actually it's a lot cooler
than<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.740> sounds<00:00:14.160> it's<00:00:14.460> archiving<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.360> I'm

powerful<00:00:33.660> let's<00:00:34.620> break<00:00:34.829> up<00:00:35.010> those<00:00:35.190> options

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
powerful let's break up those options

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.729 
powerful let's break up those options
into<00:00:35.820> two<00:00:36.059> groups<00:00:36.360> function<00:00:37.110> driven<00:00:37.500> and

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
into two groups function driven and

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.369 
into two groups function driven and
electives<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:39.030> start<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.420> using<00:00:39.570> only<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.230> of

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
electives we start by using only one of

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
electives we start by using only one of
the<00:00:40.500> five<00:00:40.739> function<00:00:41.250> options<00:00:41.610> because

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
the five function options because

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.360 
the five function options because
they're<00:00:42.120> mandatory<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> I'm<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> right

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
they're mandatory so I'm in the right

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the files in the archive so now we know

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
the files in the archive so now we know
about<00:01:11.159> function<00:01:11.729> options<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.360> we<00:01:12.510> must<00:01:12.540> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
about function options and we must use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
about function options and we must use
one<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.159> them<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.180> move

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
one and only one of them so we can move

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
one and only one of them so we can move
on<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.750> elective<00:01:16.259> options<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.890> extra

on to the elective options the extra
stuff<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:18.060> add<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:18.720> options<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
stuff we can add all of these options in

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.620 
stuff we can add all of these options in
our<00:01:19.320> command<00:01:19.680> line<00:01:19.740> at<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.220> same<00:01:20.610> time<00:01:21.210> F

of what's going on in Z deals with

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.980 
of what's going on in Z deals with
compressions<00:01:32.850> it'll<00:01:33.210> run<00:01:33.390> gun<00:01:33.600> zip<00:01:33.840> to

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
compressions it'll run gun zip to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.300 
compressions it'll run gun zip to
uncompressed<00:01:34.560> files<00:01:34.829> while<00:01:35.130> you're

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
uncompressed files while you're

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
uncompressed files while you're
extracting<00:01:35.640> them<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.150> gzip<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> compress<00:01:37.049> the

extracting them in gzip to compress the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.920 
extracting them in gzip to compress the
files<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.040> they're<00:01:38.220> added<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> archive<00:01:39.060> so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
files as they're added to the archive so

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.560 
files as they're added to the archive so
let's<00:01:40.110> give<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.470> shot<00:01:40.759> like<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.909> said<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.420> want

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
let's give it a shot like I said we want

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
let's give it a shot like I said we want
to<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.810> tar<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> main<00:01:43.890> command<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.790> then

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
to do tar with the main command and then

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.069 
to do tar with the main command and then

purposes I'm just going to create a new

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.490 
purposes I'm just going to create a new
folder<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.759> drag<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.509> tar<00:02:07.750> ball<00:02:07.990> into<00:02:08.319> that

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
folder and drag the tar ball into that

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.479 
folder and drag the tar ball into that
and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:10.090> enter<00:02:10.569> tar<00:02:10.929> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.280> shows<00:02:12.459> the

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
and then enter tar and then it shows the

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.729 
and then enter tar and then it shows the
file<00:02:12.790> names<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.209> what<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:13.510> extracted<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.260> the

the end of the file name just
automatically<00:02:32.739> it<00:02:33.220> means<00:02:33.489> can<00:02:33.700> use<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.120> and

just like that gun zip will uncompress

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.300 
just like that gun zip will uncompress
and<00:02:36.790> take<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> GZ<00:02:37.480> extension<00:02:38.110> away<00:02:38.349> but<00:02:39.130> what

and take the GZ extension away but what

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.100 
and take the GZ extension away but what
happens<00:02:39.610> if<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.819> compress<00:02:40.209> a<00:02:40.269> file<00:02:40.569> too<00:02:40.780> early

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110
