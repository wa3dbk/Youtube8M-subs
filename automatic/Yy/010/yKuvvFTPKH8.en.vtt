00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
want to demonstrate this technique to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.710 
want to demonstrate this technique to
you<00:02:11.060> we've<00:02:11.810> talked<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.260> lot<00:02:12.290> about<00:02:12.799> the<00:02:13.720> knit

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
you we've talked a lot about the knit

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.809 
you we've talked a lot about the knit
stitch<00:02:15.019> and<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.500> being<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:16.159> knit<00:02:16.400> side<00:02:16.610> of

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
stitch and this being the knit side of

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.179 
stitch and this being the knit side of
stockinette<00:02:17.209> being<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.989> series<00:02:18.349> of<00:02:18.379> V's<00:02:18.799> and

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
stockinette being a series of V's and

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.830 
stockinette being a series of V's and
that's<00:02:19.700> we're<00:02:19.969> going<00:02:20.209> to<00:02:20.299> work<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.659> now

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
that's we're going to work with now

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.000 
that's we're going to work with now
duplicate<00:02:21.529> stitch

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
duplicate stitch

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.300 
duplicate stitch
is<00:02:22.069> really<00:02:22.400> just<00:02:22.909> a<00:02:23.150> way<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.629> copying<00:02:24.310> exactly

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
is really just a way of copying exactly

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.420 
is really just a way of copying exactly
the<00:02:25.459> way<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.790> knit<00:02:25.939> stitch<00:02:26.180> looks<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:28.280> it's<00:02:28.400> a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the way the knit stitch looks see it's a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.979 
the way the knit stitch looks see it's a
series<00:02:28.730> of<00:02:28.790> these<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.510> just<00:02:29.629> happens<00:02:29.930> to

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
series of these and it just happens to

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.740 
series of these and it just happens to
be<00:02:30.079> in<00:02:30.200> a<00:02:30.349> pattern<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> first<00:02:32.390> thing<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.689> do

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
be in a pattern so the first thing I do

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.050 
be in a pattern so the first thing I do
is<00:02:32.989> I<00:02:33.140> come<00:02:33.590> from<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.829> back<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.340> I<00:02:34.430> come<00:02:34.700> in<00:02:34.909> at

there but not too much so there's the

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.250 
there but not too much so there's the
first<00:02:49.790> V<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.090> came<00:02:50.420> at<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.629> bottom<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.019> VI

at B and I go through both legs of the V
above<00:02:54.709> it<00:02:55.690> pull<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:56.840> through<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.470> I<00:02:57.709> watch

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
above it pull that through and I watch

the same hole I came out of tada

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.910 
the same hole I came out of tada
we<00:03:04.790> have<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:04.909> V<00:03:05.560> now<00:03:06.560> I'm<00:03:06.620> going<00:03:06.739> to<00:03:06.799> keep

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
we have a V now I'm going to keep

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740 
we have a V now I'm going to keep
traveling<00:03:07.190> up<00:03:07.459> here<00:03:07.670> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:07.790> bit<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.239> could

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
traveling up here a little bit I could

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.780 
traveling up here a little bit I could
come<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.200> at<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.590> bottom<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.069> the<00:03:10.159> V<00:03:10.370> right

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
come in at the bottom of the V right

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.970 
come in at the bottom of the V right
here<00:03:13.510> skip<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.720> V<00:03:14.780> and<00:03:15.230> go<00:03:15.590> through<00:03:15.829> both

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
here skip that V and go through both

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.190 
here skip that V and go through both
legs<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.639> the<00:03:16.670> V<00:03:16.819> above<00:03:19.299> watching<00:03:20.299> my<00:03:20.690> tension

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
legs of the V above watching my tension

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.660 
legs of the V above watching my tension
especially<00:03:21.650> cuz<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.829> have<00:03:21.950> double<00:03:22.280> thick<00:03:22.519> yarn

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
especially cuz I have double thick yarn

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.520 
especially cuz I have double thick yarn
you<00:03:22.879> see<00:03:23.150> you<00:03:23.750> might<00:03:23.900> have<00:03:24.019> seen<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.349> one<00:03:24.500> of

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
you see you might have seen that one of

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.439 
you see you might have seen that one of
those<00:03:24.709> strands<00:03:25.220> kind<00:03:25.519> of<00:03:25.609> looped<00:03:26.000> up<00:03:26.269> on

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
those strands kind of looped up on

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.569 
those strands kind of looped up on
itself<00:03:26.780> so<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.049> just<00:03:27.230> tightened<00:03:27.560> it<00:03:27.620> up<00:03:27.739> I<00:03:27.949> go

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
itself so I just tightened it up I go

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.220 
itself so I just tightened it up I go
back<00:03:28.760> down<00:03:28.970> into<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.299> same<00:03:29.480> hole<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.750> came<00:03:29.870> out

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
back down into the same hole I came out

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.979 
back down into the same hole I came out
of<00:03:31.000> tighten<00:03:32.000> that<00:03:32.120> up<00:03:34.269> watching<00:03:35.269> my<00:03:35.569> tension

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
of tighten that up watching my tension

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.960 
of tighten that up watching my tension
the<00:03:36.079> whole<00:03:36.109> time<00:03:36.549> okay<00:03:37.549> there<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.760> have<00:03:37.940> a

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
the whole time okay there I have a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.520 
the whole time okay there I have a
couple<00:03:38.209> of<00:03:38.419> these<00:03:38.569> I<00:03:38.780> can<00:03:38.840> keep<00:03:39.139> doing<00:03:39.169> this

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
couple of these I can keep doing this

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.069 
couple of these I can keep doing this
and<00:03:40.000> my<00:03:41.000> favorite<00:03:41.359> way<00:03:41.449> to<00:03:41.480> duplicate<00:03:41.959> stitch

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
and my favorite way to duplicate stitch

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.830 
and my favorite way to duplicate stitch
is<00:03:42.349> actually<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.769> travel<00:03:43.129> up<00:03:43.280> like<00:03:43.579> this<00:03:43.849> which

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
is actually to travel up like this which

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.330 
is actually to travel up like this which
is<00:03:44.959> why<00:03:45.079> I'm<00:03:45.169> demonstrating<00:03:45.769> it<00:03:45.859> this<00:03:45.980> way<00:03:46.160> but

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
is why I'm demonstrating it this way but

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.349 
is why I'm demonstrating it this way but
when<00:03:46.400> you're<00:03:46.519> doing<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.790> pattern<00:03:46.970> of<00:03:47.180> course

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
when you're doing a pattern of course

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.089 
when you're doing a pattern of course
you<00:03:47.480> probably<00:03:47.750> have<00:03:47.900> to<00:03:48.019> go<00:03:48.169> different

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
you probably have to go different

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.539 
you probably have to go different
directions<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:50.000> do<00:03:50.239> find<00:03:50.599> it<00:03:50.690> easier<00:03:50.959> easier

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
directions I do find it easier easier

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.520 
directions I do find it easier easier
easiest<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:53.599> start<00:03:53.840> at<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:53.989> bottom<00:03:54.169> of<00:03:54.470> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
easiest to start at the bottom of a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.809 
easiest to start at the bottom of a
motif<00:03:54.829> and<00:03:55.040> work<00:03:55.190> my<00:03:55.340> way<00:03:55.370> up<00:03:57.069> okay<00:03:58.069> so<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.549> have

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
motif and work my way up okay so I have

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.599 
motif and work my way up okay so I have
a<00:03:58.849> few<00:03:59.090> stitches<00:03:59.299> there<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.160> I<00:04:01.160> can<00:04:01.340> very

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
a few stitches there and I can very

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:05.710 
a few stitches there and I can very
easily<00:04:01.910> travel<00:04:02.980> to<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.129> left<00:04:04.629> using<00:04:05.629> the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
easily travel to the left using the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:11.759 
easily travel to the left using the
exact<00:04:06.049> same<00:04:06.079> thing<00:04:07.269> and<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:10.220> can<00:04:10.519> travel<00:04:10.909> down

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
exact same thing and I can travel down

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.020 
exact same thing and I can travel down
although<00:04:12.769> it's<00:04:13.010> not<00:04:13.159> my<00:04:13.310> favorite<00:04:13.669> way<00:04:13.790> to<00:04:13.819> do

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
although it's not my favorite way to do

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.750 
although it's not my favorite way to do
it<00:04:14.150> because<00:04:14.299> I<00:04:14.480> have<00:04:14.919> all<00:04:15.919> of<00:04:16.400> these<00:04:16.519> stitches

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
it because I have all of these stitches

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.040 
it because I have all of these stitches
to<00:04:17.030> go<00:04:17.180> through

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.050 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.790 

okay<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.440> that's<00:04:23.560> duplicate<00:04:24.130> stitch<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:24.760> once

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
okay so that's duplicate stitch and once

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.050 
okay so that's duplicate stitch and once
you<00:04:26.800> watch<00:04:26.979> your<00:04:27.190> tension<00:04:27.340> as<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.729> do<00:04:27.850> it<00:04:27.970> but

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
you watch your tension as you do it but

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.790 
you watch your tension as you do it but
once<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.330> apply<00:04:28.690> a<00:04:28.720> little<00:04:29.020> steam<00:04:29.260> to<00:04:29.410> this<00:04:29.560> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
once you apply a little steam to this it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.350 
once you apply a little steam to this it
does<00:04:30.040> even<00:04:30.280> things<00:04:30.669> out<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.030> make<00:04:31.210> it<00:04:31.240> look

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
does even things out and make it look

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.700 
does even things out and make it look
even<00:04:31.600> better<00:04:31.780> than<00:04:32.199> when<00:04:32.889> it's<00:04:33.040> first<00:04:33.250> done<00:04:34.710> so

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
even better than when it's first done so

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.740 
even better than when it's first done so
pick<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.010> motif<00:04:36.460> and<00:04:36.760> embroider<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.449> to<00:04:37.630> the

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
pick a motif and embroider it to the

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.900 
pick a motif and embroider it to the
front<00:04:38.020> and<00:04:38.290> make<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.949> sweater<00:04:39.190> your<00:04:39.400> own<00:04:39.580> I

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
front and make the sweater your own I

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.550 
front and make the sweater your own I
think<00:04:40.330> this<00:04:40.600> will<00:04:40.660> make<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.840> really<00:04:41.080> good<00:04:41.320> baby

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
think this will make a really good baby

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.100 
think this will make a really good baby
