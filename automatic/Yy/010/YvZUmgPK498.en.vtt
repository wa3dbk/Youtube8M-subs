normal DS type plastic here oh yeah
there<00:00:52.949> we<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:54.469> it<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.829> like<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:57.920> well<00:00:58.920> it's

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there we go it is not like a well it's

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.149 
there we go it is not like a well it's
it's<00:00:59.250> pretty<00:00:59.579> much<00:00:59.699> like<00:00:59.760> a<00:01:00.859> standard<00:01:01.859> DS<00:01:02.809> case

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
it's pretty much like a standard DS case

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.340 
it's pretty much like a standard DS case
but<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.610> plastic<00:01:07.970> plastic<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.299> white<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.810> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
but the plastic plastic is white like a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
but the plastic plastic is white like a
weak<00:01:10.680> ace<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.760> lighter<00:01:15.030> I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
weak ace and it's it's much lighter I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.499 
weak ace and it's it's much lighter I
don't<00:01:16.259> want<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.439> call<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.650> flimsy<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> know

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
don't want to call it flimsy you know

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.420 
don't want to call it flimsy you know
because<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.840> 3ds<00:01:19.170> cases<00:01:19.500> were<00:01:19.650> extra<00:01:20.130> extra

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
because the 3ds cases were extra extra

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.580 
because the 3ds cases were extra extra
tough<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.890> wow<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.840> kind<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.290> flimsy

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.530 
that's pretty much the only difference
between<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
between that and

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:21.420 
between that and
a<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:20.379> pretty<00:02:20.650> much<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.920> only<00:02:20.950> difference

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
a you pretty much the only difference

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.380 
a you pretty much the only difference
between<00:02:21.519> that<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.540> DS<00:02:23.530> card<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.189> that<00:02:24.659> nib

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
between that and a DS card is that nib

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.229 
between that and a DS card is that nib
see<00:02:28.680> pretty<00:02:29.680> much<00:02:29.829> the<00:02:29.920> same<00:02:30.099> deal<00:02:30.400> pins<00:02:31.060> on

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
see pretty much the same deal pins on

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.050 
see pretty much the same deal pins on
the<00:02:31.299> back<00:02:32.069> essentially<00:02:33.069> essentially<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the back essentially essentially the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.809 
the back essentially essentially the
same<00:02:34.269> type<00:02:34.569> of<00:02:34.950> SD<00:02:35.950> card<00:02:36.189> that<00:02:36.400> you<00:02:36.489> would<00:02:36.609> put

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
same type of SD card that you would put

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.429 
same type of SD card that you would put
into<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.269> digital<00:02:37.870> camera<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:38.709> it's<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:40.439> certain

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:41.439 
into a digital camera but it's a certain

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:46.949 
into a digital camera but it's a certain
shape<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.879> know<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.060> be<00:02:43.239> proprietary<00:02:44.609> so<00:02:45.959> okay

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
shape you know to be proprietary so okay

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.289 
shape you know to be proprietary so okay
so<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.290> chip<00:02:47.500> rests<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.010> here<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.430> as

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
so the chip rests in here and as

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.690 
so the chip rests in here and as
expected<00:02:49.480> there<00:02:50.019> is<00:02:50.439> no<00:02:50.680> slot<00:02:51.069> for<00:02:51.340> your<00:02:51.459> GBA

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
expected there is no slot for your GBA

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.929 
expected there is no slot for your GBA
game<00:02:52.290> above<00:02:53.290> there<00:02:53.560> you<00:02:54.519> know<00:02:54.579> it<00:02:54.730> kind<00:02:54.879> of

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
game above there you know it kind of

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:55.800 
game above there you know it kind of
makes<00:02:55.060> me<00:02:55.180> feel<00:02:55.329> like<00:02:55.389> they<00:02:55.629> should<00:02:55.659> have

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
makes me feel like they should have

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.819 
makes me feel like they should have
centered<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:57.430> know<00:02:58.319> they<00:02:59.319> didn't<00:02:59.590> sender

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829 
centered it you know they didn't sender

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:06.379 
centered it you know they didn't sender
it's<00:02:59.980> just<00:03:00.099> in<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.280> same<00:03:00.930> lower<00:03:02.849> place<00:03:03.849> that
