we're<00:01:52.280> using<00:01:52.310> basmati<00:01:53.119> rice<00:01:53.299> which<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:53.960> an

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
we're using basmati rice which is an

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.109 
we're using basmati rice which is an
Indian<00:01:54.590> I<00:01:54.890> believe<00:01:55.790> it's<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:57.759> one<00:01:58.759> cup<00:01:58.970> of<00:01:59.000> rice

put<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.930> a<00:02:00.020> pot<00:02:00.229> 2<00:02:01.009> cups<00:02:01.430> chicken<00:02:01.820> broth

put it in a pot 2 cups chicken broth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.280 
put it in a pot 2 cups chicken broth

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.140 
because it just adds a little more
flavor<00:02:03.650> to<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.040> rice<00:02:04.220> so<00:02:04.759> we're<00:02:04.909> just<00:02:04.939> going
