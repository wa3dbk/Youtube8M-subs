about<00:01:29.520> 70<00:01:30.150> feet<00:01:30.330> we've<00:01:30.780> reviewed<00:01:31.260> the<00:01:31.470> boom<00:01:31.650> Co

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
about 70 feet we've reviewed the boom Co

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.320 
about 70 feet we've reviewed the boom Co
before<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.400> we'll<00:01:32.520> have<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> link<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.150> in

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
before and we'll have a link to it in

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.520 
before and we'll have a link to it in
this<00:01:33.420> video<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.170> how<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.290> boom

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
this video so you can see how the boom

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.140 
this video so you can see how the boom
Co<00:01:34.770> works<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.030> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
Co works this is just kind of a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.700 
Co works this is just kind of a
different<00:01:36.299> mechanism<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.080> those<00:01:37.229> barrels

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
different mechanism with those barrels

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.950 
different mechanism with those barrels
battery<00:01:38.430> operated<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.180> shoots<00:01:39.390> off<00:01:39.540> those<00:01:39.720> 10

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
battery operated so shoots off those 10

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.140 
battery operated so shoots off those 10
darts<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.010> do<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.369> pump<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.820> move<00:01:42.000> over

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
darts then you do one pump you move over

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.090 
darts then you do one pump you move over
to<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> next<00:01:42.630> barrel<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.259> another<00:01:43.470> pump<00:01:43.830> move

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
to the next barrel do another pump move

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.740 
to the next barrel do another pump move
to<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.340> third<00:01:44.580> barrel<00:01:44.820> so<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> pump<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.600> only

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
to the third barrel so the pump is only

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.170 
to the third barrel so the pump is only
to<00:01:45.960> switch<00:01:46.170> barrels<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.040> battery<00:01:47.460> operated

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
to switch barrels but battery operated

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.359 
to switch barrels but battery operated
in<00:01:48.420> terms<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.869> blasting<00:01:49.380> has<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.979> smart

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
in terms of the blasting has that smart

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.969 
in terms of the blasting has that smart
