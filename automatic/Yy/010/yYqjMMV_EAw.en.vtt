00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.170 

I<00:00:02.330> think<00:00:03.330> that<00:00:03.799> sport<00:00:04.799> has<00:00:05.040> changed<00:00:06.029> and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
I think that sport has changed and

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.049 
I think that sport has changed and
evolved<00:00:06.720> so<00:00:07.049> much<00:00:07.109> their<00:00:07.790> fighters<00:00:08.790> are<00:00:08.910> more

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
evolved so much their fighters are more

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.509 
evolved so much their fighters are more
robotic<00:00:09.420> now<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:10.769> what<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:10.950> mean<00:00:11.099> by<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the UFC do well personally I feel boxing

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.380 
the UFC do well personally I feel boxing
is<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> much<00:02:31.770> stronger<00:02:32.160> sport<00:02:32.670> it's<00:02:33.120> got<00:02:33.270> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
is the much stronger sport it's got the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.280 
is the much stronger sport it's got the
stronger<00:02:33.720> traditions<00:02:34.290> it's<00:02:34.680> got<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:36.030> me<00:02:36.290> it's

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
stronger traditions it's got for me it's

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.740 
stronger traditions it's got for me it's
got<00:02:37.470> something<00:02:37.710> different<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.340> UFC<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.540> I

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
got something different to UFC but I

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.810 
got something different to UFC but I
understand<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.350> appeal<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.650> UFC<00:02:41.220> from<00:02:41.730> a

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
understand the appeal of UFC from a

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.790 
understand the appeal of UFC from a
young<00:02:41.970> person's<00:02:42.420> perspective<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.680> on

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
young person's perspective and on and on
