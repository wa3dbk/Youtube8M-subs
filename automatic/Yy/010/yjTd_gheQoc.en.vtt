00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
to manually focus so if you manually

to manually focus so if you manually
focus<00:05:03.680> your<00:05:03.800> shots<00:05:04.070> the<00:05:04.639> larger<00:05:05.530> viewfinder

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
focus your shots the larger viewfinder

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.029 
focus your shots the larger viewfinder
on<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.770> d600<00:05:07.190> might<00:05:07.580> be<00:05:07.699> useful<00:05:07.910> for<00:05:08.300> you

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
on the d600 might be useful for you

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.499 
on the d600 might be useful for you
because<00:05:10.039> it<00:05:10.310> just<00:05:10.669> allows<00:05:11.000> you<00:05:11.120> to<00:05:11.240> see<00:05:11.330> that<00:05:11.479> a

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
because it just allows you to see that a

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.020 
because it just allows you to see that a
little<00:05:11.599> bit<00:05:11.780> more<00:05:11.930> detail<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:13.490> more<00:05:13.699> brightly

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
little bit more detail and more brightly

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.439 
little bit more detail and more brightly
as<00:05:14.270> well<00:05:14.479> I<00:05:15.259> must<00:05:15.979> admit<00:05:16.099> if<00:05:16.520> I'm<00:05:17.000> manually

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
as well I must admit if I'm manually

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.270 
as well I must admit if I'm manually
focusing<00:05:17.960> I'm<00:05:18.110> probably<00:05:18.380> doing<00:05:18.560> a<00:05:18.740> landscape

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
focusing I'm probably doing a landscape

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
focusing I'm probably doing a landscape
in<00:05:19.520> which<00:05:19.759> case<00:05:20.270> RB<00:05:21.050> I<00:05:21.910> what<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:22.940> do<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.210> I

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
in which case RB I what I do is I

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.050 
in which case RB I what I do is I
compose<00:05:23.720> through<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.080> viewfinder<00:05:24.289> and<00:05:25.060> then

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
compose through the viewfinder and then

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.750 
compose through the viewfinder and then
I<00:05:26.240> check<00:05:27.080> critical<00:05:27.590> focus<00:05:27.979> through<00:05:28.340> live<00:05:28.520> view

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
I check critical focus through live view

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.790 
I check critical focus through live view
and<00:05:28.880> I<00:05:29.570> will<00:05:29.690> be<00:05:29.780> manually<00:05:30.139> focusing<00:05:30.560> if<00:05:30.680> I'm

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
and I will be manually focusing if I'm

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.320 
and I will be manually focusing if I'm
doing<00:05:31.070> that<00:05:31.099> so<00:05:31.550> I<00:05:31.580> don't<00:05:31.669> tend<00:05:32.030> to<00:05:32.060> manually

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
doing that so I don't tend to manually

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.939 
doing that so I don't tend to manually
focus<00:05:32.449> through<00:05:32.930> the<00:05:33.020> viewfinder<00:05:33.229> so<00:05:33.620> I'm<00:05:33.770> not

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
focus through the viewfinder so I'm not

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.620 
focus through the viewfinder so I'm not
not<00:05:34.250> particularly<00:05:34.669> important<00:05:35.090> to<00:05:35.210> me<00:05:35.240> but<00:05:35.539> it

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
not particularly important to me but it

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.490 
not particularly important to me but it
might<00:05:35.659> be<00:05:35.960> to<00:05:36.080> some<00:05:36.260> of<00:05:36.409> you<00:05:38.020> that<00:05:39.020> is<00:05:39.229> really

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
might be to some of you that is really

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.020 
might be to some of you that is really
it<00:05:39.919> they're<00:05:40.220> very<00:05:40.250> similar<00:05:40.940> camera<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:43.030> d70

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
it they're very similar camera the d70

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.830 
it they're very similar camera the d70
100

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
100

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.390 
100
it<00:05:44.960> just<00:05:45.169> feels<00:05:45.380> slightly<00:05:45.710> smaller<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.310> the

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
it just feels slightly smaller in the

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.790 
it just feels slightly smaller in the
hand<00:05:46.960> slightly<00:05:47.960> lighter<00:05:50.020> it<00:05:51.020> just<00:05:51.289> it<00:05:51.560> fits

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
hand slightly lighter it just it fits

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.790 
hand slightly lighter it just it fits
very<00:05:51.889> comfortably<00:05:52.250> I've<00:05:53.030> got<00:05:53.270> probably<00:05:54.050> mmm

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 
very comfortably I've got probably mmm

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.909 
very comfortably I've got probably mmm
average-sized<00:05:55.550> hands<00:05:55.820> maybe<00:05:56.060> slightly<00:05:56.389> small

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
average-sized hands maybe slightly small

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.100 
average-sized hands maybe slightly small
and<00:05:57.919> it<00:05:58.099> fits<00:05:58.310> very<00:05:58.490> comfortably<00:05:58.610> in<00:05:59.030> that<00:05:59.270> and

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
and it fits very comfortably in that and

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.499 
and it fits very comfortably in that and
again<00:06:01.039> it<00:06:01.159> is<00:06:01.280> quite<00:06:01.729> light<00:06:02.560> I'm<00:06:03.560> coming<00:06:04.009> from

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
again it is quite light I'm coming from

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:08.409 
again it is quite light I'm coming from
various<00:06:05.509> canons<00:06:05.990> and<00:06:06.199> I've<00:06:06.470> also<00:06:06.650> shots<00:06:07.130> a<00:06:07.460> OMD

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
various canons and I've also shots a OMD

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.740 
various canons and I've also shots a OMD
am<00:06:09.020> 5<00:06:09.289> recently<00:06:09.740> so<00:06:10.610> obviously<00:06:10.880> not<00:06:11.509> as<00:06:11.599> light

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
am 5 recently so obviously not as light

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.830 
am 5 recently so obviously not as light
as<00:06:11.870> that<00:06:12.050> it<00:06:12.409> doesn't<00:06:12.740> feel<00:06:12.919> bulky

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
as that it doesn't feel bulky

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.760 
as that it doesn't feel bulky
comfortable<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.960> carry<00:06:15.139> all<00:06:15.289> day<00:06:15.470> I<00:06:15.500> would

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
comfortable to carry all day I would

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.170 
comfortable to carry all day I would
imagine<00:06:15.979> but<00:06:16.340> I'll<00:06:16.460> let<00:06:16.610> you<00:06:16.699> know<00:06:16.729> about<00:06:16.909> that

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
imagine but I'll let you know about that

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.860 
imagine but I'll let you know about that
the<00:06:17.810> d600<00:06:18.380> definitely<00:06:19.099> does<00:06:19.280> have<00:06:19.490> a<00:06:19.909> bit<00:06:20.690> more

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
the d600 definitely does have a bit more

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.550 
the d600 definitely does have a bit more
weight<00:06:21.050> behind<00:06:21.229> it

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:23.560 
weight behind it

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.659 
weight behind it
the<00:06:24.560> grip<00:06:25.250> feels<00:06:25.520> slightly<00:06:26.289> taller<00:06:27.289> from<00:06:27.889> from

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:28.669 
the grip feels slightly taller from from

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.800 
the grip feels slightly taller from from
here<00:06:28.880> to<00:06:29.120> here<00:06:29.330> just<00:06:29.419> feel<00:06:29.870> slightly<00:06:30.380> taller

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
here to here just feel slightly taller

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.790 
here to here just feel slightly taller
probably<00:06:32.810> a<00:06:32.840> little<00:06:32.990> bit<00:06:33.139> better<00:06:33.320> if<00:06:33.620> you've

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
probably a little bit better if you've

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.720 
probably a little bit better if you've
got<00:06:34.039> larger<00:06:34.700> hands<00:06:35.409> but<00:06:36.409> generally<00:06:36.919> the

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:37.730 
got larger hands but generally the

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:39.280 
got larger hands but generally the
very<00:06:38.000> similar<00:06:38.360> I'll<00:06:38.510> feel<00:06:38.720> very<00:06:39.020> comfortable

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:39.290 
very similar I'll feel very comfortable

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.250 
very similar I'll feel very comfortable
switching<00:06:40.100> from<00:06:40.400> this<00:06:41.030> camera<00:06:41.390> to<00:06:42.140> this

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
switching from this camera to this

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.650 
switching from this camera to this
camera<00:06:43.330> I<00:06:44.330> don't<00:06:45.260> think<00:06:45.530> you'll<00:06:45.770> be<00:06:46.660> get

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
camera I don't think you'll be get

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.530 
camera I don't think you'll be get
confused<00:06:48.110> with<00:06:48.290> settings<00:06:48.710> etc<00:06:48.890> you<00:06:49.340> know

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
confused with settings etc you know

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.670 
confused with settings etc you know
they're<00:06:50.540> very<00:06:50.570> similar<00:06:51.020> you<00:06:51.170> can<00:06:51.290> set<00:06:51.470> them<00:06:51.620> up

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
they're very similar you can set them up

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.500 
they're very similar you can set them up
in<00:06:51.770> a<00:06:51.860> very<00:06:51.980> similar<00:06:52.280> way<00:06:52.520> you<00:06:52.910> can<00:06:53.150> see<00:06:53.360> that

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:53.510 
in a very similar way you can see that

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.150 
in a very similar way you can see that
the<00:06:53.660> light<00:06:54.020> has<00:06:54.200> come<00:06:54.260> on<00:06:54.350> the<00:06:54.500> LCD<00:06:54.740> there

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:55.160 
the light has come on the LCD there

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.710 
the light has come on the LCD there
that's<00:06:55.640> just<00:06:55.910> by<00:06:56.030> flicking<00:06:56.300> there<00:06:57.820> okay<00:06:58.820> so

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
that's just by flicking there okay so

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.550 
that's just by flicking there okay so
there<00:06:59.840> you<00:06:59.870> go<00:06:59.990> that's<00:07:00.110> a<00:07:00.230> quick<00:07:00.380> comparison

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
there you go that's a quick comparison

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
there you go that's a quick comparison
off<00:07:01.010> the<00:07:01.220> Nikon<00:07:01.690> d600<00:07:02.690> and<00:07:02.840> d70<00:07:03.680> 100<00:07:03.830> just<00:07:04.430> the

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
off the Nikon d600 and d70 100 just the

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.470 
off the Nikon d600 and d70 100 just the
physical<00:07:05.270> comparison<00:07:05.840> I'm<00:07:06.080> going<00:07:07.010> to<00:07:07.160> do<00:07:07.480> an

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480 
physical comparison I'm going to do an
