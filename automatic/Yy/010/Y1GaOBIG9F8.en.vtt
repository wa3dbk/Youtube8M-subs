00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.319
 hello everyone today this will be and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.360
 small video again about household repairs 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.730
 technology 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.799
 autumn came cold outside the window cold 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.949
 the heating season has not started yet 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.220
 or by getting their heaters with 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 last year on not all heaters 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.580
 cut years and here is one sufferer 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.880
 let's complain that 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:36.840
 demonstrate the fan is spinning but 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 there is no warm hot air 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.090
 let's see how to solve this problem is 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.149
 very typical malfunction at all 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.170
 such like windmill ah I'm already 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.280
 unscrewed in advance so as not to lose the moon 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.440
 let's see what it consists of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.829
 everything is very simple thermostat 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.530
 assembled too on bimetallic 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.370
 plate next comes the switch 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.710
 which the 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 there are four off positions 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.600
 cold air at 2 degrees of heating 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 smaller and bigger and after that 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.770
 switch contacts go on 2 spirals 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.009
 and everything is very simple on the fan 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 can break it first this here 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.880
 bimetal plate but usually 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.729
 it does not break with her just sometimes 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.860
 contacts burn and no contact as 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.350
 check it out 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:38.490
 we take the tester switch mode dialing 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.439
 there is so on switch but if he 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.490
 we are most likely involved in it 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:48.180
 works and that the third note 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.840
 here on this node on 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 so to speak dress with heaters 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.710
 two elements are installed first this too 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.890
 such a kind of thermal contact which 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:06.390
 at overheating of air inside if suddenly 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.670
 the heater will fall either to him or her 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.560
 will cover to contact our overheating 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 connect and 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.830
 the helix will not work accordingly 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.920
 no second fire 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.790
 thermal fuse not 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 recovering that is standing here 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 120 degree thermal fuse 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.560
 if the temperature rises above 120 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 He dammed and often because 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.930
 the device most often happen exactly 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.489
 what is going through this topic 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.709
 fuse check is very simple 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.519
 everything is also a dial tone device 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:48.840
 touch the tester and there is some 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.010
 resistance but it is resistance 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 spiral trip 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.510
 anything is necessary here everything is clearly nothing 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.769
 no 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.569
 hence the glow thermal fuse 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.849
 just need to be replaced 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:14.130
 very simply replacing this one myself 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:17.209
 Heater unit with fan can be 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.489
 unscrew need to unscrew this screw 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.120
 open the cap here 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.730
 unscrew it off and then there will be more 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.410
 easy access to this 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.060
 fuse here he riveted but his 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.700
 you can just bite off 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.709
 and solder him on these contacts new 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.079
 can be understood safely because 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.359
 the temperature does not exceed 120 degrees and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.010
 and the solder will not melt it melts 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:43.440
 somewhere at a temperature of 200 so 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.690
 spike will hold well to check 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.579
 really it is he or not can here with 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.549
 remove this terminal 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:54.239
 and switch to the next terminal so 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.230
 we go around this fuse and 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.150
 can we include moisture try 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.370
 use caution in this form 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.459
 try not to be more accurate do not try not to 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.450
 touch don't touch any here 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:09.630
 heating and leading parts only 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.660
 Now we will briefly put on 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:17.000
 heating power 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:20.030
 and turn on all ruined 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 and went type he say max when warm 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:26.930
 you feel everything works 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.060
 no need to change the fuse 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.630
 give the client uplay stinks yah it 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.630
 dust burns and remember you can of course 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 shalturit and leave everything in this form 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:42.080
 but God forbid something happens all the same 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.990
 fuse tip is not for nothing very 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:48.020
 high probability of fire heater 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.420
 this is the very first culprit in fires 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.540
 take care of housing 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:57.640
 fire safety measures and everything will be 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.640
 okay, that's all for now
