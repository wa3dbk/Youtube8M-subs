00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.900
 hello with you she sewed you eat 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.240
 classes Alexander Patchuk with dust today 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.070
 we have on the agenda staining number 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.800
 one on request in all search engines 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.390
 systems 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 the term came to the hair salon 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.489
 visual arts industry 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.310
 she and another name for this effect de 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.220
 grote is a gradual transition of color from 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.380
 the darkest shade to the lightest 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.570
 and we immediately fell in love with all the Hollywood 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.060
 stars because it is staining 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.060
 looks natural and natural but 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.250
 it is very expensive and sexy 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:50.280
 ombres without this natural color 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.890
 medium shade between brown nuances 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.530
 and blonde and also the effect is natural 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.930
 sun- bleached hair nuance 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.770
 Ombre staining will show us a stylist 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.990
 hope sytin ombre staining 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.719
 technically very difficult why 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.240
 what is the main thing in it to make the transition from 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:11.909
 dark color to light very smoothly 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.119
 color should be as natural as possible 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.520
 but in the bright sun play shimmer and 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.770
 add visual volume to the roots 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.869
 hair we apply dye which 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.270
 should be two three or more tones 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.609
 darker than the color at the ends of the hair 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.069
 then apply a light dye on 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.200
 tip and smooth movements 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:31.380
 draw the line between them 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.719
 colorist 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.569
 you need not only skill but also 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.509
 sense of proportion so that ombres in direct and 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:40.889
 figuratively can be called 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.380
 hand-dyeing in order 

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:45.990
 color to play in the sun on top 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.079
 light dye thin masks we 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.549
 we apply the clarifying paste so we create 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.549
 faded strand effect 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.130
 really am bread 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.640
 on the hair roots we mixed without and ash 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.750
 ash neutralized yellowness became 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 main touch 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.220
 we put this mix on the roots smoothly 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.380
 going down to the middle of the hair for 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.840
 staining ends we used 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.040
 beige blonde and already inflicted over it 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.040
