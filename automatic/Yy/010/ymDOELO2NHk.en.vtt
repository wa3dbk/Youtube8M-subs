is they take their own batteries to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.550 
is they take their own batteries to
triple<00:01:44.460> A's<00:01:44.579> why<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.630> need<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> battery<00:01:46.320> if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
triple A's why do they need a battery if

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.039 
triple A's why do they need a battery if
they're<00:01:47.430> inserted<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> controller<00:01:51.049> it's

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
they're inserted in the controller it's

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.719 
they're inserted in the controller it's
not<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.409> it's<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> wireless<00:01:52.890> memory<00:01:53.520> card

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
there you go now you can take your

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.509 
there you go now you can take your

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
that's pretty useless

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.160 
that's pretty useless
there's<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.000> exact<00:02:35.299> same<00:02:35.510> feature<00:02:35.810> on<00:02:36.049> the

there's the exact same feature on the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.710 
there's the exact same feature on the
gamecube<00:02:36.670> like<00:02:37.670> that's<00:02:38.060> at<00:02:38.209> least<00:02:38.239> a<00:02:38.540> bit<00:02:38.690> more

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
gamecube like that's at least a bit more

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.569 
gamecube like that's at least a bit more
understandable<00:02:39.500> because<00:02:39.709> it's<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.280> games

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
understandable because it's this games

and then 4 times why would you get these
they<00:03:05.329> don't<00:03:05.510> even<00:03:05.599> make<00:03:05.840> sense<00:03:06.579> somebody

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
they don't even make sense somebody

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.839 
they don't even make sense somebody
needs<00:03:08.000> some<00:03:08.269> memory<00:03:08.540> in<00:03:08.720> these<00:03:08.870> games<00:03:09.109> now<00:03:09.849> one

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
needs some memory in these games now one

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.900 
needs some memory in these games now one
for<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.060> Gamecube<00:03:15.160> this<00:03:16.160> is<00:03:16.310> also<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.669> great

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
for the Gamecube this is also a great

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.129 
for the Gamecube this is also a great
system<00:03:17.709> but<00:03:18.970> here's<00:03:19.970> the<00:03:20.090> controller<00:03:20.449> it's<00:03:21.079> a

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
system but here's the controller it's a

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.990 
system but here's the controller it's a
little<00:03:21.379> better<00:03:21.560> than<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:21.919> n64<00:03:22.370> still<00:03:22.790> pretty

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
little better than the n64 still pretty

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.650 
little better than the n64 still pretty
weird<00:03:23.650> but<00:03:24.650> now<00:03:25.120> here's<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> third-party

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660 
weird but now here's the third-party

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.140 
weird but now here's the third-party
controller<00:03:27.290> look<00:03:28.280> at<00:03:28.370> this<00:03:28.489> whenever<00:03:28.940> I<00:03:29.030> would

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
controller look at this whenever I would

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.699 
controller look at this whenever I would
play<00:03:29.359> with<00:03:29.510> friends<00:03:29.690> nobody<00:03:30.079> wanted<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.470> use

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
play with friends nobody wanted to use

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.460 
play with friends nobody wanted to use

it well the only good thing is getting

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.039 
it well the only good thing is getting
them<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.680> stick<00:03:34.160> but<00:03:34.340> it's<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.299> messed<00:03:35.660> up<00:03:35.840> I

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
who wants to use it looks horrible and

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.780 
who wants to use it looks horrible and
then<00:03:43.069> we're<00:03:43.190> saying<00:03:43.370> about<00:03:43.519> third-party

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
then we're saying about third-party

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.059 
then we're saying about third-party
controllers<00:03:44.389> is<00:03:44.840> that<00:03:45.139> if<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.560> ask<00:03:45.739> for<00:03:45.919> a

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
controllers is that if you ask for a
