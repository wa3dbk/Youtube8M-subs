00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.430
 the under 25 frame is a group that we 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.259
 have created the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.400
 to make a connection between the young 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.139
 riders 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.000
 he says youth teams and the 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.560
 senior teams quickly turned out to be one 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.990
 Clear a gap to sit in front of 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.880
 regarding the performance and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.609
 that group under 25 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.160
 those 25 that they call international have 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.650
 we created a group in which we created the 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.240
 young riders incorporate the potential 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.500
 to be able to flow to the 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.580
 seniors 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.460
 we need that a certain percentage 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.760
 and then they are included in 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.610
 the under 25 framework that we train every 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.979
 month or one we have one 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.089
 other activity for example 

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.019
 communication training courses on 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.320
 heart rate measurement 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.489
 how much food from etcetera etcetera 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.440
 so that we are actually as a team 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.989
 together and with each other every month 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.940
 improving performance 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.680
 and so we are also training to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.619
 horse and so where we like every month 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.570
 I said in an activity that is too 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:06.550
 on horseback there because train to 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.380
 Try the technical test better 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.630
 get it's own details 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.400
 improve the dots 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.040
 and we do that mainly to large ones 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.590
 competitions and then call it neck piece 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.910
 additional training need still know the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.410
 refined because we have to 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.360
 natural with this group or 

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.610
 get a connection with the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.190
 international level 2 you all at 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.170
 own trainers the riders 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.000
 and in combination with that own trainer 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.850
 together we try to improve the level 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.380
 I am now in learning I am 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.600

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.200
 I am very happy with it and says 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.259
 trial-oriented training 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.090
 So you shoot really sure what means 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.799
