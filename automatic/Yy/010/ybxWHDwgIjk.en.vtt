00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
could help us tie the evolutionary gap

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.549 
could help us tie the evolutionary gap
between<00:00:46.399> sprawling<00:00:47.399> postured<00:00:47.940> animals<00:00:48.300> and

while they're walking and this is very

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
while they're walking and this is very

even humans so to further understand
this<00:01:22.530> we're<00:01:22.830> doing<00:01:23.100> additional<00:01:23.520> studies

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
this we're doing additional studies

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.880 
this we're doing additional studies
where<00:01:24.090> we're<00:01:24.240> looking<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.689> not<00:01:25.229> only<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.560> bone

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
where we're looking at not only the bone

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
where we're looking at not only the bone
loading<00:01:26.430> component<00:01:27.030> but<00:01:27.150> also<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.659> muscular

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
loading component but also the muscular

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
loading component but also the muscular
contribution<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:30.060> our<00:01:30.180> force

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
contribution to that from our force

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
contribution to that from our force
platform<00:01:30.900> studies<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.380> can<00:01:31.560> model<00:01:31.979> what<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
platform studies we can model what the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.420 
platform studies we can model what the
muscle<00:01:33.240> contribution<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.040> study<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
muscle contribution is so the study is

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.420 
muscle contribution is so the study is
going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> directly<00:01:36.390> verify<00:01:37.250> some<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.369> those

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
going to directly verify some of those

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.179 
going to directly verify some of those
mathematical<00:01:38.790> models<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.170> figure<00:01:40.470> out<00:01:40.650> how

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
mathematical models to figure out how

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.219 
mathematical models to figure out how

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
much muscle contraction actually

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.950 
much muscle contraction actually
influences<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.610> amount<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.090> twisting<00:01:45.659> which

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
influences the amount of twisting which

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
influences the amount of twisting which
is<00:01:46.110> torsion<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:47.310> amount<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.729> bending

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
is torsion or the amount of bending

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
is torsion or the amount of bending
which<00:01:48.810> takes<00:01:49.110> place<00:01:49.350> about<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.799> long<00:01:49.979> axis<00:01:50.189> of
