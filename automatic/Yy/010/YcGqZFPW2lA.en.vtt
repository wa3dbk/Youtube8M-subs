00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
the box for pretty much most dirt tracks

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
the box for pretty much most dirt tracks
we've<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:16.049> new<00:01:16.229> silver<00:01:16.650> turnbuckles<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.310> this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
we've got new silver turnbuckles on this

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.789 
we've got new silver turnbuckles on this
car<00:01:17.700> again<00:01:18.000> look<00:01:18.930> better<00:01:19.140> on<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.619> higher

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
car again look better on the higher

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.480 
car again look better on the higher
strength<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> less<00:01:21.299> likely<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> bend<00:01:22.490> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
strength so the less likely to bend the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.730 
strength so the less likely to bend the
new<00:01:23.640> car<00:01:23.880> features<00:01:24.390> 12<00:01:24.750> mil<00:01:24.960> hexes<00:01:25.350> all<00:01:25.500> round

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
new car features 12 mil hexes all round

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.310 
new car features 12 mil hexes all round
which<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.729> becoming<00:01:27.270> new<00:01:27.780> industry<00:01:28.290> standard

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
which is becoming new industry standard

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.910 
which is becoming new industry standard
so<00:01:28.979> we've<00:01:29.130> got<00:01:29.280> 12<00:01:29.549> mil<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.060> rear

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.469 

and<00:01:36.920> also<00:01:37.700> 12<00:01:38.060> mil<00:01:38.299> hex<00:01:38.539> up<00:01:38.810> front<00:01:40.479> another

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
and also 12 mil hex up front another

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.899 
and also 12 mil hex up front another
great<00:01:41.719> feature<00:01:41.929> of<00:01:42.140> this<00:01:42.289> car<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.799> you<00:01:43.759> can

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
great feature of this car is you can

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.179 
great feature of this car is you can
access<00:01:44.270> for<00:01:44.420> diff<00:01:44.630> using<00:01:45.200> four<00:01:45.469> screws<00:01:45.799> so

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
access for diff using four screws so

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.240 
access for diff using four screws so
these<00:01:46.549> two<00:01:46.850> here<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:47.390> these<00:01:47.929> two<00:01:47.990> here<00:01:48.469> means

these two here and these two here means
you<00:01:49.399> can<00:01:49.520> get<00:01:49.640> the<00:01:49.759> diff<00:01:49.969> out<00:01:50.149> very<00:01:50.539> quickly

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
you can get the diff out very quickly

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.569 
you can get the diff out very quickly
which<00:01:51.229> is<00:01:51.259> great<00:01:51.649> for<00:01:51.829> any<00:01:51.979> changes<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:52.549> want

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:04.879 
rebuild it all the time inside we have

00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:07.419 
rebuild it all the time inside we have
steel<00:02:05.450> gears<00:02:05.829> for<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.920> ultimate<00:02:07.369> in

it<00:03:04.130> now<00:03:04.280> carries<00:03:04.669> the<00:03:04.760> bearings<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:05.450> your

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
it now carries the bearings so your

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.390 
it now carries the bearings so your
wheel<00:03:05.750> comes<00:03:06.019> off<00:03:06.169> of<00:03:06.410> just<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.709> nut<00:03:06.919> there's<00:03:07.250> no

wheel comes off of just a nut there's no

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.839 
wheel comes off of just a nut there's no
need<00:03:07.609> to<00:03:07.639> remove<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.209> bearings<00:03:08.599> each<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:09.849> so

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
need to remove the bearings each time so

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.430 
need to remove the bearings each time so
that<00:03:11.000> will<00:03:11.120> increase<00:03:11.389> the<00:03:11.599> strength<00:03:11.660> of<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.200> car

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
that will increase the strength of a car

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.800 
that will increase the strength of a car
I'm<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:12.950> make<00:03:13.160> changing<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.090> wheels<00:03:14.269> easier

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
I'm just make changing the wheels easier

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.659 
I'm just make changing the wheels easier
you<00:03:15.019> can<00:03:15.169> share<00:03:15.440> your<00:03:15.590> wheels<00:03:15.739> with<00:03:15.950> mates<00:03:16.310> you

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
you can share your wheels with mates you

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:20.090 
you can share your wheels with mates you
can<00:03:16.819> put<00:03:16.970> our<00:03:17.120> wheels<00:03:17.329> on<00:03:17.540> other<00:03:17.810> cars

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
so underneath the car we now have the

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.920 
so underneath the car we now have the
front<00:03:32.160> skid<00:03:32.550> plate<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:33.209> is<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> feature<00:03:33.660> in

front skid plate this is a feature in
the<00:03:34.050> kit<00:03:34.260> and<00:03:34.440> basically<00:03:35.340> that's<00:03:35.520> there<00:03:35.819> to

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
the kit and basically that's there to

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.240 
the kit and basically that's there to
stop<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.360> wearing<00:03:36.599> away<00:03:36.690> from<00:03:37.260> from<00:03:37.860> bottom

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
stop you wearing away from from bottom

getting<00:03:54.209> in<00:03:54.450> silt'e<00:03:54.930> Michelle<00:03:55.230> very<00:03:55.500> well<00:03:55.739> we

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
getting in silt'e Michelle very well we

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.610 
getting in silt'e Michelle very well we
have<00:03:56.730> spaces<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.239> velcro<00:03:57.810> so<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.200> can<00:03:58.349> still

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
have spaces for velcro so you can still

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.430 
have spaces for velcro so you can still
velcro<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.010> unclip<00:03:59.610> your<00:03:59.640> shell<00:04:00.000> on<00:04:00.120> and

velcro you unclip your shell on and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.780 
velcro you unclip your shell on and
basically<00:04:01.440> it<00:04:01.590> stops<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:02.100> dirt<00:04:02.340> getting<00:04:02.640> into

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
basically it stops all dirt getting into

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.530 
basically it stops all dirt getting into
