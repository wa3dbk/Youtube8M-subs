stock<00:02:46.340> earbuds<00:02:46.820> finally<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.959> believe<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:48.860> is

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
stock earbuds finally I believe this is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.870 
stock earbuds finally I believe this is
the<00:02:49.160> last<00:02:49.370> of<00:02:49.520> it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
the last of it

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.230 
the last of it
the<00:02:50.330> wall<00:02:50.570> adapter<00:02:51.310> should<00:02:52.310> be<00:02:52.459> 2<00:02:52.730> amp<00:02:52.940> just

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
the wall adapter should be 2 amp just

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.910 
the wall adapter should be 2 amp just
like<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.570> rest<00:02:53.720> and<00:02:53.990> the<00:02:54.350> rest<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.709> just

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
like the rest and the rest is just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.660 
like the rest and the rest is just
cardboard<00:02:55.220> filler<00:02:55.670> which<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.150> will<00:02:56.270> put<00:02:56.510> aside

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
cardboard filler which we will put aside

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.730 
cardboard filler which we will put aside
coming<00:02:58.670> back<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.180> device<00:02:59.480> itself<00:02:59.780> as<00:03:00.380> we

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
coming back to the device itself as we

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.230 
coming back to the device itself as we
saw<00:03:00.950> when<00:03:01.130> we<00:03:01.190> first<00:03:01.520> took<00:03:01.640> it<00:03:01.730> out<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:02.030> box

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
saw when we first took it out of a box

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.240 
saw when we first took it out of a box
it<00:03:02.480> is<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.630> white<00:03:02.959> version<00:03:03.200> these<00:03:03.620> are<00:03:03.770> this

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
it is the white version these are this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.650 
it is the white version these are this
is<00:03:04.310> a<00:03:04.459> pretty<00:03:04.670> loose<00:03:04.940> protective<00:03:05.480> here<00:03:05.630> I

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
is a pretty loose protective here I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.840 
is a pretty loose protective here I
think<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:05.990> was<00:03:06.140> probably<00:03:06.550> taken<00:03:07.550> off<00:03:07.670> at

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
think this was probably taken off at

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.550 
think this was probably taken off at
some<00:03:08.030> point<00:03:08.060> before<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:08.930> we<00:03:09.050> will<00:03:09.230> just<00:03:09.500> go

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
some point before so we will just go

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.960 
some point before so we will just go
ahead<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.920> pull<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.100> off<00:03:10.250> with<00:03:10.430> no<00:03:10.550> ceremony

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
ahead and pull it off with no ceremony

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.420 
ahead and pull it off with no ceremony
but<00:03:11.120> this<00:03:11.300> front<00:03:11.570> display<00:03:11.810> protector<00:03:12.560> jeez<00:03:13.160> is

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
but this front display protector jeez is

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.530 
but this front display protector jeez is
hard<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> get<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.850> whole<00:03:13.970> thing<00:03:14.000> in<00:03:14.209> the<00:03:14.270> frame

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
hard to get the whole thing in the frame

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.600 
hard to get the whole thing in the frame
it's<00:03:14.720> such<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.930> giant<00:03:15.260> device<00:03:15.680> sorry<00:03:16.370> it's<00:03:16.520> been

it's such a giant device sorry it's been

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.610 
it's such a giant device sorry it's been
