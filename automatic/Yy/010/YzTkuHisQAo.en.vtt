00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.560
 Today I wanted to tell you about how 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.960
 they smell like i'm stuffing 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:22.320
 I sew for this you need from reamers 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.430
 minutes old reamers drills Melchakov 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.759
 to make these 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:36.750
 big killers 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:41.640
 smaller here from the saddle small here from 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.520
 sweep generally small scale well 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 the smaller the bait the less shuya here 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.850
 Well, that does not tread even there in favor 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.860
 do little florets here too 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.190
 average of this size even such here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 this 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:06.439
 length of centering scan 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 here so the drill is inserted it is simple 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:17.759
 by type 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:18.240
 blackthorn but rounded too 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.350
 for example 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 well, let's say we cut out anything there 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.450
 it will be either at our place or there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.929
 brother petal spinners take 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.929
 average average jumping and 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:02:06.610
 with such a macar we fill it a little 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:28.780
 deform correct need to 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 Kovalenko have years when to go 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.140
 farther 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:03:00.340
 the row let's say is ready and the conclusion is all 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:03:00.340
 here let's do the chapters 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.579
 nearly 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.310
 here is an example 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.310
 what happens 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.720
 it shows that no woman gives 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.409
 grind 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:50.500
 anything anyone could do difficult 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:52.620
 flower too elementary to do if 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.620
 that 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.810
 again it is necessary to dance from the middle 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:52.850
 here again with this 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:52.850
 bodyagi leap fantasy enough 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.050
 here 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:31.160
 but whose principle is she need for more 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.870
 Of course for the fisherman, but I did it 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.210
 fluorescent paint is taken or 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.070
 any kind of contrast I am ordinary 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:44.699
 the recipe put away the varnish covered it falls 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:47.180
 in this scale then straight still not dried 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.340
 wiped and 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.120
 the scales get fluorescent red 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.120
 the bait itself 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:08.690
 now I cleaned it seems what happened in 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:08.690
 I finally found a sandpaper 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:45.880
 nod group said something like that 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.919
 become yourself give shape and you will have 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.919
 corrugated account estuary 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.440
 here bye
