00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
was probably a lot heavier than I

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.340 
was probably a lot heavier than I
thought<00:00:51.030> especially<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> rain<00:00:52.050> really

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
thought especially with the rain really

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
thought especially with the rain really
weighed<00:00:52.620> me<00:00:52.770> down<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.219> starting<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.699> 18

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
weighed me down so starting with 18

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.090 
weighed me down so starting with 18
pounds<00:00:54.510> more<00:00:54.719> than<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:55.410> wouldn't<00:00:55.980> race

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
pounds more than I wouldn't race

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.619 
pounds more than I wouldn't race
normally<00:00:56.550> with<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.850> rain<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.270> was<00:00:57.329> probably

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
normally with the rain it was probably

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.389 
normally with the rain it was probably
25<00:00:58.079> pounds<00:00:58.440> extra<00:00:58.590> weight<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.039> end<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
25 pounds extra weight by the end of it

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.880
