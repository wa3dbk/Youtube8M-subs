dehydrating the teeth as you have this
peroxide<00:01:56.740> on<00:01:56.770> them<00:01:57.099> the<00:01:57.759> second<00:01:58.209> thing<00:01:58.360> that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
peroxide on them the second thing that

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.059 
peroxide on them the second thing that
it<00:01:58.599> does<00:01:58.630> is<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.080> effects<00:01:59.500> actually<00:01:59.950> last

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:00.069 
it does is the effects actually last

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:01.740 
it does is the effects actually last
longer<00:02:00.640> than<00:02:00.670> maybe<00:02:00.970> the<00:02:01.209> hydrogen<00:02:01.539> peroxide

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
longer than maybe the hydrogen peroxide

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.300 
longer than maybe the hydrogen peroxide
would<00:02:02.349> and<00:02:02.679> then<00:02:02.770> the<00:02:02.890> third<00:02:03.099> recommendation

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
would and then the third recommendation

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.279 
would and then the third recommendation
we<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.239> is<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.569> make<00:02:04.720> sure<00:02:04.840> you're<00:02:04.989> using<00:02:05.020> a

whitening gums we're whitening teeth
what<00:02:09.940> if<00:02:10.030> people<00:02:10.270> have<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.840> crowns<00:02:11.290> porcelain

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
what if people have you crowns porcelain

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.880 
what if people have you crowns porcelain
crowns<00:02:12.400> or<00:02:12.730> tooth<00:02:13.000> colored<00:02:13.930> fillings<00:02:13.959> will

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
crowns or tooth colored fillings will

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.530 
crowns or tooth colored fillings will
those<00:02:15.040> whiten<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.880> whitening<00:02:16.120> system<00:02:16.390> don't

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
those whiten the whitening system don't

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.530 
those whiten the whitening system don't
whiten<00:02:16.900> crowns<00:02:17.170> they<00:02:17.440> do<00:02:17.500> not<00:02:17.739> white<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.540> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
whiten crowns they do not white and you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.449 
whiten crowns they do not white and you
know<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.989> colored<00:02:20.380> fillings<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.220> people

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
know the colored fillings that people

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.460 
know the colored fillings that people
get<00:02:21.550> an<00:02:21.670> affront<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.270> and<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.319> you're

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
get an affront to you and so if you're

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.630 
get an affront to you and so if you're
going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.650> have<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.980> work<00:02:24.189> done<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:24.519> you're

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
going to have that work done if you're

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to have that work done if you're
going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> get<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:24.969> crown<00:02:25.239> done<00:02:25.480> it's<00:02:25.689> really

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
going to get a crown done it's really

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.259 
going to get a crown done it's really
important<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.439> whiten<00:02:26.709> before<00:02:27.069> that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
important to whiten before that

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.160 
important to whiten before that
otherwise<00:02:28.269> they're<00:02:28.540> going<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.689> match<00:02:28.900> the

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
otherwise they're going to match the

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.710 
otherwise they're going to match the
color<00:02:29.380> that<00:02:29.620> your<00:02:29.740> teeth<00:02:29.980> are<00:02:30.190> how<00:02:30.730> often<00:02:31.240> can

often there's little fragile nerves and

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.070 
often there's little fragile nerves and
the<00:02:39.580> teeth<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:39.940> will<00:02:40.060> tell<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.480> bottom

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
really promote the ultra sonic

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.030 
really promote the ultra sonic
toothbrush<00:03:10.390> there's<00:03:10.810> electric<00:03:11.380> toothbrushes

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
toothbrush there's electric toothbrushes

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.940 
toothbrush there's electric toothbrushes
but<00:03:12.670> it's<00:03:13.510> different<00:03:13.569> than<00:03:13.989> it<00:03:14.200> is<00:03:14.230> different

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
but it's different than it is different

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.500 
but it's different than it is different
yeah<00:03:15.100> it's<00:03:15.250> just<00:03:15.430> not<00:03:15.549> a<00:03:15.580> mechanical<00:03:16.180> rotary

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
yeah it's just not a mechanical rotary

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.600 
yeah it's just not a mechanical rotary
type<00:03:16.840> situation<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.830> they've<00:03:17.980> done<00:03:18.160> studies

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
type situation and they've done studies

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.789 
type situation and they've done studies
that<00:03:18.850> show<00:03:19.209> that<00:03:19.239> with<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.200> ultrasonic

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
that show that with the ultrasonic

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.350 
that show that with the ultrasonic
action<00:03:21.190> you<00:03:21.280> don't<00:03:21.489> actually<00:03:21.730> even<00:03:22.030> have<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
action you don't actually even have to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.270 
action you don't actually even have to
touch<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.840> tooth<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.080> remove<00:03:23.470> the<00:03:23.560> plaque<00:03:23.830> so

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
touch the tooth to remove the plaque so

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.320 
touch the tooth to remove the plaque so
I<00:03:24.310> mean<00:03:24.519> that's<00:03:24.549> means<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:24.970> getting<00:03:25.209> down

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
I mean that's means it's getting down

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.300 
I mean that's means it's getting down
below<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.720> gums<00:03:25.900> getting<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.470> bacteria<00:03:27.069> out

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
below the gums getting that bacteria out

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.430 
below the gums getting that bacteria out
we've<00:03:28.180> just<00:03:28.209> recently<00:03:28.690> introduced<00:03:29.200> a<00:03:29.290> new

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
we've just recently introduced a new

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.259 
we've just recently introduced a new
technology<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.280> we've<00:03:30.430> coupled<00:03:30.940> with<00:03:31.060> the

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
technology that we've coupled with the

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.569 
technology that we've coupled with the
ultrasonic<00:03:32.019> which<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.260> called<00:03:32.410> ionic<00:03:33.040> and

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
ultrasonic which is called ionic and

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.670 
ultrasonic which is called ionic and
what<00:03:33.700> that<00:03:33.880> does<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.239> it<00:03:34.450> repolarize<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.530> your

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
what that does is it repolarize is your

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.770 
what that does is it repolarize is your
tooth<00:03:35.920> for<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.760> moment<00:03:37.000> which<00:03:37.329> then<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
tooth for that moment which then the

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.210 
tooth for that moment which then the
plaques<00:03:38.049> lefts<00:03:38.440> off<00:03:38.590> because<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:38.980> no<00:03:39.190> longer

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
plaques lefts off because it no longer

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.789 
plaques lefts off because it no longer
has<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.670> attraction<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.840> two<00:03:41.049> then<00:03:41.470> it

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
has that attraction to the two then it

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.349 
has that attraction to the two then it
just<00:03:42.100> takes<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.459> oral<00:03:42.790> health<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.180> whole

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
just takes the oral health to the whole

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.750 
just takes the oral health to the whole
nother<00:03:43.510> level<00:03:43.600> keeps<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.440> staining<00:03:45.340> off<00:03:45.579> your

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760
