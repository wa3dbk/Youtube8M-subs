classroom libraries with books readers
having<00:00:33.460> choice<00:00:33.670> we<00:00:34.239> do<00:00:34.360> think<00:00:34.540> that<00:00:34.570> reading

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
having choice we do think that reading

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.720 
having choice we do think that reading
is<00:00:35.110> an<00:00:35.350> act<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.590> comprehension<00:00:36.070> and<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.580> eyes

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
is an act of comprehension and that eyes

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.110 
is an act of comprehension and that eyes
on<00:00:36.910> print<00:00:37.120> is<00:00:37.239> not<00:00:37.360> reading<00:00:37.720> and<00:00:37.900> that<00:00:38.830> that<00:00:39.400> if

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
on print is not reading and that that if

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.760 
on print is not reading and that that if
we<00:00:40.270> need<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.450> rep<00:00:40.690> match<00:00:40.900> readers<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.320> books<00:00:41.530> um

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
we need to rep match readers to books um

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.670 
we need to rep match readers to books um
so<00:00:42.640> in<00:00:43.510> all<00:00:43.720> of<00:00:43.840> our<00:00:43.960> schools<00:00:44.260> all<00:00:44.440> of<00:00:44.559> our

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
so in all of our schools all of our

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.110 
so in all of our schools all of our
teachers<00:00:44.950> do<00:00:45.040> running<00:00:45.220> records<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.970> figure

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
teachers do running records to figure

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.180 
teachers do running records to figure
out<00:00:46.390> what<00:00:46.720> level<00:00:47.050> texts<00:00:47.470> kids<00:00:47.680> can<00:00:47.890> read<00:00:48.040> with

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
out what level texts kids can read with

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.920 
out what level texts kids can read with
96%<00:00:48.670> accuracy<00:00:49.120> fluency<00:00:49.690> and<00:00:49.780> comprehension

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
96% accuracy fluency and comprehension

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.170 
96% accuracy fluency and comprehension
and<00:00:50.650> we're<00:00:51.129> matching<00:00:51.460> them<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.760> those<00:00:51.879> books

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
and we're matching them to those books

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.970 
and we're matching them to those books
which<00:00:52.420> means<00:00:52.750> that<00:00:53.140> they're<00:00:53.440> not<00:00:53.590> all<00:00:53.739> reading

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
which means that they're not all reading

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.510 
which means that they're not all reading
the<00:00:54.070> same<00:00:54.220> text<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:55.090> we<00:00:55.480> think<00:00:55.660> that<00:00:56.520> explicit

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
the same text we we think that explicit

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.400 
the same text we we think that explicit
instruction<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.120> really<00:00:58.420> important<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.170> that

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
instruction is really important and that

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.590 
instruction is really important and that
kids<00:00:59.770> don't<00:00:59.980> just<00:01:00.160> learn<00:01:00.550> by<00:01:00.760> osmosis<00:01:00.910> and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
kids don't just learn by osmosis and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.020 
kids don't just learn by osmosis and
that<00:01:01.960> we<00:01:02.620> need<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:03.040> figure<00:01:03.370> out<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.790> skills

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
that we need to figure out the skills

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.670 
that we need to figure out the skills
and<00:01:04.180> strategies<00:01:04.630> of<00:01:04.660> proficient<00:01:05.199> reading<00:01:05.380> and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
and strategies of proficient reading and

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.859 
and strategies of proficient reading and
we<00:01:06.250> need<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> be<00:01:06.790> able<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.240> teachers<00:01:07.420> talk

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
we need to be able to have teachers talk

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.450 
we need to be able to have teachers talk
about<00:01:08.140> those<00:01:08.350> skills<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:08.770> strategies<00:01:09.190> in

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
about those skills and strategies in

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.770 
about those skills and strategies in
ways<00:01:09.759> that<00:01:10.149> are<00:01:11.399> compelling<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.700> kids<00:01:12.910> and<00:01:13.210> to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
ways that are compelling to kids and to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.120 
ways that are compelling to kids and to
do<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.140> think<00:01:14.290> one<00:01:14.680> of<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:14.860> things<00:01:15.009> that's

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
do that I think one of the things that's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.770 
do that I think one of the things that's
helpful<00:01:15.399> is<00:01:15.610> for<00:01:15.790> teachers<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.210> understand

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
helpful is for teachers to understand

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.420 
helpful is for teachers to understand
that<00:01:17.080> most<00:01:17.290> of<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.710> reading<00:01:18.009> skills<00:01:18.280> and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
that most of the reading skills and

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.520 
that most of the reading skills and
strategies<00:01:18.820> are<00:01:19.060> also<00:01:19.509> thinking<00:01:20.080> skills<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
strategies are also thinking skills and

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.859 
strategies are also thinking skills and
strategies<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.280> prediction<00:01:22.210> for<00:01:22.330> example<00:01:22.750> is

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
strategies so prediction for example is

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.059 
strategies so prediction for example is
something<00:01:22.990> that<00:01:23.350> you<00:01:23.649> do<00:01:23.800> when<00:01:23.950> you're

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
something that you do when you're

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:25.850 
something that you do when you're
watching<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.399> television<00:01:24.550> show<00:01:25.030> you<00:01:25.270> know<00:01:25.360> and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.469 
watching a television show you know and
it's<00:01:26.860> something<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.250> do<00:01:27.429> when<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:27.850> when<00:01:28.390> you

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
it's something you do when you when you

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.059 
it's something you do when you when you
try<00:01:28.660> to<00:01:28.720> buy<00:01:28.959> somebody<00:01:29.229> a<00:01:29.410> present<00:01:29.860> that's

I'm trying to like read all that I know

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.359 
I'm trying to like read all that I know
about<00:01:39.970> her<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.750> keep<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.709> and<00:01:41.950> keep<00:01:42.220> the

about her and keep that and keep the
sort<00:01:42.580> of<00:01:42.610> story<00:01:43.539> of<00:01:43.720> her<00:01:43.899> of<00:01:44.110> who<00:01:44.500> my<00:01:44.649> mother<00:01:44.860> is

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
sort of story of her of who my mother is

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.880 
sort of story of her of who my mother is
in<00:01:45.520> my<00:01:45.700> mind<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.360> to<00:01:46.569> predict<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.319> in<00:01:47.679> ways

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
in my mind and to predict and in ways

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.620 
in my mind and to predict and in ways
that<00:01:48.130> will<00:01:48.250> looks<00:01:48.670> almost<00:01:48.910> like<00:01:49.060> author<00:01:49.360> the

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
that will looks almost like author the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.410 
that will looks almost like author the
continuing<00:01:50.410> story<00:01:50.679> so<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.640> think<00:01:51.759> that<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.209> a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
continuing story so we think that that a

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.550 
continuing story so we think that that a
lot<00:01:52.869> of<00:01:53.080> teachers<00:01:53.349> are<00:01:53.940> disempowered<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.720> to

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
lot of teachers are disempowered to to

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.589 
lot of teachers are disempowered to to
talk<00:01:56.950> about<00:01:57.190> reading<00:01:57.399> skills<00:01:57.819> they<00:01:58.060> think<00:01:58.479> of

you're if you're teaching activating
prior<00:02:18.310> knowledge<00:02:18.370> which<00:02:18.970> is<00:02:19.090> something<00:02:19.270> that

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
prior knowledge which is something that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.660 
prior knowledge which is something that
none<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.690> us<00:02:19.840> talk<00:02:20.140> about<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.739> you<00:02:20.920> know<00:02:21.040> it's

none of us talk about or you know it's

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
none of us talk about or you know it's
it's<00:02:22.030> hard<00:02:22.270> to<00:02:22.330> teach<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.750> in<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:23.020> really

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
it's hard to teach that in a really

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.510 
it's hard to teach that in a really
compelling<00:02:23.620> way<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:23.920> we<00:02:24.250> think<00:02:24.340> it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
compelling way so we think it's

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.320 
compelling way so we think it's
important<00:02:24.940> for<00:02:24.970> teachers<00:02:25.180> to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
important for teachers to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.700 
important for teachers to
own<00:02:27.330> reading<00:02:28.110> skills<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.470> we'll<00:02:28.560> come<00:02:28.680> back

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
own reading skills and we'll come back

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:35.420 
own reading skills and we'll come back
and<00:02:28.920> talk<00:02:29.040> more<00:02:29.070> about<00:02:29.250> that
