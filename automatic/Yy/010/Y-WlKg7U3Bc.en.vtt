processed<00:01:42.720> these<00:01:42.930> days<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.829> are

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
processed these days they actually are

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
processed these days they actually are
harvested<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:44.640> they're<00:01:44.759> at<00:01:44.850> their<00:01:44.880> ibis<00:01:45.329> and

harvested when they're at their ibis and

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.990 
harvested when they're at their ibis and
then<00:01:45.689> flash<00:01:46.110> frozen<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.250> don't<00:01:47.460> lose<00:01:47.520> any

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
then flash frozen so they don't lose any

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
then flash frozen so they don't lose any
of<00:01:48.090> their<00:01:48.270> nutrients<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.869> frozen<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of their nutrients so frozen can be a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.310 
of their nutrients so frozen can be a
good<00:01:49.680> way<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.890> go<00:01:50.130> canned<00:01:51.060> vegetables<00:01:51.689> tend<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
good way to go canned vegetables tend to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
good way to go canned vegetables tend to
have<00:01:52.649> less<00:01:53.070> vitamins<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.909> them<00:01:53.939> than<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
have less vitamins in them than the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.420 
have less vitamins in them than the
fresh<00:01:54.960> or<00:01:55.140> frozen<00:01:55.170> varieties<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.219> lot<00:01:56.369> of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
fresh or frozen varieties and a lot of

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.280 
fresh or frozen varieties and a lot of
times<00:01:56.579> they<00:01:56.700> have<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:56.880> lot<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.060> sodium<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.079> if

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
times they have a lot of sodium so if

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950
