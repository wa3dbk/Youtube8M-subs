00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
that I loved it's easy for somebody to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.390 
that I loved it's easy for somebody to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.040 
locked into a certain position I was
falling<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.070> my<00:02:06.250> right<00:02:06.490> on<00:02:06.700> my<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.270> ski<00:02:07.630> in<00:02:07.870> a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
falling to my right on my right ski in a

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.230 
falling to my right on my right ski in a
flying<00:02:08.350> pirouette<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.280> look<00:02:09.610> up<00:02:09.790> and<00:02:10.000> I'm

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
flying pirouette I look up and I'm

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.180 
flying pirouette I look up and I'm
seeing<00:02:10.630> there's<00:02:11.020> just<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.350> wall<00:02:11.530> of<00:02:11.740> trees<00:02:11.890> in

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
seeing there's just a wall of trees in

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.800 
seeing there's just a wall of trees in
front<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.430> me<00:02:12.490> there's<00:02:12.850> no<00:02:13.060> gaps<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.720> have

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
front of me there's no gaps I would have

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.020 
front of me there's no gaps I would have
gone<00:02:13.870> into<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> trees<00:02:14.560> headfirst<00:02:15.130> at<00:02:15.550> 60

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
gone into the trees headfirst at 60

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.760 
gone into the trees headfirst at 60
miles<00:02:16.180> an<00:02:16.270> hour<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.660> believe<00:02:17.080> it<00:02:17.230> was<00:02:17.350> certain

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
miles an hour I believe it was certain

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.800 
miles an hour I believe it was certain
death<00:02:17.980> or<00:02:18.220> paralysis<00:02:18.640> or<00:02:19.000> something<00:02:19.360> bad<00:02:19.600> in

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
death or paralysis or something bad in

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.930 
death or paralysis or something bad in
there<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.140> was<00:02:20.410> a<00:02:20.470> microcosm<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> lot

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
there so that was a microcosm of a lot

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.430 
there so that was a microcosm of a lot
of<00:02:22.060> different<00:02:22.330> stuff<00:02:22.540> at<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.720> point<00:02:23.140> things

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
of different stuff at that point things

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.860 
of different stuff at that point things
were<00:02:23.590> looking<00:02:23.860> pretty<00:02:24.040> grim<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.520> had<00:02:25.270> one<00:02:25.600> last

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
were looking pretty grim I had one last

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.840 
were looking pretty grim I had one last
time<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.560> I<00:02:26.620> was<00:02:26.800> like<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.070> can<00:02:27.250> jam<00:02:27.489> my<00:02:27.670> tail

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
time where I was like I can jam my tail

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.940 
time where I was like I can jam my tail
and<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.390> tip<00:02:28.690> my<00:02:28.870> balance<00:02:29.260> just<00:02:29.560> enough

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
and I can tip my balance just enough

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.860 
and I can tip my balance just enough
over<00:02:30.370> that<00:02:30.520> I<00:02:30.580> can<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.940> back<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.390> my<00:02:31.540> inside

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
over that I can get back on my inside

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
over that I can get back on my inside
edge<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.350> turn<00:02:32.500> away<00:02:32.709> from<00:02:32.830> this<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.250> kind<00:02:33.580> of

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
edge and turn away from this I kind of

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.729 
edge and turn away from this I kind of
