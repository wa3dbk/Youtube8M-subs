season<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.260> Dragon<00:00:48.620> Ball<00:00:48.739> Z<00:00:49.010> because<00:00:49.730> this<00:00:49.880> is

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
season of Dragon Ball Z because this is

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.930 
season of Dragon Ball Z because this is
season<00:00:50.360> where<00:00:51.080> we<00:00:51.110> get<00:00:51.400> Goku<00:00:52.400> fighting<00:00:52.700> Frieza

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940

and then we move on to the back here we
got<00:01:31.550> Frieza<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.020> I<00:01:33.049> guess<00:01:33.290> for<00:01:33.469> every<00:01:33.740> season

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
got Frieza so I guess for every season

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.859 
got Frieza so I guess for every season
they're<00:01:34.460> always<00:01:34.610> gonna<00:01:34.759> make<00:01:34.850> a<00:01:34.969> villain<00:01:35.600> to

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
they're always gonna make a villain to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.289

be<00:01:36.020> in<00:01:36.079> the<00:01:36.200> back<00:01:36.549> so<00:01:37.549> we're<00:01:37.670> season<00:01:37.909> 4<00:01:38.149> they

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
be in the back so we're season 4 they

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.780
