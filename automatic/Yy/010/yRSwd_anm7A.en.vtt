going to be going over the differences

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.280 
going to be going over the differences
of<00:00:19.660> the<00:00:19.869> new<00:00:20.110> phantom<00:00:20.770> 2<00:00:21.300> vision<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.540> there<00:00:23.080> is

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
of the new phantom 2 vision and there is

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.380 
of the new phantom 2 vision and there is
a<00:00:23.470> muse<00:00:23.710> versions<00:00:24.100> of<00:00:24.250> phantom<00:00:24.790> and<00:00:25.029> their<00:00:25.240> new

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
a muse versions of phantom and their new

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.160 
a muse versions of phantom and their new
vision<00:00:25.930> version<00:00:26.290> 2<00:00:26.970> guys<00:00:27.970> now<00:00:28.779> the<00:00:28.840> main

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170 
vision version 2 guys now the main

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.830 
vision version 2 guys now the main
differences<00:00:29.680> between<00:00:29.740> the<00:00:30.099> new<00:00:30.520> and<00:00:31.480> all

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
differences between the new and all

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.070 
differences between the new and all
phantom<00:00:32.830> 2<00:00:33.070> is<00:00:33.460> mainly<00:00:33.970> down<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.600> the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:35.080 
phantom 2 is mainly down to the

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.710 
phantom 2 is mainly down to the
transmitter<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.910> of<00:00:37.030> the<00:00:37.150> main<00:00:37.390> differences

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:37.720 
transmitter one of the main differences

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.290 
transmitter one of the main differences
DJI<00:00:38.410> have<00:00:38.590> done<00:00:38.770> on<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:39.699> older<00:00:41.250> phantom<00:00:42.250> 2<00:00:42.550> you

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
DJI have done on the older phantom 2 you

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.240 
DJI have done on the older phantom 2 you
had<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.750> small<00:00:44.020> tilt<00:00:44.320> leaver<00:00:44.680> on<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.070> back

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
had a small tilt leaver on the back

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.549 
had a small tilt leaver on the back
which<00:00:45.580> was<00:00:45.790> okay<00:00:46.210> but<00:00:46.629> a<00:00:46.930> lot<00:00:47.320> of<00:00:47.379> people

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
which was okay but a lot of people

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
which was okay but a lot of people
didn't<00:00:47.769> like<00:00:47.800> that<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.220> wasn't<00:00:48.400> very

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
didn't like that it wasn't very

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.469 
didn't like that it wasn't very
proportional<00:00:49.809> so<00:00:50.440> I'm<00:00:50.559> the<00:00:50.710> new<00:00:51.479> transmitter

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:52.479 
proportional so I'm the new transmitter

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.869 
proportional so I'm the new transmitter
we<00:00:53.260> never<00:00:53.470> have<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.650> little<00:00:53.979> toggle<00:00:54.190> feel<00:00:54.580> on

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
we never have a little toggle feel on

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:57.329 
we never have a little toggle feel on
the<00:00:55.120> top<00:00:55.360> for<00:00:55.659> tilting<00:00:56.290> the<00:00:56.530> game<00:00:56.680> ball<00:00:56.920> up<00:00:57.159> and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339 
the top for tilting the game ball up and

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:59.729 
the top for tilting the game ball up and
down<00:00:57.400> no<00:00:57.729> so<00:00:57.909> self-centering<00:00:58.629> a<00:00:58.960> toggle<00:00:59.470> wheel

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
down no so self-centering a toggle wheel

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:01.410 
down no so self-centering a toggle wheel
and<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.220> also<00:01:00.400> mental<00:01:00.879> it's<00:01:01.000> sunita

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
and it's also mental it's sunita

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.090 
and it's also mental it's sunita
subscription<00:01:01.989> fingers<00:01:02.290> very<00:01:02.470> well<00:01:02.769> so

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
subscription fingers very well so

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.280 
subscription fingers very well so
basically<00:01:03.549> that<00:01:04.089> will<00:01:04.239> make<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.900> gimbal<00:01:05.199> go

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
basically that will make the gimbal go

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.820 
basically that will make the gimbal go
down<00:01:05.590> let<00:01:06.100> go<00:01:06.310> it<00:01:06.490> will<00:01:06.670> stop<00:01:06.990> push<00:01:07.990> it<00:01:08.170> up<00:01:08.320> the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
down let go it will stop push it up the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.640 
down let go it will stop push it up the
gimbal<00:01:09.159> go<00:01:09.310> up<00:01:09.640> one<00:01:10.330> of<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.570> other<00:01:10.690> features

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
gimbal go up one of the other features

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.960 
gimbal go up one of the other features
of<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.130> new<00:01:12.250> transmitter

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
of the new transmitter

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.969 
of the new transmitter
traditionally<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.229> older<00:01:14.500> phantom

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
traditionally in the the older phantom

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.010 
traditionally in the the older phantom
you<00:01:15.400> had<00:01:15.549> a<00:01:15.580> four<00:01:15.820> cell<00:01:16.030> battery<00:01:16.479> box<00:01:16.690> in<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
you had a four cell battery box in the

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.899 
you had a four cell battery box in the
back<00:01:17.229> there<00:01:17.530> and<00:01:17.799> you<00:01:18.100> took<00:01:18.250> four<00:01:18.520> double<00:01:18.820> A

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
back there and you took four double A

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.020 
back there and you took four double A
batteries<00:01:18.940> in<00:01:19.630> there<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:21.130> is<00:01:21.310> normal<00:01:21.790> most

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
batteries in there which is normal most

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.700 
batteries in there which is normal most
their<00:01:22.240> really<00:01:22.540> control<00:01:22.870> models<00:01:23.200> on<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.560> new

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
their really control models on the new

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.710 
their really control models on the new
one<00:01:23.980> you<00:01:24.370> will<00:01:24.520> notice<00:01:24.700> there's<00:01:25.300> nothing<00:01:25.600> on

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
one you will notice there's nothing on

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.180 
one you will notice there's nothing on
the<00:01:25.810> back<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.230> completely<00:01:26.680> clean

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
the back it's completely clean

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.790 
the back it's completely clean
that<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.700> because<00:01:28.060> they<00:01:28.330> now<00:01:28.510> have<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:29.200> lightful

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
that is because they now have a lightful

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.220 
that is because they now have a lightful
battery<00:01:30.280> built<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.880> so<00:01:31.360> when<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.780> get<00:01:31.990> them

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
battery built in so when you get them

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:33.930 
battery built in so when you get them
they're<00:01:32.410> actually<00:01:32.500> come<00:01:32.860> pre<00:01:33.100> charged<00:01:33.460> but

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
they're actually come pre charged but

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.790 
they're actually come pre charged but
you<00:01:34.030> actually<00:01:34.150> charge<00:01:34.600> them<00:01:34.900> through<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.470> USB

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
you actually charge them through the USB

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.740 
you actually charge them through the USB
socket<00:01:36.430> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.640> bottom<00:01:37.060> so<00:01:37.390> when<00:01:37.540> you<00:01:37.630> switch

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
socket on the bottom so when you switch

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.290 
socket on the bottom so when you switch
on<00:01:38.050> though<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.310> get<00:01:39.400> B<00:01:39.580> beeps<00:01:39.820> you<00:01:40.000> never<00:01:40.180> have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
on though you get B beeps you never have

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.180 
on though you get B beeps you never have
a<00:01:40.390> green<00:01:40.660> light<00:01:40.690> opposed<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.500> the<00:01:41.620> red<00:01:41.890> one<00:01:42.130> we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
a green light opposed to the red one we

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.530 
a green light opposed to the red one we
used<00:01:42.340> to<00:01:42.430> have<00:01:42.550> on<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.790> phantom<00:01:43.180> 2<00:01:43.210> I'll

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
used to have on the phantom 2 I'll

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.200 
used to have on the phantom 2 I'll
always<00:01:43.750> dream<00:01:44.110> on<00:01:44.380> the<00:01:44.590> Vision<00:01:45.130> Plus<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:46.090> was

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
always dream on the Vision Plus it was

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.640 
always dream on the Vision Plus it was
actually<00:01:46.510> read<00:01:46.660> on<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:46.960> phantom<00:01:47.350> which<00:01:47.440> was<00:01:47.590> a

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
actually read on the phantom which was a

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.950 
actually read on the phantom which was a
little<00:01:47.860> bit<00:01:47.950> odd<00:01:48.100> but<00:01:48.520> now<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.760> have<00:01:49.120> our<00:01:49.420> four

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
little bit odd but now you have our four

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.440 
little bit odd but now you have our four
only<00:01:50.410> B<00:01:50.560> power<00:01:50.920> indicator<00:01:51.280> on<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.850> front<00:01:52.090> here

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
only B power indicator on the front here

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.570 
only B power indicator on the front here
so<00:01:52.900> as<00:01:53.200> it's<00:01:53.410> not<00:01:53.530> quite<00:01:53.770> fully<00:01:54.040> charged<00:01:54.310> so

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
so as it's not quite fully charged so

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.460 
so as it's not quite fully charged so
you're<00:01:54.700> already<00:01:54.880> down<00:01:55.300> one<00:01:55.510> so<00:01:56.020> that's<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.320> very

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
you're already down one so that's a very

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.320 
you're already down one so that's a very
good<00:01:56.680> feature<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.280> then<00:01:57.400> to<00:01:57.520> charge<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:58.060> you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
good feature and then to charge it you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.570 
good feature and then to charge it you
just<00:01:58.510> simply<00:01:58.630> plug<00:01:59.110> it<00:01:59.260> into<00:01:59.380> USB<00:01:59.890> socket<00:02:00.490> on

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
just simply plug it into USB socket on

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.570 
just simply plug it into USB socket on
the<00:02:00.670> back<00:02:00.820> to<00:02:01.030> charger<00:02:02.010> now<00:02:03.010> one<00:02:03.190> other<00:02:03.340> quick

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
the back to charger now one other quick

the back to charger now one other quick
handy<00:02:03.940> thing<00:02:04.120> they've<00:02:04.270> actually<00:02:04.420> done<00:02:04.780> as

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
handy thing they've actually done as

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.450 
handy thing they've actually done as
well<00:02:05.230> is<00:02:05.440> they've<00:02:05.710> actually<00:02:05.860> properly

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
well is they've actually properly

X 1 and X 2 but nobody actually have
what<00:02:13.989> they<00:02:14.110> are<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.500> you've<00:02:14.650> got<00:02:14.830> your<00:02:14.980> GPS

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
what they are so you've got your GPS

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.670 
what they are so you've got your GPS
attitude<00:02:16.209> attitude<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:17.110> on<00:02:17.319> this<00:02:17.470> side

you've<00:02:17.890> got<00:02:17.920> off<00:02:18.580> and<00:02:18.879> then<00:02:19.209> if<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.420> have

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
you've got off and then if you have

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.099 
you've got off and then if you have
enabled<00:02:19.900> your<00:02:21.060> nazimods<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.330> your<00:02:22.540> phantom

enabled your nazimods on your phantom

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.959 
enabled your nazimods on your phantom
you<00:02:23.439> would<00:02:23.560> actually<00:02:23.680> have<00:02:23.920> off<00:02:24.219> course<00:02:24.670> lock

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:24.969 
you would actually have off course lock

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.649 
you would actually have off course lock
and<00:02:25.239> home<00:02:25.780> lock

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659

now<00:02:27.659> moving<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.469> Phantom's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
now moving on to the Phantom's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.690 
now moving on to the Phantom's
themselves<00:02:29.609> this<00:02:29.790> is<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.090> original<00:02:30.359> phantom

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
themselves this is the original phantom

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.220 
themselves this is the original phantom
not<00:02:32.700> an<00:02:32.819> awful<00:02:33.120> lot<00:02:33.239> has<00:02:33.359> actually<00:02:33.750> changed<00:02:33.780> on

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
not an awful lot has actually changed on

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.690 
not an awful lot has actually changed on
the<00:02:34.349> model<00:02:34.739> but<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.069> thing<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.459> have

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
the model but one thing they have

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.830 
the model but one thing they have
changed<00:02:36.299> is<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:38.040> motors<00:02:38.430> now<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:39.420> older

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
changed is the motors now on the older

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.809 
changed is the motors now on the older
if<00:02:39.989> you<00:02:40.079> actually<00:02:40.260> look<00:02:40.709> really<00:02:41.250> close<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:41.730> I

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
if you actually look really close like I

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
if you actually look really close like I
put<00:02:42.030> them<00:02:42.180> both<00:02:42.510> together<00:02:42.750> like<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.799> you

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
put them both together like that and you

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.949 
put them both together like that and you
look<00:02:44.129> really<00:02:44.310> closely<00:02:44.700> you'll<00:02:45.359> actually<00:02:45.540> see

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
look really closely you'll actually see

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.440 
look really closely you'll actually see
one<00:02:46.200> motor<00:02:46.409> is<00:02:46.620> actually<00:02:46.799> taller<00:02:47.370> no<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.269> is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
one motor is actually taller no this is

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.990 
one motor is actually taller no this is
the<00:02:48.629> new<00:02:48.780> version<00:02:49.079> -<00:02:49.439> fatso<00:02:49.799> -<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.609> it<00:02:50.760> comes

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
the new version - fatso - and it comes

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.809 
the new version - fatso - and it comes
with<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.239> more<00:02:51.510> powerful<00:02:51.719> motor<00:02:52.170> no<00:02:52.950> reckoning

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
with a more powerful motor no reckoning

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.209 
with a more powerful motor no reckoning
something<00:02:54.180> about<00:02:54.329> 20%<00:02:55.019> more<00:02:55.170> powerful<00:02:55.769> now

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
something about 20% more powerful now

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.569 
something about 20% more powerful now

don't<00:03:01.530> tend<00:03:01.889> to<00:03:01.980> add<00:03:02.220> too<00:03:02.430> much<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.000> next

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
don't tend to add too much to the next

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:04.640 
don't tend to add too much to the next
row<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:03.959> not<00:03:04.169> really<00:03:04.379> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> be<00:03:04.620> a

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
row it's not really going to be a

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.129 
row it's not really going to be a
problem<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.639> the<00:03:05.760> phantom<00:03:06.239> twos<00:03:06.599> with<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
problem but on the phantom twos with the

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:09.229 
problem but on the phantom twos with the
separate<00:03:07.530> gimbal<00:03:07.980> people<00:03:08.459> used<00:03:08.609> to<00:03:08.669> add<00:03:08.909> a<00:03:08.939> lot

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
separate gimbal people used to add a lot

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:10.759 
separate gimbal people used to add a lot
of<00:03:09.269> extra<00:03:09.480> weight<00:03:09.840> with<00:03:10.049> various<00:03:10.409> things<00:03:10.650> like

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
of extra weight with various things like

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.250 
of extra weight with various things like
ground<00:03:11.250> stations<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.180> video<00:03:12.480> transmitters

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
ground stations and video transmitters

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.229 
ground stations and video transmitters
so<00:03:13.620> they<00:03:13.739> used<00:03:13.950> to<00:03:14.040> get<00:03:14.159> quite<00:03:14.340> heavy<00:03:14.879> so<00:03:14.909> on

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
so they used to get quite heavy so on

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.909 
so they used to get quite heavy so on
the<00:03:15.359> new<00:03:15.510> phantom<00:03:16.049> they've<00:03:16.439> got<00:03:16.650> more

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:16.919 
the new phantom they've got more

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:18.920 
the new phantom they've got more
powerful<00:03:17.340> motor<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.879> this<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.269> going<00:03:18.719> to<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.900> a

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
powerful motor and this is going to be a

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.140 
powerful motor and this is going to be a
lot<00:03:19.109> better<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.530> basically<00:03:20.430> creating<00:03:21.000> more

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
lot better for basically creating more

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.940 
lot better for basically creating more
thrust<00:03:21.540> so<00:03:22.049> Nick<00:03:22.169> it's<00:03:22.319> got<00:03:22.439> quite<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.650> bit<00:03:22.799> more

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
thrust so Nick it's got quite a bit more

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.129 
thrust so Nick it's got quite a bit more
trust<00:03:23.280> in<00:03:23.430> each<00:03:23.549> corner<00:03:23.939> and<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.780> slightly

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
trust in each corner and so slightly

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.020 
trust in each corner and so slightly
taller<00:03:25.319> water<00:03:25.620> also<00:03:26.250> as<00:03:26.579> we're<00:03:26.790> on<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.939> very

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
taller water also as we're on the very

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.699 
taller water also as we're on the very
tops<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.540> motors<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:27.930> slightly<00:03:28.200> different

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
tops the motors are slightly different

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.250 
tops the motors are slightly different
where<00:03:28.889> before<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:29.969> superb<00:03:30.479> picking<00:03:31.019> out<00:03:31.139> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
right propeller you were going to put on

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.360 
right propeller you were going to put on
you<00:03:33.329> they<00:03:33.449> have<00:03:33.599> that<00:03:33.750> clean<00:03:34.109> water<00:03:34.560> top<00:03:35.040> or

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
you they have that clean water top or

the black props on the new one they've
actually<00:03:39.720> coloured<00:03:40.290> them<00:03:40.440> so<00:03:40.829> you've

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
actually coloured them so you've

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:42.679 
actually coloured them so you've
actually<00:03:41.069> got<00:03:41.310> a<00:03:41.340> black<00:03:41.639> motor<00:03:41.970> for<00:03:42.419> the<00:03:42.479> black

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
of difference one other thing I did

of difference one other thing I did
notice<00:03:53.519> actually<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.329> new<00:03:54.479> transmitter

notice actually on the new transmitter

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.949 
notice actually on the new transmitter
now<00:03:56.430> see<00:03:56.699> when<00:03:57.060> you<00:03:57.090> normally<00:03:57.509> arm<00:03:57.750> your

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
now see when you normally arm your

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.569 
now see when you normally arm your

phantom you pull if it's a vision you
cool<00:03:59.759> ball<00:04:00.000> stick<00:04:00.269> send<00:04:00.540> away<00:04:00.689> and<00:04:01.409> on<00:04:01.709> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
cool ball stick send away and on the

cool ball stick send away and on the
phantom<00:04:02.220> 2<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.579> both<00:04:02.759> put<00:04:03.239> both<00:04:03.449> decks<00:04:03.750> over

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
phantom 2 you both put both decks over

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.719 
phantom 2 you both put both decks over
the<00:04:04.019> week<00:04:04.169> time<00:04:04.349> the<00:04:04.530> mortar<00:04:04.829> snow<00:04:05.099> on<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.519> new

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
the week time the mortar snow on the new

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.699 
the week time the mortar snow on the new
one<00:04:05.970> when<00:04:06.479> you<00:04:06.569> actually<00:04:06.780> armed<00:04:07.109> your<00:04:07.319> motors

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
one when you actually armed your motors

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.129 
one when you actually armed your motors
as<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.340> will<00:04:08.459> no<00:04:08.579> notice<00:04:09.090> that<00:04:09.329> this<00:04:09.810> stick

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
as you will no notice that this stick

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.199 
as you will no notice that this stick
doesn't<00:04:10.379> actually<00:04:10.680> spring<00:04:11.129> back<00:04:11.370> to<00:04:11.579> centre

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
doesn't actually spring back to centre

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.059 
doesn't actually spring back to centre
yet<00:04:12.449> it's<00:04:12.930> actually<00:04:13.290> there's<00:04:13.500> like<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.650> small

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
yet it's actually there's like a small

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.939 
yet it's actually there's like a small
catch<00:04:14.639> with<00:04:14.939> which<00:04:15.389> it<00:04:15.569> clips<00:04:15.840> into<00:04:16.109> I<00:04:16.530> think

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
catch with which it clips into I think

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.710 
catch with which it clips into I think
the<00:04:17.039> idea<00:04:17.310> so<00:04:17.489> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.699> are<00:04:17.909> Miyamoto's<00:04:18.570> them

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
the idea so if you are Miyamoto's them

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.659 
the idea so if you are Miyamoto's them
you<00:04:18.840> don't<00:04:18.959> immediately<00:04:19.349> push<00:04:20.070> the<00:04:20.250> stick<00:04:20.459> up

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
you don't immediately push the stick up

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.700 
you don't immediately push the stick up
to<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> middle<00:04:21.329> position<00:04:21.509> the<00:04:22.259> motors<00:04:22.590> will

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
to the middle position the motors will

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
to the middle position the motors will
actually<00:04:23.159> just<00:04:23.340> stop<00:04:23.639> for<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.090> but<00:04:24.449> I<00:04:24.479> think

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
actually just stop for you but I think

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.060 
actually just stop for you but I think
there's<00:04:24.840> been<00:04:24.990> maybe<00:04:25.380> more<00:04:25.680> suited<00:04:26.039> for

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
there's been maybe more suited for

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.029 
there's been maybe more suited for
things<00:04:26.550> like<00:04:26.669> the<00:04:27.139> Naza<00:04:28.139> light<00:04:28.590> blink

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
things like the Naza light blink

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.589 
things like the Naza light blink
controller<00:04:29.520> which<00:04:30.000> doesn't<00:04:30.360> have<00:04:30.479> the

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
controller which doesn't have the

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.839 
controller which doesn't have the
intelligent<00:04:31.259> angle<00:04:31.650> so<00:04:32.039> actually<00:04:32.550> when<00:04:32.729> you

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:32.849 
intelligent angle so actually when you

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.310 
intelligent angle so actually when you
arm<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.090> motors<00:04:33.509> and<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.750> stick<00:04:33.990> was<00:04:34.199> to

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
arm the motors and the stick was to

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.990 
arm the motors and the stick was to
centre<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.130> models<00:04:35.460> actually<00:04:35.610> already

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
centre the models actually already

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.510 
centre the models actually already
trying<00:04:36.330> to<00:04:36.450> take<00:04:36.599> off<00:04:36.870> cos<00:04:37.050> it

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
trying to take off cos it

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.010 
trying to take off cos it
throttle<00:04:38.090> so<00:04:38.449> I<00:04:38.479> believe<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:38.840> probably

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
throttle so I believe it's probably

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.960 
throttle so I believe it's probably
being<00:04:39.380> done<00:04:39.530> more<00:04:39.710> for<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.099> so<00:04:40.430> let's<00:04:40.789> say

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
being done more for that so let's say

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.460 
being done more for that so let's say
when<00:04:41.210> you<00:04:41.270> fill<00:04:41.419> it<00:04:41.569> back<00:04:41.690> it<00:04:41.990> will<00:04:42.080> just<00:04:42.229> look

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
when you fill it back it will just look

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.589 
when you fill it back it will just look
back<00:04:42.740> for<00:04:43.190> soon<00:04:43.340> as<00:04:43.460> you<00:04:43.550> touch<00:04:43.759> it<00:04:43.789> it<00:04:44.389> just

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
back for soon as you touch it it just

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.089 
back for soon as you touch it it just
springs<00:04:44.780> back<00:04:45.020> up<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:45.380> Center<00:04:45.770> so<00:04:45.919> on<00:04:46.069> a

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
springs back up to Center so on a

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:46.779 
springs back up to Center so on a
phantom

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
phantom

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:48.040

it'll<00:04:47.030> still<00:04:47.300> be<00:04:47.330> sitting<00:04:47.630> on<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.900> ground

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
it'll still be sitting on the ground

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.830 
it'll still be sitting on the ground
handling<00:04:48.530> idling<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:50.090> really<00:04:50.509> there's<00:04:50.690> just

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
handling idling so really there's just

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.390 
handling idling so really there's just
this<00:04:50.930> quick<00:04:51.139> short<00:04:51.500> video<00:04:51.710> just<00:04:51.919> to<00:04:52.190> show<00:04:52.220> you

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
this quick short video just to show you

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.749 
this quick short video just to show you
the<00:04:52.580> difference<00:04:52.910> of<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.270> new<00:04:53.479> version<00:04:54.259> to

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 
the difference of the new version to

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.830 
the difference of the new version to
phantom<00:04:55.759> so<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.060> will<00:04:56.210> apply<00:04:56.449> to<00:04:56.539> the

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
phantom so this will apply to the

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.370 
phantom so this will apply to the
Phantom<00:04:57.289> 2<00:04:57.500> range<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.039> the<00:04:58.340> Vision<00:04:59.060> Plus<00:04:59.509> and
