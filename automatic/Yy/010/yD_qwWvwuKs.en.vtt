00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.470

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.580
 the singer of the titty that good sequence 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.360

 he believes that the team will accept this situation from the street 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.030
 is a player who has never experienced such a situation in Zurich 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.030
 having its importance and was holder and conquered the title 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 this smart system 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.300
 of work 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.090
 we have a quality group she did not come 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 Christian sees the appreciation of the group 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.070
 and we know when valuing it is of the group when there is good 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.560
 campaign those individual objectives those with the reserves also end up 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.980
 he even talked 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.020
 in haiti on this situation you are the coach who are not 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.900
 accompanied by our work - said 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.270
 Ford reported 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.220
 he started his career 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 in place of apodi 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.760
 the easy gain 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.760
 Then I say why and even eat Brazil. 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.910
 For me, I'd stay here and see the video has a reason. 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.360
 in conversation with the situation 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 in this pavuna station 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.780
 Iraqi women's sector 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.210
 do not think that way expanded after this kate maintenance 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.950
 is an important moment in the computer system difficult moment we 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.449
 We had 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:15.909
 the great game that comes to us 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.639
 the anguish perspective of 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.569
 de dilma a regularity of competition a recession 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.950
 the staff would look for this I know it will not always be the same 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:29.329
 team set up to play well played 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 I may be the second time the company does not know 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.029
 katy perry del bosque did not have to see 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.509
 this type of decision demonstrates 

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:42.459
 and really the boss is the coach and there is not in any kind of 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.409
 external interference 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.939
 I'll do what you think is the right 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.939
 I try to be accessed on the internet site 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.889
 this profile of athletes of the team of curb and what I put that was by 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:56.809
 example the withdrawal of the event 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.609
 that's what gives us 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.069
 has nothing to say about the partners justifying the foam a quick way 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.659
 tite that has had that had a team one more time 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.829
 he is very aggressive in health 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.219
 then this happens 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:21.299
 the staff for indicting the brazilian councilman explained that in the jet culture shot 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:25.519
 during the whole time of the politician he liked to realize that he had no money 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.339
 Soon from the utah jazz as they chose to take it 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.319
 It's good to show you a little 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.029
 set aside a little here 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.029

00:03:42.029 --> 00:03:44.030

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.119
 on 4 August 2008 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:47.069
 according to the player 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.090
 the most important is the conquest of the world 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.780
 was a good performance in the first game of the final of the liberators for example but 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.869
 is constantly booed on the waterfront 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:59.239
 because at this moment of the prison he intends to spend Christmas at Christmas since 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
 three years 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.499
 where is the worst 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:17.499
 this process generates the cigarette-end pcp on the floor 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:22.289

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.900

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.949
 only they were applauded for help 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.229
 let me take up again the question 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.050
 london was pending 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.050
 maintenance of the same team that beat the palm trees 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.680
 we have all our balls stopped 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:53.059
 stop ball and leave it open 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.789
 we have a good move 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.039
 championship round 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.039
 Deborah Monteiro, who can handle it 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:08.149
