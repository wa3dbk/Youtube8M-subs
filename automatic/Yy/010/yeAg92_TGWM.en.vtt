00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
fit

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.540 
fit
obviously<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:32.360> 21<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.230> same

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
obviously it's 21 it's just the same

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.670 
obviously it's 21 it's just the same
almost<00:00:35.550> same<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.840> impossible<00:00:37.440> for

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
almost same with so it's impossible for

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.900 
almost same with so it's impossible for
it<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.800> fit<00:00:38.129> inside<00:00:39.559> anyways<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.700> want

it up so once you tighten it up

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.680 
it up so once you tighten it up
this<00:02:12.820> stays<00:02:13.230> pretty<00:02:14.230> firmly<00:02:14.590> on<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.300> that's

very snug on it so if your strobes a

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:01.050 
very snug on it so if your strobes a
little<00:04:58.689> bit<00:04:58.779> bigger<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.310> might<00:05:00.310> not<00:05:00.430> fit<00:05:00.699> so
