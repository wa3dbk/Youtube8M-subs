00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
held in with 110 millimeter bolt and the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
held in with 110 millimeter bolt and the
harness<00:01:15.810> right<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.140> just<00:01:16.710> push<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> tab<00:01:17.310> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
harness right here just push the tab and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.200 
harness right here just push the tab and
pull<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> harness<00:01:18.060> off<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.770> then<00:01:20.670> remove

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:31.730 
pull that harness off and then remove
that<00:01:21.240> 10<00:01:21.810> millimeter<00:01:22.200> bolt<00:01:30.200> now<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> ignition

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
that 10 millimeter bolt now the ignition

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.749 
that 10 millimeter bolt now the ignition
coil<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.190> lifts<00:01:32.580> right<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:34.759> now

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
coil just lifts right up and out now

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.580 
coil just lifts right up and out now
with<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.270> ignition<00:01:36.630> coil<00:01:36.990> removed<00:01:37.350> you<00:01:37.530> can

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
with the ignition coil removed you can

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.230 
with the ignition coil removed you can
see<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.950> spark<00:01:38.250> plugs<00:01:38.490> right<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.060> there

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
see the spark plugs right down in there

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.580 
see the spark plugs right down in there
so<00:01:40.520> using<00:01:41.520> an<00:01:41.759> extension<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.600> your<00:01:42.899> 5/8<00:01:43.350> inch

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so using an extension and your 5/8 inch

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.249 
so using an extension and your 5/8 inch
socket<00:01:44.369> you<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> just<00:01:45.300> remove<00:01:45.840> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
socket you want to just remove that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.550 
socket you want to just remove that
spark<00:01:46.920> plug<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> plug<00:01:52.140> doesn't<00:01:52.440> come

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
spark plug and if the plug doesn't come

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.260 
spark plug and if the plug doesn't come
right<00:01:52.590> out<00:01:52.830> then<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.430> use<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> magnet<00:01:54.060> or

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
right out then you can use a magnet or

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
right out then you can use a magnet or
pliers<00:01:54.660> to<00:01:54.960> reach<00:01:55.110> down<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.350> grab<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:56.360> you'll

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
pliers to reach down and grab it you'll

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
pliers to reach down and grab it you'll
want<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.570> set<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.899> gap<00:01:58.110> between<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.740> center

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
want to set the gap between the center

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.650 
want to set the gap between the center
electrode<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.789> ground<00:02:00.000> electrode<00:02:00.180> on

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
electrode and the ground electrode on

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.570 
electrode and the ground electrode on
this<00:02:01.259> should<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.820> 0.04<00:02:02.820> for<00:02:04.340> set<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.430> by

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
this should be 0.04 for set it by

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.180 
this should be 0.04 for set it by
sliding<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.660> spark<00:02:07.500> plugs<00:02:07.650> cool<00:02:07.830> in<00:02:07.920> between

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
sliding the spark plugs cool in between

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.109 
sliding the spark plugs cool in between
there<00:02:08.369> make<00:02:08.580> sure<00:02:08.610> there's<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.910> little

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
there make sure there's a little

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.430 
there make sure there's a little
resistance<00:02:09.570> when<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.780> pull<00:02:10.049> it<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.320> out

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
resistance when you pull it in and out

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.640 
resistance when you pull it in and out
and<00:02:10.730> then<00:02:11.810> carefully<00:02:12.810> put<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.290> spark<00:02:13.620> plug

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
and then carefully put the spark plug

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.479 
and then carefully put the spark plug
back<00:02:13.980> down<00:02:14.220> in<00:02:14.489> and<00:02:15.590> thread<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.709> in<00:02:16.799> by<00:02:16.980> hand<00:02:17.250> to

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
back down in and thread it in by hand to

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.580 
back down in and thread it in by hand to
make<00:02:17.640> sure<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.880> don't<00:02:17.970> cross<00:02:18.239> thread<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.660> once

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
make sure you don't cross thread it once

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:20.720 
make sure you don't cross thread it once
it's<00:02:19.769> seated<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.190> want<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> tighten<00:02:20.700> it
