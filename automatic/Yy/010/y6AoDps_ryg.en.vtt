 can remember why not yet got 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.349
 paws writers while famously juggling 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.239
 a variety of comedic genres from 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:29.950
 black humor then base farting 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.720
 new series not only managed to acquire 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.730
 impressive fan base but also conquer 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.350
 a large number of enemies and even up to 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.090
 so much so that the Muslim community 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.980
 once announced a head award 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.380
 the creators of the series Tray Parker and Mat 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.760
 stone wonder what the hell barbra 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.750
 Streisand did not think of it before 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 although she 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.679
 dumb but so far the fate of a guy 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.449
 favorably and they successfully continue 

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.589
 please your fans and annoy 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.899
 public by all possible 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.690
 ways recently here is a game released 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.969
 before her almost all played like a fool 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.530
 release video just now thanks damn 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.989
 great suppliers of Novosibirsk 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.309
 shops you please as never before 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.260
 everything else would be there today, we still 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.620
 talk about toys south park the stick 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.620
 of truth 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.030
 the essence is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.259
 I understand what a small mountain town 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.049
 new baby arrives 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.340
 meet it you are 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.710
 parents immediately throw you out of the house 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.289
 demanding to make new friends then more 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.909
 Yes , the color is not, but in principle, what can 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:36.039
 be easier especially in this city not 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.869
 is it true the same local children just 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.450
 this moment is completely passionate about some role-playing 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.459
 playing people against elves or whatever it is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.259
 they have each of the factions called 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.000
 dreams of taking possession of that very stick of truth 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.069
 for which we have to fight on 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.270
 throughout most of the game all this 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.429
 the action will take place against 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.110
 typical sauce Tarkovskogo fucking 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.329
 alien invasion of conspiracy 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.030
 government uprising zombie nazis 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.560
 yes they are here too, there is something personally in my 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.629
 the look already makes the game reference 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.369
 awesome residents of the city somehow no longer 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.989
 especially so many crap are surprised 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 have seen that for a few lives ahead 

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:09.039
 enough for plot and humor 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.750
 here with this all right thank god 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.400
 what kind of script did this ray take personal 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.329
 and not any left guys with 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.220
 own vision 

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:18.010
 however, the first thing I want to say about 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.989
 shelves true it is pure fan service 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.000
 and I can't say it's straight 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.829
 very good honestly confess 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.630
 the first launch was much more interesting to me 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.609
 wander through familiar places to find 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.170
 let useless but pleasant sends 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.090
 us to the original series trash 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.920
 communicate with characters about whom 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.930
 the creators themselves have long forgotten the type 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.910
 jimbo and not yes and making friends on 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.889
 place on facebook than follow the plot 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.269
 and participate in battles and I somehow 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.680
 more than sure that with the same problem 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.230
 most fans will face 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 series well small town so it 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.010
 specific pleasure for a long time not 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.780
 will drag on and for whom it is no secret that south 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.489
 park the stick of the roof is lpg 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.380
 with respect to the combat system 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.590
 the creators decided to make a very brave 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.239
 find it is not very popular step by step 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.639
 thing in the masses but individuals 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.169
 like he gives me fun 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:03.519
 what if you came across like 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.660
 games then you have particular problems 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.280
 should not arise 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.200
 actually even with the naked eye 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.510
 significantly noticeable and simplified given 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 system under ordinary player classes here 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.169
 albeit present but a special role in 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.060
 battle do not play in the battle may participate 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.069
 only 2 characters which is not good 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.440
 because available companions are pretty 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.849
 much and poyuzat want every such 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.409
 possibility of course there is but 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.120
 switching between them is wildly annoying 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:26.590
 so there is a chance that you 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.990
 spend most of the game with just 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.760
 one of 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.010
 them so i'm like that ok and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 did not poyuzal to it for example directly 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.910
 sadness itself worked too 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.290
 now not just chose used here 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.360
 still have to act with your fingers 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.750
 attack time is either beaten quick time 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.120
 events or yes timing again 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.860
 adoption concept can this trend today 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.150
 something like that is clear that 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.770
 like games timing sometimes 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.870
 used but lately somehow 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.670
 unduly often come across it 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.650
 just weird but luckily not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.510
 problematic for 2 share of the dynamics 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.290
 this feature adds during attack 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.970
 the character blinks and needs to be in time 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.760
 poke the button though whom i am telling 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.200
 then in other words the combat system here 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.820
 can be described as a casual 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.590
 stepwise which is good in principle 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.060
 most cartoon series fans 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.760
 hardly made from the same dough as 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.890
 all there mayor pg zadroty paraphrasing 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.989
 classic square enix does that for you 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.760
 what do you want and here it seems like everything to 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.799
 place even occasionally happens 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.050
 just when we are not beating up local children 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.060
 zombie nazis from the people w sister kim 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.220
 Kardashian we as I said earlier 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.140
 explore the city where side quests 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.160
 you can dial which is naturally important for 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.500
 character pumping 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.330
 go scattered riddles Allen find 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.590
 The key is available at this moment I want 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.030
 make a small digression and 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.010
 remind that the game was developed 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.230
 notorious obsidian hands from ass 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.270
 but the heart is golden entertainment well you 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.980
 know kotor 2 fallout new vegas and i dont 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.690
 I know maybe it's just me 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.460
 lucky over the same need to be to 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.070
 make a game about the console necessarily 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.110
 that is, what is there to sag I literally 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.210
 an hour before the launch of this game enjoyed 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.950
 the fifth gta which reception headquarters lead a 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.140
 as fast as sonic in a row 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.120
 in general there is a whole set of small 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.830
 shoals and defects a large number 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.200
 weekly lack of response to commands 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.000
 location construction also happens 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.890
 sometimes confusing i mean they like 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.840
 would be two-dimensional but multi-layered 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.280
 so walking along the road for example you have 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.410
 the opportunity to go for some taste 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.420
 To find a secret there and there were cases 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.980
 when the character just didn't understand what 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:23.990
 do he stuck into something invisible 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.610
 but it was worth moving it literally a couple 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.170
 millimeters how he immediately created that 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.790
 here you can go through all these 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.500
 minor flaws with interest 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.900
 offset by familiar surroundings 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.820
 fun fighting sparkling humor about 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.770
 which will also tell a couple of gentle I 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.150
 I understand perfectly that humor cartoon series 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.490
 very often and if 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.110
 not always beyond but here they are 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.340
 something right that overdone too much 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:45.950
 ass jokes 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.510
 their many features some of 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.220
 which of course are very successful 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.750
 for example, I lost wildly with reference to 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.240
 Skyrim character abilities but 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.710
 by golly, even the cartman does not fart so much 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.690
 how much does this have to do to our 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.180
 he even has special abilities 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.130
 based on farting it I do not say 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.810
 renting a marsh no ass in the world 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:04.190
 able to survive that amount 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.720
 painful manipulations which 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.280
 falls on his miserable anus 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.350
 console versions of the game these moments 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.390
 by the way cut and I can not say that 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.430
 strongly saddened by these facts some 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.050
 jokes frankly don't work for matt and 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.640
 3rd such sometimes happens but in 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.410
 the context of the half-hour episode is not 

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.060
 so noticeable but when throughout 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.610
 almost the entire plot of the video game 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.860
 fortetsya 1 not funny joke don't you dare 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.050
 fart on anyone's balls gets creepy 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.180
 offensively yes and who in their right mind will 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.890
 fart okay drove the south park 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.140
 chapter as political social 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.670
 jokes have not gone away importantly and then 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.800
 that the screenwriters pretty much walked along 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.600
 video games in general dare numerous 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.100
 stamps and nonsense with which gamers 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.590
 face so often that already 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.330
 just do not notice how the moron was laughing 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.790
 about audio diaries in games honest 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.410
 but don't care if you are too painful 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.510
 bear any jokes about fart shit 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.520
 feel free to skip this game 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.350
 there is a risk of pebbing up the tv or 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.970
 monitor otherwise the same south park the 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.800
 stick of truth into a real gift for 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:59.870
 fans of the series who will help you 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.610
 recall long forgotten events and heroes 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.320
 if you are not fans of the series 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.210
 but are not mind neighing of 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.860
 base humor and I do not see it 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.480
 nothing shame you can safely 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.100
 take up the game she really 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.200
 able to occupy you for a couple of evenings 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:14.090
 although whom I cheat you probably already in 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.260
 she played gone made her 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.300
 the opinion that I am happy 

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.400
 I will read in the comments 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.930
 I'll go try the new in flames and you look 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.780
 I will have time to make a movie while the game is still 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:31.870
 relevant to all good luck and see you soon 

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:31.870
