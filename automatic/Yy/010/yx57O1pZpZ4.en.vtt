pleasure<00:01:04.609> to<00:01:04.909> build<00:01:05.149> I<00:01:05.750> started<00:01:06.439> off<00:01:06.560> by

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
pleasure to build I started off by

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.399 
pleasure to build I started off by
really<00:01:07.159> just<00:01:07.399> doing<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> wash<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.409> it's

really just doing the wash on it it's
really<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.799> first<00:01:09.979> time<00:01:10.159> I've<00:01:10.310> done<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.520> Gundam

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
really the first time I've done a Gundam

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.330 
really the first time I've done a Gundam
with<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.119> wash<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.750> usually<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:12.469> used<00:01:12.920> done<00:01:13.219> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
too much on this here on the chest

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.590 
too much on this here on the chest
because<00:02:20.470> they<00:02:20.950> actually<00:02:21.130> came<00:02:21.520> out<00:02:21.670> well<00:02:21.850> but

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
because they actually came out well but

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.940 
because they actually came out well but
on<00:02:22.720> some<00:02:22.900> other<00:02:23.050> parts<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.410> were<00:02:23.560> kind<00:02:23.770> of

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
on some other parts that were kind of

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.000 
on some other parts that were kind of
hard<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> rub<00:02:24.550> off<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.560> what<00:02:26.709> I<00:02:26.740> mean<00:02:26.890> by

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
hard to rub off on and what I mean by

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.400 
hard to rub off on and what I mean by
rubbing<00:02:27.340> off<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.790> plastic<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.230> piece

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
rubbing off it's a plastic it's a piece

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.710 
rubbing off it's a plastic it's a piece
of<00:02:29.440> plastic<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.250> decal<00:02:31.060> printed<00:02:31.450> on<00:02:31.540> one

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
of plastic with the decal printed on one

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.380 
of plastic with the decal printed on one
side<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.200> rub<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.980> off<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.520> sticks<00:02:33.880> to

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
side and you rub it off and it sticks to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.540 
side and you rub it off and it sticks to
the<00:02:34.420> figure<00:02:34.840> so<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.050> not<00:02:35.170> actually<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.770> decal

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
the figure so it's not actually a decal

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.100 
the figure so it's not actually a decal
that<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.760> peel<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> stick<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.720> rub<00:02:37.989> it

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
that you peel and stick it you rub it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.010 
that you peel and stick it you rub it
off<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:39.550> tried<00:02:39.940> various<00:02:40.390> things<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:40.810> tried

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
off and I tried various things I tried

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.930 
off and I tried various things I tried
guitar<00:02:41.380> picks<00:02:41.650> which<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.400> thought<00:02:42.640> would<00:02:42.790> work

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
guitar picks which I thought would work

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.110 
guitar picks which I thought would work
very<00:02:43.000> well<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:44.530> ended<00:02:45.160> up<00:02:45.340> just<00:02:45.520> using<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.910> pen

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
very well I ended up just using a pen

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.550 
very well I ended up just using a pen
which<00:02:46.300> I<00:02:46.420> thought<00:02:46.630> would<00:02:46.780> be<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:47.170> worst<00:02:47.350> way

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
which I thought would be the worst way

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.199 
which I thought would be the worst way
to<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.830> it<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.160> the<00:02:48.250> pen<00:02:48.459> actually<00:02:48.880> work<00:02:49.060> the

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
to do it and the pen actually work the

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.780 
to do it and the pen actually work the
best<00:02:49.530> what<00:02:50.530> I<00:02:50.560> did<00:02:50.739> is<00:02:50.830> I<00:02:50.920> cut<00:02:51.130> out<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.400> decals

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
best what I did is I cut out the decals

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.300 
best what I did is I cut out the decals
I<00:02:51.910> needed<00:02:52.239> I<00:02:52.420> taped<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.290> up<00:02:53.500> with<00:02:53.680> scotch

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
I needed I taped them up with scotch

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.009 
I needed I taped them up with scotch
tape<00:02:54.610> around<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.090> edges<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.630> then<00:02:55.690> I<00:02:55.840> just

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
tape around the edges and then I just

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.470 
tape around the edges and then I just
rubbed<00:02:56.230> them<00:02:56.350> on<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:57.310> side<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.940> had<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.450> a

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
together and I literally just put the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.060 
together and I literally just put the
little<00:03:46.480> pointy<00:03:46.870> brush<00:03:47.140> into<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.620> thin<00:03:47.920> air

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
little pointy brush into the thin air

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.910 
little pointy brush into the thin air
with<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.310> black<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.820> just<00:03:49.540> touch<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.590> panel

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
with the black and just touch the panel

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.090 
with the black and just touch the panel
line<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.340> it<00:03:51.579> literally<00:03:51.910> just<00:03:52.060> fills<00:03:52.750> in<00:03:53.100> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
line and it literally just fills in the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.190 
line and it literally just fills in the
panel<00:03:54.400> lines<00:03:54.549> perfectly<00:03:55.030> and<00:03:55.360> if<00:03:55.570> it<00:03:56.019> comes

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
panel lines perfectly and if it comes

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.300 
panel lines perfectly and if it comes
out<00:03:56.350> a<00:03:56.410> little<00:03:56.530> bit<00:03:56.709> sloppy<00:03:56.860> you<00:03:57.070> can<00:03:57.190> always

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
out a little bit sloppy you can always

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.550 
out a little bit sloppy you can always
take<00:03:57.519> a<00:03:57.549> q-tip<00:03:57.970> with<00:03:58.030> thinner<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.750> wipe<00:03:59.380> off

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
take a q-tip with thinner and wipe off

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.650 
take a q-tip with thinner and wipe off
the<00:03:59.590> rest<00:03:59.860> and<00:04:00.670> that's<00:04:00.820> gonna<00:04:00.940> be<00:04:01.120> my<00:04:01.269> method

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
the rest and that's gonna be my method

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.870 
the rest and that's gonna be my method
from<00:04:01.750> now<00:04:02.019> on<00:04:02.230> because<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:03.040> can<00:04:03.310> kind<00:04:03.519> of<00:04:03.670> get

can't do that with a gun to marker you

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.229 
can't do that with a gun to marker you
could<00:04:17.440> do<00:04:17.560> nice<00:04:17.799> clean<00:04:18.190> panel<00:04:18.549> lines<00:04:18.700> but<00:04:18.910> gun

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
could do nice clean panel lines but gun

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.550 
could do nice clean panel lines but gun
the<00:04:19.359> markers<00:04:19.720> but<00:04:19.900> if<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.109> want<00:04:20.289> to<00:04:20.380> get<00:04:20.530> a

the markers but if you want to get a
little<00:04:20.859> bit<00:04:21.630> kind<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.690> weathering

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349

you're<00:04:24.070> gonna<00:04:24.160> have<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.430> do<00:04:24.580> it<00:04:24.729> with

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
you're gonna have to do it with

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.440 
you're gonna have to do it with
brush<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.010> I<00:04:27.040> don't<00:04:27.640> know<00:04:27.790> what<00:04:28.060> else<00:04:28.240> I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
brush so and I don't know what else I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.000 
brush so and I don't know what else I
can<00:04:28.510> say<00:04:28.660> about<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.230> it<00:04:29.410> obviously<00:04:29.800> is

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
can say about this it obviously is

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.440 
can say about this it obviously is
articulated<00:04:30.790> I'm<00:04:30.910> not<00:04:31.030> going<00:04:31.150> to<00:04:31.210> show<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
articulated I'm not going to show the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.060 
articulated I'm not going to show the
articulation<00:04:31.600> because<00:04:32.260> this<00:04:32.380> is<00:04:32.530> a<00:04:32.560> model<00:04:32.890> kit

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
articulation because this is a model kit

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.250 
articulation because this is a model kit
it's<00:04:33.250> not<00:04:33.370> really<00:04:33.580> meant<00:04:33.790> to<00:04:33.850> be<00:04:34.260> articulated

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
it's not really meant to be articulated

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.140 
it's not really meant to be articulated
like<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.470> toy<00:04:35.800> you<00:04:35.980> put<00:04:36.250> it<00:04:36.370> in<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.700> position

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
like a toy you put it in the position

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.730 
like a toy you put it in the position
that<00:04:37.240> you<00:04:37.360> want<00:04:37.480> and<00:04:37.690> that's<00:04:37.750> it

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
that you want and that's it

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.710 
that you want and that's it
not<00:04:39.250> saying<00:04:39.550> it's<00:04:39.850> gonna<00:04:40.000> break<00:04:40.330> or<00:04:40.540> anything

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
not saying it's gonna break or anything

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.320 
not saying it's gonna break or anything
but<00:04:41.020> it's<00:04:41.680> a<00:04:41.770> little<00:04:41.890> bit<00:04:42.100> fiddly<00:04:42.340> it's<00:04:43.090> very

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
but it's a little bit fiddly it's very

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.810 
but it's a little bit fiddly it's very
lightweight<00:04:44.250> so<00:04:45.250> it's<00:04:45.370> not<00:04:45.490> something<00:04:45.760> you

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
lightweight so it's not something you

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.580 
lightweight so it's not something you
want<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.060> fiddle<00:04:46.570> around<00:04:46.720> with<00:04:46.930> too<00:04:47.110> much<00:04:47.290> but

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
want to fiddle around with too much but

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.980 
want to fiddle around with too much but
it<00:04:47.890> does<00:04:47.920> have<00:04:48.310> excellent<00:04:49.060> articulation<00:04:49.750> just

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.610 
actually has the core fighter here I
wanted<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.800> show<00:05:32.860> you<00:05:32.980> that<00:05:33.930> pop<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.170> bad<00:05:35.410> boy

out

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
out

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.180 
out
well<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.660> booster<00:05:38.080> section<00:05:38.290> stayed<00:05:38.800> in<00:05:38.980> there

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
well the booster section stayed in there

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:40.890 
well the booster section stayed in there
so<00:05:39.340> just<00:05:39.370> pretend<00:05:39.880> the<00:05:39.970> booster<00:05:40.270> section<00:05:40.540> is

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
so just pretend the booster section is

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.030 
so just pretend the booster section is
attached<00:05:41.320> to<00:05:41.470> this<00:05:41.650> right<00:05:42.430> here

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
attached to this right here

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:50.670 
attached to this right here
so<00:05:45.040> this<00:05:45.220> transforms<00:05:47.190> like<00:05:48.190> so<00:05:48.640> and<00:05:49.180> then<00:05:50.110> the

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
so this transforms like so and then the

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.200 
so this transforms like so and then the
little<00:05:50.919> wing<00:05:51.040> set<00:05:51.280> you<00:05:51.370> got<00:05:51.460> to<00:05:51.580> put<00:05:51.760> on<00:05:51.910> I
