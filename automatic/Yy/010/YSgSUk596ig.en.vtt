00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:20.180
 I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.190
 a delicious Bolivian dish more 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.040
 specifically from my hometown the 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:30.150
 peace this dish of course is called 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.950
 La Paz dish is very typical of 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.309
 well I want to teach them so that 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.530
 learn cooking something rich something new 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.210
 and the truth is that it is very very 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.550
 simple the truth is that they do not have to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.090
 do almost nothing really good the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 dish consists only of corn 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.600
 to valverde 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.810
 that frying and good to give you a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.620
 special touch to those of us who are lovers 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.410
 beef steak we add one 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.110
 Roasted as we say 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:11.300
 the ingredients abuse more than all 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:15.710
 they're going to be a little bit of salt 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:18.650
 and of course water to boil the 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.409
 abbas and the choclos ok well let's go to 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.409
 put the corn on them look how they look at 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.750
 tasty and good we will put it to the 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.190
 pot that good I was already putting them 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.120
 I was already boiling the water 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.280
 little to warm it 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.660
 just to buy time because to me 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.310
 husband is already going to arrive he will arrive with 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.320
 hungry and imagine, I'm not going to 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.660
 leave waiting poor after a 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.250
 long day of work you have to consent 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.660
 the husband like that already and they are going to take good 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.250
 sorry that the cameras do not mean 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.130
 moved but the truth is that it is very 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.150
 difficult to shoot with one hand and record with 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.600
 the other 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.090
 I say come until they are happening in the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:02.140
 ideas to shoot with one hand and be 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.840
 exposing the ingredients color ok to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.619
 the pot of corn we only leave it 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 well and well, well, we're going to 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.150
 add a little bit of this 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.390
 public do this you know how to give them 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.660
 a little taste cited a lot 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.640
 neither but more or less already the pot of 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.280
 beans because nothing just leave it like that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.370
 and she already solitates things you do not need 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.470
 some because at lunchtime we 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.140
 to you remember that we are going to 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.250
 eat without the peel 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.770
 let's peel well we leave it there we go 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.990
 to let it reach the point of 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.090
 boil 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.280
 and already if it is well cooked and everything 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.080
 depending on whether or not we take it out of the fire 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.560
 still ok and the beans have reached 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.860
 cooking point are soft are already 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.320
 ready to serve now let's continue 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.760
 cooking here look I have a pan 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.310
 you know 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.730
 while those respects there those waste 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.620
 waste is because I previously already 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.950
 I was doing a few roasts and 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.950
 your 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:23.580
 and let's see how our guys are 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.530
 I was watching and they are not yet 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.400
 soft do not have or will not reach a 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.430
 soft point 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.860
 ends because it is a letter of them 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.180
 but for now let's prepare the 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.340
 steak let's season a little bit with 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 salt I always put the salt as 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.030
 a height 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.209
 well, even 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.209
 something considerable and they can put it already 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.660
 be that only something can add a 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:57.980
 little bit of ajinomoto also that they give 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.360
 your little sweetie already and that's why I 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.830
 I miss you because 8 out 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.840
 Pretty is going to fix everything Miranda 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.840
 the cane and put it at random 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:16.510
 and with the spatula like that and now I'm going to 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.910
 proceed to be good as it can be a 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.590
 little bit and I have here is good I have 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.800
 the top of these promotions I have these 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.710
 spares 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.750
 where I put it and it always left half 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.360
 uncovered so that the meats to the kurbi 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.659
 services meanwhile let's leave 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.520
 that for now I'm going to start cutting the 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.729
 cheese and then we're going to fry it 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.879
 as well 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.430

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:46.809

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:51.339

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.650
 public of the asado as enough and 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:04.349
 You can put tasty pieces of 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.349
 cheese that I have already cut in slices like this 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.980
 and they put it there 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.720
 and they let it fry there a little and 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.770
 meanwhile I'm going to grab and I'm going to 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:20.280
 start serving a dish 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.560
