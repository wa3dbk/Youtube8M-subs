after you've done that that's probably

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
after you've done that that's probably
the<00:00:58.590> hardest<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> mission<00:00:59.280> he's<00:00:59.730> gonna

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
run on follow you'll do jump across here

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.440 
run on follow you'll do jump across here
and<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.789> another<00:01:02.879> cutscene

from<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.380> fall<00:02:01.190> head<00:02:02.190> on<00:02:02.310> over<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.580> far

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
from the fall head on over to the far

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.060 
from the fall head on over to the far
right<00:02:03.030> jump<00:02:03.300> over<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> year<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.530> marker

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
right jump over to the year the marker

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
right jump over to the year the marker
the<00:02:05.220> yellow<00:02:05.340> marker<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.090> then<00:02:06.899> there's<00:02:07.080> two

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the yellow marker and then there's two

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.620 
the yellow marker and then there's two
people<00:02:07.770> from<00:02:07.890> out<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.130> windows<00:02:08.429> over<00:02:08.789> there

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.309 

now<00:02:12.630> suppose

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.690 

and<00:02:17.650> I<00:02:18.219> believe<00:02:18.609> that<00:02:18.999> that<00:02:19.749> is<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.609> again<00:02:21.609> way

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and I believe that that is it again way
