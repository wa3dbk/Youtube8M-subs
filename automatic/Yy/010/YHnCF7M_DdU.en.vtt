00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.910
 in fact to summarize first the 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.670
 expertise 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.470
 it's actually getting someone 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.980
 qualified to watch the boat at the 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:20.089
 place of the buyer so the expert he goes 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.089
 go there how to say examined several 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:25.159
 posts whose lively works under the 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.509
 floatation and the dead works at 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.939
 above haying so the hull in 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:33.710
 general in the works 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:37.190
 he will examine the keel we can see 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.570
 down below the boat a little heel we 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.360
 to say anyone can see but 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.040
 after what is needed is to see if 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
 repercussions inside the boat 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.930
 on the structure and that often it's 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.120
 the expert who can diagnose what 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.690
 is dangerous or not dangerous then 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.920
 well, we can get closer to the back 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:01.850
 we have here the line of arms 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.159
 then the rudder then on a 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.130
 on a hull there is also a thing 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.380
 the main thing we check is the los 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.409
 pause the osmosis it's an infiltration 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.869
 water that can form blisters 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:19.590
 we just scratch fooling lenses and 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:22.259
 to the humidity measurements of the gel coat 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.670
 and depending on the rate we decide if there 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.100
 is more or less osmosis and now 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 we're going to talk about remorse trailers 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.869
 so all that is above the 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.240
 flotation 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.329
 in a general way we will look at 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.110
 if there is no evidence of shock or 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.509
 repair and in addition we examine the coke 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.880
 in its color so more or less 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.270
 brilliant and then we realize that in fact 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.899
 it is marbled is somewhat yellowed in 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 does the gelcoat tend to change 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.909
 in time it starts to become more 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.520
 or less floury and more or less 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.579
 attacked by the uv is precisely is 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.950
 jonnie like that we walk on a bridge in 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.209
 teak 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.349
 when he's on the boat and we have to 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.450
 buy the boat you have to check that 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.670
 the bridge is not to be changed if the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.410
 deteriorate it will be very expensive to 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.269
 redo once we've examined the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.849
 protect at that moment we inspect 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.129
 all parties we see blanket who 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.860
 are gelcoat is there so it's the same 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.769
 look like on the hull see if there is 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.090
 failure to see if age brightness of default 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:31.200
 and then the portholes 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:34.590
 afterwards in the cockpit we examine the 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.319
 rich we look at sister corners finally 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.989
 the whole of the deck hardware so 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.019
 get rid of it, let's look to see 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:47.310
 if it is not flambÃ© but we can roll 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.040
 examine on the back and on the side 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.290
 once we have examined that we examine 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.579
 rigging at least in parts 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.319
 low 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.669
 it's a visual examination so we do not 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.069
 radiography of things like that but 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.419
 we do a nearly complete review of 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.989
 the entire base of the rigging in the 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.849
 expertise 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.900
 following the external visit have made 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.459
 the inside did the inside 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.290
 why because we're going to look at any 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.299
 the structure of which we will examine the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.919
 counters mold to examine in the 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.690
 chests inside 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.669
 so there we have reinforcements of the veranda 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.930
 so we're going to look for cracks 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:20.430
 which would put the structure in danger 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.250
 happens on the whole boat that 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.440
 can happen on the pontics is here 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.540
 who supports the mast it can be worn 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.370
 spend in the funds or so on the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.290
 partitions 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.780
 the hull bridge connection we see 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.659
 appear here with bolting on 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 cadenas also that they are bolted to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.569
 outside so we have ten years a vision 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.200
 general to launch from this 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.060
 expertise 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.950
 we mainly give technical advice 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.829
 technical advice on points 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.060
 positive and negative points 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:55.920
 after value it's something else 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.870
 value it depends so much on the market 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:02.940
 that we will venture to the value that in 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.410
 last resort it's really giving 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.859
 a value anyway but rather 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.859
 a fork 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.440
 no
