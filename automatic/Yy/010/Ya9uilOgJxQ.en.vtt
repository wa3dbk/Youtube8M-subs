 It's heavy I'm alone I'm alone, but people who can not die very much are dead passable 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.520
 It's not a dead play Zoro Domenico 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:23.770

 I know why I understand why anyway 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.880
 It is impossible for a person who has become such a body to return to the original 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.810
 That means 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:20.180

 It's related but hey 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:53.610
 The reason I couldn't say in the end was that they had resistance to get them to touch the dark part of the waver 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.530
 It is because I thought that I would not die if I did not die after all 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.150
 Anyway, I 'm going to water 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:05.250

 How many have you been growing up since the time of being a kid?

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:35.460

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.910
 Oh I'm sure I'm always going to do what I'm doing 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.190

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.730

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:56.409
 While thinking about the childhood friend Crea Stanfield, who is accustomed not to die everyday 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.980

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:03.440

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.260

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:28.569
 It's still early to think about it seriously 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:32.529
 Even though my body has changed, the contents have not changed 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:35.669

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.669
