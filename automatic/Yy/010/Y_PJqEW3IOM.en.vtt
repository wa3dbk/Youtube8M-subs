00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.610
 hello this program is entertaining 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.530
 aerobatics and I am leading oscar first release 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.930
 our heading we told you about 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.660
 main controls and nodes 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.460
 of the aircraft in this edition we are available 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.290
 form will tell you about the basic techniques 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 flying in the battle framing he 's not 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.339
 is a reception directly 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.260
 aerobatics air combat on nevertheless 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.899
 allows you to take advantage before 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.760
 start of the battle essentially framing this 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.530
 climb that will allow you to take 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.170
 air combat the most convenient position 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.030
 except for the attack of a possible opponent 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.040
 addition climb allows you to get 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.270
 tangible potential energy 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.970
 which can be any moment 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 converted to speed is important to understand 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.960
 which is not an advantage for every aircraft 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.729
 height will be quite useful as 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.040
 each machine has its own effective 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.840
 application heights and some simply not 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.549
 able to climb enough for 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 gaining height advantage 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.600
 nevertheless advantage height 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.610
 often allows you to start an air battle 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.380
 the first and the enemy impose his 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:37.359
 dive initiative represents your 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.950
 simple and universal manner which 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.109
 varies in style of performance in 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.119
 Depending on the task at 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.490
 Essentially you just send the plane to the ground 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.079
 at a certain angle to accelerate 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.149
 performance of this maneuver is worth 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:51.369
 turn the car over the cream 180 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.609
 degrees and pull the handle over it 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.329
 significantly speed up walking to manaus 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.670
 diving can be like 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.429
 defensive as well as attacking and followed 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.139
 distinguish them from a defensive dive 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.149
 applied on machines capable of fast 

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.729
 increase the distance to the pursuer 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.560
 using the speed dial in this case 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.810
 all you have to do is enter the maneuver and 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.459
 survive the cradle while doing 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.080
 this maneuver you must sensibly evaluate 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.760
 speed capabilities of your car 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.980
 relative to the pursuer car 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.720
 case if the opponent is insignificant 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.580
 inferior to you power speed and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 dynamics is the application of this manner 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.420
 can 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.970
 you will fail to land the enemy 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.920
 on 6 dives to attack is applied in 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.900
 If you have tangible 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.760
 superior height over the enemy 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.430
 in this case, you must select a position 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.410
 for attack execute move maneuver lower 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.390
 thrust for successful aiming and if 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.130
 it's not enough to release flaps a 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
 then attack the target 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.550
 then you can use 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.020
 the energy gained during a dive 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.160
 leaving on height for the purpose of repeated 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.350
 approaching the target 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.239
 this maneuver is called burzum and 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.069
 used on fairly powerful machines 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.030
 able to repeatedly go on 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.040
 next run 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.320
 garage is the most common 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.269
 maneuvers in combat many beginners use 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.760
 buy more and exclusively this maneuver without 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.590
 combination with others is due to those 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
 that simple mirage is performed very 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.019
 just at the clinic to release your plane 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.040
 flaps and pull the handle towards you 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.570
 reduce maneuver time 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.540
 help the following actions 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.340
 flap release and reduced thrust also 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.959
 varies roll values ​​you can 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.220
 help and with the help of the prowl that 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.950
 will have a beneficial effect on time 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.930
 maneuver through work 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.180
 gas you can influence the shape of your 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.709
 maneuver but who if you will 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.100
 go through the whole maneuver with a minimum 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.140
 pounding 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.530
 you will lose all your energy very quickly 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.970
 what will give the enemy a barrel advantage 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.430
 is an even simpler maneuver 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.200
 air combat than the turn represents 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.750
 your plane coup along the longitudinal 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.150
 Axis conservation course can be divided into two 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.130
 type execution of this maneuver first 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.720
 type of simple barrel which is performed 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.519
 only rotation of the aircraft along 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.620
 longitudinal axis using aileron 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.450
 a simple barrel can only slightly 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.750
 employee aiming what can help 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.160
 only dealt with an inexperienced opponent 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.530
 more complex options smeared barrel 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.390
 it is performed with a slightly squeezed handle 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.190
 on itself so the plane and 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.350
 rotation relative to the longitudinal axis 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.970
 describes this spiral around it 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.470
 defensive manner brought us 8 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.660
 speeds are very effective in that case 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.239
 if the distance to the enemy is extremely small 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.370
 Your task will be to reset the traction 0 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.380
 start the car abruptly into a maneuver 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.660
 flaps the case your pursuer 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.820
 if he is not experienced enough will pass 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.340
 trail the pursuit of ski and wrap 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.450
 around her spiral or he will start 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.180
 spin yourself in this 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.710
 do not lie but it is no longer the 6 most successful 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.780
 is the application of a smeared barrel 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.460
 right after the splif maneuver which 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.730
 is a reverse figure 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.350
 immelman aerobatics milman 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.180
 designed for quick classes 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.610
 convenient to attack opponents position 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.290
 directly after convergence 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.090
 it is performed as follows 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.530
 discrepancies or earlier 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.900
 depending on the situation 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.120
 release flaps handle extreme on 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.190
 yourself after passing the half loop 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.380
 leveling the plane horizon aileron and 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.080
 that if your opponent is not experienced 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.330
 or does not see you you will be higher 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.000
 above that opens the perfect fire 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.950
 positions in the event that you spend 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.600
 one-on-one battle with enough experienced 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.150
 the opponent is most likely you 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:14.220
 waiting for output either sabers mono or with 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.900
 combat reversal in this case 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.890
 fire contact will occur at the top 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.930
 half loop parts 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.030
 when performing immelman it is important to work 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.280
 thrusts don't drive cars to uncomfortable for 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.840
 you mode and so for example very 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.760
 keep my speed short 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.260
 effective maneuverable since the top 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.300
 parts of the half loop you have problems 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.670
 with digestion machine and also 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.440
 outputting it to level flight in order to 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.750
 Definition will close for you access to 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.160
 firing position is similar if you 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.930
 exceed optimum speed 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.390
 passing maneuver then at that moment 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.430
 when the enemy opens fire to you above 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.430
 you will complete the half loop 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.960
 in this issue we told you about 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.069
 the basic techniques of flying in combat 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.530
 the next issue we have more 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:02.690
 dwell on such figures as burzum 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:05.060
 and her split and fighting turn with you was 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:08.120
