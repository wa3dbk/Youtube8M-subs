00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.660
 ae 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.970
 I heard neither work nor was a country 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 sharing will create anything that 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.410
 had to do with me and that in the future 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.550
 be a sustainable project that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.090
 enjoyed from behind 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.280
 the idea came up like so many others 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.860
 it was a man I was back like that 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.960
 turn small objects and then to 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.900
 leave the furniture at the mall or just to 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.810
 unix and independent received good 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.560
 criticism and said no but why not 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.140
 There is business and I thought, damn, mother. 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.020
 it was something i record doing eee 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.890
 I have discovered that sometimes it is that the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.200
 wind filled with those of the pleasures ram 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.910
 is at a greater depth and the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.229
 work stays in fight and not in 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.740
 We need to work longer hours. 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.110
 important to discover that the taste for 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.970
 transformation of the object was a 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.869
 after that I took an online course 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.680
 and hence the execution of the project 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.680
 it was a bit like that 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.210
 I keep doing what I do is 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.570
 and treats the part of the cast of a 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.970
 I have now is working given the way 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.070
 this is what an uncle who lived if there is 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.700
 some room for maneuver in order to 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.720
 think about a project the economic part instead 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.520
 I do not cry 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.940
 I still have the same job and 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.080
 help in the economical part that I am mother 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.080
 will come and I will do it but the creative 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.750
 with a mass transforms the furniture and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.600
 This one I more or less works for 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:20.300
 tanks or and your gift and it does not work 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:23.790
 more on the backside now your neighbors 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.590
 ask if I want the furniture and the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.570
 reality the option of making a brief 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.670
 and we almost always stayed 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.330
 with it only when there is nothing at all 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.280
 do 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.170
 when it does not compensate, it is not the work that 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.790
 we have to deal with them 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
 does not later compensate the final price 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.680
 important issue this furniture is 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.870
 only a sample of what is possible to be 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.400
 done by each customer does not have an idea 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.130
 and we try to build a story to 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.650
 back and see if you are going to make an object 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.120
 insertion in the contact they want 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.790
 usually people already come with a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.890
 very cool idea and really like the taste 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.019
 cruise give wings in the imagination and 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.910
 delete create something that no one else has 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.130
 that even that is God that was made 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.230
 thinking that do not give ideas 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.180
 Our idea is important and we can 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.970
 be even more creative because sometimes 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.100
 limited work in the sense that 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.049
 things already come pre-defined and there are things 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.760
 which we do not like much to do as in 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.239
 any job i love this job 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.739
 but lease from white is not far 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.090
 the thing you like to do that 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.220
 we were just we're already 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.410
 to realize this idea of creating some 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.650
 workshops were searched in the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.019
 people would like to do is exactly 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.780
 what we do the new ones themselves 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.930
 and that he does not have any more he has no technique and 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.370
 then it 's hard to have a little more time 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 to be able to create for example a line 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.410
 because I have two children and I 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:48.130
 it's almost impossible not to think news and 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.480
 and I think it 's a bet your lens 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.370
 because children are much more 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.350
 They are much more permeable and when 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.880
 has sometimes color the work 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.040
 people get a little efficient because 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.260
 does not match with the continued with the other 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.480
 staff was the fourth panel salt and the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.920
 children are much more permeable then 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.030
 almost everything is allowed and the credibility 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.030
 there is almost no limit 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.879
 I think signage think we 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.870
 we do not produce the mass we make 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:21.459
 a product that is only we bet on 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.949
 quality of our products have 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.790
 quality and are made to think 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:29.710
 finish two specific people and 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:32.320
 everyone has a story behind 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.870
 we keep the legacies of the pieces and we have 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:37.330
 that things are used not 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.340
 we want to come in and change your 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.320
 personality and a house such as 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.150
 when we in the times we are in 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.780
 a style our home should also be 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:50.169
 but the more appropriate reflection and think 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.410
 big bet to enter a house and will have 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.700
 his personality and reflected in the space 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.320
 about to enter this summer of all 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.630
 products that have seats to the i that the 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.220
 the live the recipe 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:04.229
 I think the bet was that it was a 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.229
 different and customized product
