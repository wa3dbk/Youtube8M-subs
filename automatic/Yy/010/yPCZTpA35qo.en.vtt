00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
little bit of a nerf at least in some

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.570 
little bit of a nerf at least in some
areas<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.539> Razorback<00:00:19.170> SMG<00:00:19.890> this

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
areas and that is the Razorback SMG this

areas and that is the Razorback SMG this
thing<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> actually<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.720> my<00:00:22.289> hands<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.740> least

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
thing is actually in my hands at least

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
thing is actually in my hands at least
it<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> better<00:00:23.609> than<00:00:23.939> most<00:00:24.269> assault<00:00:24.779> rifles<00:00:25.199> at

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
it is better than most assault rifles at

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.070 
it is better than most assault rifles at
that<00:00:25.890> mid<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.400> even<00:00:26.699> somewhat<00:00:27.119> longer<00:00:27.449> ranges

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
that mid to even somewhat longer ranges

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.650 
that mid to even somewhat longer ranges
this<00:00:28.320> thing<00:00:28.470> has<00:00:28.619> almost<00:00:28.920> no<00:00:29.369> recoil<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.090> seems

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
this thing has almost no recoil it seems

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.720 
this thing has almost no recoil it seems
to<00:00:30.779> be<00:00:30.900> quite<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.289> high<00:00:31.590> damage<00:00:31.890> assault<00:00:32.489> era

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
to be quite a high damage assault era

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.970 
to be quite a high damage assault era
SMG<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.930> almost<00:00:34.230> call<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.739> assault

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
SMG as well I almost call it an assault

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.500 
SMG as well I almost call it an assault
rifle<00:00:35.010> because<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.640> acts<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.030> an<00:00:36.239> assault

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
rifle because it acts like an assault

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.319 
rifle because it acts like an assault
rifle<00:00:36.570> it<00:00:37.290> still<00:00:37.559> excels<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.250> close<00:00:38.640> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
rifle it still excels up close this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
rifle it still excels up close this
thing<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:39.750> an<00:00:39.840> absolute<00:00:40.020> beast<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.890> you'll

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
thing is an absolute beast and you'll

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.740 
thing is an absolute beast and you'll
probably<00:00:41.340> if<00:00:41.879> you've<00:00:42.120> run<00:00:42.300> into<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.510> lot<00:00:42.719> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
probably if you've run into a lot of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.260 
probably if you've run into a lot of
really<00:00:43.110> good<00:00:43.260> players<00:00:43.520> you<00:00:44.520> probably<00:00:44.820> looked

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really good players you probably looked

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
really good players you probably looked
at<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> kill<00:00:45.660> feat<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.079> seen<00:00:46.590> like

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
gun this is the one overpowered gun in

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.319 
gun this is the one overpowered gun in
the<00:00:52.440> game<00:00:52.590> right<00:00:52.800> now<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.250> don't<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.030> like

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the game right now I don't really like

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180 
the game right now I don't really like
to<00:00:54.449> throw<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.870> word<00:00:55.020> overpowered<00:00:55.710> around<00:00:55.980> but

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
to throw the word overpowered around but

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.860 
to throw the word overpowered around but
this<00:00:56.340> one<00:00:56.579> definitely<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> need

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
this one definitely is going to need

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.619 
this one definitely is going to need
some<00:00:58.199> form<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.800> nerf<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.789> me<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.239> needs

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
some form of a nerf to me it just needs

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.209 
some form of a nerf to me it just needs
a<00:01:00.780> little<00:01:00.809> bit<00:01:01.140> more<00:01:01.320> recoil<00:01:01.770> you'll<00:01:01.980> probably

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
a little bit more recoil you'll probably

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.799 
a little bit more recoil you'll probably
see<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> couple<00:01:02.760> times<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.239> game<00:01:03.420> play<00:01:03.660> I'm

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
see a couple times in this game play I'm

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.230 
see a couple times in this game play I'm
melting<00:01:04.439> people<00:01:04.920> at<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.159> distance<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
melting people at a distance that I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.580 
melting people at a distance that I
don't<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:06.689> I<00:01:06.780> should<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.960> melting<00:01:07.320> people

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
don't think I should be melting people

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.039 
don't think I should be melting people
at<00:01:07.710> because<00:01:08.070> with<00:01:08.670> an<00:01:08.790> assault<00:01:09.090> rifle<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.570> don't

so<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.630> red<00:01:36.810> dot<00:01:36.960> sight<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.380> makes<00:01:37.560> me<00:01:37.710> feel

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
so the red dot sight just makes me feel

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.499 
so the red dot sight just makes me feel
a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.310> bit<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.640> confident<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.210> my

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
a little bit more confident about my

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.990 
a little bit more confident about my
crossmap<00:01:40.020> shots<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:41.280> use<00:01:41.579> quick-draw

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
crossmap shots I also use quick-draw

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
crossmap shots I also use quick-draw
grip<00:01:42.240> but<00:01:42.360> that's<00:01:42.540> simply<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:42.899> that's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
grip but that's simply because that's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.289 
grip but that's simply because that's
pretty<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.759> unlocked<00:01:45.090> right

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
pretty well all I have unlocked right

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.740 
pretty well all I have unlocked right
now<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> grip<00:01:45.979> quick<00:01:46.979> draw<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:48.299> red<00:01:48.540> dot

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
now is grip quick draw and the red dot

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
now is grip quick draw and the red dot
sight<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> just<00:01:49.649> unlocked<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:50.009> few

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
sight and now I just unlocked a few

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.410 
sight and now I just unlocked a few
things<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.490> laser<00:01:50.729> sight<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.149> things<00:01:51.270> like

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
things like laser sight and things like

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.270 
things like laser sight and things like
that<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:52.049> I'll<00:01:52.530> probably<00:01:52.680> end<00:01:52.979> up<00:01:53.070> switching

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that so I'll probably end up switching

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.859 
that so I'll probably end up switching
quick-draw<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.939> laser<00:01:54.090> sight<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.630> playing

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
quick-draw for laser sight and playing

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
quick-draw for laser sight and playing
around<00:01:54.990> without<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.590> bit<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.430> far

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
around without a little bit but so far

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
around without a little bit but so far
that's<00:01:57.000> how<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.479> run<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.899> gun<00:01:58.170> let<00:01:58.890> me
