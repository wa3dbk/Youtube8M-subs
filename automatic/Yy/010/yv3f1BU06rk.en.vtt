00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
underrated gun video on the scar I do

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.380 
underrated gun video on the scar I do
the<00:02:04.680> test<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> scar<00:02:05.640> dis<00:02:05.790> find<00:02:06.180> its

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
the test with the scar dis find its

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.169 
the test with the scar dis find its
three<00:02:06.659> hit<00:02:06.810> kill<00:02:06.990> range<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:08.280> 33<00:02:08.819> meters

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
three hit kill range and it's 33 meters

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.820 
three hit kill range and it's 33 meters
so<00:02:09.720> if<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.959> watch<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.140> video<00:02:10.410> you<00:02:10.560> can<00:02:10.649> get<00:02:10.800> a

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
so if you watch that video you can get a

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.059 
so if you watch that video you can get a
really<00:02:11.160> good<00:02:11.190> idea<00:02:11.370> what<00:02:11.730> 35<00:02:12.150> meters<00:02:12.599> is

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
really good idea what 35 meters is

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.569 
really good idea what 35 meters is
just<00:02:13.340> a<00:02:13.430> couple<00:02:13.640> extra<00:02:13.849> meters<00:02:14.239> and<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.370> yeah

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
just a couple extra meters and so yeah

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.910 
just a couple extra meters and so yeah
that's<00:02:17.180> where<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.689> gun<00:02:17.900> shines<00:02:18.200> it's<00:02:18.709> not

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
that's where this gun shines it's not

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.379 
that's where this gun shines it's not
good<00:02:19.129> at<00:02:19.219> clothes<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.670> not<00:02:19.999> particularly

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:20.389 
good at clothes it's not particularly

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:21.940 
good at clothes it's not particularly
good<00:02:20.629> super<00:02:21.049> long<00:02:21.200> range<00:02:21.409> because<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.739> shoots

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
good super long range because it shoots

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.819 
good super long range because it shoots
a<00:02:22.069> little<00:02:22.280> slower<00:02:22.519> but<00:02:22.900> medium<00:02:23.900> range<00:02:24.170> having

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
a little slower but medium range having

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.379 
a little slower but medium range having
that<00:02:24.859> very<00:02:25.219> very<00:02:25.489> long<00:02:25.670> forehead<00:02:26.060> kill<00:02:26.209> range

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:26.389 
that very very long forehead kill range

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:28.720 
that very very long forehead kill range
and<00:02:26.599> also<00:02:26.840> being<00:02:26.989> quite<00:02:27.290> accurate<00:02:27.799> it<00:02:27.950> is<00:02:28.249> very

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and also being quite accurate it is very

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.149 
and also being quite accurate it is very
very<00:02:28.819> good<00:02:29.329> at<00:02:29.540> medium<00:02:29.959> range<00:02:29.989> so<00:02:30.590> don't<00:02:30.980> use

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
very good at medium range so don't use

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.190 
very good at medium range so don't use
this<00:02:31.250> like<00:02:31.430> an<00:02:31.519> SMG<00:02:31.790> basically<00:02:32.599> pretend<00:02:33.049> that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
this like an SMG basically pretend that

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.259 
this like an SMG basically pretend that
truck<00:02:33.469> made<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.739> mistake<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.459> accidentally

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
truck made a mistake and accidentally

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.240 
truck made a mistake and accidentally
put<00:02:35.510> an<00:02:35.659> assault<00:02:35.989> rifle<00:02:36.019> in<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:36.349> SME<00:02:36.680> category

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
put an assault rifle in the SME category

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.909 
put an assault rifle in the SME category
and<00:02:37.430> use<00:02:37.969> it<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.239> an<00:02:38.359> assault<00:02:38.659> rifle<00:02:38.919> so

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:39.919 
and use it like an assault rifle so

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:41.800 
and use it like an assault rifle so
basically<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.489> a<00:02:40.609> decent<00:02:41.060> assault<00:02:41.569> rifle

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
basically this is a decent assault rifle

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.509 
basically this is a decent assault rifle
that<00:02:41.930> has<00:02:41.989> SMG<00:02:42.530> traits<00:02:42.859> so<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.069> has<00:02:43.159> better<00:02:43.370> hit

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 
that has SMG traits so it has better hit

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.879 
that has SMG traits so it has better hit
fire<00:02:43.669> up<00:02:43.790> close<00:02:44.060> it<00:02:44.359> moves<00:02:45.139> you<00:02:45.439> run<00:02:45.739> at<00:02:45.859> a

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
fire up close it moves you run at a

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:47.530 
fire up close it moves you run at a
hundred<00:02:46.040> percent<00:02:46.189> speed<00:02:46.579> also<00:02:47.180> remember<00:02:47.510> that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
hundred percent speed also remember that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.240 
hundred percent speed also remember that
when<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.810> aim<00:02:47.959> down<00:02:47.989> sights<00:02:48.439> you<00:02:48.950> have<00:02:49.069> like

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
when you aim down sights you have like

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.949 
when you aim down sights you have like
eighty<00:02:49.489> eighty<00:02:49.909> percent<00:02:50.239> move<00:02:50.599> speed<00:02:50.840> or

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
eighty eighty percent move speed or

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.569 
eighty eighty percent move speed or
something<00:02:51.230> so<00:02:51.349> it's<00:02:51.379> like<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.859> already<00:02:52.129> have

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
something so it's like you already have

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.309 
something so it's like you already have
an<00:02:52.699> adjustable<00:02:52.909> stock<00:02:53.329> on<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.719> i<00:02:54.199> would

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
an adjustable stock on and i would

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.869 
an adjustable stock on and i would
recommend<00:02:54.349> putting<00:02:54.949> an<00:02:55.099> adjustable<00:02:55.519> stock<00:02:55.699> on

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
recommend putting an adjustable stock on

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.670 
recommend putting an adjustable stock on
because<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.299> takes<00:02:56.540> up<00:02:56.719> to<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.900> hundred<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:57.500> two

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
because it takes up to a hundred and two

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.229 
because it takes up to a hundred and two
percent<00:02:58.040> move<00:02:58.219> speed<00:02:58.459> so<00:02:58.909> you<00:02:58.939> can<00:02:59.120> actually

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
percent move speed so you can actually

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.459 
percent move speed so you can actually
walk<00:02:59.510> around<00:02:59.780> while<00:03:00.019> aiming<00:03:00.230> down<00:03:00.409> sights

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
walk around while aiming down sights

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.619 
walk around while aiming down sights
faster<00:03:01.430> than<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.699> would<00:03:01.849> be<00:03:01.969> going<00:03:02.120> normally

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
faster than you would be going normally

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:05.020 
faster than you would be going normally
and<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:03.439> this<00:03:03.620> gun<00:03:03.799> is<00:03:03.829> just<00:03:04.159> really

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
and so like this gun is just really

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.270 
and so like this gun is just really
should<00:03:05.209> be<00:03:05.299> used<00:03:05.480> like<00:03:05.659> an<00:03:05.780> assault<00:03:06.049> rifle<00:03:06.280> not

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
should be used like an assault rifle not

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.929 
should be used like an assault rifle not
like<00:03:07.489> an<00:03:07.609> SMG<00:03:07.879> and<00:03:09.310> use<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.430> attachments<00:03:10.909> like

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
like an SMG and use the attachments like

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.610 
like an SMG and use the attachments like
that<00:03:11.239> i<00:03:11.569> would<00:03:12.019> definitely<00:03:12.319> recommend

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
that i would definitely recommend

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.890 
that i would definitely recommend
putting<00:03:13.519> a<00:03:13.699> site<00:03:13.939> on<00:03:13.969> because<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.659> lot<00:03:14.870> of

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
putting a site on because a lot of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.539 
putting a site on because a lot of
people<00:03:14.989> this<00:03:15.409> iron<00:03:15.680> sights<00:03:15.980> are<00:03:16.129> very<00:03:16.310> good
