it's like plugging into the wall except

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.200 
it's like plugging into the wall except
instead<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.220> being<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.520> guy<00:01:11.700> over<00:01:12.030> in<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
instead of being that guy over in the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.910 
instead of being that guy over in the
corner<00:01:12.570> sitting<00:01:12.780> by<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.049> plug<00:01:13.380> waiting<00:01:13.830> an

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
corner sitting by the plug waiting an

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
corner sitting by the plug waiting an
hour<00:01:14.040> for<00:01:14.340> your<00:01:14.430> phone<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.670> be<00:01:14.880> alive<00:01:15.119> you're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
hour for your phone to be alive you're

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
hour for your phone to be alive you're
still<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.290> guy<00:01:16.439> who's<00:01:16.680> done<00:01:16.920> yet<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.189> go

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
still on the guy who's done yet to go

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
still on the guy who's done yet to go
under<00:01:17.700> your<00:01:17.790> do<00:01:18.030> your<00:01:18.119> deal<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
under your do your deal so this is the

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.330 
under your do your deal so this is the
fuel<00:01:19.170> cell<00:01:19.409> itself<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
fuel cell itself so so this is it's the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
fuel cell itself so so this is it's the
same<00:01:23.549> thing<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> Hairspray<00:01:24.479> this<00:01:24.780> is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
same thing that's in Hairspray this is

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.560 
same thing that's in Hairspray this is
butane<00:01:25.350> fuel<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.360> this

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
butane fuel in here and then in this

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
butane fuel in here and then in this
system<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.500> fuel<00:01:28.860> cell<00:01:29.130> that

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
system here is the fuel cell that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
system here is the fuel cell that
converts<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> butane<00:01:30.360> over<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
converts that to butane over to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.920 
converts that to butane over to
electricity

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.270 

so<00:01:35.930> there's<00:01:36.080> actually<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.440> battery<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:36.920> here<00:01:37.159> as

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
so there's actually a battery in here as

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.890 
so there's actually a battery in here as
well<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.760> so<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:38.360> know<00:01:38.479> you're<00:01:38.659> always

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
well and so you know you're always

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.690 
well and so you know you're always
getting<00:01:39.260> power<00:01:39.620> you<00:01:39.890> don't<00:01:40.040> have<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.280> wait<00:01:40.460> for

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
getting power you don't have to wait for

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.399 
getting power you don't have to wait for
it<00:01:40.760> to<00:01:40.850> start<00:01:41.090> up<00:01:41.300> you're<00:01:41.600> just<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.990> plug<00:01:42.200> in

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
it to start up you're just you plug in

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.440 
it to start up you're just you plug in
you<00:01:42.530> get<00:01:42.680> power<00:01:42.920> it's<00:01:43.430> a<00:01:43.490> hybrid<00:01:43.880> system<00:01:44.330> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
you get power it's a hybrid system the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.149 
you get power it's a hybrid system the
system<00:01:44.780> does<00:01:44.990> what<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.320> needs<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.680> do<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.100> you

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
system does what it needs to do so you

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.430 
system does what it needs to do so you
never<00:01:46.520> have<00:01:46.820> to<00:01:47.000> worry<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:47.869> have<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:48.290> do

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440

done and when the cartridge is empty put

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.249 
done and when the cartridge is empty put
on<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.630> new<00:01:53.780> one<00:01:57.940> so<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.540> get<00:01:59.659> this<00:01:59.900> sort<00:02:00.200> of

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:00.259 
on the new one so to get this sort of

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.840 
on the new one so to get this sort of
capacity<00:02:00.890> the<00:02:01.040> battery<00:02:01.369> will<00:02:01.490> be<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> lot

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
capacity the battery will be a lot

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.910 
capacity the battery will be a lot
larger<00:02:02.060> this<00:02:02.450> device<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.770> other

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
larger this device but the other

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.529 
larger this device but the other
critical<00:02:04.460> thing<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:04.820> you<00:02:05.060> just<00:02:05.210> have<00:02:05.330> to

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
critical thing is that you just have to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.540 
critical thing is that you just have to
remember<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.899> recharge<00:02:06.289> it<00:02:06.500> over<00:02:07.220> and<00:02:07.430> over

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
remember to recharge it over and over

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.389 
remember to recharge it over and over
and<00:02:07.820> over<00:02:08.060> again<00:02:08.149> this<00:02:08.420> case<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:10.160> have<00:02:10.280> this

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
and over again this case you have this

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.509 
and over again this case you have this
you<00:02:10.550> know<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:12.170> can<00:02:12.350> handle<00:02:12.530> pretty<00:02:13.070> wide<00:02:13.250> range

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
you know it can handle pretty wide range

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.250 
you know it can handle pretty wide range
of<00:02:13.670> operating<00:02:14.000> temperatures<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.840> throw<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
of operating temperatures you throw this

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.990 
of operating temperatures you throw this
thing<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.590> your<00:02:15.620> bag<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.340> never<00:02:16.640> worry

thing in your bag and you never worry
about<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.989> you<00:02:18.019> take<00:02:18.470> away<00:02:18.590> that<00:02:18.680> fear<00:02:19.100> I<00:02:19.250> mean

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
about you you take away that fear I mean

from the website $2.99 for the system

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.480 
from the website $2.99 for the system
$9.99<00:02:53.570> for<00:02:53.780> the<00:02:53.840> pods<00:02:54.080> I<00:02:54.470> will<00:02:55.100> start<00:02:55.280> shipping

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
$9.99 for the pods I will start shipping

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:04.590 
$9.99 for the pods I will start shipping
in<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.820> summer<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.750> then<00:02:56.900> later

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.490 

so<00:03:05.600> it's<00:03:06.190> 55,000<00:03:07.190> milliwatts<00:03:07.840> so<00:03:08.840> it's<00:03:09.110> 10

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
so it's 55,000 milliwatts so it's 10

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.520 
so it's 55,000 milliwatts so it's 10
charges<00:03:09.920> of<00:03:10.310> like<00:03:10.520> an<00:03:10.700> iPhone<00:03:11.120> 4s<00:03:11.630> full<00:03:12.440> charge

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
charges of like an iPhone 4s full charge

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.200 
charges of like an iPhone 4s full charge
well<00:03:15.530> so<00:03:15.710> we're<00:03:15.890> delivering<00:03:16.130> five<00:03:16.580> wants<00:03:17.060> out

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.210 
well so we're delivering five wants out

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.430 
well so we're delivering five wants out
here<00:03:17.480> and<00:03:17.630> so<00:03:17.720> it's<00:03:17.870> a<00:03:17.930> little<00:03:18.080> bit<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.350> a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
here and so it's a little bit of a

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.830 
here and so it's a little bit of a
misleading<00:03:18.970> parameter<00:03:19.970> to<00:03:20.120> try<00:03:20.300> to<00:03:20.360> compare

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
misleading parameter to try to compare

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.460 
misleading parameter to try to compare
we're<00:03:21.470> delivering<00:03:21.890> lots<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:23.000> device<00:03:23.470> roughly

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
we're delivering lots the device roughly

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.640 
we're delivering lots the device roughly
four<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.040> one<00:03:25.190> conversion<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.480> that's<00:03:27.170> you

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
four to one conversion so that's you

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.050 
four to one conversion so that's you
know<00:03:27.710> whenever<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.360> 14,000<00:03:30.520> in<00:03:31.520> one<00:03:31.910> of

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
know whenever that is 14,000 in one of

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.790 
know whenever that is 14,000 in one of
these<00:03:32.120> pods<00:03:32.420> and<00:03:32.720> then<00:03:32.840> you<00:03:33.290> know<00:03:33.410> as<00:03:33.530> you<00:03:33.650> see

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
these pods and then you know as you see

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.900 
these pods and then you know as you see
these<00:03:33.950> pods<00:03:34.250> are<00:03:34.430> really<00:03:34.670> lightweight

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
these pods are really lightweight

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.600 
these pods are really lightweight

power<00:03:53.420> it's<00:03:54.230> like<00:03:54.350> the<00:03:54.620> breath<00:03:54.830> you<00:03:54.860> it's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
power it's like the breath you it's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.860 
power it's like the breath you it's
bring<00:03:55.640> it<00:03:55.760> out<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.150> it's<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.330> little<00:03:56.630> bit<00:03:56.720> of<00:03:56.810> a

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
bring it out so it's a little bit of a

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.699 
bring it out so it's a little bit of a
humid<00:03:57.170> air<00:03:58.390> exactly<00:03:59.390> but<00:03:59.900> you<00:04:00.110> know<00:04:00.230> just<00:04:00.500> like

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
humid air exactly but you know just like

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.380 
humid air exactly but you know just like
breathing<00:04:00.980> so<00:04:01.610> it's<00:04:01.700> a<00:04:01.730> little<00:04:01.850> bit<00:04:02.000> alive<00:04:02.209> you

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
breathing so it's a little bit alive you

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.699 
breathing so it's a little bit alive you
can<00:04:02.480> hold<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:02.750> thing<00:04:02.959> it's<00:04:03.200> running<00:04:03.590> right

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
can hold this thing it's running right

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.710 
can hold this thing it's running right
now<00:04:03.890> it's<00:04:04.670> kind<00:04:04.850> of<00:04:04.880> like<00:04:05.000> vibrating<00:04:05.600> yeah

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
now it's kind of like vibrating yeah

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.900 
now it's kind of like vibrating yeah
it's<00:04:05.959> got<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.110> little<00:04:06.500> bit<00:04:06.650> of<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.860> pump<00:04:07.550> in<00:04:07.730> there

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
it's got a little bit of a pump in there

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.240 
it's got a little bit of a pump in there
and<00:04:08.060> that's<00:04:08.120> pushing<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.019> air<00:04:09.140> around

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
and that's pushing the air around

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.520 
and that's pushing the air around
a<00:04:10.400> little<00:04:11.270> bit<00:04:11.390> warm<00:04:11.660> that's<00:04:11.870> as<00:04:12.020> warm<00:04:12.230> as<00:04:12.410> it

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
a little bit warm that's as warm as it

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.750 
a little bit warm that's as warm as it
gets<00:04:12.740> you<00:04:12.980> can<00:04:13.160> put<00:04:13.310> it<00:04:13.400> in<00:04:13.490> minutes

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
gets you can put it in minutes

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.190 
gets you can put it in minutes
generating<00:04:14.390> energy<00:04:14.540> right<00:04:14.990> now

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
generating energy right now

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.199 
generating energy right now
this<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.740> a<00:04:15.770> great<00:04:16.579> invention<00:04:16.850> just<00:04:17.030> here

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
this is a great invention just here

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.400 
this is a great invention just here
suppose<00:04:17.420> we<00:04:17.450> were<00:04:17.780> here<00:04:17.989> at<00:04:18.079> hearing<00:04:18.290> about

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
suppose we were here at hearing about

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:19.720 
suppose we were here at hearing about
hydrogen<00:04:18.769> fuel<00:04:19.070> cells<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.489> now<00:04:19.549> we're

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
hydrogen fuel cells and now we're

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.240 
hydrogen fuel cells and now we're
finally<00:04:20.150> seeing<00:04:21.049> them<00:04:21.350> and<00:04:21.769> then<00:04:21.890> they<00:04:22.070> work

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
finally seeing them and then they work

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.700 
finally seeing them and then they work
that's<00:04:22.550> also<00:04:22.820> a<00:04:23.120> long<00:04:23.780> time<00:04:24.020> coming<00:04:24.440> but<00:04:24.470> we're

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
that's also a long time coming but we're

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.530 
that's also a long time coming but we're
really<00:04:24.920> excited<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.640> be<00:04:25.790> delivering<00:04:26.270> those<00:04:26.360> to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
really excited to be delivering those to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.800 
really excited to be delivering those to
customers<00:04:26.990> thank<00:04:27.440> you<00:04:27.500> very<00:04:27.620> much
