bit<00:04:57.430> about<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.090> is<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.930> a<00:04:58.960> newest<00:04:59.650> the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
bit about the is this a newest the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.310 
bit about the is this a newest the
newest<00:05:00.190> version<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.760> control<00:05:01.180> device<00:05:01.510> yes
