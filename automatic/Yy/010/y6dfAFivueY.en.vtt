00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.570
 anthony lurling mark loss with two 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.430
 a 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.290
 from heerenveen if I wedges you 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.700
 yes what I will see the gentleman himself 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.590
 could have done the job of NAC 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.019
 three times a lot of oil is not possible 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.410
 about you and that tree that way 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.270
 No, I just say it and the rest I also 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.330
 sorry said to those guests because yes 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.949
 want you get 3 good chances for it 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.439
 first played well myself I was constant 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.910
 rotating and ball-proof 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.099
 I think I can get them first 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 basically do everything right and I think 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.920
 there the compliment must go to the keeper 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.230
 and he takes him in the short for good 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.510
 corner I had my mobility and good at it 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 the second the second chance I think I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.590
 the first least then sees your gun too 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.540
 I want to score, I think and yes, what I want 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.489
 just said that third chance is there 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 it is bad in millions between the posts 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.360
 actually hurried shot 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.789
 well it stands as being pointed to that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.050
 shoot balls in but they are the first 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.879
 that party keeper good in the second and 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.190
 third party must be one of those three must 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.290
 we do not think that we are a few beautiful 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.710
 opportunities that we do not create and 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.270
 well should make 2nd half after the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.210
 especially to the gaulle yes then we drop 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.700
 again just like against az and you only one 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.440
 defender less sharp and yes so you see 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.510
 there anyway 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.320
 yes here it lacks the sharpness and the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.380
 agreements 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.210
 yes got here than specified moment and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.550
 not fulfilled and then yes that is short de 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.530
 striker of their 2 goals and so you lose 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.340
 the competition if you add more now 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.960
 scooter 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.390
 yes we make arrangements in advance 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
 certain things and if we fulfill them 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.259
 then we achieve results 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.509
 if we do n't honor it now we will get it 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.229
 it was difficult and and we could see that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.940
 tonight 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.860
 he stopped that penalty, whoever 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.060
 not the season for the first time then 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.890
 the audience went as you stand thinking 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.460
 well we wear it but dovey now 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.190
 to me 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 subscribe well we can moments 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.750
 are to your team to a team 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.310
 to get over it only I found that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.990
 we second habit were too bad 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.690
 because that is so easy to 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.360
 and and there may be both 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.240
 he often blames you for this 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.700
 you have to have to just have to 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.170
 be satisfied with the last few weeks 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.210
 and that satisfaction can be lost immediately 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.440
 are going to a match so have to go there 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.420
 we realize 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.490
 we have to tell children that we do 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.690
 we want to get European football 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.160
 we must do our safe as quickly as possible 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.300
 and unfortunately don't have that story 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.770
 can see 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.090
 just have to stay positive 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.600
 because the last week just whole 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.750
 goes very well with the moss on them 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.750
 to be
