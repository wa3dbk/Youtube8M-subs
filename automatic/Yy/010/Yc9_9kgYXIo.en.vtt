the<00:00:16.800> atlona<00:00:17.130> vga<00:00:17.940> two<00:00:18.060> HDMI<00:00:18.600> scaler<00:00:19.350> converter

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the atlona vga two HDMI scaler converter

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.029 
the atlona vga two HDMI scaler converter
is<00:00:20.250> exactly<00:00:20.939> what<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.570> need<00:00:21.600> this<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.500> going

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
is exactly what you need this is going

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.890 
is exactly what you need this is going
to<00:00:23.160> allow<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.550> take<00:00:23.820> both<00:00:24.090> audio<00:00:24.600> and

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
to allow you to take both audio and

video from your laptop or desktop and
convert<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.920> single<00:00:29.300> HDMI<00:00:30.300> signal<00:00:31.080> so

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
convert it to a single HDMI signal so

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.639 
convert it to a single HDMI signal so
you<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.070> go<00:00:32.189> from<00:00:32.579> two<00:00:33.300> cables<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:34.079> one<00:00:34.380> cable

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
you can go from two cables to one cable

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010 
you can go from two cables to one cable
running<00:00:35.130> into<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.520> HDMI<00:00:36.180> display<00:00:36.390> carrying

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
running into your HDMI display carrying

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.459 
running into your HDMI display carrying
both<00:00:37.350> video<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.190> audio<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:39.350> resolutions<00:00:40.350> up

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
both video and audio at resolutions up

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.209 
both video and audio at resolutions up
to<00:00:40.500> 1920<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:42.059> 1200<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.320> very<00:00:43.680> very<00:00:43.860> high

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
to 1920 by 1200 so very very high

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.850 
to 1920 by 1200 so very very high
resolution<00:00:44.520> being<00:00:45.210> passed<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:46.410> cable

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
resolution being passed over this cable

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.520 
resolution being passed over this cable
setup<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.700> super<00:00:48.390> super<00:00:48.750> simple<00:00:48.899> it's<00:00:49.230> bus

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
setup is super super simple it's bus

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.830 
setup is super super simple it's bus

audio cable to your audio output and you
plug<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.480> vga<00:00:57.840> cable<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.590> your<00:00:58.710> video

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
plug in the vga cable to your video

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
plug in the vga cable to your video
output<00:00:59.520> now<00:00:59.670> this<00:00:59.879> box<00:01:00.120> will<00:01:00.480> automatically

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
output now this box will automatically

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.070 
output now this box will automatically
sense<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.980> resolution<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:02.879> match<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.600> for

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
sense your resolution and match it for

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770 
sense your resolution and match it for
the<00:01:04.199> HDMI<00:01:04.830> signal<00:01:04.890> or<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:06.060> can<00:01:06.390> use<00:01:06.540> the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
the HDMI signal or you can use the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780 
the HDMI signal or you can use the
switch<00:01:07.080> on<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.350> side<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:08.189> switch<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.580> manual

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
switch on the side to switch to manual

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.789 
switch on the side to switch to manual
mode<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.299> then<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.750> can<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.170> click

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
mode and then you can actually click

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.330 
mode and then you can actually click
through<00:01:11.189> all<00:01:11.369> of<00:01:11.460> your<00:01:12.330> various<00:01:12.869> resolutions

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
through all of your various resolutions

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.649 
through all of your various resolutions
so<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.610> find<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> resolution<00:01:15.630> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
so you can find the resolution that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.109 
so you can find the resolution that
matches<00:01:16.439> best<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.920> what<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.340> need<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.939> so

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
matches best to what you need it for so

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.310 
matches best to what you need it for so
it's<00:01:18.270> also<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.659> scaler

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
it's also a scaler

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.550 
it's also a scaler
in<00:01:19.470> addition<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.580> simply<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.420> converter<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.470> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
in addition to simply a converter so you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
in addition to simply a converter so you
have<00:01:22.799> very<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.220> or<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.210> very<00:01:24.479> very

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
have very very or a lot of very very

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
have very very or a lot of very very
flexible<00:01:25.259> options<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.220> you're<00:01:26.310> passing

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
flexible options when you're passing

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.819 
flexible options when you're passing
that<00:01:26.880> video<00:01:27.180> signal<00:01:27.570> along<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.350> your<00:01:28.530> display

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
that video signal along to your display

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.249 
that video signal along to your display
