alright you pour as much as you want I

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.860 
alright you pour as much as you want I
mean<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:13.650> could<00:02:13.830> pour<00:02:14.069> more<00:02:14.510> foundation<00:02:15.510> and

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
mean you could pour more foundation and

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.580 
mean you could pour more foundation and
less<00:02:17.270> moisturizer<00:02:18.270> depending<00:02:18.989> how<00:02:19.349> much

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
less moisturizer depending how much

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.729 
less moisturizer depending how much
coverage<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.130> want<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> put<00:02:22.170> about<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
coverage you want so I put about that

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.720 
coverage you want so I put about that
much<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:26.720> I<00:02:27.720> mean<00:02:28.380> this<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.650> foolproof<00:02:29.069> if<00:02:29.550> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
much and I mean this is foolproof if you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.699 
much and I mean this is foolproof if you
don't<00:02:29.910> like<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.330> way<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.660> comes<00:02:30.870> out<00:02:31.050> if<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
don't like the way it comes out if you

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.960 
don't like the way it comes out if you
think<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.100> too<00:02:32.459> watery<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.480> um<00:02:34.340> too<00:02:35.340> thick

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
think it's too watery or um too thick

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.920 
think it's too watery or um too thick
you<00:02:36.239> can<00:02:36.840> add<00:02:37.019> more<00:02:37.620> foundation<00:02:38.459> or

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
you can add more foundation or

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.270 
you can add more foundation or
moisturizer<00:02:39.930> which<00:02:40.260> ever<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:40.739> is<00:02:40.830> that<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
moisturizer which ever it is that you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.740 
moisturizer which ever it is that you
need<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.600> I'm<00:02:42.900> gonna<00:02:43.049> add<00:02:43.319> some<00:02:43.680> moisturizer

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
need so I'm gonna add some moisturizer

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.699 
need so I'm gonna add some moisturizer
and<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:46.319> add<00:02:46.530> about<00:02:46.950> that<00:02:47.370> much<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:49.410> first

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
and I add about that much the first

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.670 
and I add about that much the first
thing<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.430> first<00:02:50.459> time<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.030> did<00:02:51.450> this<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:52.440> came

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
thing the first time I did this it came

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.479 
thing the first time I did this it came
out<00:02:52.799> feeling<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.819> moose<00:02:55.130> so<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:56.310> you're

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
white so I'm just going to swirl until

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.740 
white so I'm just going to swirl until
all<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.790> white<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.060> gone<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.359> swirl

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
all the white is gone so you just swirl

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.560

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:26.480 

and<00:03:19.040> that's<00:03:20.040> what<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.459> should<00:03:20.489> look<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:24.019> so

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
and that's what it should look like so

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.000 
and that's what it should look like so
I<00:03:26.630> mean<00:03:27.630> I<00:03:27.840> could<00:03:28.110> try<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.410> out<00:03:30.650> see<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> don't

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

I mean I could try it out see I don't
like<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.370> way<00:03:32.520> that<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:33.210> looking<00:03:33.920> it<00:03:34.920> feels

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
like the way that it's looking it feels

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.120

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
really watery and it feels like I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.210 
really watery and it feels like I
