came up with and stumbled upon and I

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.610 
came up with and stumbled upon and I
kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.880> broke<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.470> turned<00:00:37.470> it<00:00:37.560> into

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
kind of broke it down and turned it into

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.580 
kind of broke it down and turned it into
an<00:00:37.860> actual<00:00:38.130> lesson<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.960> sticking<00:00:40.440> for

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
an actual lesson so the sticking for

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.410 
an actual lesson so the sticking for
this<00:00:40.680> pattern<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.640> be<00:00:41.700> sixteenth

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
this pattern is going to be sixteenth

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.139 
this pattern is going to be sixteenth
notes<00:00:42.720> long<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.710> gonna<00:00:43.829> ultimately<00:00:44.430> take

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
notes long we're gonna ultimately take

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.970 
notes long we're gonna ultimately take
that<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.450> speed<00:00:45.630> it<00:00:45.720> up<00:00:45.810> and<00:00:45.930> play<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.260> 32nd

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
that and speed it up and play it as 32nd

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.280 
that and speed it up and play it as 32nd
notes<00:00:47.130> if<00:00:47.399> you've<00:00:47.700> seen<00:00:47.880> any<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.090> my<00:00:48.149> previous

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
notes if you've seen any of my previous

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.900 
notes if you've seen any of my previous
lessons<00:00:49.290> you<00:00:49.530> know<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.340> drill<00:00:50.579> of<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
lessons you know the drill of how we

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
lessons you know the drill of how we
just<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> start<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.840> off<00:00:51.930> slow<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.350> then

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
just take it start it off slow and then

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
just take it start it off slow and then
we<00:00:52.770> speed<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.100> up<00:00:53.220> so<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.180> pattern<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.690> going

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
we speed it up so the pattern is going

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.040 
we speed it up so the pattern is going
to<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:54.989> kick<00:00:55.950> right<00:00:56.370> left<00:00:56.790> kick<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:57.420> left

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
to be kick right left kick right left

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.920 
to be kick right left kick right left
kick<00:00:58.440> kick<00:00:58.860> right<00:00:59.309> left<00:00:59.760> kick<00:01:00.149> kick<00:01:00.540> right

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
kick kick right left kick kick right

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.639 
kick kick right left kick kick right
left<00:01:01.350> right<00:01:01.590> left<00:01:02.000> now<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.199> pattern<00:01:04.199> sounds

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
left right left now the pattern sounds

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:22.249 
left right left now the pattern sounds
like<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:20.119> okay<00:01:21.119> so<00:01:21.179> we've<00:01:21.389> got<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.569> one<00:01:21.990> E

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
like this okay so we've got that one E

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.840 
like this okay so we've got that one E
and<00:01:22.289> two<00:01:22.799> E<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.249> three<00:01:23.789> E<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.240> four<00:01:24.840> E<00:01:25.079> and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
and two E and three E and four E and

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.109 
and two E and three E and four E and
let's<00:01:26.850> take<00:01:27.060> that<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.539> play<00:01:27.749> one<00:01:28.350> measure<00:01:28.619> in

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
let's take that and play one measure in

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.819 
let's take that and play one measure in
of<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.209> groove<00:01:30.450> one<00:01:30.810> measure<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:31.409> fill<00:01:31.619> as

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
of a groove one measure of that fill as

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.859 
of a groove one measure of that fill as
16th<00:01:32.279> notes<00:01:32.490> I'm<00:01:32.849> gonna<00:01:33.090> set<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.689> metronome

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
16th notes I'm gonna set the metronome

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.059 
16th notes I'm gonna set the metronome
to<00:01:34.490> 70<00:01:35.490> beats<00:01:35.639> per<00:01:35.789> minute<00:01:36.209> and<00:01:36.709> like<00:01:37.709> if<00:01:37.979> you

00:01:38.059 --> 00:01:38.069 
to 70 beats per minute and like if you

to 70 beats per minute and like if you
did<00:01:38.189> see<00:01:38.399> earlier<00:01:39.029> I'm<00:01:39.179> alternating<00:01:39.630> between

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
did see earlier I'm alternating between

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.389 
did see earlier I'm alternating between
the<00:01:40.229> hi-hats<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.649> the<00:01:40.770> snare<00:01:40.950> drum<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.279> I'm

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:41.399 
the hi-hats and the snare drum so I'm

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.760 
the hi-hats and the snare drum so I'm
not<00:01:41.520> staying<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.149> one<00:01:42.450> drum<00:01:42.810> I'm<00:01:42.990> playing<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
not staying on one drum I'm playing it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
not staying on one drum I'm playing it
between<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> hi-hats<00:01:44.459> and<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> snare<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> we

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
between the hi-hats and the snare and we

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
between the hi-hats and the snare and we
can<00:01:45.539> change<00:01:45.719> it<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.929> and<00:01:46.109> move<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.709> all<00:01:46.770> over

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
can change it up and move it all over

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
can change it up and move it all over
the<00:01:47.039> set<00:01:47.249> if<00:01:47.429> you<00:01:47.549> would<00:01:47.639> like<00:01:47.789> but<00:01:47.999> let's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the set if you would like but let's

00:01:48.689 --> 00:02:10.290 
the set if you would like but let's
start<00:01:48.869> off<00:01:48.990> with<00:01:49.079> this

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.600 

okay<00:02:11.300> cool<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:12.220> we've<00:02:13.220> got<00:02:13.400> that

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
okay cool so now we've got that

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.670 
okay cool so now we've got that
established<00:02:13.850> let's<00:02:14.570> take<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.230> speed<00:02:15.560> it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
established let's take that and speed it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.950 
established let's take that and speed it
up<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.040> play<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.520> as<00:02:16.700> thirty-second<00:02:17.330> notes<00:02:17.480> so

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
up and play it as thirty-second notes so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.600 
up and play it as thirty-second notes so
we're<00:02:18.050> gonna<00:02:18.140> take<00:02:18.410> that<00:02:18.620> same<00:02:19.130> exact<00:02:19.430> pattern

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
we're gonna take that same exact pattern

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.520 
we're gonna take that same exact pattern
not<00:02:20.180> change<00:02:20.480> anything<00:02:20.690> except<00:02:21.230> we're<00:02:21.380> gonna

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
not change anything except we're gonna

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.500 
not change anything except we're gonna
play<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.770> twice<00:02:22.100> as<00:02:22.250> fast<00:02:22.400> twice<00:02:23.240> as<00:02:23.420> many

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
play it twice as fast twice as many

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.050 
play it twice as fast twice as many
times<00:02:23.840> through<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.800> I'm<00:02:25.430> gonna<00:02:25.580> lower<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
times through so I'm gonna lower the

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.510 
times through so I'm gonna lower the
tempo<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> little<00:02:26.660> bit<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.990> we<00:02:27.080> can<00:02:27.370> it'll<00:02:28.370> allow

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
tempo a little bit so we can it'll allow

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.070 
tempo a little bit so we can it'll allow
us<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.670> get<00:02:28.850> some<00:02:29.000> space<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.450> there<00:02:29.600> and<00:02:29.810> so

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
us to get some space in there and so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.540 
us to get some space in there and so
we're<00:02:30.200> not<00:02:30.260> playing<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.620> ridiculously<00:02:31.280> fast

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
we're not playing it ridiculously fast

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:57.550 
we're not playing it ridiculously fast
yet<00:02:54.490> okay<00:02:55.490> nice<00:02:55.760> so<00:02:56.090> what<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.600> can<00:02:56.750> do<00:02:56.930> after

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
yet okay nice so what you can do after

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.520 
yet okay nice so what you can do after
that<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.770> what<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.580> like<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.630> do<00:02:59.750> is<00:03:00.170> take<00:03:00.380> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
that is what I like to do is take the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.440 
that is what I like to do is take the
left<00:03:00.740> hand<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.160> play<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.640> ghost<00:03:01.970> notes<00:03:02.240> on

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
left hand and play the ghost notes on

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.090 
left hand and play the ghost notes on
the<00:03:02.600> snare<00:03:02.810> drum<00:03:02.870> instead<00:03:03.410> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.709> left<00:03:03.890> hand

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the snare drum instead of the left hand

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.410 
the snare drum instead of the left hand
completely<00:03:05.030> on<00:03:05.209> this<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.140> high<00:03:06.290> hats<00:03:06.500> so

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
completely on this the high hats so

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.610 
completely on this the high hats so
let's<00:03:08.420> try<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.900> pattern<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.440> the

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
let's try that that pattern would be the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.410 
let's try that that pattern would be the
exact<00:03:09.950> same<00:03:10.130> thing<00:03:10.340> except<00:03:10.730> for<00:03:10.910> ghost<00:03:11.209> notes

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
exact same thing except for ghost notes

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.390 
exact same thing except for ghost notes
on<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.690> snare<00:03:12.380> drum<00:03:12.440> at<00:03:12.800> the<00:03:12.830> left<00:03:13.040> hand<00:03:13.250> that

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
on the snare drum at the left hand that

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:23.729 
on the snare drum at the left hand that
sounds<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:13.970> this

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.959 

okay<00:03:24.739> so<00:03:24.980> let's<00:03:25.159> speed<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.549> up<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.760> little<00:03:25.849> bit

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:25.969 
okay so let's speed that up a little bit

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:27.520 
okay so let's speed that up a little bit
and<00:03:26.299> I'll<00:03:26.629> move<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:26.900> around<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.170> drum<00:03:27.319> set

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
and I'll move it around the drum set

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:54.159 
and I'll move it around the drum set
