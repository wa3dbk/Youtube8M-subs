00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 the idea came from that we like a lot 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.600

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.910

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.099

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.690

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.309
 the holidays a month and in that medium 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:47.870
 we had a contracted project that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.219
 We were able to realize with the help of friends 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.420
 and between us with a lot of effort 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.390

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.340

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.280
 rooms as I already wanted with a lot 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.469
 light and this is the way we have of 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.330
 to be able to return a little bit of everything 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.369
 they gave us some things that we 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.250
 sandra rivers in the middle of the field where 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.950
