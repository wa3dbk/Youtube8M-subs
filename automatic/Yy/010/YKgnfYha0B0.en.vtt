00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
church the og's a lot of people think

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.430 
church the og's a lot of people think
that's<00:00:38.280> like<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> only<00:00:38.610> difference<00:00:39.290> but<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
that's like the only difference but it's

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.520 
that's like the only difference but it's
not<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:41.219> goes<00:00:41.370> deeper<00:00:41.550> than<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.530> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
not it goes deeper than that the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.889 
not it goes deeper than that the
material<00:00:44.040> itself<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:45.059> dura<00:00:45.270> book<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.629> lot

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
material itself the dura book is a lot

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.220 
material itself the dura book is a lot
softer<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> new<00:00:47.160> book<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.700> my<00:00:47.879> opinion<00:00:48.230> I'm

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
softer in the new book in my opinion I'm

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.040 
softer in the new book in my opinion I'm
still<00:00:49.500> waiting<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.980> 2011<00:00:50.820> release<00:00:51.090> of<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
still waiting on the 2011 release of the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.610 
still waiting on the 2011 release of the
five<00:00:52.260> supposed<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> be<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> sway<00:00:53.550> softer<00:00:54.030> nubuck

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
five supposed to be a sway softer nubuck

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.380 
five supposed to be a sway softer nubuck
hopefully<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> sock<00:00:56.070> with<00:00:56.219> dura<00:00:56.460> buck<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
hopefully it's a sock with dura buck if

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
hopefully it's a sock with dura buck if
not<00:00:57.600> softer<00:00:58.109> we'll<00:00:58.289> see<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.609> those

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
not softer we'll see how to get those

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:05.479 
not softer we'll see how to get those
endure<00:01:00.270> beyond<00:01:00.629> those<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:02.059> course<00:01:04.489> should

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
endure beyond those of course should

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.940 
endure beyond those of course should
know<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:07.729> on<00:01:08.900> the<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.049> thousand<00:01:10.439> has<00:01:10.560> nike

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
know that on the two thousand has nike

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.940 
know that on the two thousand has nike
and<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> lace<00:01:11.340> locks<00:01:11.549> opposed<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.950> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and the lace locks opposed to the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.179 
and the lace locks opposed to the
jumpman<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.640> neuro<00:01:14.820> retros<00:01:15.979> but<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
jumpman on the neuro retros but the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.920 
jumpman on the neuro retros but the
biggest<00:01:17.430> difference<00:01:17.670> in<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.090> opinion<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
biggest difference in my opinion is the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.410 
biggest difference in my opinion is the
actual<00:01:19.229> three<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.950> tongue<00:01:20.600> on<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:23.420> 2007

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
actual three in tongue on the 2007

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.590 
actual three in tongue on the 2007
release<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.490> 3m<00:01:26.820> tongue<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
release it's a 3m tongue but the

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.580 
release it's a 3m tongue but the
materials<00:01:28.140> like<00:01:28.350> smooth<00:01:29.869> that's<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.140> maybe

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
materials like smooth that's maybe maybe

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
materials like smooth that's maybe maybe
that's<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> reason<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.159> doesn't<00:01:32.430> pop<00:01:32.579> as

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
that's the reason when doesn't pop as

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.270 
that's the reason when doesn't pop as
much<00:01:33.020> also<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> judgment<00:01:34.500> stitched<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:35.009> but

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
much also the judgment stitched in but

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.179 
much also the judgment stitched in but
it's<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.640> a<00:01:35.670> smoother<00:01:36.570> jump<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> he<00:01:37.979> has

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it's like a smoother jump in and he has

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
it's like a smoother jump in and he has
a<00:01:38.280> me<00:01:38.670> meet<00:01:39.270> han<00:01:41.600> it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.689> pretty<00:01:42.960> smooth<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
a me meet han it's a pretty smooth I

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.940 
a me meet han it's a pretty smooth I
guess<00:01:44.040> jet<00:01:44.280> man<00:01:44.659> on<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.560> thousand

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
guess jet man on the two thousand

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.050 
guess jet man on the two thousand
release<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:48.540> gem<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> stitched<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.500> well

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
release the gem and stitched in as well

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.280 
release the gem and stitched in as well
people<00:01:51.060> could<00:01:51.210> say<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.509> sloppy<00:01:51.750> but<00:01:52.049> deaths

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
people could say it's sloppy but deaths

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.719 
people could say it's sloppy but deaths
because<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:53.340> material<00:01:53.490> shoes<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.270> it's<00:01:54.450> like

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
because the material shoes on it's like

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.880 
because the material shoes on it's like
didn't<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.259> this<00:01:58.259> should<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.530> just<00:01:58.740> see

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
didn't get that this should you just see

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.139 
didn't get that this should you just see
like<00:01:58.920> grace<00:02:00.350> are<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.560> a<00:02:01.590> grated<00:02:02.340> material<00:02:02.909> on

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
like grace are like a grated material on

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.050 
like grace are like a grated material on
three<00:02:03.420> material<00:02:03.950> that's<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.700> me<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.000> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
three material that's to me that's the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.880 
three material that's to me that's the
reason<00:02:06.299> why<00:02:06.329> pops<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.079> because<00:02:07.229> actual

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
reason why pops so much because actual

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.969 
reason why pops so much because actual
three<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.280> material<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:10.200> jet<00:02:10.440> man<00:02:10.619> actually

three in material the jet man actually

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.589 
three in material the jet man actually
has<00:02:11.129> fingers<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:11.910> one<00:02:12.090> opposed<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.510> the
