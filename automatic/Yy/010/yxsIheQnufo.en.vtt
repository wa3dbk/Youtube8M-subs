00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.780
 we are here north 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.490
 brandenburg in the region which has been good 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.010
 10,000 years native 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.660
 owns pond turtles and that is 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.320
 at the same time the last occurrences in 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 Germany 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.900
 you did not have to exactly 20 years ago 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.520
 in the wild at all 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.550
 pond turtles population exist 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.949
 we have a total of eight occurrences here 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.680
 found of it still exist today 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.419
 six maybe seven in small 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.210
 therefore it was necessary 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:38.090
 once to explore the habitats 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.579
 places to find but also the 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.530
 stocks that were much too old 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.770
 rejuvenate so we existed 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.719
 that means over the 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.210
 last two decades also a breeding 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.600
 population and are now in 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.180
 the situation also already orphaned 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.829
 locations of historical occurrence 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.010
 again, wetland turtles 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.649
 The pond turtle is from the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.979
 extinction and there are several 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.280
 reasons for the decline of this species in 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.939
 our region thats essentially 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.159
 intensification of the land and 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.630
 forestry and of course the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.119
 fragmentation of landscape the 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.189
 drainage of aquatic 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.500
 habitats that are thus the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.049
 major causes more recently 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.750
 we have a very different problem with 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.240
 the painter and the raccoon and also 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.520
 the ruler is just for the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.180
 European pond turtle a big one 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.119
 threat 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.009
 he eats eggs and adult animals, the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.240
 Stocks of the pond turtle are suffering 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.369
 considerably below 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.130
 because the species does not plant until 14 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.960
 Years on in the conservation project become wild 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.040
 Cameras at the shore for monitoring 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.659
 used 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.399
 This could mean the raccoon as 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.649
 main predator of the 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.470
 pond turtle are identified 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.970
 a very important component of ours 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.549
 protection project is now the so-called 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.600
 predator management we have on site 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.950
 hunters in the project integrates the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.140
 operate cost traps and raccoons 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.899
 remove from the area and thus also 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.989
 specialization and training 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.520
 We prevent eating habits 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.190
 can intercept this 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 raccoons specialize in the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.820
 food 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.650
 punt turtle break and that 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.780
 is a very important component for 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.630
 the protection of this population has become 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.280
 another option is the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.590
 places an undisturbed 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.720
 reproduction undisturbed also before 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.910
 Predators learn here as well 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.190
 a location has so yesterday evening 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.310
 a pond turtles female like that 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.400
 between 12 and 18 eggs laid that it 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.950
 so the average and we have 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.470
 This evening with odorants 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.380
 location weathered and in the hours 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.930
 it's here today in the morning 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.940
 This network once again secured with 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.370
 so wire mesh that holds over the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.080
 entire season just before leaving 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.030
 the fiddle that is usually like that 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.530
 March / April we remove this 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.600
 wire mesh with it the young ones 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.340
 can migrate unhindered 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.410
 Of course you have to consider 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.870
 turtles become 100 years old and 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.570
 a pond turtles lays 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.000
 at the earliest with 14 15 years the first 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.970
 let's say it takes a lot 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.930
 long breath for such a project alive 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.760
 to obtain 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.890
 We are very thankful that we are with 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.140
 to the foundations and also to the land 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.160
 Brandenburg is a continuous partner 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.620
 have found 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.650
 Of course the animals will be with us too 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.000
 in an accompanying monitoring 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.670
 We have a database registered 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.650
 the body measurements are taken 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.300
 patterning so we can too 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.550
 marsh turtles also recognize 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.590
 animals observed in the wild 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.450
 be or can be photographed 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.760
 we based on your individual pattern 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 head side panels leg pattern 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.540
 recognize 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.070
 we are here in one at one 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.010
 waters probably the last rest or 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.670
 European pond turtle live and 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.040
 So here we are , the Predators 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.200
 Fell short number of the raccoon 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.510
 is very much in the stock development 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.519
 rising so that the 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.640
 actually in the moment of the demigods 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:16.280
 turtle and around 2005 I have 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.519
 then dropped with little success 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.530
 Eg 2007 was already or tomorrow already 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.460
 Caught 120 raccoons 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.720
 that was then to remember that 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.300
 which consisted increases more and more 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.590
 We prefer working with cost traps 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.070
 I actually have an extra 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.760
 has only one entrance is promoted so 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.330
 So that's the raccoon 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.550
 can be affiliated 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.020
 For example, when I fall fruit in the trap 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.740
 in an animal there is no fish or 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.230
 go in 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.080
 that's all for the purposeful function 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:50.030
 important as the first turtles then 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.740
 Excluding injuries is natural 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.660
 also from the side of nature conservation said 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.690
 been whether there can no longer do 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.830
 just to bring back the raccoon 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.920
 In addition, a former 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.270
 Open-air enclosure for the pond turtle 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.730
 remodeled it created different 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.160
 biotope structures like waters and 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.820
 dry areas of the 15 hectares large area 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.710
 is with an electric fence against fox 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.960
 raccoon dog and raccoon protected 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:17.150
 many other types use besides the 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.620
 terrapin this area also there 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.810
 include, for example, the floor breeders 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.270
 in addition, the little plover the kiebitz 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.160
 pensions have their young undisturbed here 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.080
 we have here in a former 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.440
 So it's a ruined mine 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.380
 landscape a wonderful new system 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.030
 in habitats from water to 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.460
 the place of a plague and dry grass 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.850
 created something very good for many species 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.850
 coming
