00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
it's so clean obviously you don't want

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.500 
it's so clean obviously you don't want
him<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.460> know<00:01:05.549> draw<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.880> little<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510

know Star Wars shape or whatever you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.230 
know Star Wars shape or whatever you
just<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> assign<00:01:10.049> very<00:01:10.890> clean<00:01:11.340> very<00:01:11.700> so

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
just want to assign very clean very so

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
just want to assign very clean very so
you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.479> read<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> card<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.409> looks<00:01:13.439> good<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.189> mean

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you can read a card it looks good I mean

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.060 
you can read a card it looks good I mean
both<00:01:14.670> signatures<00:01:15.060> look<00:01:15.450> identical<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> I

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
both signatures look identical so I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.730 
both signatures look identical so I
really<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.909> think<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.689> doesn't<00:01:19.080> deter

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
really do think that it doesn't deter

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.710 
really do think that it doesn't deter
its<00:01:19.979> value<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.909> some<00:01:21.150> people<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.570> may

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
its value and for some people it may

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.649 
its value and for some people it may
have<00:01:21.930> higher<00:01:22.320> value<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.400> is<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.970> bunch

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
have higher value but there is a bunch

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
have higher value but there is a bunch
of<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:24.960> who<00:01:25.290> will<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:26.130> trade<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.729> sign

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
of people who will not trade for sign

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.999 
of people who will not trade for sign
cards<00:01:27.299> because<00:01:27.600> they<00:01:27.720> want<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.409> cards<00:01:28.740> or

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
cards because they want the cards or

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
cards because they want the cards or
they<00:01:29.670> won't<00:01:29.850> consider<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.420> sign<00:01:30.780> card<00:01:31.049> in

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they won't consider a sign card in

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.109 
they won't consider a sign card in
near-mint<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.250> extremely<00:01:32.970> valuable<00:01:33.360> cards

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
near-mint for extremely valuable cards

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.350 
near-mint for extremely valuable cards

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
know why I'm using his cards proof so a

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.319 
know why I'm using his cards proof so a
proof<00:01:47.460> card<00:01:47.759> what<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.570> word<00:01:49.909> well<00:01:50.909> it's

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
proof card what is that word well it's

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.719 
proof card what is that word well it's
worth<00:01:51.689> whatever<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.649> paid<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.220> honestly

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
worth whatever you paid for it honestly

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.350 
worth whatever you paid for it honestly
which<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> about<00:01:54.270> 20<00:01:54.630> bucks<00:01:54.810> or<00:01:55.110> 10<00:01:55.740> bucks<00:01:55.950> or

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
which is about 20 bucks or 10 bucks or

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.490 
which is about 20 bucks or 10 bucks or
40<00:01:57.360> dollars<00:01:57.659> depending<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.259> type<00:01:58.469> of

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
40 dollars depending on what type of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
40 dollars depending on what type of
proof<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.280> proof<00:01:59.549> means<00:01:59.880> it's<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> back

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
proof it is so proof means it's the back

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.990 
proof it is so proof means it's the back
of<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.200> card<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.700> love
