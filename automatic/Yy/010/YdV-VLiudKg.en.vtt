00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and multiple casts f-for that it'll

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.410 
and multiple casts f-for that it'll
you'll<00:02:01.890> cast<00:02:02.130> farther<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.820> said<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.180> having

you'll cast farther it said just having

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
you'll cast farther it said just having
dry<00:02:03.630> line<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.170> then<00:02:04.290> most<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.920> time<00:02:05.159> I'll<00:02:05.280> use

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
dry line but then most the time I'll use

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.880 
dry line but then most the time I'll use
a<00:02:05.490> cutie<00:02:05.939> line<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.299> lure<00:02:06.420> when<00:02:06.600> I'm<00:02:06.689> using

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
monofilament sore fluorocarbons and

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.080 
monofilament sore fluorocarbons and
basically<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.590> does<00:02:10.790> it's<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.879> liquid

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
substance that you spray on your real

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
substance that you spray on your real
you'd<00:02:14.340> spray<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:14.910> you'd<00:02:15.180> spray<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.630> here

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
you'd spray it you'd spray it right here

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.510 
you'd spray it you'd spray it right here
just<00:02:16.170> write<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.590> directly<00:02:16.920> on<00:02:17.070> your<00:02:17.100> spool

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
just like that you just spray it and I

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.240 
just like that you just spray it and I
usually<00:02:20.790> do<00:02:21.300> maybe<00:02:21.900> four<00:02:22.200> or<00:02:22.230> five<00:02:22.290> sprays<00:02:22.710> per

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
school kind of rub it in and I hit the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.040 
school kind of rub it in and I hit the
hit<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.160> bail<00:02:26.490> and<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:27.240> know<00:02:27.360> move<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.810> spool

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
hit the bail and you know move the spool

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.360 
hit the bail and you know move the spool
around<00:02:28.290> make<00:02:28.440> sure<00:02:28.470> everything's<00:02:28.980> evenly

coated<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.240> just<00:02:30.390> let<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.570> soak<00:02:30.900> in<00:02:30.960> I'll<00:02:31.440> do

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
coated and I just let it soak in I'll do

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.790 
coated and I just let it soak in I'll do
it<00:02:31.740> usually<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.220> night<00:02:32.640> before<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:33.090> tournament

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and basically it just gets kind of it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690 
and basically it just gets kind of it
gets<00:02:36.930> reduces<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.680> line<00:02:37.890> memory<00:02:38.100> that<00:02:38.520> year

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
gets reduces the line memory that year

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.290 
gets reduces the line memory that year
of<00:02:38.820> mine<00:02:38.970> has<00:02:39.320> let<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.440> cast<00:02:40.710> farther<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.550> it

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
although it is a little expensive it'll

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.630

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
like say with backlashes line memory you

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
like say with backlashes line memory you
can<00:04:08.880> cast<00:04:09.120> farther<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.870> conditions<00:04:10.320> your<00:04:10.380> line

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
can cast farther it conditions your line

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.680 
can cast farther it conditions your line
helps<00:04:11.340> it<00:04:11.430> last<00:04:11.640> longer<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.239> kind<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.450> stuff
