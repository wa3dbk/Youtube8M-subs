00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
so basically we have to do first go

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.109 
so basically we have to do first go
outside<00:00:16.039> first<00:00:17.039> starting<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.820> you'll<00:00:17.910> see

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
outside first starting on and you'll see

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.730 
outside first starting on and you'll see
four<00:00:18.359> computers<00:00:18.840> as<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.199> see<00:00:19.350> in<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> next

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
four computers as you see in the next

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.980 
four computers as you see in the next
clip<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.189> they<00:00:20.340> will<00:00:20.490> they'll<00:00:21.449> each<00:00:21.689> other

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
clip and they will they'll each other

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
clip and they will they'll each other
and<00:00:22.230> then<00:00:23.070> all<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.519> screens<00:00:23.820> will<00:00:24.000> go<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> color

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
and then all the screens will go a color

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.359 
and then all the screens will go a color
and<00:00:24.689> then<00:00:24.840> you'll<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.650> you<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.890> as

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
and then you'll have to what you do as

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.330 
and then you'll have to what you do as
you<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.730> all<00:00:27.689> them<00:00:27.900> went<00:00:28.199> red<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.859> hold<00:00:29.099> X

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
you see all them went red so I hold X

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.550 
you see all them went red so I hold X
near<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.670> red<00:00:29.849> one<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.050> it'll<00:00:31.260> go<00:00:31.380> red

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
near the red one and then it'll go red

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.179 
near the red one and then it'll go red

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
near the green one and basically it's a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.819 
near the green one and basically it's a
sequence<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:37.950> now<00:00:38.070> red<00:00:38.340> green<00:00:39.290> green<00:00:40.290> red<00:00:42.829> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
sequence so now red green green red and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.139 
sequence so now red green green red and
then<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.520> I'll<00:00:44.610> go<00:00:44.760> red<00:00:45.920> green<00:00:46.920> green<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.030> red

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
then so I'll go red green green and red

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:57.260 
then so I'll go red green green and red
green<00:00:51.149> red<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.680> yellow<00:00:53.719> red<00:00:54.719> green<00:00:55.410> green<00:00:56.270> red

can't<00:01:02.309> just<00:01:02.430> copy

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
can't just copy

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.420 
can't just copy
so<00:01:03.120> now<00:01:03.270> green<00:01:04.229> green<00:01:05.510> red<00:01:06.510> yellow<00:01:07.159> green<00:01:10.430> and

then<00:02:14.270> yeah<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:14.959> hack<00:02:15.500> all<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.130> them<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:16.940> I

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
then yeah so hack all of them and I

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.910 
then yeah so hack all of them and I
don't<00:02:17.360> know<00:02:17.510> if<00:02:17.569> there's<00:02:17.690> a<00:02:17.780> time<00:02:17.990> limit<00:02:18.170> but

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
don't know if there's a time limit but

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.330 
don't know if there's a time limit but
think<00:02:19.280> there<00:02:19.490> is<00:02:19.670> but<00:02:20.420> anyway<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.590> there's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
think there is but anyway so there's

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.260 
think there is but anyway so there's
three<00:02:22.610> in<00:02:22.640> this<00:02:22.940> room<00:02:23.209> I<00:02:23.450> think<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:25.270> think

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
three in this room I think that I think

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.080 
three in this room I think that I think
I<00:02:26.330> might<00:02:26.480> change<00:02:26.510> each<00:02:27.020> time<00:02:27.050> actually<00:02:27.590> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
I might change each time actually and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.180 
I might change each time actually and
then<00:02:29.090> my<00:02:29.330> last<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.140> here<00:02:32.830> okay<00:02:33.830> and<00:02:34.010> now

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
then my last one is here okay and now

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.820 
then my last one is here okay and now
what<00:02:34.370> you<00:02:34.459> have<00:02:34.489> to<00:02:34.580> do<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.560> don't<00:02:36.560> know<00:02:36.680> what

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
what you have to do I don't know what

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.490 
what you have to do I don't know what
I'm<00:02:36.890> doing<00:02:37.100> here<00:02:37.280> but<00:02:37.459> anyway<00:02:38.260> you'll<00:02:39.260> have<00:02:39.350> to

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
I'm doing here but anyway you'll have to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.530 
I'm doing here but anyway you'll have to
go<00:02:39.830> back<00:02:39.860> down<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.790> hubs<00:02:41.030> buttons<00:02:41.390> but<00:02:41.510> I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
go back down here and hubs buttons but I

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.210 
go back down here and hubs buttons but I
did<00:02:41.810> wrong<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.110> first<00:02:42.290> time<00:02:42.500> you<00:02:42.800> can't<00:02:43.040> just

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
did wrong the first time you can't just

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.830 
did wrong the first time you can't just
hold<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.580> have<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:43.910> hold<00:02:44.090> X<00:02:44.300> each<00:02:44.540> time

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
hold it you have to hold X each time

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.210 
hold it you have to hold X each time
you're<00:02:45.019> near<00:02:45.200> one<00:02:45.440> you<00:02:45.620> have<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.830> do<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.040> quite

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
you're near one you have to do it quite

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.380 
you're near one you have to do it quite
quickly<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:48.550> there<00:02:49.550> and<00:02:49.820> then<00:02:50.090> they<00:02:50.209> will

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
quickly and there and then they will

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.080 
quickly and there and then they will
show<00:02:50.690> loads<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.350> little<00:02:51.620> different<00:02:52.220> light<00:02:52.790> and

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
show loads a little different light and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.770 
show loads a little different light and
then<00:02:53.959> what<00:02:54.110> you<00:02:54.200> got<00:02:54.320> to<00:02:54.410> do<00:02:54.670> run<00:02:55.670> back<00:02:55.940> down<00:02:55.970> to

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
then what you got to do run back down to

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.850 
then what you got to do run back down to
the<00:02:58.989> place<00:02:59.989> where<00:03:00.200> there's<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.530> big<00:03:00.560> black

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
the place where there's the big black

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.530 
the place where there's the big black
pyramid<00:03:03.400> okay<00:03:04.400> so<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:04.700> you<00:03:04.760> can<00:03:04.970> see<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.390> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
pyramid okay so now you can see that the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.900 
pyramid okay so now you can see that the
the<00:03:05.900> ball<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.470> pushed<00:03:06.680> in<00:03:06.890> and<00:03:07.310> for<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.700> next

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
the ball is pushed in and for the next

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.410 
the ball is pushed in and for the next
step

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.430 

what<00:03:11.420> we<00:03:11.510> do<00:03:11.660> back<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.200> starting<00:03:14.230> yes<00:03:15.230> we

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
what we do back to the starting yes we

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.960 
what we do back to the starting yes we
go<00:03:15.620> here<00:03:16.010> and<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.930> step<00:03:18.579> one<00:03:19.579> needs<00:03:19.820> to

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
go here and this step one needs to

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.990 
go here and this step one needs to
happen<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.739> tunnel<00:03:21.739> six<00:03:22.100> where<00:03:22.519> I<00:03:22.549> am<00:03:22.790> now

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
happen the tunnel six where I am now

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.940 
happen the tunnel six where I am now
needs<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.630> have<00:03:23.750> been<00:03:23.959> decompressed<00:03:24.650> by<00:03:25.190> the

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
needs to have been decompressed by the

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.380 
needs to have been decompressed by the
excavator<00:03:27.950> so<00:03:28.250> after<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.700> you'll<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 
excavator so after that you'll see the

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.030 
excavator so after that you'll see the
focusing<00:03:29.810> stone<00:03:30.019> from<00:03:30.230> shangri-la<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:30.890> have

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
focusing stone from shangri-la we have

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.310 
focusing stone from shangri-la we have
to<00:03:31.160> do<00:03:31.280> you<00:03:32.180> just<00:03:32.360> have<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.570> knife<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.230> it

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
to do you just have to knife it and it

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.680 
to do you just have to knife it and it
will<00:03:33.380> bounce<00:03:33.590> around<00:03:33.829> and<00:03:34.370> kind<00:03:35.329> of<00:03:35.390> float

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
will bounce around and kind of float

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.350 
will bounce around and kind of float
bounce<00:03:35.930> around<00:03:36.079> and<00:03:36.670> it'll<00:03:37.670> go<00:03:37.820> all<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.329> way

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
bounce around and it'll go all the way

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.530 
bounce around and it'll go all the way
round<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:40.250> map<00:03:40.430> basically<00:03:40.880> well<00:03:41.299> not<00:03:41.420> all

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
round the map basically well not all

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.380 
round the map basically well not all
around<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.870> run<00:03:42.019> but<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.320> you'll<00:03:42.799> see<00:03:43.000> okay

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
around the run but like you'll see okay

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.720 
around the run but like you'll see okay
so<00:03:44.959> then<00:03:45.170> whenever<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.769> stops<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:46.250> knife<00:03:46.459> it

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
so then whenever it stops just knife it

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.060 
so then whenever it stops just knife it
and<00:03:47.660> sometimes<00:03:47.900> you<00:03:48.230> shoot<00:03:48.500> it<00:03:48.650> I'll<00:03:48.799> show<00:03:49.010> you

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
and sometimes you shoot it I'll show you

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.970 
and sometimes you shoot it I'll show you
that<00:03:49.160> later<00:03:49.299> but<00:03:50.299> knife<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:50.989> will<00:03:51.170> just

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
that later but knife it and it will just

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.789 
that later but knife it and it will just
do<00:03:52.190> its<00:03:52.340> thing<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.700> don't<00:03:52.820> have<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:53.209> like<00:03:53.900> all

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
do its thing you don't have to like all

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.170 
do its thing you don't have to like all
you<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.100> do<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.310> knife<00:03:55.519> it<00:03:55.700> when<00:03:55.820> it<00:03:55.910> stops

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
you have to do is knife it when it stops

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:04.010 
you have to do is knife it when it stops
so<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:59.540> stops<00:04:00.049> there

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:04.020 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.990 

I<00:04:04.340> think<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> have<00:04:05.460> to<00:04:05.550> shoot<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.850> there

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
I think I have to shoot it there

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.850 
I think I have to shoot it there
actually<00:04:06.300> well<00:04:06.930> you<00:04:07.050> can<00:04:07.260> shoot<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.560> or<00:04:07.680> knife

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
actually well you can shoot it or knife

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.920 
actually well you can shoot it or knife
it<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:08.250> I<00:04:08.400> couldn't<00:04:08.700> reach<00:04:08.850> there<00:04:09.150> no<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
it but I couldn't reach there no you

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.270 
it but I couldn't reach there no you
have<00:04:10.050> to<00:04:10.200> do<00:04:10.320> you<00:04:10.380> have<00:04:10.470> to<00:04:10.530> open<00:04:10.830> the<00:04:10.890> door<00:04:11.070> so

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
have to do you have to open the door so

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.360 
have to do you have to open the door so
we<00:04:11.310> can<00:04:11.430> go<00:04:11.580> through<00:04:11.760> and<00:04:12.320> then<00:04:13.320> it'll<00:04:13.560> go<00:04:13.830> what

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
we can go through and then it'll go what

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.250 
we can go through and then it'll go what
we'll<00:04:14.490> do<00:04:14.670> then<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:15.180> was<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.660> bit<00:04:15.780> confused<00:04:15.930> but

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
we'll do then I was a bit confused but

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.590 
we'll do then I was a bit confused but
what<00:04:16.380> actually<00:04:16.500> does<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.420> part

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
what actually does this is the part

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.820 
what actually does this is the part
where<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:18.780> need<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.020> wave<00:04:19.170> gun<00:04:19.440> so<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.709> should

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
where you need the wave gun so I should

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.199 
where you need the wave gun so I should
have<00:04:19.950> missed<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.160> earlier<00:04:20.340> but<00:04:20.670> what<00:04:20.820> what

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
have missed that earlier but what what

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.830 
have missed that earlier but what what
um<00:04:21.500> what<00:04:22.500> do<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:23.580> get<00:04:23.880> out<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> wave<00:04:24.300> gun<00:04:24.600> and

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
um what do you get out the wave gun and

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.200 
um what do you get out the wave gun and
what<00:04:25.680> it<00:04:25.830> would<00:04:26.100> have<00:04:26.160> done<00:04:26.430> it<00:04:26.730> goes<00:04:26.910> up<00:04:27.090> to

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
what it would have done it goes up to

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.670 
what it would have done it goes up to
that<00:04:27.360> dish<00:04:27.600> and<00:04:27.930> you<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.260> shoot<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.480> and

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
that dish and you have to shoot it and

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.470 
that dish and you have to shoot it and
there<00:04:31.680> we<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.860> you<00:04:32.190> can<00:04:32.250> see<00:04:32.550> it<00:04:32.820> goes<00:04:33.210> back

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
there we go you can see it goes back

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.430 
there we go you can see it goes back
down<00:04:34.730> to<00:04:35.730> where<00:04:35.850> we<00:04:36.000> are<00:04:36.030> now<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:37.140> you<00:04:37.350> just

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
down to where we are now and you just

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.700 
down to where we are now and you just
have<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.680> follow<00:04:37.830> it<00:04:38.570> there<00:04:39.570> is<00:04:39.720> and<00:04:40.050> it'll<00:04:40.560> go

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
have to follow it there is and it'll go

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.310 
have to follow it there is and it'll go
through<00:04:40.920> tunnel<00:04:41.370> 11<00:04:41.760> now<00:04:42.660> I'd<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.170> made<00:04:43.290> a

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
through tunnel 11 now I'd have made a

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.470 
through tunnel 11 now I'd have made a
mistake<00:04:43.440> here<00:04:43.740> badly<00:04:44.420> basically<00:04:45.420> the

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
mistake here badly basically the

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.230 
mistake here badly basically the
excavator<00:04:46.020> had<00:04:46.650> been<00:04:46.860> in<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.670> decompressed

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
excavator had been in the decompressed

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.110 
excavator had been in the decompressed
and<00:04:48.360> was<00:04:48.510> still<00:04:48.720> in<00:04:48.930> ten<00:04:49.320> eleven<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:49.980> I<00:04:50.220> knifed

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
and was still in ten eleven so I knifed

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.990 
and was still in ten eleven so I knifed
it<00:04:51.330> there<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.900> was<00:04:52.710> like<00:04:52.920> shit<00:04:53.220> so<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.700> thought<00:04:53.910> it

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
it there I was like shit so I thought it

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.430 
it there I was like shit so I thought it
was<00:04:54.090> going<00:04:54.240> to<00:04:54.300> get<00:04:54.480> like<00:04:54.630> I<00:04:54.810> thought<00:04:55.260> that<00:04:55.320> I

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
was going to get like I thought that I

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.070 
was going to get like I thought that I
was<00:04:55.530> ruined<00:04:56.010> then<00:04:56.190> but<00:04:57.120> I<00:04:57.150> hopefully<00:04:57.450> luckily

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
was ruined then but I hopefully luckily

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.380 
was ruined then but I hopefully luckily
not<00:04:58.200> what<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.380> did<00:04:58.590> I<00:04:58.710> got<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.860> hacker<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.490> I

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
not what I did I got the hacker and I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.580 
not what I did I got the hacker and I
went<00:05:00.540> to<00:05:00.630> hack<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:01.430> excavator<00:05:02.430> and<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:04.320> went

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
went to hack the excavator and it went

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.460 
went to hack the excavator and it went
back<00:05:04.680> out<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.040> I<00:05:05.310> could<00:05:05.870> basically<00:05:06.870> go<00:05:07.260> back

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
back out and I could basically go back

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.560 
back out and I could basically go back
and<00:05:07.680> find<00:05:07.980> the<00:05:08.220> focusing<00:05:08.760> stone<00:05:09.000> again<00:05:09.210> trying

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
and find the focusing stone again trying

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.500 
and find the focusing stone again trying
I<00:05:09.750> fit<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.430> had<00:05:11.760> a<00:05:11.820> bit<00:05:12.000> of<00:05:12.030> problems

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510
