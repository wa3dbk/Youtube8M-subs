hey guys welcome to pucker powder we're

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.360 
hey guys welcome to pucker powder we're
really<00:00:05.140> excited<00:00:05.560> to<00:00:05.950> tell<00:00:06.100> you<00:00:06.129> about<00:00:06.279> a

machine<00:00:08.850> today<00:00:09.850> we're<00:00:09.970> going<00:00:10.060> to<00:00:10.150> be<00:00:10.210> showing

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
machine today we're going to be showing

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.120 
machine today we're going to be showing
you<00:00:10.600> how<00:00:10.630> to<00:00:10.780> change<00:00:11.140> out<00:00:11.440> from<00:00:11.710> the<00:00:11.830> old

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
you how to change out from the old

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:14.340 
you how to change out from the old
mechanisms<00:00:12.790> to<00:00:13.360> the<00:00:13.450> new<00:00:13.570> mechanisms<00:00:14.110> and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:14.350 
mechanisms to the new mechanisms and

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.900 
mechanisms to the new mechanisms and
then<00:00:14.530> how<00:00:14.650> to<00:00:14.710> fill<00:00:14.920> those<00:00:15.040> mechanisms<00:00:15.310> with

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
then how to fill those mechanisms with

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.089 
then how to fill those mechanisms with
your<00:00:16.059> pucker<00:00:16.270> powder<00:00:16.480> when<00:00:17.439> you<00:00:17.529> upgrade<00:00:17.740> your

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
your pucker powder when you upgrade your

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.409

machine<00:00:18.189> we're<00:00:18.789> going<00:00:18.910> to<00:00:18.970> be<00:00:19.060> sending<00:00:19.390> you

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
machine we're going to be sending you

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.560 
machine we're going to be sending you
five<00:00:20.320> of<00:00:20.650> the<00:00:20.769> new<00:00:20.859> mechanisms<00:00:21.460> along<00:00:22.300> with

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
five of the new mechanisms along with

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.519

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
how to change out from your older

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.670 
how to change out from your older
mechanism<00:00:33.250> to<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.609> new<00:00:33.699> mechanism<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:35.590> the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
mechanism to the new mechanism so the

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.599 
mechanism to the new mechanism so the
first<00:00:35.859> thing<00:00:35.980> we're<00:00:36.100> gonna<00:00:36.190> do<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.460> remove

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609 
first thing we're gonna do is remove

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.230 
just pull that movie fast we're going to
mount<00:01:08.500> the<00:01:08.860> mounting<00:01:09.220> bracket<00:01:09.610> and<00:01:09.760> you<00:01:10.120> just

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
mount the mounting bracket and you just

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.610 
mount the mounting bracket and you just
want<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.390> make<00:01:10.510> sure<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:10.840> your<00:01:11.050> arrow<00:01:11.260> is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
want to make sure that your arrow is

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.460 
want to make sure that your arrow is
pointing<00:01:12.100> up<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:13.390> you're<00:01:13.540> going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.780> type<00:01:14.140> two

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470

pointing up and you're going to type two
of<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:15.070> new<00:01:15.610> screws<00:01:15.940> that<00:01:16.090> we<00:01:16.210> send<00:01:16.480> you<00:01:16.630> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
of the new screws that we send you and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
of the new screws that we send you and
just<00:01:18.130> line<00:01:18.310> those<00:01:18.550> up<00:01:18.610> with<00:01:19.000> the<00:01:19.060> two<00:01:19.150> holes

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.470 

and<00:01:23.590> it<00:01:23.890> may<00:01:23.980> use<00:01:24.130> the<00:01:24.250> allen<00:01:24.400> wrench<00:01:24.550> and<00:01:25.120> just

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
and it may use the allen wrench and just

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:45.450 
and it may use the allen wrench and just
screw<00:01:25.690> those<00:01:25.810> into<00:01:26.050> place<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:45.160> want<00:01:45.400> to

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
screw those into place you just want to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.320 
screw those into place you just want to
get<00:01:45.520> them<00:01:45.640> good<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:45.820> tight<00:01:48.030> next<00:01:49.030> we're<00:01:49.240> going

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
get them good and tight next we're going

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.570 
get them good and tight next we're going
to<00:01:49.420> install<00:01:49.720> your<00:01:50.140> new<00:01:50.200> mechanism<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.280> you

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
to install your new mechanism and you

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.070 
to install your new mechanism and you
just<00:01:51.760> want<00:01:51.880> to<00:01:51.910> make<00:01:52.060> sure<00:01:52.300> that<00:01:52.750> your

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
just want to make sure that your

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.460 
just want to make sure that your
mounting<00:01:53.680> posts<00:01:54.190> are<00:01:54.420> lined<00:01:55.420> up<00:01:55.660> with<00:01:56.050> the<00:01:56.229> top

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
mounting posts are lined up with the top

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.070 
mounting posts are lined up with the top
holes<00:01:56.800> in<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.340> mounting<00:01:57.640> bracket<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:58.990> you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
holes in the mounting bracket and so you

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.390 
holes in the mounting bracket and so you
just<00:01:59.200> want<00:01:59.410> to<00:01:59.470> put<00:01:59.619> those<00:01:59.740> up<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.130> the<00:02:00.160> top

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
just want to put those up in the top

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.359 
just want to put those up in the top
holes<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.750> then<00:02:02.229> slide<00:02:02.530> down<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:02.979> lock<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
holes and then slide down and lock the

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.700 
holes and then slide down and lock the
mechanism<00:02:03.790> into<00:02:03.940> place<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:05.350> you're<00:02:05.530> going<00:02:05.650> to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
mechanism into place now you're going to

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.080 
mechanism into place now you're going to
fill<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.979> new<00:02:06.130> mechanism<00:02:06.729> with<00:02:06.880> pucker

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
fill the new mechanism with pucker

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.969 
fill the new mechanism with pucker
powder<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.750> to<00:02:08.170> do<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.500> you're<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:08.830> going

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
powder and to do this you're just going

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.310 
powder and to do this you're just going
to<00:02:09.160> lift<00:02:09.340> up<00:02:09.520> gently<00:02:09.789> on<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.420> top<00:02:10.539> of<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.230> new

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
to lift up gently on the top of the new

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.230 
to lift up gently on the top of the new
mechanism<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.460> just<00:02:12.610> kind<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.790> set<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
mechanism I'm just kind of set that to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.930 
mechanism I'm just kind of set that to
the<00:02:13.270> side<00:02:14.160> you're<00:02:15.160> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.340> tear<00:02:15.520> open<00:02:15.550> your

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
the side you're going to tear open your

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.460 
the side you're going to tear open your
bag<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.330> candy<00:02:16.660> at<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.780> tier<00:02:17.020> knotch

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
bag of candy at the tier knotch

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.130 
bag of candy at the tier knotch
and<00:02:18.280> then<00:02:19.210> you're<00:02:19.300> just<00:02:19.390> going<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.600> pour<00:02:19.870> to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
and then you're just going to pour to

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:33.530 
and then you're just going to pour to
pucker<00:02:20.350> powder<00:02:20.650> into<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.640> mechanism
