00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
enough but what are your thoughts the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.300

one<00:01:09.689> thing<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.290> disagree<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:11.040> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
one thing that I would disagree is that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.890 
one thing that I would disagree is that
I<00:01:11.460> don't<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.479> showing<00:01:12.689> up

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
