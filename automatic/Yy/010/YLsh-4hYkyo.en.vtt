00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.859
 well swag good to all friends this is 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.830
 and north to welcome for a very video 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 special since it's on a video on 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 the site lucky that in France I had 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 already made a video on it to say that 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.609
 I was on the site I will come back to the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.059
 end of this video on clash ofcl in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.890
 France so yes I come back to this site 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.579
 because a new section appeared 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.420
 on the site 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.540
 it's the wiki section that allows 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.450
 to have information about the game 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.860
 clash of clowns for people who 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.809
 want to get clash of clan everything 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.449
 just like that they can have 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.000
 a small presentation of the game as well as 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.260
 interesting elements of the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 gameplay so I show you this because 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.590
 that it's likely to evolve over time 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 days it's slowly risking 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.220
 trestles simply 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.580
 so when we arrive on the index of the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.860
 wiki down a description we will say 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 that's handy because all these 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.330
 characters there are in png 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.720
 so I could reuse them for 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.560
 the thumbnails but we have a description 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.659
 etc. 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.340
 it's not the most interesting in the 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.290
 more interesting is here it's at 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.990
 say we have the defense categories 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 army troop winter resources which 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.369
 is really very useful because we 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.619
 will be able to have several informations 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.689
 for example on Madeira Defense we go 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.650
 can see the ranking in order 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.909
 priority of information then 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.530
 of improvement by people tell 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.570
 anything the indicated classification 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
 indicates the order of priority of 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.670
 improvements pardon tower of hell 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.530
 Africa this turn of exit and it's good 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.820
 knowing that I personally 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.320
 find that the walls are pretty 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.930
 important and puts it in last 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.960
 position anyway it's a pity then 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.939
 we see the types of the state she was able to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.670
 dyes different types of defense 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.320
 excuse me all the buildings can 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 improve with gold the walls to 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.730
 from welz finally here are things 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 that not everyone does not know what 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.019
 it's still words things 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.969
 there are some basic stuff but for them 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.939
 people who want to start putting themselves 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.769
 in the game it's really great 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.829
 improvement priorities then the 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.120
 improvement priorities it's really 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.680
 a good idea because it's true that 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.189
 many people often ask me 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.060
 do what first the king the thing 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.519
 so here is that 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.769
 not looked at he puts the king in wii he 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.920
 puts the heroes in the east so he puts the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.629
 king before the queen of the archers so the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.069
 troops are using data here are the 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.959
 trainings I leave you I'll go to you 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 let it look so yes it's not bad 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.510
 because it gives calculation tools 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.090
 that is, if we look at the 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.919
 online calculator for example you 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.900
 I do not know if you know this 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:57.239
 site there it's just you 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.209
 give yours number of barracks and 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.010
 it's quite slow, it's very complete loot 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.230
 calculator also that's pretty good 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.829
 I advise you to go watch this 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.310
 may interest you for the most 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:12.599
 most interested simply 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.829
 troops in the resource to their 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.540
 resources will see what there is I have not 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:18.510
 looked before I looked very very 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.819
 quickly made the first two so the gold 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.229
 the elixir the external black the gems 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.729
 it must be said that the site did not have 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:26.329
 interest for a long time that he put the wiki 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.500
 what we can already see the hummer raid 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.629
 we can slowly get gems 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.729
 with the contests on the website voila and 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:35.489
 yes super dirty is organizing contests on 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:36.629
 the official supercell forum so I 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.859
 advise you to go there if you have 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.879
 want to gems it is advisable to 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.329
 keep your genes to buy the 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:44.159
 huts of workers have more workers 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.530
 drastically the speed of improvement 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:49.319
 of your face here and that it was for 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.510
 resources and afterwards at various 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.329
 so it happens that yes to expand 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.060
 several different Ivorian athletes for 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.199
 the moment there is nothing so I you 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.299
 advise going to see to go do a 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:02.430
 turn like that it will also allow you 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.489
 for not knowing myself seeing my video for the 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.530
 forum know that it gets more and 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:11.540
 more important because it helps to 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.650
 reflect the French community in the 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.720
 the French community on some 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 thing that we'll say in the world and 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.130
 also to supercell because we are not 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.740
 very well known and it allows to give a 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:24.389
 good image of us here know that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.120
 this video I do them of my own free will 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.070
 because many had criticized 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.350
 the last clash video clan 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.120
 France so this video I do it from 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.340
 my own accord it is I who have decided to 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.280
 do it to give a positive image 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.540
 of the French community 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.810
 and know that now we can see 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.139
 who is online there are fa who is in 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.949
 line 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:47.930
 and yes so over in fact know that if 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.280
 I am not very often connected 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.720
 on the forum it's just by 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.520
 lack of time and it felt 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.370
 also in the videos I have less of 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.270
 time for videos here on this I 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.949
 wish you a good day a 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.080
 good evening it depends on the time it 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.550
 is I leave you stubborn to have 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.550
 watched this video go ciao
