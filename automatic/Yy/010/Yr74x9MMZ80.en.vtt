00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.850
 hi to all from the bakery santa rita 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.599
 of maurizio spinello today we will make you 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.519
 see how the sourdough activates 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.210
 dried first of all you have to go out 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:28.769
 out of the fridge and keep it at temperature 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.769
 environment for about an hour 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.380
 start with weighing 30 g of water 20 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.380
 degrees 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.660
 then pour the yeast into a bowl 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 of glass 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.770
 and at this point we add water 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.590
 and Madama begins 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.590
 bad all 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.990
 the dough should be enough 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.990
 under 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.410
 we form a ball 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.020
 to then insert the in a container of 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.020
 plastic 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:00.270
 we close and let it rest for 24 hours 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.490
 covered with a tea towel at a temperature 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.490
 of 25 27 degrees 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.290
 the 24 hours have now passed 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:20.810
 we will start the first refreshment ie 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.299
 we will begin to feed our debt 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.890
 you remember with fresh flour 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:30.590
 yesterday we added 30 g of water to the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:35.060
 our 100 g of sourdough 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.359
 so we got a mass of 130 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.870
 grams now we have to add 130 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.870
 grams of flour and 65 g of water 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:03:03.030
 and we begin to knead we form 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.030
 always a ball 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.260
 and we keep a little more in a container 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.260
 great 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.160
 the yeast 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.710
 he begins to increase his volume 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.050
 this is a sign that everything proceeds by 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.200
 the best 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:33.650
 let's start with the second refreshment 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.430
 we think 130 grams of yeast 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.430
 let's put it in the bowl 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.090
 the remainder must be thrown away 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.480
 and add the doses of the first 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.480
 refreshment 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.410
 we always form a ball and 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.229
 we keep for the usual 24 hours of 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.800
 rest at this point the yeast is 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.800
 ready
