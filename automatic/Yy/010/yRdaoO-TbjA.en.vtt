it's really really simple and also you

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.250 
it's really really simple and also you
can<00:00:49.469> here<00:00:49.739> go<00:00:50.340> manually<00:00:50.850> or<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> don't

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
can here go manually or if you don't

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.350 
can here go manually or if you don't
know<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.940> automatically<00:00:53.940> detect

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
know you can just automatically detect

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.790 
know you can just automatically detect
and<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.899> like<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> innovate<00:00:56.629> so

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
and it's not like you can innovate so

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.189 
and it's not like you can innovate so
yeah<00:00:58.800> that's<00:00:59.070> pretty<00:00:59.219> much<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.420> takes

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
yeah that's pretty much it it takes

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.429 
yeah that's pretty much it it takes
about<00:01:01.379> 10<00:01:01.949> minutes<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:03.110> download<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.409> install

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
about 10 minutes to download and install

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.630 
about 10 minutes to download and install
drivers<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.689> gonna<00:01:06.869> probably<00:01:07.640> about

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
drivers but it's gonna probably about

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.340 
drivers but it's gonna probably about
95%<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.049> gonna<00:01:10.170> fix<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.650> problem<00:01:11.210> I<00:01:12.350> don't

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
95% it's gonna fix the problem I don't

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.910 
95% it's gonna fix the problem I don't
think<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.710> need<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.070> if<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.030> have<00:01:15.240> AMD

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
think you need to know if you have AMD

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
think you need to know if you have AMD
graphics<00:01:16.920> card<00:01:17.280> or<00:01:17.520> Nvidia<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.119> don't

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
graphics card or Nvidia if you don't

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.960 
graphics card or Nvidia if you don't
know<00:01:20.600> which<00:01:21.600> craft<00:01:21.960> cars<00:01:22.310> which<00:01:23.310> craft<00:01:23.700> card

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
know which craft cars which craft card

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.380 
know which craft cars which craft card
you<00:01:24.090> have<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.659> go<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> device<00:01:25.320> manager

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
you have just go to the device manager

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.890 
you have just go to the device manager
Ibis<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.740> display<00:01:29.430> adapters<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.570> you

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
Ibis and go to display adapters and you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.140 
Ibis and go to display adapters and you
can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.710> Nvidia<00:01:32.310> or<00:01:33.140> 80<00:01:34.140> Radeon<00:01:35.150> so

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
can see here Nvidia or 80 Radeon so

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
can see here Nvidia or 80 Radeon so
that's<00:01:36.810> pretty<00:01:37.020> much<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.409> just<00:01:37.740> download<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that's pretty much it just download it

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.280 
that's pretty much it just download it
it<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.810> not<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.290> doesn't<00:01:40.890> have<00:01:40.920> any<00:01:41.340> virus<00:01:41.729> or

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290

it it's not it doesn't have any virus or
anything<00:01:43.290> like<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:44.899> when<00:01:45.899> you're

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
anything like that but when you're

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.770 
anything like that but when you're
installing<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.740> drivers<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.909> probably

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
installing the drivers you probably

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.569 
installing the drivers you probably
going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> little<00:01:49.530> flashes<00:01:50.070> on<00:01:50.399> your
