00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
man I'll tell ya this is gonna be a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
man I'll tell ya this is gonna be a
rough<00:02:38.319> ride<00:02:39.599> we<00:02:41.010> give<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.129> an<00:02:42.220> idea<00:02:42.370> in<00:02:42.909> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
rough ride we give you an idea in the

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.470 
rough ride we give you an idea in the
first<00:02:43.170> two<00:02:44.170> hours<00:02:44.879> we<00:02:45.879> did<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.560> 135<00:02:47.560> miles

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
first two hours we did that 135 miles

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.750 
first two hours we did that 135 miles
switches<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:50.280> which<00:02:51.280> is<00:02:51.430> pretty<00:02:51.670> good<00:02:51.819> time

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.290 

but<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:56.030> all<00:02:56.180> come

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.470 

blew<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> hose<00:03:01.170> tank<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.800> gas<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:02.480> 135

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
blew a hose tank of gas in that 135

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.320 
blew a hose tank of gas in that 135
miles<00:03:03.960> so<00:03:04.440> i<00:03:04.890> guess<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.670> can<00:03:05.790> kind<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.120> figure

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
miles so i guess you can kind of figure

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.740 
miles so i guess you can kind of figure
what<00:03:06.660> we<00:03:06.810> were<00:03:06.960> doing<00:03:07.350> up<00:03:08.130> high<00:03:08.790> 70<00:03:09.420> towards

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
what we were doing up high 70 towards

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.650 
what we were doing up high 70 towards
Kansas<00:03:10.020> City<00:03:10.580> we<00:03:11.580> were<00:03:11.670> getting<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.210> a<00:03:12.240> little

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
Kansas City we were getting on a little

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.420 
Kansas City we were getting on a little
better<00:03:12.840> plan<00:03:13.140> a<00:03:13.170> little<00:03:13.440> bit<00:03:13.740> back<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.190> forth

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
better plan a little bit back and forth

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.809 
better plan a little bit back and forth
so

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
so

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.360 
so
that's<00:03:15.999> why<00:03:16.180> we<00:03:16.209> blew<00:03:16.629> so<00:03:16.870> much<00:03:16.989> gas<00:03:17.370> usually

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
that's why we blew so much gas usually

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.099 
that's why we blew so much gas usually
you<00:03:18.969> know<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.299> highway<00:03:19.659> from<00:03:19.719> the<00:03:19.959> highway

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
you know the highway from the highway

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.849 
you know the highway from the highway
I'm<00:03:20.590> doing<00:03:20.889> like<00:03:21.040> 70<00:03:21.519> 35<00:03:21.849> mile<00:03:22.209> an<00:03:22.239> hour<00:03:22.859> I'll

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:23.859 
I'm doing like 70 35 mile an hour I'll

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:27.839 
I'm doing like 70 35 mile an hour I'll
get<00:03:24.159> close<00:03:24.730> to<00:03:24.939> 200<00:03:25.359> miles<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:27.310> that<00:03:27.489> was<00:03:27.639> kind

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
get close to 200 miles so that was kind

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.000 
get close to 200 miles so that was kind
of<00:03:28.349> those<00:03:29.349> kind<00:03:29.680> of

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
of those kind of

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.850 
of those kind of
weird<00:03:30.610> that<00:03:31.000> we<00:03:31.120> only<00:03:31.269> got<00:03:31.450> 135<00:03:32.080> I<00:03:32.290> didn't

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
weird that we only got 135 I didn't

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.380 
weird that we only got 135 I didn't
think<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.069> was<00:03:33.129> going<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.459> that

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
think it was going to be that

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.600 
think it was going to be that
so<00:03:35.390> now<00:03:35.810> we're<00:03:36.080> settling<00:03:36.620> down<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.280> good

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
so now we're settling down to a good

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.309 
so now we're settling down to a good
place<00:03:38.739> light<00:03:39.849> glows<00:03:40.849> are<00:03:41.090> good<00:03:41.300> traffic<00:03:41.810> light

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
place light glows are good traffic light

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.380 
place light glows are good traffic light
and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
and

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.690 
and
we<00:03:44.600> rewarded<00:03:45.140> for<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.590> stick<00:03:45.920> to<00:03:46.040> about<00:03:46.190> 80<00:03:46.550> to

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
we rewarded for the stick to about 80 to

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.940 
we rewarded for the stick to about 80 to
85<00:03:47.150> miles<00:03:47.770> on<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:49.160> on<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.090> dial<00:03:50.480> which<00:03:51.410> if<00:03:51.770> you

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
85 miles on the on the dial which if you

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.160 
85 miles on the on the dial which if you
can<00:03:52.130> see<00:03:52.970> my<00:03:53.180> gps<00:03:54.140> you'll<00:03:54.470> see<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:54.709> about<00:03:55.900> 74<00:03:56.900> to

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
can see my gps you'll see is about 74 to

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.640 
can see my gps you'll see is about 74 to
75<00:03:57.800> miles<00:03:58.160> an<00:03:58.400> hour<00:03:59.110> so<00:04:00.110> that's<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.620> think

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
75 miles an hour so that's I think

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.320 
75 miles an hour so that's I think
that's<00:04:00.920> a<00:04:01.010> good<00:04:01.160> speed<00:04:01.459> and<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:01.940> don't<00:04:02.150> think

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
that's a good speed and I don't think

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.670 
that's a good speed and I don't think
there's<00:04:02.450> any<00:04:02.600> reason<00:04:02.690> there<00:04:03.500> might<00:04:03.650> be

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
there's any reason there might be

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.770 
there's any reason there might be
certain<00:04:04.280> areas<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.030> the<00:04:05.150> trip<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.450> will

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
certain areas and the trip that will

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.320 
certain areas and the trip that will
maybe<00:04:06.430> try<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:07.459> make<00:04:07.730> a<00:04:07.760> little<00:04:07.970> bit<00:04:08.180> better

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
maybe try to make a little bit better

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.900 
maybe try to make a little bit better
time<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.170> especially<00:04:09.709> going<00:04:10.280> through<00:04:10.610> a<00:04:10.640> city

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
time but especially going through a city

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.699 
time but especially going through a city
like<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.450> we're<00:04:11.720> going<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.930> keep<00:04:12.110> it<00:04:12.290> you

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
like this we're going to keep it you

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.670 
like this we're going to keep it you
know<00:04:12.890> what<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.070> decent<00:04:13.959> kind<00:04:14.959> of<00:04:15.080> decent<00:04:15.200> speed

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
know what a decent kind of decent speed

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.150 
know what a decent kind of decent speed

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.500 

I

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
I

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.680 
I
suggest<00:05:37.020> trying<00:05:37.380> to<00:05:37.590> build<00:05:37.860> up<00:05:38.070> your<00:05:38.100> stamp

stamina

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:41.810 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.290 

because<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.590> is

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.300 

five<00:05:49.169> we're<00:05:50.169> getting<00:05:50.289> ready<00:05:50.440> to<00:05:50.740> pass<00:05:51.039> the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
five we're getting ready to pass the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.580 
five we're getting ready to pass the
state<00:05:51.639> lines<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.449> I<00:05:52.539> figure<00:05:52.870> they'd<00:05:53.050> go<00:05:53.259> ahead

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
state lines so I figure they'd go ahead

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.519 
state lines so I figure they'd go ahead
and<00:05:53.970> turn<00:05:54.970> the<00:05:55.240> camera<00:05:55.750> on<00:05:55.780> it

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
and turn the camera on it

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.399 
and turn the camera on it
you<00:05:56.709> know<00:05:56.859> every<00:05:57.189> little<00:05:57.309> bit<00:05:57.609> of

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.700 

it<00:06:03.890> was<00:06:04.130> that<00:06:04.310> much<00:06:04.520> better

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
it was that much better

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.130 
it was that much better
you<00:06:07.550> know<00:06:07.940> you<00:06:08.000> take<00:06:08.300> off<00:06:08.510> on<00:06:08.690> a<00:06:08.750> line<00:06:08.930> like
