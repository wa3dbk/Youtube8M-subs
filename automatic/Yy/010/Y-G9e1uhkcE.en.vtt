00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.009
 start all very welcome to this 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.430
 new tutorial i am andrÃ© also 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.579
 known as 110 bringing a tutorial 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.519
 fast and simple but very few 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:27.099
 people know and it's like blocking 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:31.179
 cars and weapons from the panel or without 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:33.410
 script or it has external script because 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.340
 the panel 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.530
 the panel that already brings the mt can do it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.800
 then we guide them and we go to 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 our panel with the p 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.180
 we are not going to restore and we look at the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.750
 room script that comes with the server 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:56.510
 we select it and we give settings 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:00.199
 ok here we go down 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.780
 so far we see this as brackets and 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.659
 next you should say health vehicles 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.659
 which means disabled vehicles 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.190
 we double click on it and enter the 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.550
 parentheses we will place the vehicle 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.320
 that we do not want to appear 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.290
 but if we do not, we do not know the idea of 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.940
 vehicle we close this let's player 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.680
 liquid tells you 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.920
 we search the vehicle we do not want 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.780
 putin they say 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.780
 to see I do not want them to use 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.590
 the river 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.590
 That model 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.990
 in this case I do not think they feel that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.360
 I give it to me 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:54.170
 we will go where he says p rino and law of 432 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.920
 432 we go back to settings 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.360
 we go down here says saber movies 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.000
 4 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:08.340
 32 ok 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.340
 now we get out of the vehicle 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.500
 let's go to the other panel let's create you 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.849
 yes I think it was just 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.849
 it was then 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.950
 I do not know where this 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.390
 wow I'm going out I do not know why to see 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.790
 we take out the square brackets 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.730
 our nephew was already doing 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.030
 brackets 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.849
 how blesses rhythms art not alone with 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.450
 when we try to take it out he wants 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.830
 say that we can not get it out but if it 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.690
 can take out from the panel 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.580
 administration 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.740
 only one environment can give the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.670
 vehicle 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:14.930
 the same with weapons 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:18.680
 we go for example we do not want the weapon 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.940
 wilpon we do not want the minibus by 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.000
 example 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.160
 we go we look for the minimum the 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.870
 we give 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.630
 and here we see where they say uy for me 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.400
 none is 38 then again 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.120
 we go to our resort 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.120
 settings 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.750
 and here it says we found and health and 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.750
 we buried everything again and it was 38 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.890
 we arrived here 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.890
 then I want to say 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.630
 the shovel of this to see if we can 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.630
 take it out again 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.090
 you have to say the minimum then let's go 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.730
 we try to take it out again as well 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:08.890
 says my no arrangement to lewis that is not 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.230
 we can take it out 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.470
 and that would be basically for example if 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:17.220
 they want to add another weapon that does not 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.600
 want another vehicle 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.600
 we give here we can sound 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.880
 a comma 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.370
 Y 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.370
 the 41 does not count the 48 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.710
 and the 31 best we all change to 31 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.190
 sorry if I'm wrong a lot because if 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.540
 time that I did not play to put as 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.580
 M4A1 to bless nice but I do it 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.660
 I can see with the admin panel that the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.660
 increases had they have the power 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.550
 the same with cars going to the panel 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.490
 the other idea of writing it in the first 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.129
 idea after eat and the other idea of 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.770
 another car 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:18.379
 and that would be all I hope there was 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:22.239
 liked it if it served you to like it 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:22.239
 please goodbye
