 the fact that I am not the people that 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.549
 for some crime committed 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:21.070

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.149

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.820
 from their religion among the people jalili what 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.609
 they are committed for crimes 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.829
 someone else was charged by another person and 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.039

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.519
 felled wasted zeratul childbirth ural and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.789
 soul will bear another's time no one soul 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:01.300
 bears someone else's time 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:08.550
 This from Surf morning 18 so from principles 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:12.160
 you or that they punished people for 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.350
 crimes are committed by other 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.650
 the reason for the crime of misconduct another 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.840
 man charges from some person 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.290
 who was not to blame and diamonds 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.820
 anatoly sent down ayat cooking lake to lakes 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:32.050
 grass for the hand about the soul does not carry time 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.300
 a stranger and so if the person did not commit 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.950
 some sin if he didn't commit 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.660
 crime and lawlessness then why 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.130
 need to charge him for lawlessness 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.579
 who committed friend 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.530
 and even the one that made you 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.689
 law is it close to him or is it his 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.640
 cousin or is it his father or is it 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.009
 his son is still impossible 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.950
 who committed the crime against himself 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.369
 do not innocent commit themselves 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.810
 man to punish for it 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.960
 the crime that someone committed 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.520
 other because if you punish him 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.810
 who has not really started 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.090
 the crime of another 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:17.080
 then this is injustice is lawlessness 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.989
 dreams don't approve of it if it doesn't recognize 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.560
 this is the quality of people uncle region 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.590
 which is present in this clever 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.500
 continues to be present unfortunately 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.470
 see for example some bedouins 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 hectares of tribes not only among the Bedouins 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.640
 tribes and some nations that live 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.140
 in the former Soviet Union there is this 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.940
 custom 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.650

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.010
 people had to collect muscles and kill 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.989
 some other person of this kind 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.730
 that person who is not involved 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.799
 the crime of which did not called 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.840
 then blood feud then spent killing 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.940
 in these these people who are to blame 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.530

 some tribe but this man is me 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:20.639
 noble has no weight they instead 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.030
 to punish this person take them 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.660
 kill or pave someone else from 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.290
 of this tribe 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.239
 which has nobility and will be weighty 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.250
 high-ranking person from this nation 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.510
 of this kind so that it does not say well 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.370

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.450
 or take revenge on him which they have some 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.030
 leader and hood leader stock then 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.280
 dignitary don't punish 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.590
 criminal and punishing for example sheikh 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.090
 this tribe the leader of this tribe 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.870
 someone who has a status in society 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.659
 high position in this tribe this here 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.359
 these actions of this action or and which 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:02.359
 need to avoid avoiding by all means 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.909
 crime is punished for him not 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:10.909
 other than the one who performed it and 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:17.070
 disgust pisos exacted rocks all 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.979
 this who committed this crime 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.889
 here it is and justice anatoly votes 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:25.410
 already says doctor manetta further ground 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.199
 farther court love if on tadane godfather 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.949
 who transgressed against you you transgress 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:36.840
 against him as much as you 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:41.570
 there will be nobody against you 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:44.639
 anatoly talos allows revenge wish 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.370
 equivalent and only to the person who 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:50.220
 did not commit this crime much 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.919
 so this is a great important rule that 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.060
 crime lake we are here auto suleiman 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:59.099
 ala a crime punishment for him 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.740
 responsible for it carries none other than 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.620
 the person who committed but not others 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:08.170
 it is clear now someone will say but in Islam 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:13.210
 there is such a hook such an establishment if 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:19.300
 some person committed some 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:22.150
 crime by mistake the driver crushed 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.200
 I did not intend to crush it 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.140
 ok why allah subhan va ta'ala 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.680
 doesn't lay dia here on the very 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:34.630
 the person who did this 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.140
 crime by mistake and imposes 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:42.160
 carrying a diet in excess for this imposes 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:44.490
 on his mouth on especially who she eats 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.250
 representatives of his kind in the male line 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:49.780
 why so we say that only 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.430
 the one who committed the crime he bears 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.600
 responsible for this why others 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.750
 why are they assigned to her 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:59.020
 paying diets to subhanalla because 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:02.560
 Islam is a religion of justice here 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.480
 just this fair this fair 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.330
 because such an establishment will inflict 

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:11.140
 imagine justice secondly 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:12.970
 mutual assistance between relatives 2 this 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.450
 man developed a crime committed on 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.040
 really no it happened by mistake 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.200
 happened by mistake he had no such 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:25.840
 there is no peace therefore very fair 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.390
 very fair by the way to his 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:32.890
 relatives they also took part in 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:35.350
 what do you pay me in payment 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.940
 of this ransom because the same 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.690
 relatives if the person died 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.100
 isn't it cute trail field quality 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.380
 heirs if he died 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.590
 Similarly, if it is a check completely 6 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.689
 something they also carry what they like when 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.549
 participation in the section 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:52.699
 inheritance they will take part in the section 

00:06:50.549 --> 00:06:54.689
 why pay diets 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:56.580
 as for the one who did 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:58.529
 crime purposely deliberately 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.049
 then such a person is responsible 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:05.459
 yourself go and pay yourself and relatives 

00:07:01.049 --> 00:07:07.909
 image pay well of course 

00:07:05.459 --> 00:07:10.079
 write to charge from this person 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:11.789
 punishment to this person and not to someone 

00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:13.439
 to another because he who committed 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:15.679
 this crime is with regard to this 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:15.679
 of the issue
