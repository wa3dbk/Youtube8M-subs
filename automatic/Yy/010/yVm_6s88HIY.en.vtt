00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.650 
see what frogs and flies has to offer
well<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.550> off<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> great<00:00:33.120> start<00:00:33.239> at

first<00:00:33.809> glance<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.500> graphics<00:00:34.860> are<00:00:34.949> pretty

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
first glance the graphics are pretty

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.399 
first glance the graphics are pretty
blocky<00:00:35.510> it's<00:00:36.510> basically<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> competition

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409 
blocky it's basically a competition

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:39.259 
blocky it's basically a competition
between<00:00:37.800> two<00:00:38.129> frogs<00:00:38.489> who<00:00:38.670> hopped<00:00:38.909> from<00:00:39.000> lily

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
between two frogs who hopped from lily

pad<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> lily<00:00:39.780> pad<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.710> are<00:00:40.829> some<00:00:40.949> huge<00:00:41.190> ass

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
pad to lily pad these are some huge ass

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.319 
pad to lily pad these are some huge ass
lily<00:00:41.699> pads

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
lily pads

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.210 
lily pads
you<00:00:42.900> catch<00:00:43.079> flickering<00:00:43.620> blocks<00:00:43.920> that<00:00:44.159> are

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
you catch flickering blocks that are

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.860 
you catch flickering blocks that are
supposed<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.760> flies<00:00:45.059> each<00:00:45.360> being<00:00:45.629> worth

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
supposed to be flies each being worth

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.899 
supposed to be flies each being worth
two<00:00:46.140> points<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.739> what<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.339> most<00:00:47.370> points

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
two points and what has the most points

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.299 
two points and what has the most points
at<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.030> end<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.449> time<00:00:48.659> limit<00:00:48.809> wins<00:00:49.309> that's

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
at the end of the time limit wins that's

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.939 
at the end of the time limit wins that's
about<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> really<00:00:52.109> any<00:00:52.350> fun<00:00:52.680> just

about it so is it really any fun just
hopping<00:00:53.280> back<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.640> forth<00:00:53.850> across<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> screen

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
graphics aren't even that great but who

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.229 
graphics aren't even that great but who
cares<00:01:01.679> it's<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> great<00:01:02.399> little<00:01:02.670> competitive

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.389 
cares it's a great little competitive
game<00:01:03.510> more<00:01:03.989> fun<00:01:04.259> with<00:01:04.379> multiplayer<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.009> course

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
game more fun with multiplayer of course

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.800 
game more fun with multiplayer of course
but<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:05.910> an<00:01:06.000> option<00:01:06.149> to<00:01:06.360> play<00:01:06.509> against

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
but there's an option to play against

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
but there's an option to play against
the<00:01:06.899> computer<00:01:07.190> there<00:01:08.190> are<00:01:08.250> two<00:01:08.369> variations

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the computer there are two variations

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.719 
the computer there are two variations
that<00:01:09.149> each<00:01:09.270> player<00:01:09.509> can<00:01:09.750> select<00:01:09.869> respectively

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
that each player can select respectively

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.130 
that each player can select respectively
the<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.940> one<00:01:12.060> makes<00:01:12.240> your<00:01:12.360> jumps<00:01:12.690> land<00:01:12.960> in

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the first one makes your jumps land in

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.870 
the first one makes your jumps land in
the<00:01:13.229> same<00:01:13.410> spot<00:01:13.470> every<00:01:13.800> time<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:14.550> all<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.759> have

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
the same spot every time so all you have

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.580 
the same spot every time so all you have
to<00:01:14.940> do<00:01:15.149> is<00:01:15.300> thrust<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> joystick<00:01:16.289> in<00:01:16.380> either

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
to do is thrust the joystick in either

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.169 
to do is thrust the joystick in either
direction<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.280> land<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:17.610> same<00:01:17.850> spot

00:01:18.169 --> 00:01:18.179 
direction and you land in the same spot

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:20.630 
direction and you land in the same spot
every<00:01:18.210> time<00:01:18.830> second<00:01:19.830> variation<00:01:20.039> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> little

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
every time second variation is a little

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.560 
every time second variation is a little
more<00:01:20.759> complex

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
more complex

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.359 
more complex
you<00:01:21.990> have<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.200> angle<00:01:22.350> your<00:01:22.500> jumps<00:01:22.890> accordingly

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
you have to angle your jumps accordingly

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.339 
you have to angle your jumps accordingly
you<00:01:23.819> might<00:01:23.970> fall<00:01:24.239> into<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.599> river<00:01:24.750> which<00:01:25.229> will

00:01:25.339 --> 00:01:25.349 
you might fall into the river which will

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.630 
you might fall into the river which will
delay<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.649> for<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:26.009> short<00:01:26.039> period<00:01:26.399> of<00:01:26.580> time

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
delay you for a short period of time

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
delay you for a short period of time
before<00:01:27.149> climbing<00:01:27.390> back<00:01:27.660> onto<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> lily<00:01:28.289> pad

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
before climbing back onto the lily pad

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.100 
before climbing back onto the lily pad
the<00:01:29.399> fly's<00:01:29.640> patterns<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> sporadic<00:01:30.720> at<00:01:30.869> times

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the fly's patterns of sporadic at times

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.449 
the fly's patterns of sporadic at times
you'd<00:01:31.410> think<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.800> they<00:01:31.890> were<00:01:31.979> moths

00:01:32.449 --> 00:01:32.459 
you'd think that they were moths

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:34.669 
you'd think that they were moths
but<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.119> avoids<00:01:33.509> monotony<00:01:34.050> and<00:01:34.289> adds<00:01:34.410> the

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
but this avoids monotony and adds the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.520 
but this avoids monotony and adds the
chance<00:01:34.950> factor<00:01:35.429> to<00:01:35.580> the<00:01:35.700> strategy<00:01:36.530> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
chance factor to the strategy the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
chance factor to the strategy the
background<00:01:37.920> gets<00:01:38.130> progressively<00:01:38.310> darker<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
background gets progressively darker and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
background gets progressively darker and
the<00:01:39.479> game<00:01:39.660> will<00:01:39.780> ends<00:01:39.989> a<00:01:40.110> short<00:01:40.349> time<00:01:40.560> after

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the game will ends a short time after

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.499 
the game will ends a short time after
nightfall<00:01:41.069> so<00:01:41.670> you'll<00:01:41.849> have<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.030> pretty<00:01:42.270> good

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
nightfall so you'll have a pretty good

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.210 
nightfall so you'll have a pretty good
idea<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.959> when<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.470> limit<00:01:43.739> is<00:01:43.770> reaching

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
idea of when the time limit is reaching

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.699 
idea of when the time limit is reaching
its<00:01:44.340> end<00:01:44.569> when<00:01:45.569> the<00:01:45.690> game<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.020> over<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.410> frogs

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
its end when the game is over the frogs

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:48.919 
its end when the game is over the frogs
hop<00:01:46.920> off<00:01:47.130> screen<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.819> Firefly<00:01:48.300> drags<00:01:48.690> at

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
hop off screen and a Firefly drags at
