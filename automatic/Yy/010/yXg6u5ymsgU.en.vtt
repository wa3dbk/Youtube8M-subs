00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:18.260
 Today I have my new permanent 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:21.830
 generator get that nice one 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.480
 thing is that even has a led and 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.480
 because it is operated with magnets 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 he needs no exciter voltage 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:47.530
 the generator and 700 watts has two 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:50.359
 change outputs so once 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.640
 AC voltage between the and the 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.699
 housings and again AC voltage 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.370
 So next school between the 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.530
 housing i would think that later 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.440
 test for different speeds 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.759
 let's see what's coming out of it and everything 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.310
 though with these young the the 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:15.409
 different translation 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:31.100
 very nice also to this disc and he 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:33.770
 I think 300 watts was right 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 powerful and I think so too 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.009
 loosely create the small generator to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.280
 operate and then look what the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.829
 so it's so exciting or when it's off again 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.130
 again everything for the experimental setup 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:55.040
 Of course , the generator has prepared the generator 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.479
 not fixed 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.960
 I can discuss that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.439
 of course, here are the different sizes 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.460
 try the slice 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.819
 this display but i say 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.100
 the number again and then we look 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.220
 Something he does I'm there 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.220
 curious; excited 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:27.050
 so now we can do that with the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:27.050
 smallest slice and action 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.500
 You can also nice the LEDs are like that 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500
 lamp 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.600
 he delivers now 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.460
 we want 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.150
 on the water side 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.150
 Beatrice 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.519
 OK 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.519
 then I build the just quickly to 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.090
 Let's have a look now have the same 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.090
 play normal 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.319
 perhaps 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.010
 next level 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.609
 20 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:16.630
 we still have two stages 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:19.110
 relatively slow from the speed so 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.170
 not equate to a normal one 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.850
 alternator from the car would be at 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:31.000
 this speed at all no 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:33.810
 So what kind of electricity do they produce? 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 penultimate 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.960
 yes she has to 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:46.960
 3 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:05:00.240
 and let's see a little one more 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:13.290
 motor here also the last stage 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:16.970
 really makes 27 worse out of one phase 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.970
 here is the second one 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.630
 still on the 30th 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.970
 also 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.930
 I would not have thought that now 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:10.949
 beautiful you can certainly beautiful 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:13.400
 film the thing out of it and see you 

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:13.400
 next time
