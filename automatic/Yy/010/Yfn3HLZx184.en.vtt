 that he was a proud warrior fell in 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 misfortune due to a false accusation and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.020

 the legendary wind technique many 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.240
 they thought I was destined to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.399
 become a great hero however 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.860
 that changed forever during the 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.959
 oxxean invasion ajaccio will be 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.819
 entrusted to protect an elder jong gio 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.310
 but his pride made him stupid and 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:46.979
 he thought that his sword would be the one that marked 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.259
 the difference so joined the battle 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.140
 when he returned he found the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.100
 old man murdered a disgraced 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.590
 He delivered 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.080
 prepared to pay for that error with your 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.450
 life however remained stone 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.330
 when he learned that he was not accused 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.549
 negligence but of the murder itself 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.160
 despite his dismay and be 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.200
 consumed by guilt he knew that if not 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.630
 they did nothing the real murderer was 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.880
 he would go unpunished and so he raised his sword 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.400
 against his own school and it opened 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.680
 path to slashes to freedom 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.800
 knowing that with his betrayal he was 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.150
 returning to all georgia against him 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.370
 completely alone for the first time in his 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.519
 life set out to find who 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.769
 really killed the old man and I passed the 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:33.720
 following years wandering trying 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:36.660
 find some clue that led you 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.430
 to the murderer during all that time his 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.920
 ancient allies followed him 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.560
 forcing him to constantly fight or 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.390
 dying his mission kept him going 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.900
 until one day he was discovered by 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.540
 enemy who most had his own 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.640
 johnny brother united by the same 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.680
 code of honor the two warriors will 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.019
 they saluted and drew their swords 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.370
 walking in circles were studied 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.860
 silently under the light of 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.409
 when their swords met jone 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.629
 was no match for jazz war that ended with 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.340
 his brother in one fell swoop I already released 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.590
 his gun and ran next to john 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.360
 seized by emotion asked 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.420
 how was it possible for his own brother 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.269
 I considered him guilty John answered 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.090
 the old man was killed with a technique 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.310
 of wind who would be if not already me 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.739
 he understood then why they accused him 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.989
 declared his innocence again robbed a 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.299
 again for the forgiveness of his brother 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:34.060
 tears flooded her face when her 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.280
 Brother died in his arms and his 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.590
 burial there is a low the rising sun 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.290
 but there was no time to save duels 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.329
 soon there would be someone else after him the 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.359
 revelation of his brother provided him 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.519
 a new purpose now had the 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.590
 track that I needed to find the 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:53.140
 real murderer performing a 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.120
 oath he gathered his belongings made 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.349
 one last look at johnny's grave and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.349
 left with the wind
