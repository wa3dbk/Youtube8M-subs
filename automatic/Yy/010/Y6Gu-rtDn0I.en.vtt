00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello everyone today we bring you the analysis 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.680
 of the 7-inch snack tablet that 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.200
 adds to the trend of many are 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 distributors and wholesalers of no 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.090
 make the hardware themselves 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.340
 take advantage in the manufacture of others in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 this case the 7 inch tablet 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:36.360
 corresponds to the bq maxwell plus model 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.950
 and we see that it has a line of 7 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.059
 inches very similar to all tablets 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.749
 of that size there is not much innovation 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.399
 except for some fabrications like 

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.379
 samsung that tend to other colors to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.000
 incorporate white even silver in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.180
 its manufacture 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.330
 and we see first of all that it has 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.480
 output on micro hdmi that is something 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.010
 quite good enough for this 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 type of devices that we can always 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.160
 have on the table and use as 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.110
 media player we see the mini usb 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.240
 in this case instead of micro usb that 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.610
 is the trend that is something 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.180
 rare 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.540
 we observed the micro sd slot here in 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.540
 the lateral 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.440
 at the top we would have the jack 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.270
 3.5 mm for the headphones or the 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.660
 device the music player 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.180
 externally and here we would have the button 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.800
 on and the volume we see that 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.860
 has a small camera in the part 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.390
 superior that is of poor quality 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.460
 vga but that is enough to 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.800
 videoconferences and that you have not opted for 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.080
 the rear camera that yes 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.210
 incorporates in other manufacturers we see that 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.550
 it has a rubber coating that is yes 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.920
 well it makes it very comfortable to handle with the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.750
 holding it in your hand you stain it with 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.240
 a lot of ease in fact you will see that there 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.460
 use marks of these days that are 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.680
 some are practically indelible 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.250
 that makes it quite the part 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.950
 back of the terminal 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.820
 the answer is quite clean and the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.130
 we really liked it 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.180
 although in specifications it goes a little 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.489
 short remember that 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.519
 we could talk about an average range of 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.840
 tablets I thought the price is a 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.790
 little bit more in the input range of 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.079
 middle range we have a tablet of 7 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.209
 inches with a dual processor 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.609
 1.6 gigahertz core 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.150
 the screen is 7 inches as we have 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:33.670
 said ips with resolution of 1024 x 600 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.549
 that if it's something short in relation to what 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.959
 that we are used to seeing in others 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.450
 tablets of this size the nexus 7 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.370
 to go no further has 8 gigas of 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.340
 internal storage that is expandable 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.959
 as we said by microsd up 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:52.299
 32gb and has a weight of about 350 360 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.730
 grams if yes it is light enough 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.150
 the 4100 milliamp battery that 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.389
 therefore guarantees about 6 or 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.239
 7 hours intensive non-intensive use 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.639
 we would be talking about 4 hours 4 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.909
 hours and a half approximately and that 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:12.040
 carries version 404 of android ice 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.620
 cream sanwich that in principle does not have 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.109
 we do not have news that he is going to 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.040
 arriving and living in at least soon 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:20.790
 weather 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 to turn it on 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.680
 I do not know if you notice but the lighting 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:36.390
 it is not is not homogeneous has has 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.390
 shadows on the edges 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.800
 well here we would have what is the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.180
 home screen as we said 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.160
 porta android 404 ice cream sandwich 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.050
 during the start if it's a little bit more 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.370
 a little more stumbling but 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.370
 then if it's a lot softer 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.410
 We are not going to spend a lot of time talking 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.480
 from the Android version because no 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.200
 has no layer on it's android 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.200
 pure and hard ' 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 and here we see 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.820
 The response speed is pretty 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.820
 good 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.069
 It is a tablet quite comfortable to handle 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.090
 especially in the past when we can 

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.090
 dispose of it with both hands 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.990
 and as we see 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 despite having only 1 gb of ram 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.840
 we are already used in the high range 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.240
 from other manufacturers that the trend 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.680
 is to incorporate 2 gigs there is even 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.840
 news out there of some terminal that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.770
 will come out even with three we see that it is 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.770
 pretty loose 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.270
 month 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.820
 the screen despite having the resolution 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.590
 cropped let's say though for 7 inches 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:05.030
 It should be more than enough 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.030
 It has good visibility 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:13.160
 and the answer as we see is quite 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.160
 good 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.639
 and if you want 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.490
 we are going to launch a test for you to see 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.540
 more or less the power level in the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.540
 that this tablet moves 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.990
 there is a lot of movement in the 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.990
 three d 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:08.680
 is something that is expected at least in this 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:08.680
 spectrum 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.320
 here you can see a little more of the jump in 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.460
 the transition is not as smooth as in 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.460
 the previous images 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.380
 and we see that with a score of three 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:38.150
 thousand 736 because it is located near the 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.000
 transformer prime that is very 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.590
 thank since it is the previous model 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.190
 the last transformer that has taken the 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.540
 asus house and below the one etc x 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.520
 but that we are already talking about a range 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.590
 high on smartphone despite having left 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.700
 to the web site, it is still a 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:54.700
 very powerful device 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:05.400
 as you see brings also some some 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.400
 preinstalled software like for example 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.570
 efe barry der and even snack books that 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.370
 you need your own account 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.180
 distributor to access the 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.880
 books in its online catalog 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.310
 and in general we liked it a lot 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:24.840
 it's a terminal that does not stand out 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:26.500
 because of its power the hdmi port does it 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.670
 quite 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:32.710
 useful let's say in the leisure environment not 

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:34.660
 only to show films but to 

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:37.360
 able to operate the tablet in one in a 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.810
 much bigger screen and especially 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.639
 we like that the price is 130 euros is 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.370
 the price of free snack 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:49.310
 and although it can not compete in power 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.350
 with its highest competitor in this field 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:54.320
 what is he 

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:57.170
 google nexus 7 because this one is like this 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:59.270
 also with 16 gigas in the 200 euros and 

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:02.960
 quite below with 70 euros less 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:05.380
 at 130 the snack tablet is a very 

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.380
 good choice
