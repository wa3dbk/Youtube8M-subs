00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:44.410

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:47.580
 Okay, so I'll talk it's about the 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.930
 punch I used was this one 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:56.830
 no hole but if you do not have money 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.410
 you can use is you can drill with 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.530
 needle only that there will be a hole 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.770
 the smaller you will have to use a tape 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.320
 Number 10 this here or you can 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.690
 use a crochet needle to drill 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.620
 also a tool 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.190
 well if you do not have that pierced 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.270
 here is when you put the 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.920
 pages you have to put all 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:32.140
 together here in this larger fifth, but it is 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:39.790
 only for example is when you close the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:42.220
 album she'll give a she'll run a 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.440
 bit then you go there after 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:49.870
 you fix that here cut to cut 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.540
 here leave a size only leaving here 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.720
 you put all the pages together 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:00.310
 punches put in and closes when 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.470

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.010
 cut all the leaves together that people 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.079
 Call me to reframe that's why. 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.519
 here it also has to be smaller than 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:18.680
 This is when he closes her. 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:22.350

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.900
 and I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.510
 that certainly gives you time to do 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.050
 amon the pages I made colorful because 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.460
 I already had these pages ready 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.100
 It was from another album that I was going to make 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.900
 I've been wrong here and there. 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.000
 reuse for this here but you can 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.390
 make it all brown 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.390
 fine 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.760
