00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.420
 Welcome, people, youtube talk. 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.549
 to another video on the vinicius channel 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.850
 tutorials and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.840
 how to leave ours in the top ten 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.670
 faster and lighter for this first 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.480
 You will enter the windows button 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.730
 xp 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.309
 the keyboard and here we will go into 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.149
 run 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 here you will run first 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:46.110
 percentage time percentage will give a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.420
 in having here you will have several folders 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.460
 temporary files that you can 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.460
 erase everything you have inside 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.090
 let's exclude 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.460
 after doing this you can is ignoring 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:13.890
 here the remaining files because they can 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.680
 be the files we are using 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.200
 now like this one is the program of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.549
 recording is what makes this file 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.890
 temporary 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.710
 then those are not going to have people's way 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.560
 delete is reminding you that you can 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.170
 exclude is quiet mind because they are 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 only temporary files are not 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.030
 no photos or videos of it 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.880
 now you will enter with a button 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.880
 windows and x again let's get into 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:50.130
 and you will put the command 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 pre chi chi 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:58.110
 that way we're going to give it an okay 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:05.970
 ask if you want to enter the folder 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:08.489
 you give permission to continue here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.979
 will also have many files 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.250
 temporary and there you are 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.579
 excluding everything also to be more 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:22.340
 You can give a control there easily. 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:22.340
 select everything okay let's delete 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.920
 Some are going to stay too, it's normal you 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.340
 Ignore him leaving and now we're going 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:39.709
 trying is with the ex windows button 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.709
 again we will enter the system 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.230
