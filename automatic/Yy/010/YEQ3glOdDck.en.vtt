plastic<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.250> don't<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.850> think<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.689> earned<00:02:03.899> plastic

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
plastic I don't I think I earned plastic

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.600 
plastic I don't I think I earned plastic
I<00:02:04.530> don't<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.860> that's<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.100> default<00:02:05.430> one

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
I don't think that's a default one

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.710 
I don't think that's a default one
nothing<00:02:06.329> else<00:02:06.540> has<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> default<00:02:07.079> one<00:02:08.000> and<00:02:09.000> as

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
nothing else has a default one and as

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.600 
nothing else has a default one and as
you<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.959> see<00:02:10.020> everything<00:02:10.560> has<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> cost<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.459> I'm

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you can see everything has a cost so I'm

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760 
you can see everything has a cost so I'm
gonna<00:02:11.819> have<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.209> the<00:02:12.360> money<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:13.349> do<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
gonna have to have the money to do it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.420 
gonna have to have the money to do it
and<00:02:13.950> then<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.190> have

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and then you have

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.910 
and then you have
why<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:15.870> finalize<00:02:16.319> it<00:02:16.349> these<00:02:16.680> are<00:02:16.859> the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
why to finalize it these are the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
why to finalize it these are the
patterns<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> I've<00:02:17.760> acquired<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.569> far
