00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
out from the rim it's good to use

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.050 
out from the rim it's good to use
different<00:03:29.040> shades<00:03:29.430> because<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:29.940> all

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
different shades because they all

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.900 
different shades because they all
contrast<00:03:30.600> even<00:03:31.050> though<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.230> same<00:03:31.440> color<00:03:31.910> it's

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
like using difference because they're

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.640 
like using difference because they're
all<00:03:34.590> different<00:03:34.860> or<00:03:35.220> contrasting<00:03:36.440> now<00:03:37.440> it's
