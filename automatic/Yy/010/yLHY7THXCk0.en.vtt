00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
here and also just you know pretty good

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.120 
here and also just you know pretty good
at<00:01:54.720> stopping<00:01:54.960> Trish<00:01:55.470> another<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.100> that

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
at stopping Trish another like that

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
at stopping Trish another like that
and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.909> my<00:01:57.119> one<00:01:57.329> copy<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.780> maxi<00:01:58.500> which<00:01:58.710> I

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and then my one copy of maxi which I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.670 
and then my one copy of maxi which I
just<00:01:59.070> run<00:01:59.219> because<00:01:59.490> honestly<00:01:59.909> it's<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.780> too

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
just run because honestly it's it's too

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530 
just run because honestly it's it's too
critical<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.729> able<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.969> draw<00:02:03.119> cars<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
critical to be able to draw cars and

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.250 
critical to be able to draw cars and
your<00:02:03.630> putter<00:02:03.780> starts<00:02:04.079> their<00:02:04.200> crazy

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
your putter starts their crazy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.110 
your putter starts their crazy
now<00:02:05.860> this<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.280> key<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.550> the<00:02:06.730> deck<00:02:06.880> I<00:02:07.000> had

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
now this is the key to the deck I had

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.490 
now this is the key to the deck I had
three<00:02:07.300> copies<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.690> fusion<00:02:07.990> gate<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.260> lets<00:02:08.440> me

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
three copies of fusion gate this lets me

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.469 
three copies of fusion gate this lets me
act<00:02:08.770> like<00:02:08.890> i<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.220> polymerization<00:02:09.880> right<00:02:10.360> in

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
act like i have polymerization right in

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.240 
act like i have polymerization right in
my<00:02:10.600> hand<00:02:10.630> or<00:02:11.050> rather<00:02:11.200> miracle<00:02:11.680> fusion<00:02:11.920> right

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
my hand or rather miracle fusion right

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.830 
my hand or rather miracle fusion right
in<00:02:12.340> my<00:02:12.400> hand<00:02:12.430> and<00:02:12.730> lets<00:02:12.910> me<00:02:13.000> remove<00:02:13.150> two

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
in my hand and lets me remove two

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.660 
in my hand and lets me remove two
monsters<00:02:14.290> from<00:02:14.410> play<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:15.070> order<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.460> summon

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
monsters from play in order to summon

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.980 
monsters from play in order to summon
any<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.570> these<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.020> aren't<00:02:17.200> masked<00:02:17.530> heroes

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
any of these that aren't masked heroes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.630 
any of these that aren't masked heroes
then<00:02:19.990> i<00:02:20.020> got<00:02:20.170> two<00:02:20.290> copies<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> miracle<00:02:21.070> I<00:02:21.220> have

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
then i got two copies of miracle I have

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.490 
then i got two copies of miracle I have
three<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:21.970> never<00:02:22.330> run<00:02:22.510> three<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:23.170> would<00:02:23.350> it

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
three I never run three it would it

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.100 
three I never run three it would it
would<00:02:23.530> just<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.800> overkill<00:02:24.190> with<00:02:24.250> Fusion<00:02:24.670> gate

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
would just be overkill with Fusion gate

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.660 
would just be overkill with Fusion gate
parallel<00:02:26.110> world<00:02:26.290> fusion<00:02:26.530> actually<00:02:27.100> really

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
parallel world fusion actually really

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.610 
parallel world fusion actually really
became<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.630> reason<00:02:28.960> that<00:02:28.990> I<00:02:29.110> built<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.470> deck

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
became the reason that I built this deck

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.170 
became the reason that I built this deck
is<00:02:29.680> because<00:02:29.950> with<00:02:30.340> Fusion<00:02:30.670> gate<00:02:30.820> you<00:02:30.940> remove

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
is because with Fusion gate you remove

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.970 
is because with Fusion gate you remove
ownership<00:02:31.420> from<00:02:31.660> play<00:02:31.870> with<00:02:32.410> parallel<00:02:32.830> world

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
ownership from play with parallel world

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.890 
ownership from play with parallel world
fusion<00:02:33.280> you<00:02:33.580> can<00:02:33.730> take<00:02:33.940> those<00:02:34.120> cards<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.810> are

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
fusion you can take those cards that are

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.780 
fusion you can take those cards that are
removed<00:02:35.110> from<00:02:35.200> play<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:35.620> fusion<00:02:36.340> with<00:02:36.550> them

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
removed from play and fusion with them

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.490 
removed from play and fusion with them
and<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.420> shuffles<00:02:37.630> them<00:02:37.810> back<00:02:37.990> into<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:38.320> deck

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
and it shuffles them back into the deck

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
and it shuffles them back into the deck
so<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.070> adds<00:02:39.460> them<00:02:39.700> right<00:02:39.880> back<00:02:40.030> in<00:02:40.210> there

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
so it just adds them right back in there

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.830 
so it just adds them right back in there
and<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.600> get<00:02:40.720> him<00:02:40.810> back<00:02:40.930> right<00:02:40.960> away<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:42.840> only

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
and you get him back right away I only

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.100 
and you get him back right away I only
run<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.260> ease<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:45.390> lot<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.480> people<00:02:46.690> say<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:46.990> sure

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
run to ease a lot of people say you sure

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.050 
run to ease a lot of people say you sure
on<00:02:47.230> three<00:02:47.440> I<00:02:47.590> never<00:02:48.190> find<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.730> have<00:02:48.940> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
on three I never find that I have the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.780 
on three I never find that I have the
problem<00:02:49.540> running<00:02:50.080> into<00:02:50.350> my<00:02:50.470> monsters<00:02:50.860> ever<00:02:51.430> I

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
problem running into my monsters ever I

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.940 
problem running into my monsters ever I
mean<00:02:52.210> you<00:02:52.330> really<00:02:52.600> get<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.170> him<00:02:53.380> really

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
mean you really get to him really

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.120 
mean you really get to him really
quickly<00:02:54.400> it<00:02:54.520> just<00:02:54.700> it's<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.300> way<00:02:55.420> it<00:02:55.510> happens

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
quickly it just it's the way it happens

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.530 
quickly it just it's the way it happens
especially<00:02:57.130> with<00:02:57.459> Stratus<00:02:57.880> traps<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.420> like

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
especially with Stratus traps is like

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.160 
especially with Stratus traps is like
roaming<00:02:58.810> 30<00:02:59.050> anyways<00:03:00.150> to<00:03:01.150> massive<00:03:01.570> change<00:03:01.840> now

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
roaming 30 anyways to massive change now

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.490 
roaming 30 anyways to massive change now
i<00:03:02.410> have<00:03:02.620> three<00:03:02.860> targets<00:03:03.250> for<00:03:03.340> mass<00:03:03.520> change<00:03:04.500> but

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
i have three targets for mass change but

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.160 
i have three targets for mass change but
really<00:03:05.860> as<00:03:06.820> soon<00:03:06.970> as<00:03:07.060> I<00:03:07.150> draw<00:03:07.360> it<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.660> have<00:03:07.870> so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
really as soon as I draw it I have so

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.690 
really as soon as I draw it I have so
many<00:03:08.290> water<00:03:08.560> monsters<00:03:09.010> than<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.160> runners<00:03:09.459> even

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
many water monsters than I runners even

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.300 
many water monsters than I runners even
funny<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.420> have<00:03:10.600> six<00:03:11.230> with<00:03:11.440> these<00:03:11.739> two<00:03:12.010> and

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
funny so I have six with these two and

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.130 
funny so I have six with these two and
then<00:03:12.670> these<00:03:12.910> two<00:03:12.970> make<00:03:13.390> it<00:03:13.420> not<00:03:13.750> at<00:03:14.020> least

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
then these two make it not at least

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.740 
then these two make it not at least
three<00:03:14.380> making<00:03:14.650> nine<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.880> honestly<00:03:16.480> mask

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
three making nine and honestly mask

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.050 
three making nine and honestly mask
changing<00:03:17.200> out<00:03:17.350> absolute<00:03:18.100> zero<00:03:18.340> it's

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
changing out absolute zero it's

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.780 
changing out absolute zero it's
incredible<00:03:19.930> huh<00:03:20.080> bro<00:03:20.560> oh<00:03:20.860> yeah<00:03:21.340> if<00:03:21.459> you<00:03:21.610> don't

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
incredible huh bro oh yeah if you don't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.240 
incredible huh bro oh yeah if you don't
know<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.120> mass<00:03:22.300> change<00:03:22.630> does<00:03:22.920> I'll<00:03:23.920> explain

it when i get to absolute zero i run one

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:27.780 
it when i get to absolute zero i run one
copy<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.230> terraforming<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.920> it's<00:03:27.010> i<00:03:27.130> mean<00:03:27.580> it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
copy of terraforming and it's i mean it

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.570
