00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:11.070

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.660

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.689
Oticon is excited to welcome you to the
next generation a Brain Hearing

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.550
Technology

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.119
powered by the new Inium Sense Platform.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.680
Hi, I'm Sheila Oliver, Vice President of
Marketing here at Oticon,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.189
and I am thrilled to be able to share
with you some details about how our new

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.219
Inium Sense Platform will help your
patients get more of what they need from

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.469
their hearing devices.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.540
The new Inium Sense Platform brings 30
percent more processing power

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.969
delivering improved real-time processing,
improved feedback management,

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.400
and up to 20 percent improvement and soft
speech understanding

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.310
and a fully integrated tinnitus solution
available in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.810
all performance levels and all styles. Now
you've heard me mention Brain Hearing

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.579
Technology,

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.000
but what is that exactly. One of the
things we know about

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.189
individuals with hearing loss is that
they perceive sounds differently

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.170
and unfortunately many hearing devices
are not able to account

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.930
for these individual variations in
perception. But why is that?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.659
It's because hearing is a cognitive
process. It happens here,

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.780
and our goal is to deliver better hearing
with less

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.850
effort by supporting how the brain makes
sense of sound. That's what Brain Hearing

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.650
Technology is all about

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.990
giving your patients exactly
what their brains need to hear properly.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.860
With customized solutions to match the
unique hearing profile

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.780
of each of your patients. You know,
patients notice this gap in their

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.290
ability to follow conversation.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.799
As a matter of fact, the number one reason
why new uses are even motivated to

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.500
visit a hearing care professional is
because they struggle communicating

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.860
in difficult listening situations.
That's why we believe that hearing care

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.689
is health care.

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.100
When people can't follow conversation
due to a hearing loss

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.150
it can leave them feeling isolated and
depressed

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.150
but by giving your patients access to
the latest Oticon solutions,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.200
you're in a position to not only improve
their hearing but also their overall

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.740
health

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.250
and that's great. Using Oticon's unique Personalization Process,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.379
we're able to assess for

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:16.480
instance, the patient's soft sound perception, so that
in noisy and challenging environments

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.439
your patients are getting an extra boost in
soft gain when they really need it

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.200
which is about 75 percent of the time
and this is where the additional

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.579
processing power

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.010
we built into the Inium Sense Platform
really shines.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.859
It starts with soft speech booster that
works in conjunction with our new

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.519
proprietary rationale,

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.889
Voice Align Compression Plus, so that your
patients can take full advantage of

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.230
their hearing capabilities.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.099
But what about feedback? You know, one of
the strengths of our hearing care

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.930
solutions has

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.930
always been striking that right balance
between

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.200
audibility and managing feedback, and now,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.970
thanks to the additional processing
power, we've been able to rebuild our

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.010
feedback system

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.359
to detect feedback faster, remove it
faster,

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.980
but at the same time not jeopardize
sound quality,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
performance, and audibility. In fact,

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.700
our new Inium Sense feedback shield is a
good example

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.980
of how all the new features on the Inium
Sense Platform

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.709
have been designed to work together. At
Oticon,

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.069
putting people first means helping
patients hear sound more naturally.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.400
Everything starts with the brain. Tinnitus,
for instance, is

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.440
often associated with hearing loss and
is primarily the brain's reaction to the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.379
loss of normal

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.019
input from the ear. Our fully-integrated
tinnitus sound support solutions

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.699
build on our brain hearing approach.
Available in Alta 2 Pro TI,

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.979
Nera Pro TI, and RIA 2 Pro TI.

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:45.159
In addition to traditional broadband
sounds

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.229
the hearing care professional patient
can select from three ocean sounds

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:53.479
and these sounds are unique and soothing.
They have clinically been shown to

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:54.709
reduce the annoyance

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.760
of tinnitus. Even with all of this the fitting
process is still simple

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.129
and intuitive. But we've included a new
shape-to-audiogram feature

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.629
to make it more efficient. Couple
that with our patient education and

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.259
counseling support materials

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:13.430
as well as our robust marketing
support and you'll find that the new

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.959
Inium Sense Platform, driven by Brain
Hearing Technology,

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.949
gives your patients exactly what they
need to hear in all styles

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.650
and all performance levels, achieving
ninety-six percent patient satisfaction

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.879
in both new and experience hearing
device users.
