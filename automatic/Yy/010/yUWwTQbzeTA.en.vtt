praying<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.720> it'll<00:03:43.019> be<00:03:43.139> javi<00:03:43.410> Alonso<00:03:43.980> I

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
praying that it'll be javi Alonso I

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.370 
praying that it'll be javi Alonso I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
would take a lawn so ever over every

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.440 
would take a lawn so ever over every
single<00:03:46.530> midfielder<00:03:47.220> aside<00:03:47.760> from<00:03:47.910> Lucas<00:03:48.269> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
single midfielder aside from Lucas and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.150 
single midfielder aside from Lucas and
Jared<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.989> we<00:03:49.109> have<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:50.010> would

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
Jared that we have I think you would

agree<00:03:50.220> with<00:03:50.489> me<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:51.350> there's<00:03:52.350> other

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
agree with me on that there's other

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.830 
agree with me on that there's other
issues<00:03:52.680> I<00:03:53.130> want<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:53.370> get<00:03:53.430> into<00:03:53.609> as<00:03:54.030> far<00:03:54.480> as<00:03:54.630> in

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
issues I want to get into as far as in

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080 
issues I want to get into as far as in
the<00:03:54.959> club<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.980> we'll<00:03:56.310> cover<00:03:56.549> those<00:03:56.790> another

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
the club but we'll cover those another

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.309 
the club but we'll cover those another
time<00:03:57.299> just<00:03:57.510> let<00:03:57.599> me<00:03:57.690> know<00:03:57.810> your<00:03:57.930> thoughts<00:03:57.989> on

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
time just let me know your thoughts on

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.599 
time just let me know your thoughts on
Clint<00:03:58.530> Dempsey<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.889> personally<00:03:59.400> don't<00:03:59.489> think

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
Clint Dempsey I personally don't think

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.550 
Clint Dempsey I personally don't think
he<00:03:59.910> would<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.359> best<00:04:00.569> signing<00:04:00.959> but<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.349> think

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
he would be the best signing but I think

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.620 
he would be the best signing but I think
we<00:04:01.650> could<00:04:01.769> work<00:04:02.069> with<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.459> if<00:04:02.609> we<00:04:03.060> released<00:04:03.420> a

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
we could work with it if we released a

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.420 
we could work with it if we released a
few<00:04:03.900> other<00:04:04.049> players<00:04:04.319> so<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.829> is<00:04:04.980> it<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.190> this
