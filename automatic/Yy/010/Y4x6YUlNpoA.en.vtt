00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.029
 princess acceptance today will tell you 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.220
 about one interesting poster 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 which sometimes appears in the rooms 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.110
 horror attraction sure to put 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 likes friends if you want to see more 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.880
 video on this game for the beginning let's 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.600
 Together we will look at the screenshot from the video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.109
 cameras 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.720
 number two is a room is an office and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.170
 closer to everyone here we can see the costume 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.420
 baths 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 some by the way think this is a suit 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.059
 Freddie he certainly looks like and if you lighten up 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.090
 the picture can be seen in color 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.620
 this bone is already stolen 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 if we look at the picture 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.800
 the final of the game we will see that the dismissal from 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.870
 ears 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.390
 and in itself its head is in shape 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.969
 resembles Freddie 's head therefore 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.840
 some think it's a freddie costume 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.660
 but as you can see, this is not the case besides the costume 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.610
 Bonnie in this room can be seen very 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.160
 interesting poster which sometimes 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.160
 appears on the wall instead of posters 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.589
 slats and depicted on it from the foothills but 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.650
 he has black eyes and one of them 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.260
 glows white by looking at this drawing 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.090
 Immediately there are several questions that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.310
 this poster why it appears 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.130
 instead of Freddie and what's with his eyes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.520
 let us all in order to view it 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.950
 rabbit 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 is a speedball pattern not like it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.420
 was the only yellow rabbit 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 he appears on the wall and covers himself 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.299
 drawing freddie but why exactly freddie 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.439
 I'll tell you a little later but about his eyes 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.270
 I had an option 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.740
 that since he is lit grade 1 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 maybe inside the spring bonny 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.180
 is someone's soul such a charge 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 appeared due to the fact that if we 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 look at the final picture of the game where 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 lie their pasok in which the soul is 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.490
 children we see that they have the same 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.210
 one eye glows with the same 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.329
 parties 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 however friends look further because 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:56.640
 such a poster with a rabbit is not one but two 10 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.250
 video camera you can see a poster with 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.950
 an image of Freddie and he is the same 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.990
 like in another room but on it also 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 a poster may appear with the surf not a 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.960
 the most interesting thing is that it is different from 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.509
 previous poster 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.300
 and here as we see it already glows 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.670
 both voices besides it stands exactly in 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.860
 the same pose as Freddy on the poster I 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 you can still clearly see the reflection 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.010
 poster 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040
 on the floor it says that the poster is not 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:26.920
 is a hallucination and he is obviously something 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.840
 so I have a version of that since 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.290
 a poster with a dressing room appears on top 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.350
 freddie's poster for this hint of stage 01 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.560
 Now I will explain how you know in the game fnaf 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.480
 3 there are six different mini-games and one 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 of them we play golden freddie 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.260
 which appears on stage 01 and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 title scene 01 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.880
 speaks for itself just in this mini 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.239
 the game we see the very scene 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.670
 which was the very first pizzeria and there 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.070
 there were two animatronics first screen 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.100
 fight and 2 golden freddy 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.880
 Pisa immediately visible connection as there were two 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.769
 animatronics and two posters are changing 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.140
 also the poster the surf does not appear on 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.780
 the poster of the USSR 1 and as you can see on the stage 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
 ahead stands in the foothills and behind it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.200
 golden fredy 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.930
 so these scott posters hint at 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.299
 that fnaf4 tells the story of that 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.350
 pizzerias that were spring ponies and 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.290
 young flat 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.739
 course of the game the final fnaf 3 says 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.380
 that all the souls of the children are freed but so 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:31.780
 is it really after all in the picture with 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.820
 not a good ending can be clearly seen five 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.360
 heads of animatronics who glow 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:40.180
 eyes one of the heads izhevsk dark seen 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.860
 only the glow of course on the nose can 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.829
 it's easy to determine what is Freddy's head 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:45.670
 that's just some freddie purple 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:48.190
 or gold 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.820
 because scott specially put this 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.220
 head so that it was not visible however 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.780
 if holly and then in the game we could see 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.680
 head of all animatronics 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:01.680
 bonny check boxing freddie and purple 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.030
 freddie and here's the head golden freddie 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.610
 stuck with the exception of phantom of course 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.470
 but most likely it does not count as 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.870
 it's just the imagination of the main 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.870
 hero while purple Freddie 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.810
 on phantom does not look like and it is possible that 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.790
 the final we see just the head 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.250
 purple freddie well judging by the mini game 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.130
 when baby shower puts on a mask 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.220
 that is, would it be purple fredy 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.800
 dalmask was to be darker but that was not the point 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.650
 and the most basic clue is that 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.980
 the final mini-game we play soul 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.010
 child most likely this soul and gold 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:42.860
 freddie a violet freesia and on this 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.860
 hints a few facts first of all 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.740
 animatronics were in train suits 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.419
 the purple guy sorted them out thereby 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.450
 freeing the souls of children 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:56.479
 but Golden Freddy has a suit too 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.790
 so the whole final would have won the golden 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.340
 Freddie would also be in costume and 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.770
 the purple guy would have him too 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.880
 disassemble the second still in the first 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.000
 story mini-game 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.720
 purple freddy lures the rest 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.270
 animatronics 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.540
 purple guy but have you ever 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.190
 thought about who he is and why he is 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.600
 does 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.790
 perhaps he has long been planning 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.910
 revenge on the violet guy and he like 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:25.310
 once there is such an opportunity therefore 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.690
 he lures animatronics since 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.450
 knows that alone 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.760
 it can not cope as well as the soul of a child 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:34.220
 is in purple freddie's costume 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.950
 the costume is most likely a ghostly 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:39.400
 then he can freely enter the secret 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:42.380
 rooms he naturally all animatronics 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.530
 take him for his therefore and 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:48.110
 follows him and signal less we 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:48.680
 We already play with the child who was in 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.169
 suit 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.900
 purple freddy and since this costume 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.479
 ghostly then he can loose it 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.630
 shoot so in the final he got his revenge 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:02.390
 the purple man has his soul 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.569
 calmed down like the souls of other children and and 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.119
 in 3 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:09.029
 golden freddie not at all see in the game 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:11.789
 except for his phantom a violet 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:14.969
 Freddy is therefore most likely just 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:17.939
 his head you see in the dark so 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:20.159
 the story continues friends perhaps as 

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:22.949
 once the same newspaper that we see 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:25.679
 after 6 nights scott also hints that 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.619
 fnaf 4 will be about the very first pizzeria 

00:06:25.679 --> 00:06:29.189
 because in the newspaper we see a toy 

00:06:28.619 --> 00:06:32.279
 Freddie 

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:34.949
 although there were three of them in Stalin's office 

00:06:32.279 --> 00:06:38.039
 have our 4 tell us everything 

00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.240
 beginnings and we will learn the story of golden freddy 

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:41.399
 screen carnage 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.379
 I hope you liked the release 

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:46.349
 talk about this video with all your 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.719
 friends and acquaintances possible in them and eggs 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.879
 options about this and I have friends 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:53.039
 my many more theories on 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:55.529
 this game and now be sure to put 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.539
