read stuff like that and I don't really

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.570 
read stuff like that and I don't really
care<00:01:04.059> about<00:01:04.350> steering<00:01:05.350> angles<00:01:05.950> and<00:01:06.250> if<00:01:06.400> the

apparently well built

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.810 
apparently well built
is<00:01:29.940> it<00:01:30.420> easy<00:01:30.690> to<00:01:30.810> write<00:01:31.230> not<00:01:31.860> performance<00:01:32.610> wise

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
is it easy to write not performance wise

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.850 
is it easy to write not performance wise
which<00:01:33.090> generally<00:01:33.840> easy<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.230> write<00:01:34.410> stuff<00:01:34.740> like

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
which generally easy to write stuff like

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.190 
which generally easy to write stuff like
that<00:01:34.980> does<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> go<00:01:35.820> well<00:01:36.060> does<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.510> stop<00:01:36.900> well

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
that does it go well does it stop well

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.670 
that does it go well does it stop well
or<00:01:37.560> well<00:01:38.160> enough<00:01:38.580> for<00:01:39.140> me<00:01:40.140> stuff<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.650> that

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
or well enough for me stuff like that

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.980 
or well enough for me stuff like that
and<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.100> actually<00:01:41.280> enjoy<00:01:41.730> doing<00:01:41.760> that<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.720> fun

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and I actually enjoy doing that it's fun

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.430 
and I actually enjoy doing that it's fun
I<00:01:43.230> get<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.800> ride<00:01:43.980> a<00:01:44.010> bike<00:01:44.250> around<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.440> some

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
I get to ride a bike around and some

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.580 
I get to ride a bike around and some
work<00:01:47.510> editing<00:01:48.510> but<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:48.810> still<00:01:49.050> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.350> fun

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
work editing but it's still a lot of fun

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.070 
work editing but it's still a lot of fun
and<00:01:50.330> this<00:01:51.330> is<00:01:51.510> odds<00:01:53.450> there's<00:01:54.450> usually<00:01:54.660> a<00:01:54.900> lot

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
and this is odds there's usually a lot

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.560 
and this is odds there's usually a lot
of<00:01:55.229> traffic<00:01:55.440> here<00:01:55.800> it's<00:01:56.610> almost<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.120> there

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
of traffic here it's almost like there

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.850 
of traffic here it's almost like there
should<00:01:57.720> be<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.900> lot<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.080> cars<00:01:58.350> here<00:02:00.680> there's<00:02:01.680> no

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
should be a lot of cars here there's no

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.720 
should be a lot of cars here there's no
