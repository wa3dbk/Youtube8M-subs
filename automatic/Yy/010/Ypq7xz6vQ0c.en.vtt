00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
all right guys we're doing sight reading

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.070 
all right guys we're doing sight reading
less<00:00:04.230> than<00:00:04.500> 102<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:06.029> we're<00:00:06.839> really

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
less than 102 and we're really

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.089 
less than 102 and we're really
concentrating<00:00:07.560> on<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:09.800> level<00:00:10.800> that<00:00:10.830> is

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
concentrating on that that level that is

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.709 
concentrating on that that level that is
so<00:00:11.400> important<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:11.969> crucial<00:00:12.599> that

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
so important so crucial that

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.900 
so important so crucial that
intermediate<00:00:13.290> level<00:00:13.349> where<00:00:14.340> you<00:00:14.429> really

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
intermediate level where you really

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.450 
intermediate level where you really
learn<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.150> read<00:00:15.740> this<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> level<00:00:17.310> that

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
learn to read this is the level that

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.320 
learn to read this is the level that
many<00:00:18.390> people<00:00:19.100> will<00:00:20.100> self-destruct<00:00:20.730> on

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
many people will self-destruct on

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
many people will self-destruct on
because<00:00:21.600> they<00:00:21.689> don't<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:22.260> learn<00:00:22.410> their

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
because they don't really learn their

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.560 
because they don't really learn their
notes<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> they're<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:23.939> good<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.210> have<00:00:24.359> such

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
notes and they're so good and have such

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.509 
notes and they're so good and have such
a<00:00:24.600> good<00:00:24.810> ear<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.740> they<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.189> by<00:00:26.340> without

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
a good ear that they can get by without

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.009 
a good ear that they can get by without
really<00:00:27.060> reading<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.480> notes<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.840> then<00:00:27.930> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
really reading the notes and then the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
really reading the notes and then the
music<00:00:28.140> starts<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> get<00:00:28.740> harder<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.640> out

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
music starts to get harder and going out

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.630 
music starts to get harder and going out
of<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.060> pet<00:00:30.840> hand<00:00:31.230> positions<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.009> you're

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
of these pet hand positions and you're

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.810 
of these pet hand positions and you're
just<00:00:32.820> lost<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.329> frustrated<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.860> we're<00:00:35.640> really

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
just lost and frustrated so we're really

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.760 
just lost and frustrated so we're really
going<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> hit<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.540> intermediate<00:00:37.170> level<00:00:37.590> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
going to hit this intermediate level a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.880 
going to hit this intermediate level a
long<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:39.000> before<00:00:39.629> we<00:00:39.870> progress<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.530> harder

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
long time before we progress to a harder

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.830 
long time before we progress to a harder
level<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.309> sight<00:00:41.489> reading<00:00:41.730> okay<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.570> if<00:00:42.690> this

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
level of sight reading okay so if this

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.740 
level of sight reading okay so if this
seems<00:00:43.140> four<00:00:44.129> level<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.760> lesson<00:00:45.090> 102<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> be

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
seems four level for lesson 102 to be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740 
seems four level for lesson 102 to be
quite<00:00:46.020> easy<00:00:46.590> or<00:00:47.039> whatever<00:00:47.489> that's<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.570> we

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
hand in the other hand we'll just fall

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.650 
hand in the other hand we'll just fall
into<00:04:40.410> place<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:41.160> you'll<00:04:41.310> really<00:04:41.460> count<00:04:41.970> the
