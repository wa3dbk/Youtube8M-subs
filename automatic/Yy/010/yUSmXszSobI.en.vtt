00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello my name is khan bakum i am 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:07.500
 well-known youtube coach from germany 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.440
 and today I will give you the best diet 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.120
 the world before 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.250
 If I have the best nutrition now 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.949
 want to introduce the best diet in the world 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.590
 then it makes sense from individual 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.869
 different nutritional forms the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.609
 essence to filter out the best 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680
 and we will take care of that 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.660
 for example, just some of the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.849
 to experience current and current 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.969
 nutritional form to eg write here 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 Palais down vegan and right full 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.790
 nutrition according to dge 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.300
 The colors have nothing to do with it 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.680
 so it means no evaluation and 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.480
 instead of me now on the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.760
 Differences of this nutritional form 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.890
 I would like to concentrate where are 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.199
 there maybe similarities 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.160
 yes, where do synergies arise? 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.969
 the cut quantities 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.520
 and what is the essence of everything 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 have the same and I focus on that 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.930
 I've always been a coach because I know 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 if I am strong on the positive 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.890
 focus on all diets 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 instead of the differences in the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.409
 animal quarrels and fruitless 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.509
 Discussions end I concentrate myself 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.400
 on the essence of everything in common 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:24.270
 for example, no or little white 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.020
 sugar or there will be no or few 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 white abstract maile recommended or none 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.979
 and little finished products or a little bit of 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.329
 highly processed industrial oils 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.390
 that is the essence of all these 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.490
 nutritional forms that unites them so 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.790
 Let's concentrate on it 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.670
 instead of more worthless discussions 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.890
 and to squabble 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.240
 I do the same with this essence 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.329
 on the tolerability of 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.090
 food about the motivation for 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.000
 the transformation in life and in the 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.680
 training in my book to lose weight 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.740
 key already meanwhile 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.970
 helped hundreds of people 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.729
 permanently around 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.040
 decrease in the long run you can do that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.220
 buy breath connections now as well if you 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.370

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.470
 and otherwise we will see each other on the beach 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.230
 that was your kolja balcony and now 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.660
 Do you know that the best diet in the world? 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.730
 An individual diet is the one out 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.020
 different nutritional forms that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.020
