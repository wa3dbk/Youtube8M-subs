confirmed<00:00:56.590> but<00:00:57.460> this<00:00:57.609> video<00:00:57.879> I<00:00:57.940> go<00:00:58.180> 72<00:00:58.960> 29<00:00:59.500> so<00:00:59.800> a

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
confirmed but this video I go 72 29 so a

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.069 
confirmed but this video I go 72 29 so a
pretty<00:01:00.070> beastly<00:01:00.489> gameplay<00:01:01.059> probably<00:01:01.930> would

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
pretty beastly gameplay probably would

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.569 
pretty beastly gameplay probably would
have<00:01:02.170> had<00:01:02.350> the<00:01:02.500> hundred-plus<00:01:02.890> gameplay<00:01:03.430> if

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
have had the hundred-plus gameplay if

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.150 
have had the hundred-plus gameplay if
the<00:01:03.699> game<00:01:03.910> didn't<00:01:04.239> end<00:01:04.420> so<00:01:04.540> fast<00:01:05.290> because<00:01:05.950> the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
the game didn't end so fast because the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.920 
the game didn't end so fast because the
time<00:01:06.460> limit<00:01:06.760> didn't<00:01:07.030> run<00:01:07.120> out<00:01:07.300> we<00:01:07.510> just<00:01:07.540> kind

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:07.870 
this game the first one lasted a long

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.359 
this game the first one lasted a long
time<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.319> first<00:02:08.440> one<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.709> got<00:02:08.830> a<00:02:08.860> lot<00:02:09.039> of<00:02:09.069> kills

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
time the first one I got a lot of kills

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.400 
time the first one I got a lot of kills
with<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.729> it<00:02:10.030> was<00:02:10.149> a<00:02:10.179> very<00:02:10.450> good<00:02:10.810> score<00:02:11.110> streak

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
with it it was a very good score streak

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.590 
with it it was a very good score streak
but<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.770> second<00:02:12.160> one<00:02:12.370> ended<00:02:13.240> up<00:02:13.360> getting<00:02:13.570> shot

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
but the second one ended up getting shot

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.330 
but the second one ended up getting shot
down<00:02:13.990> like<00:02:14.050> right<00:02:14.440> away<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.950> believe<00:02:15.190> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
down like right away and I believe I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.600 
down like right away and I believe I
only

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
only

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.090 
only
at<00:02:15.640> about<00:02:15.940> two<00:02:16.270> kills<00:02:16.540> with<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.900> maybe<00:02:17.860> three

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
at about two kills with it maybe three

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:20.190 
at about two kills with it maybe three
two<00:02:18.430> or<00:02:18.550> three<00:02:18.760> kills<00:02:19.000> with<00:02:19.180> it<00:02:19.360> also<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.020> was

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
two or three kills with it also I was

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.840 
two or three kills with it also I was
really<00:02:20.470> bummed<00:02:20.650> out<00:02:20.830> about<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.310> know<00:02:21.460> dogs

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
really bummed out about that I know dogs

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.910 
really bummed out about that I know dogs
that<00:02:22.060> have<00:02:22.210> got<00:02:22.390> me<00:02:22.570> more<00:02:22.720> kills<00:02:23.080> at<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> point

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that have got me more kills at a point

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.680 
that have got me more kills at a point
like<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.220> but<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:24.820> know<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.270> goes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
like that but you know it goes

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.480 
like that but you know it goes
hand-in-hand<00:02:26.050> they're<00:02:26.350> both<00:02:26.530> great<00:02:26.770> score

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
hand-in-hand they're both great score

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.760 
hand-in-hand they're both great score
streaks<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.000> each<00:02:28.600> one<00:02:28.840> has<00:02:28.870> its<00:02:29.080> moments<00:02:29.440> in

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
streaks and each one has its moments in

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.770 
streaks and each one has its moments in
time<00:02:29.800> because<00:02:30.280> sometimes<00:02:30.760> your<00:02:31.240> dogs<00:02:31.510> can

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
time because sometimes your dogs can

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.240 
time because sometimes your dogs can
only<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.110> four<00:02:32.380> or<00:02:32.530> five<00:02:32.680> kills<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.130> that's

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
only get four or five kills and that's

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.460 
only get four or five kills and that's
definitely<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.820> letdown<00:02:34.320> especially<00:02:35.320> when<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
definitely a letdown especially when you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.020 
definitely a letdown especially when you
think<00:02:35.680> another<00:02:35.920> score<00:02:36.250> streak<00:02:36.490> would<00:02:36.640> do<00:02:36.820> you

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
think another score streak would do you

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.420 
think another score streak would do you
much<00:02:37.660> better<00:02:37.990> but<00:02:38.590> anyways<00:02:38.950> back<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.220> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
much better but anyways back to the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.730 
much better but anyways back to the
camel<00:02:39.850> back<00:02:40.000> to<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.210> sideboard<00:02:40.720> camo<00:02:41.140> this
