retouching<00:00:17.779> it's<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:19.140> not<00:00:19.350> that

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
retouching it's really not that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.429 
retouching it's really not that
complicated<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.400> way<00:00:20.520> I<00:00:20.550> approach<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.439> most

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
complicated the way I approach it most

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.730 
complicated the way I approach it most
of<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.830> using<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.699> clone<00:00:24.060> stamp<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.960> it's

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
of it is using the clone stamp and it's

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.660 
of it is using the clone stamp and it's
just<00:00:25.980> kind<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.699> going<00:00:27.000> slowly<00:00:27.599> and<00:00:27.930> taken<00:00:28.890> one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
just kind of going slowly and taken one

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.089 
just kind of going slowly and taken one
step<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.000> time<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.869> message<00:00:31.560> there<00:00:31.769> don't

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
step at a time and a message there don't

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.470

herself I think some of the other shots
she<00:01:14.189> was<00:01:14.340> she<00:01:15.299> had<00:01:15.420> our<00:01:15.509> nails<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.930> her<00:01:16.020> face<00:01:16.350> or

she was she had our nails in her face or
something<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.130> um<00:01:17.479> anyway<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> yeah

something like that um anyway so yeah

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.580 
something like that um anyway so yeah
it's<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:22.490> pretty<00:01:23.490> basic<00:01:24.170> it's<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.439> lot

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
it's really pretty basic it's just a lot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's really pretty basic it's just a lot
of<00:01:25.710> time<00:01:26.630> and<00:01:27.860> I'm<00:01:28.860> sure<00:01:29.070> there's<00:01:29.280> probably<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of time and I'm sure there's probably a

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.600 
of time and I'm sure there's probably a
fast<00:01:30.570> way<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:31.110> this<00:01:31.259> but<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> choose

fast way to do this but I kind of choose

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.020 
fast way to do this but I kind of choose
to<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.200> pathway<00:01:34.590> because<00:01:35.400> one

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to not do with the pathway because one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
to not do with the pathway because one
of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> things<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.720> feel<00:01:37.110> pretty

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
of the things that I feel pretty

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740 
of the things that I feel pretty
passionate<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:38.970> keep<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.420> skin

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
eyelash work to do I could go on for

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.539 
eyelash work to do I could go on for
even<00:03:11.629> longer<00:03:11.840> than<00:03:12.079> i<00:03:12.349> did<00:03:12.410> in<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.829> shot<00:03:13.310> and

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
even longer than i did in the shot and

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.809 
even longer than i did in the shot and
get<00:03:13.760> really<00:03:14.120> really<00:03:14.450> crazy<00:03:15.129> like<00:03:16.129> perfect<00:03:16.609> and

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819

get really really crazy like perfect and
stuff<00:03:17.090> but<00:03:17.389> i<00:03:17.829> think<00:03:18.829> this<00:03:19.010> far<00:03:19.910> as<00:03:20.060> i<00:03:20.209> remember

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
stuff but i think this far as i remember

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.259 
stuff but i think this far as i remember
this<00:03:20.840> took<00:03:21.109> about<00:03:21.290> three<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.579> half<00:03:22.609> hours

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
this took about three and a half hours

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.580 
this took about three and a half hours
something<00:03:23.599> like<00:03:23.690> that<00:03:24.400> um<00:03:25.720> what<00:03:26.720> also<00:03:27.230> helps

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
something like that um what also helps

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.259 
something like that um what also helps
is<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.829> listen<00:03:28.639> to<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> really<00:03:29.480> good<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:32.120> really

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
is to listen to a really good to really

is to listen to a really good to really
good<00:03:32.450> music<00:03:32.720> so<00:03:32.930> i<00:03:33.109> was<00:03:33.470> listening<00:03:33.829> to<00:03:33.950> pandora

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
the air radio air raid air the air

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.110 
the air radio air raid air the air
station<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.620> the<00:03:46.220> other<00:03:46.370> thing<00:03:46.430> that<00:03:46.639> I<00:03:46.790> do<00:03:46.910> is

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
station so the other thing that I do is

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.830 
station so the other thing that I do is
it<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.680> happened<00:03:49.190> like<00:03:49.280> 30<00:03:50.269> seconds<00:03:50.660> ago

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
it just happened like 30 seconds ago

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.000 
it just happened like 30 seconds ago
while<00:03:51.109> I<00:03:51.139> was<00:03:51.169> trying<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.530> figure<00:03:51.650> out<00:03:51.799> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
while I was trying to figure out the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.009 
while I was trying to figure out the
name<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.400> air<00:03:52.549> is<00:03:53.829> so<00:03:54.829> when<00:03:54.980> I<00:03:55.010> start<00:03:55.400> off<00:03:55.609> I

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
name for air is so when I start off I

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.080 
name for air is so when I start off I
the<00:03:57.019> clone<00:03:57.260> stamp<00:03:57.310> stamp<00:03:58.310> is<00:03:58.609> at<00:03:58.819> one-hundred

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
the clone stamp stamp is at one-hundred

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.960 
the clone stamp stamp is at one-hundred
percent<00:03:59.419> opacity<00:03:59.870> so<00:04:00.590> I<00:04:00.620> eliminate<00:04:01.010> all<00:04:01.549> the

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
percent opacity so I eliminate all the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.420 
percent opacity so I eliminate all the
blemishes<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.690> then<00:04:03.410> I<00:04:03.680> decrease<00:04:04.250> the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
blemishes and then I decrease the

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.059 
blemishes and then I decrease the
opacity<00:04:04.549> to<00:04:05.419> right<00:04:05.720> now<00:04:05.870> we're<00:04:05.930> at<00:04:06.109> thirty

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
opacity to right now we're at thirty

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.319 
opacity to right now we're at thirty
percent<00:04:08.030> I<00:04:08.269> think<00:04:08.510> so<00:04:09.609> I'm<00:04:10.609> not<00:04:10.910> completely

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
percent I think so I'm not completely

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.839 
percent I think so I'm not completely
eliminating<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.139> using<00:04:12.620> just<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:13.639> like<00:04:13.819> a

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
eliminating and using just it's like a

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.770 
eliminating and using just it's like a
light<00:04:14.120> brush<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:15.290> here<00:04:15.889> I<00:04:16.419> wanted<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.539> extend

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
light brush so here I wanted to extend

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.599 
light brush so here I wanted to extend
the<00:04:17.989> photo<00:04:18.229> farther<00:04:18.859> to<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.099> left<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.519> I'm

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
the photo farther to the left so I'm

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.180 
the photo farther to the left so I'm
adding<00:04:19.820> a<00:04:20.060> bit<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.389> her<00:04:21.320> shoulder<00:04:21.769> because<00:04:22.039> I

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
adding a bit of her shoulder because I

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.150 
adding a bit of her shoulder because I
dropped<00:04:22.550> her<00:04:22.700> shoulder<00:04:23.120> out

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
dropped her shoulder out

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.370 
dropped her shoulder out
so<00:04:24.670> I'm<00:04:24.730> using<00:04:24.910> another<00:04:25.210> photo<00:04:25.570> that<00:04:25.900> shows

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
so I'm using another photo that shows

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.580 
so I'm using another photo that shows
her<00:04:26.620> shoulder<00:04:26.950> in<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.100> similar<00:04:27.520> angle<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.750> then

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
her shoulder in a similar angle and then

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.800 
her shoulder in a similar angle and then
just<00:04:30.310> suggests<00:04:31.030> a<00:04:31.090> little<00:04:31.330> bit<00:04:31.480> here<00:04:31.720> and

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
just suggests a little bit here and
