00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.520
 How are we doing back this time with 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.420
 a boxing one always gets a little bit of 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.010
 a game as you can see is halo 4 and 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.400
 I was able to make some strange movements there 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.650
 to be able to get it before the day of 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.169
 today is November 3 and you can see 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.070
 then November the game opens 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:30.110
 the 6th day 6 day Tuesday today is 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.989
 Saturday at the time I'm recording 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.720
 this yes a little complicated to get them 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.780
 but finally I did it is not original 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.949
 can you see it's failed I'm going to say 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.980
 why are we going to see what has 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.199
 in simply to show them 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.460
 the content if at any time 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:52.670
 plan you can buy a non- version 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.589
 this game leave it to me this game is 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.120
 quite quite expected since from 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:01.699
 that I saw the trailer on 3 of 2011 was 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.220
 it was epic since the saga halo I like 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.450
 a lot of fact you can see there good ones 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.549
 are subscribed can see what 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.770
 you can buy an xbox nothing more for the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
 made of hello was not for some other 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.430
 thing simply because it 's waiting 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.520
 a lot of this game I bought it in April already 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 He arrived already November and good 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.470
 basically that's my reason the xbox 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.570
 let's open it 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.570
 let's break 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.420
 from the box 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.490
 of course everything is correctly fine 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 it does not matter we're going to remove the plastic 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.479
 this game was announced on the e3 of 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:05.259
 2011 and in the live action live demo of 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.640
 game in e3 of 2012 and they left us 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.610
 more sanctified and if indeed 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.610
 I broke this that has to break us but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.610
 good 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.190
 has two discs is the disc two can 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.950
 see him 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.690
 abroad four discs two 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.690
 in the 4 disc 1 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.480
 I guess writing in the game no 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.050
 make legal copies of this record and 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.520
 you know can not piracy raise that 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.300
 cover to see important information 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:42.550
 the security game 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.740
 He rises and do not know something good has 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.210
 something quite interesting is that it has 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:51.910
 a 14 day trial of xbox live gold 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:55.480
 have I suppose that a code that back 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.240
 if here behind has a code for 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.160
 have the free xbox live test 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.830
 so they can play multiplayer the 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 campaign I do not know and from there they fall in love and 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.270
 they keep playing all this in the end because that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 it's all we went after the part of 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.840
 back what I appreciate in the code 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.090
 obviously 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.410
 here has a display m 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.140
 once 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:23.100
 electrical and photosensitive warning 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.960
 guarantee of evolutions in 90 days 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.010
 etcetera etcetera says to lift the 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.200
 cover but 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.970
 I do not know how to stand up honestly do not 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.590
 I want to try and what 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.819
 it was quite difficult to get it 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.900
 so I do not want to spoil everything 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.060
 there things have the disc and there 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.300
 I am 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.650
 and good basically because that 's all today 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.380
 It's November 3 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.700
 I can not play it unfortunately or 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.920
 maybe you saw me play it but 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.440
 disconnected from xbox live since if you 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.840
 you connect the cult live they make you a pan 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.300
 of the console and your account then 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.860
 that's the only bad thing 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.230
 hear and I'm cox walking follow me on 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.930
 twitter like the video if you liked it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.930
