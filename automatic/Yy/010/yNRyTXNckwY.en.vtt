00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
a lot of people disagree with that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.969 
a lot of people disagree with that
that's<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.930> my<00:01:49.020> personal<00:01:49.439> preference<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that's just my personal preference you

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.910 
that's just my personal preference you
know<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.509> personally<00:01:51.509> enjoy<00:01:51.930> watching<00:01:52.560> monta

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
know I I personally enjoy watching monta

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.190 
know I I personally enjoy watching monta
play<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.970> personally<00:01:54.509> think<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.840> highly

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
play and I personally think that highly

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.260 
play and I personally think that highly
of<00:01:55.409> him<00:01:55.649> now<00:01:56.280> I'm<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.430> saying<00:01:56.579> he's<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> best

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
of him now I'm not saying he's the best

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.109 
of him now I'm not saying he's the best
defender<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.729> shooting<00:01:59.729> guard<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.090> he's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
defender as a shooting guard but he's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.719 
defender as a shooting guard but he's
the<00:02:00.360> second<00:02:00.780> best<00:02:00.810> scoring<00:02:01.799> shooting<00:02:02.369> guard<00:02:02.549> I

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the second best scoring shooting guard I

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.130 
the second best scoring shooting guard I
don't<00:02:02.909> think<00:02:02.969> James<00:02:03.329> Harden's<00:02:03.719> better<00:02:03.930> than

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
don't think James Harden's better than

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.899 
don't think James Harden's better than
Monta<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.649> don't<00:02:04.829> think<00:02:05.040> Dwyane<00:02:05.280> Wade's<00:02:05.579> better

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
Monta I don't think Dwyane Wade's better

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.670 
Monta I don't think Dwyane Wade's better
than<00:02:06.119> Monta<00:02:06.540> either<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.500> have<00:02:07.649> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
than Monta either they just have a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.090 
than Monta either they just have a
better<00:02:07.950> team

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
better team

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.700 
better team
and<00:02:09.190> more<00:02:09.820> championships<00:02:10.570> basically<00:02:11.170> so

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
and more championships basically so

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.470 
and more championships basically so
that's<00:02:11.950> that's<00:02:12.160> pretty<00:02:12.340> debatable<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.300> guys

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
that's that's pretty debatable you guys

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.480 
that's that's pretty debatable you guys
leave<00:02:14.080> your<00:02:14.260> opinions<00:02:14.620> in<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.740> comments<00:02:15.310> who

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
leave your opinions in the comments who

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.270 
leave your opinions in the comments who
you<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:17.020> top<00:02:17.290> three<00:02:17.650> shooting

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you think is the top three shooting

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.910 
you think is the top three shooting
guards<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.670> league<00:02:18.880> today<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:20.620> that's

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
guards in the league today that that's

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.470 
guards in the league today that that's
just<00:02:21.010> my<00:02:21.160> assumption<00:02:21.610> basing<00:02:22.060> off<00:02:22.180> last

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
just my assumption basing off last

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.870 
just my assumption basing off last
season<00:02:22.990> I<00:02:23.170> personally<00:02:23.950> think<00:02:24.100> kobes<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.550> best

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
season I personally think kobes the best

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.750 
season I personally think kobes the best
shooting<00:02:25.120> guard<00:02:25.420> Ben<00:02:25.780> Monta<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.530> then<00:02:27.130> maybe

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
shooting guard Ben Monta and then maybe

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.580 
shooting guard Ben Monta and then maybe
James<00:02:28.120> Harden<00:02:28.510> or<00:02:28.630> Paul<00:02:28.840> George<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:29.410> Paul

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
James Harden or Paul George but Paul

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.530 
James Harden or Paul George but Paul
George<00:02:29.890> isn't<00:02:30.700> really<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.090> shooting<00:02:31.420> guard

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
George isn't really a shooting guard

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.830 
George isn't really a shooting guard
anymore<00:02:31.810> so<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.320> guess<00:02:33.300> Paul<00:02:34.300> George<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.690> like

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
anymore so I guess Paul George is like

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.270 
anymore so I guess Paul George is like
the<00:02:34.960> second<00:02:35.320> best<00:02:35.440> small<00:02:35.680> forward<00:02:35.740> in<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the second best small forward in the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.700 
the second best small forward in the
leak<00:02:36.460> but<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:37.510> again<00:02:37.630> that's<00:02:38.140> also

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
leak but then again that's also

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.500 
leak but then again that's also
debatable<00:02:39.250> because<00:02:39.370> I'm<00:02:39.610> saying<00:02:39.910> Paul<00:02:40.240> George

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
debatable because I'm saying Paul George

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.390 
debatable because I'm saying Paul George
is<00:02:40.690> better<00:02:40.900> than<00:02:41.050> Kevin<00:02:41.230> Durant<00:02:41.620> which<00:02:41.860> he<00:02:42.250> is

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
is better than Kevin Durant which he is

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.540 
is better than Kevin Durant which he is
this<00:02:43.060> year<00:02:43.270> at<00:02:43.420> least<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:44.590> I'm<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.430> gonna

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
is this is probably the prime example I

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.690 
is this is probably the prime example I
haven't<00:03:59.800> really<00:03:59.980> talked<00:04:00.190> about<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.490> gameplay

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.650 
I'm not going to talk about the gameplay
other<00:04:03.010> than<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.310> fact<00:04:03.490> that<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:04.330> was<00:04:04.420> another

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
other than the fact that it was another

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.420 
other than the fact that it was another
difficult<00:04:05.110> game<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.320> play<00:04:05.620> considering<00:04:06.370> it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
difficult game to play considering it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.100 
difficult game to play considering it
was<00:04:06.520> on<00:04:06.610> superstar<00:04:07.090> difficulty<00:04:07.570> and<00:04:07.720> I<00:04:07.780> suck

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
was on superstar difficulty and I suck

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.950 
was on superstar difficulty and I suck
at<00:04:08.260> playing<00:04:08.440> superstar<00:04:08.980> difficulty<00:04:09.490> so

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
at playing superstar difficulty so

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.270 
at playing superstar difficulty so
hopefully<00:04:10.960> I<00:04:10.990> win<00:04:11.230> a<00:04:11.260> few<00:04:11.440> games<00:04:11.500> in<00:04:12.160> the

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280
