00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.230 
the latte I'm gonna add two tablespoons
of<00:01:26.439> caramel<00:01:26.649> syrup<00:01:27.039> now<00:01:27.520> this<00:01:27.670> all<00:01:27.820> just<00:01:27.850> helps

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
of caramel syrup now this all just helps

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.310 
of caramel syrup now this all just helps
maintain<00:01:28.420> tender<00:01:29.380> it<00:01:29.939> enhances<00:01:30.939> the<00:01:31.149> flavor

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
maintain tender it enhances the flavor

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.630 
maintain tender it enhances the flavor

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
because when we have caramel that's

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.899 
because when we have caramel that's
cloyingly<00:01:34.359> sweet<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:35.740> we<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.159> you<00:01:36.789> know

cloyingly sweet then we have you know
the<00:01:37.030> salt<00:01:37.359> kind<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.749> counterbalance<00:01:38.079> is<00:01:38.560> that

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the salt kind of counterbalance is that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.800 
the salt kind of counterbalance is that
flavor<00:01:40.679> on<00:01:41.679> our<00:01:41.920> palate<00:01:42.460> yes<00:01:42.939> surface<00:01:43.359> so<00:01:43.539> good
