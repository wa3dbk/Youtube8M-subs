00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.990
 hello today we are going to draw the fear of the 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.490
 intensely movie 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.349
 it's very easy , that's what I say 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.869
 Well the first thing to do is like a 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:20.869
 cone that is the bottom of your mouth 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.780
 something like that see here we make a line 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.180
 that his smile 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.220
 we close is like a diamond 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.320
 and here we are going to take out his nose 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:40.430
 like squid like 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.559
 and you have to go trapping this area we're going to 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.170
 do the eye is like almost almost a 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.480
 circle but is half 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.940
 Chaton 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.329
 and from here in between we also take out the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.749
 other 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.949
 those circles and also chatito because 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:01.579
 from here he will make the complete one 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.789
 complete part of the circle here equal 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.789
 some moons 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.260
 as the eye is very small we are going to 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.540
 use with the finest brush 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.420
 because here is how we do here as a 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.810
 crushed oval 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.180
 and a little dot 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.790
 and the other one is almost a ball because 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:28.060
 you are in perspective and a little dot 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:32.720
 black with the colors is because it is 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.530
 looking around here is the perspective 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:40.090
 here flying we make an arc and a half 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.420
 disheveled like that an eyebrow 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 here goes to the other arch and take off 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.370
 it is removed 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.630
 then and we closed the diamond here 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.630
 at the height of the smile 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 then here we have a little ball 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.770
 and as a triangle 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 the little table and the monkey 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:13.860
 and here we put some lines here 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:16.680
 and we close it and here's his shirt 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.430
 here under the bow we are going to lower a 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.740
 little arm 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.160
 it's like that and then it goes up like once 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.320
 and here we round up and make a 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.430
 same line parallel plates 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.400
 spaghetti and we open it a little here 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.690
 let's do as one more triangle 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.890
 very flat width one point another point is 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.870
 bringing a shirt as 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.700
 cufflinks 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.800
 and it's a good thing to do well 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:54.600
 a curve and a half straight 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.260
 we made the liter 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:04.599
 another and then another and we close 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.599
 because we're going to put a stick 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.960
 continues to twist that as a kind of 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:20.060
 picture 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:23.890
 Curved like this is a chocolate that brings 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.260
 let's know the piece of stick that follows 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.090
 and down here 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.220
 of the bun and we have a line 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.620
 and here we continue making a bit 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.640
 than those of your shoulder and we're going to do 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:43.530
 like a line like that gets into bread 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.480
 zone really and that one that does not pump 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.470
 and here too but vice versa mt isa 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.590
 give pump 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.430
 and that we make a line 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.760
 closes 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.200
 and that their belts a band nothing of 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.550
 that 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.190
 and bone in his pants 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.710
 and his pants make a bomb that goes 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.590
 out and then drag 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:14.240
 and that a bomb 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:18.910
 that gets hooked and stays that way 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:23.300
 as here to do as well as a curvita 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:26.060
 going down the rectum and we put 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.540
 and then here we bring in the 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:34.890
 line up and that the closed 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:37.020
 down here your shoes come out is a 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:38.580
 line that goes up is not very 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.490
 thick the brush we will leave as 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.490
 the sole we made a line like that 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.550
 the shoes 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.680
 list 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.190
 and here is the other part of the 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:58.390
 shoe that is going to stay here here 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:01.420
 shadow then I do not know I do not know there is no 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:04.350
 almost nothing and here we are going to download a line 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.350
 what is the Valencian 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.930
 and we have to do the rest of the 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:14.139
 shoes a curvita we know the sole 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.500
 very simple and simplified in the stripe 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:18.930
 closing 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.850
 and well the other arm comes out of here 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.120
 same without anything else we make a triangle 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.460
 that closes and teams down we take out the 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.490
 I want here 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.210
 a line 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.960
 and in this hand, here we have a 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.539
 wand here another other 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.180
 and I've been trying only with the two 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.449
 hands 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.490
 and here not here the head comes out 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:50.150
 a few dots and then with him the same 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.330
 to the little one 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.690
 and it comes out in the middle but from behind 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:59.030
 that this does not come out of the middle 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.410
 back and a few dots doing like a 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.810
 snail 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.840
 and disheveled this is not how 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.840
 works 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.130
 and who knows what that will be 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:19.699
 hair or flower hair intention so the 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.229
 houndstooth which is the illustration of 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:25.479
 here we are going to do so nothing else very 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.479
 simple is not going to look like 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.650
 this figure 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.510
 we inhale we are going to simulate nothing else 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:48.910
 with the brush or I leave with a hairline 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:52.229
 of the improvement of its base in the pants 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.229
 that I like that 

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.459
 and there we are afraid
