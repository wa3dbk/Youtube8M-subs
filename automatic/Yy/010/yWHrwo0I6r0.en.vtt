00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
with civ 5 with the brazil game I

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.679 
with civ 5 with the brazil game I

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:43.689 
certainly felt a little bit burnt out

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.290 
certainly felt a little bit burnt out
then<00:04:44.110> I<00:04:44.139> took<00:04:44.259> some<00:04:44.530> time<00:04:44.800> away<00:04:45.099> from<00:04:45.460> the

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
then I took some time away from the

then I took some time away from the
actual<00:04:46.599> recording<00:04:47.169> played<00:04:47.500> some<00:04:47.740> games<00:04:47.919> of

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
civ 5 on my own it gave me a chance

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.170 
civ 5 on my own it gave me a chance
especially<00:04:50.620> with<00:04:50.710> both<00:04:51.310> gods<00:04:51.699> and<00:04:51.909> kings<00:04:52.060> in

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180

especially with both gods and kings in
brave<00:04:52.360> new<00:04:52.419> world<00:04:52.719> I<00:04:52.810> never<00:04:52.840> end<00:04:53.169> up<00:04:53.259> playing<00:04:53.560> a

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
brave new world I never end up playing a

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.619 
brave new world I never end up playing a
whole<00:04:53.860> lot<00:04:54.069> of<00:04:54.189> those<00:04:54.310> so<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.090> was<00:04:55.240> able<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.419> sort

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
whole lot of those so I was able to sort

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.749 
whole lot of those so I was able to sort
of<00:04:55.689> sit<00:04:55.870> down<00:04:56.020> and<00:04:56.439> really<00:04:57.099> read<00:04:57.460> through

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 
of sit down and really read through

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.580 
of sit down and really read through
everything<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.270> start<00:04:58.449> to<00:04:58.599> understand<00:04:59.020> more

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
everything and start to understand more

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.020 
everything and start to understand more
of<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.800> mechanics<00:05:00.250> properly<00:05:00.669> and<00:05:00.759> then<00:05:00.789> when

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
of the mechanics properly and then when

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.909 
of the mechanics properly and then when
it<00:05:01.120> came<00:05:01.270> back<00:05:01.419> for<00:05:01.629> France<00:05:01.900> even<00:05:02.770> though<00:05:02.889> I

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
it came back for France even though I

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.110 
it came back for France even though I
still<00:05:03.159> made<00:05:03.310> pill<00:05:03.460> any<00:05:03.610> mistakes<00:05:03.909> and<00:05:04.090> I

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
still made pill any mistakes and I

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.430 
still made pill any mistakes and I
dropped<00:05:04.360> down<00:05:04.449> a<00:05:04.509> difficulty<00:05:04.960> level<00:05:05.199> i<00:05:05.259> still

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
dropped down a difficulty level i still

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.260 
dropped down a difficulty level i still
felt<00:05:05.590> just<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.280> just<00:05:06.310> had<00:05:06.580> a<00:05:06.639> lot<00:05:06.759> more<00:05:06.879> fun<00:05:07.060> so

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
felt just I just had a lot more fun so

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.640 
felt just I just had a lot more fun so
now<00:05:07.360> I've<00:05:07.479> been<00:05:07.569> back<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.050> playing<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.379> Emperor

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
now I've been back to playing on Emperor

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.600 
now I've been back to playing on Emperor
level<00:05:08.919> and<00:05:09.039> feeling<00:05:09.280> pretty<00:05:09.370> good<00:05:09.550> about

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
level and feeling pretty good about

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.089 
level and feeling pretty good about
myself<00:05:09.879> so<00:05:10.240> we'll<00:05:10.780> probably<00:05:11.379> have<00:05:11.889> another

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
myself so we'll probably have another

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.529 
myself so we'll probably have another
civ<00:05:12.340> 5<00:05:12.520> game<00:05:12.729> coming<00:05:13.030> up<00:05:13.060> in<00:05:13.150> the<00:05:13.210> future<00:05:13.449> I'm

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
civ 5 game coming up in the future I'm

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:14.939 
civ 5 game coming up in the future I'm
going<00:05:13.659> to<00:05:13.719> be<00:05:13.810> playing<00:05:13.930> probably<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.710> more

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949 
going to be playing probably a more

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.770 
going to be playing probably a more
militaristic<00:05:15.400> one<00:05:15.759> because<00:05:16.599> we've<00:05:16.750> been

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
militaristic one because we've been

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.540 
militaristic one because we've been
doing<00:05:17.020> like<00:05:17.169> Bill<00:05:17.409> sciency<00:05:18.099> things<00:05:18.129> and

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
doing like Bill sciency things and

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.709 
doing like Bill sciency things and
culture<00:05:18.849> things<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.270> whatever<00:05:19.479> we're<00:05:19.629> going

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:19.719 
culture things and whatever we're going

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.659 
culture things and whatever we're going
back<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:19.960> war<00:05:20.229> think<00:05:20.650> I'm<00:05:20.740> i<00:05:20.830> play<00:05:21.009> Montezuma<00:05:21.550> I

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
back to war think I'm i play Montezuma I

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.119 
back to war think I'm i play Montezuma I
like<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:21.969> early<00:05:22.750> game<00:05:22.960> culture<00:05:23.500> bonus<00:05:24.009> thing

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
like the early game culture bonus thing

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.350 
like the early game culture bonus thing
might<00:05:24.340> be<00:05:24.460> a<00:05:24.490> lot<00:05:24.610> of<00:05:24.669> fun<00:05:24.759> to<00:05:24.940> do<00:05:25.029> that<00:05:25.180> way<00:05:25.500> and

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
might be a lot of fun to do that way and

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.390 
might be a lot of fun to do that way and
what<00:05:28.360> else<00:05:28.509> probably<00:05:29.139> some<00:05:29.650> more<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.099> for

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
what else probably some more you for

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.219 
what else probably some more you for
related<00:05:31.060> content<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.599> don't<00:05:31.990> think<00:05:32.020> there's

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
related content I don't think there's

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.830 
related content I don't think there's
going<00:05:32.319> to<00:05:32.409> be<00:05:32.469> an<00:05:32.560> EU<00:05:32.770> for<00:05:33.069> let's<00:05:33.400> play<00:05:33.840> right

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:36.219 
now because I'm mostly waiting for

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:37.980 
now because I'm mostly waiting for

might be some of those like mini like
two<00:05:40.029> or<00:05:40.180> three<00:05:40.210> episodes<00:05:40.870> here<00:05:41.199> how<00:05:41.349> you<00:05:41.409> would

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
two or three episodes here how you would

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.200 
two or three episodes here how you would
potentially<00:05:42.069> start<00:05:42.520> this<00:05:42.699> nation<00:05:43.060> or

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
potentially start this nation or

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.640 
potentially start this nation or
something<00:05:43.449> like<00:05:43.750> that<00:05:43.810> we'll<00:05:44.379> see<00:05:44.500> how<00:05:44.620> it

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
something like that we'll see how it

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.279 
something like that we'll see how it
goes<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.159> yeah<00:05:45.969> random<00:05:46.389> other<00:05:46.539> content<00:05:47.050> that
