00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello how good is that in the video 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.709
 today what we are going to learn to do 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.050
 to be these bracelets look are 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:18.200
 combined what are accounts with 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.060
 wire you see what a beautiful thing and if 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.130
 you are interested and you like to stay to see the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.720
 video is worth the materials that we are going to 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.000
 need to be aluminum wire 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.710
 of 1.5 millimeters two types of balls 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.779
 as you can see here some ovals and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.870
 other round silicone thread or 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.210
 thin elastic a piece of finite wire 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.890
 or a needle in our tools 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.949
 Scissors rules and optional glue 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.949
 instant 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.740
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.440
 a few pieces of wire about 13 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.990
 centimeters each with the first one that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 cortemos can serve as a guide for 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.830
 cut the others I needed six in 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830
 total 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.660
 now let's take and in one of the 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.610
 we're going to make a spiral 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.560
 we started with the counting tool 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.070
 rounded and we continue with the fingers 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 to scratch the wire as little as possible 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.360
 and we must make the spiral until 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.800
 we get more or less in half now 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.210
 we will do the same 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.510
 on the other end but to the side 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.040
 otherwise we start with the tool 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.040
 and we continue with the fingers 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.020
 and when we get more or less to the 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.130
 half of us will have to have one 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.980
 piece so similar to one that and this what 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.050
 we will do with the wreckage of wire 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.090
 now we will take one of the pieces and a 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.870
 of the oval balls 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.150
 we will put it like this 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.980
 we put the spiral and throw towards 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.140
 up and place the other spiral in the 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.140
 another part of the ball and we will do 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.670
 match the little hole in the ball with the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.500
 spiral hole 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.810
 does not have to match by both 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.530
 parts of the ball for out there can 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.490
 then put in our silicone thread 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.290
 and this I have done with all the waves 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.069
 now let's form a little needle with the 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.630
 finite wire 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.170
 Well, we have the silicone ones 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.030
 so that we do not get loose 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.130
 and we crush the wire well 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.230
 so that we stay as fine as possible and 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.520
 we enter through the holes that have 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.520
 our little balls 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.170
 and once we have our little needle 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.390
 made today we will be introducing our 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.950
 balls and sandwiching one with wire and 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.959
 one without wire 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.530
 to be already forming what our 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.530
 bracelet 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.190
 exposing one of each class leaving 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.190
 intercalated 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.090
 and the truth is that it is very very pretty 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.900
 once we have done this because 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.670
 we can cut the needle and we do 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.670
 to our silicone ear 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.620
 a couple of knickers to make it look good 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.620
 strong 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.960
 and we can put a drop of 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.960
 glue 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.910
 it has dried we pulled the thread of 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.060
 silicone and we hide the knot inside 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.430
 one of the balls 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:31.080
 and our bracelet is finished 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.610
 look at what prettier thing more beautiful and more 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.020
 Elegant 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.020
 It is an authentic beauty 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.480
 well you know that every time I 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.040
 can I bring different options for 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.930
 that you can compare and so you can 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.180
 Take ideas and here some bracelets 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.310
 they are for my heart for my sister is 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.110
 for example is exactly the same is the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.730
 only that it is made with the one of the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.120
 tics or banesto only elastics that bring 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.250
 the ball boxes 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.049
 then we have these that what you can 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.930
 to do is instead of making the spirals 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.750
 36 centimeters 6 a little more 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.209
 long and you will be more more drawings 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.950
 instead of being alone because we 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.909
 there are several besides it is little ball like 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.909
 You see, it's closer 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.260
 this ball is not totally ballad is more 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.329
 in teardrop shape and it's also very 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.599
 pretty 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.110
 you see the combination I make of 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.110
 wire colors 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.300
 this is in blue tones 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.909
 and this one that says with the balls 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.189
 these porcelain imitating the pieces 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:42.629
 the balls in China were very 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.660
 cool you see with drawing and everything 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:47.370
 pretty that is left 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.410
 in pink and green 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.000
 there is always a little ball that makes a 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.040
 little contrast but no more than 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.810
 what work 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.310
 these are my ideas and well now you 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.080
 you will give pictures so you can 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.880
 see better and I also wanted you 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.190
 teach the choker look how pretty 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.590
 is 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.330
 does not have closure removed is the girl 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.730
 completely in the mind by the head 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.990
 and well you can put it with the balls 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.640
 here in front of the balls in a little 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.150
 the balls in the back part that 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.010
 see all this the same the truth is that 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.500
 It is very beautiful and good if you want 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.240
 do the earrings as nothing today 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.950
 two pieces you put a cane and the 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.210
 hook of earring and ready you have the 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.230
 earrings also to the game of the 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.230
 bracelet and choker 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:21.759
 and I say goodbye from here with my 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:22.989
 collection of bracelets and say o 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:24.369

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:25.959
