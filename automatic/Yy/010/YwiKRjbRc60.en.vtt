sort of traditional Hungarian family my

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.000 
sort of traditional Hungarian family my
parents<00:00:26.210> came<00:00:26.360> over<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:27.080> the<00:00:27.170> US<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:27.710> little<00:00:27.920> bit

before<00:00:28.340> my<00:00:28.369> sister<00:00:28.850> and<00:00:28.940> I<00:00:29.000> were<00:00:29.119> born<00:00:29.300> they

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
before my sister and I were born they

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.779 
before my sister and I were born they
wanted<00:00:30.289> a<00:00:30.380> better<00:00:30.500> life<00:00:30.590> and<00:00:31.130> better<00:00:31.550> life<00:00:31.760> for

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.549 
wanted a better life and better life for
us<00:00:32.029> so<00:00:32.509> we<00:00:32.629> grew<00:00:32.809> up<00:00:32.899> with<00:00:33.050> a<00:00:33.170> lot<00:00:33.319> of<00:00:33.350> the

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
us so we grew up with a lot of the

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.829 
us so we grew up with a lot of the
cultural<00:00:34.069> and<00:00:34.339> traditional<00:00:34.839> Hungarian

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:35.839 
cultural and traditional Hungarian

00:00:35.839 --> 00:00:39.040 
cultural and traditional Hungarian
things<00:00:36.109> in<00:00:36.379> our<00:00:36.469> family<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.129> really<00:00:37.989> proud<00:00:38.989> of

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
things in our family and really proud of

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.770 
things in our family and really proud of
that<00:00:39.199> heritage<00:00:40.059> family<00:00:41.059> is<00:00:41.179> important<00:00:41.659> to<00:00:41.690> me

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
that heritage family is important to me

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.200 
that heritage family is important to me
it's<00:00:42.229> probably<00:00:42.469> gotten<00:00:43.309> more<00:00:43.460> important<00:00:43.999> as

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
it's probably gotten more important as

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.750 
it's probably gotten more important as
we've<00:00:44.539> all<00:00:45.139> kind<00:00:45.559> of<00:00:45.739> split<00:00:46.010> out<00:00:46.159> around<00:00:46.609> the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
we've all kind of split out around the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.239 
we've all kind of split out around the
country<00:00:46.909> and<00:00:47.539> moved<00:00:47.780> away<00:00:48.249> there's

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
country and moved away there's

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.489 
country and moved away there's
definitely<00:00:49.879> a<00:00:49.909> bit<00:00:50.539> of<00:00:50.690> natural<00:00:51.079> talent<00:00:51.229> that

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:51.499 
definitely a bit of natural talent that

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:52.869 
definitely a bit of natural talent that
comes<00:00:51.679> with<00:00:51.949> something<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:52.309> brushstroke<00:00:52.670> and

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
comes with something the brushstroke and

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.599 
comes with something the brushstroke and
I<00:00:53.059> picked<00:00:53.600> that<00:00:53.690> up<00:00:53.749> right<00:00:54.229> away<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.739> made<00:00:55.460> it

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
I picked that up right away and made it

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.119 
I picked that up right away and made it
to<00:00:55.729> my<00:00:55.850> first<00:00:55.999> Nationals<00:00:56.510> at<00:00:56.690> age<00:00:56.929> 13<00:00:57.409> so<00:00:57.889> I

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
to my first Nationals at age 13 so I

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.369 
to my first Nationals at age 13 so I
definitely<00:00:58.729> jumped<00:00:59.179> pretty<00:00:59.510> quick<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.170> then

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
definitely jumped pretty quick but then

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.139 
definitely jumped pretty quick but then
it<00:01:00.499> was<00:01:00.649> kind<00:01:00.889> of<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.129> slow<00:01:01.370> climb<00:01:01.670> from<00:01:01.940> there

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
it was kind of a slow climb from there

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.889 
it was kind of a slow climb from there
on<00:01:02.389> out<00:01:02.539> to<00:01:02.899> be<00:01:03.289> the<00:01:03.469> top<00:01:04.239> US<00:01:05.239> breaststroker

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
on out to be the top US breaststroker

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.889 
on out to be the top US breaststroker
eventually<00:01:06.500> I<00:01:06.789> have<00:01:07.789> always<00:01:07.939> loved<00:01:08.390> swimming

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
eventually I have always loved swimming

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:11.920 
eventually I have always loved swimming
not<00:01:09.409> necessarily<00:01:09.979> for<00:01:10.369> having<00:01:11.360> goals<00:01:11.659> or

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
not necessarily for having goals or

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.600 
not necessarily for having goals or
wanting<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:12.350> be<00:01:12.439> the<00:01:12.530> best<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:13.039> just<00:01:13.100> loved

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
wanting to be the best I just loved

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.480 
wanting to be the best I just loved
training<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.630> loved<00:01:14.869> competing<00:01:15.439> the<00:01:16.189> point

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
training and I loved competing the point

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.940 
training and I loved competing the point
where<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.700> really<00:01:16.869> started<00:01:17.869> to<00:01:18.170> realize<00:01:18.320> that

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
where I really started to realize that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.800 
where I really started to realize that
something<00:01:19.430> special<00:01:19.579> was<00:01:19.909> happening<00:01:20.359> was<00:01:20.630> when

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
something special was happening was when

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.200 
something special was happening was when
I<00:01:20.840> did<00:01:21.079> win<00:01:21.229> my<00:01:21.409> first<00:01:21.680> national<00:01:22.399> title<00:01:23.000> and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
I did win my first national title and

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.450 
I did win my first national title and
that<00:01:23.359> was<00:01:23.570> after<00:01:23.899> I<00:01:24.500> just<00:01:24.890> graduated<00:01:25.340> high

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
that was after I just graduated high

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.760 
that was after I just graduated high
school<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:26.420> was<00:01:26.479> that<00:01:26.780> point<00:01:27.049> that<00:01:27.289> I<00:01:27.350> really

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
school it was that point that I really

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.230 
school it was that point that I really
thought<00:01:27.950> maybe<00:01:28.219> I<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:28.880> know<00:01:28.969> keep<00:01:29.210> going

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
thought maybe I can you know keep going

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.139 
thought maybe I can you know keep going
and<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:30.079> kind<00:01:30.289> of<00:01:30.469> wasn't<00:01:31.009> until<00:01:31.429> a<00:01:31.700> year

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
and it kind of wasn't until a year

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.929 
and it kind of wasn't until a year
before<00:01:32.530> the<00:01:33.530> oay<00:01:33.829> trials<00:01:34.399> that<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.609> really

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
before the oay trials that I really

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.359 
before the oay trials that I really
thought<00:01:35.119> that<00:01:35.179> I<00:01:35.359> could<00:01:35.659> make<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.020> team<00:01:36.369> you

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
thought that I could make the team you

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.859 
thought that I could make the team you
have<00:01:37.490> put<00:01:37.670> in<00:01:37.789> so<00:01:37.939> much<00:01:38.090> hard<00:01:38.270> work<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.719> effort

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
have put in so much hard work and effort

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.679 
have put in so much hard work and effort
and<00:01:39.350> it<00:01:39.619> all<00:01:39.740> comes<00:01:39.979> down<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.280> one<00:01:41.240> minute<00:01:41.359> two

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
and it all comes down to one minute two

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.179 
and it all comes down to one minute two
minutes<00:01:41.960> however<00:01:42.170> long<00:01:42.469> you're<00:01:42.619> racing<00:01:42.920> for

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
minutes however long you're racing for

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.520 
minutes however long you're racing for
