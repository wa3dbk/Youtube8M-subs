00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.930
 Russian weather forecasters will start soon 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.870
 get accurate information from space 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.770
 one of these days rocket carrier union 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.770
 telecommunications itu 7 space 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.410
 meteorologist 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.410
 first for the last decades ahead 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.710
 each country must have its borders 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.039
 political system 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.480
 its has europe has usa has 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.460
 China 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.179
 unfortunately in Russia 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.380
 there were difficult times otherwise hydro meteorological 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.339
 statistics was destroyed in 2004 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:34.640
 finally failed last 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.960
 domestic meteorological 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:36.720
 satellite 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.100
 project data from foreign 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.430
 spacecraft 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.380
 the accuracy of the weather forecast left 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.319
 want something better 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:46.529
 but apparently the situation will change to 

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:49.529
 better meteor fill the gap 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.540
 appliances 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.400
 we are very those devices which chinavat 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.420
 images now produce measurements 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.270
 global dimension 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.010
 characteristics specifically 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.170
 cloudiness and on 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.850
 surface of the sea in 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.010
 different areas of the spectrum good 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.350
 resolution they today 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 not been developed for one year 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.000
 most modern airport 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.420
 equipment 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.299
 This unique project assumes precisely 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.170
 so she repents in space 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.630
 12 times a day will be transferred from it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.850
 information down to earth as far as these 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.420
 place and modern 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.659
 side radar for 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.200
 round-the-clock all-weather 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.060
 monitoring 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.870
 this satellite will be lit 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.650
 using radar 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.450
 northern sea route 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.140
 that is, the thickness will be determined 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.040
 of ice 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.710
 ice young or old width dropped 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.110
 India cracks this information will 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.230
 transferred to the captain of the icebreaker 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.760
 which can more properly 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.640
 send their ships because they 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.930
 stuck in the ice the satellite combines in 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.740
 many functions it is capable of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.710
 pave the way in the icy wilderness 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.010
 find new mineral deposits 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:54.990
 as well as earthquake warnings 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.310
 floods and other 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.180
 our information since we are 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.619
 Member of the World Meteorological 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.479
 organizations will take in everything 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:02.920
 the world 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.960
 there is nothing on earth to pay 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.249
 hard tested 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.509
 without laughing britain how in space is it 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.159
 best electronic check 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.510
 the instrumentation therefore the committee worked 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.099
 tightness parameters 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.469
 ever delivered it to 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.659
 cosmodrome Baikonur 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.489
 repetition tests 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.539
 but it is very prestigious 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.149
 the company's management is seriously worth it 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.779
 very big money 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:26.969
 so itâ€™s very difficult with them 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.709
 the weather service collects information every three 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.750
 hours and weather forecast 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.480
 to complete the work you need it 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.499
 at least two devices 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.019
 a second satellite is being prepared 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.029
 Sheremetyevo 

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:39.129
 which is supposed 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.139
 run early next year 

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:43.359
 Now the Russian constellation satellite 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:43.679
 Aug 

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:45.779
 will consist of three vehicles 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.629
 the third satellite will be special 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.409
 radar which will be based on active 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.459
 lattice position with very high 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.859
 spatial order solution 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:54.639
 satisfied 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.289
 what is also needed compartment 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.909
 i'm not only arctic here anymore 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:01.059
 Tatyana is practically a companion who will 

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.549
 and 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.269
 ocean throat explorers 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.519
 this is the fourth generation satellite 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.519
 only in our country, the early nineties 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.520
 was built and launched 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.210
 32 facial but then the whole 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:14.900
 decade development group 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.920
 stopped 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.310
 now there is a revival of goods and 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.760
 one can hope that the Russians will soon 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.819
 will receive the most accurate weather forecast
