sure that the top of the hedge is

sure that the top of the hedge is
narrower<00:01:08.390> than<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.870> base<00:01:09.080> so<00:01:09.680> it's<00:01:09.860> a

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
narrower than the base so it's a

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.700 
narrower than the base so it's a
pyramidal<00:01:10.460> shape<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.570> idea<00:01:11.930> is<00:01:12.170> to<00:01:12.409> expose

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
pyramidal shape the idea is to expose

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.039 
pyramidal shape the idea is to expose
the<00:01:12.920> sunshine<00:01:13.460> to<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.760> hedge<00:01:13.940> equally<00:01:14.510> from

the sunshine to the hedge equally from
top<00:01:15.320> to<00:01:15.350> bottom<00:01:15.650> and<00:01:16.159> let<00:01:16.670> air<00:01:16.940> circulate

top to bottom and let air circulate
through<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.920> approach<00:01:19.220> is<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.430> same

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
through it the approach is the same
