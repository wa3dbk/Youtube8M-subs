00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
across the face this one does pretty

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.880 
across the face this one does pretty
well<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.090> one<00:00:54.239> has<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> hot<00:00:54.660> spot<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.590> two

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
well this one has a hot spot and and two

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.250 
well this one has a hot spot and and two
really<00:00:56.100> low<00:00:56.370> spots<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.690> did<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.930> we<00:00:58.020> did

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
really low spots what we did is we did

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.369 
really low spots what we did is we did
five<00:00:58.500> readings<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.539> then<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> added<00:01:01.050> them<00:01:01.230> up

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
five readings and then we added them up

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.080 
five readings and then we added them up
and<00:01:01.440> divided<00:01:01.770> by<00:01:01.890> five<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> got<00:01:02.520> an<00:01:02.670> average

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
and divided by five and got an average

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.910 
and divided by five and got an average
and<00:01:03.420> we'll<00:01:04.019> show<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.320> math<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:04.830> we're

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and we'll show you that math but we're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.399 
and we'll show you that math but we're
also<00:01:05.040> gonna<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:06.000> won't<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.810> able<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.020> talk<00:01:07.200> when

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
also gonna I won't be able to talk when

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.660 
also gonna I won't be able to talk when
these<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.710> running<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.280> won't<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.490> able<00:01:08.549> to

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
loud but we're gonna show the amp draw

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.660 
loud but we're gonna show the amp draw
test<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.420> air<00:01:13.409> speed<00:01:13.710> across<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.340> face

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
test and the air speed across the face

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.359 
test and the air speed across the face
of<00:01:14.880> both<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.240> these<00:01:15.530> without<00:01:16.530> talking<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.009> one
