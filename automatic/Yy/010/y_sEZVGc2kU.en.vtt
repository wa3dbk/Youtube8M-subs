00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
needed break from YouTube just lot of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.660

work to do lighting and editing and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.480 
work to do lighting and editing and
uploading<00:01:38.850> every<00:01:39.600> single<00:01:40.049> day<00:01:40.490> it's

uploading every single day it's

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
uploading every single day it's
definitely<00:01:41.670> underrated<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.869> amount<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.229> work

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that goes into it so yeah I either get a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
that goes into it so yeah I either get a
break<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.880> I'll<00:01:48.090> eventually<00:01:48.479> probably

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
break which I'll eventually probably

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.010 
break which I'll eventually probably
have<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.560> any<00:01:50.009> way<00:01:50.579> or<00:01:51.479> we'll<00:01:51.659> get<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.899> the
