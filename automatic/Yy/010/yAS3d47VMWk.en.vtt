if you put it anywhere with any oil or

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760 
if you put it anywhere with any oil or
dirt<00:01:48.689> they're<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> kind<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.409> pick<00:01:49.619> up

that<00:01:49.920> color<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.670> stain<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
that color and it will stain it's a

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.120 
that color and it will stain it's a
little<00:01:51.990> disappointing<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.829> bright

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
all-black version it's not going to show

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
all-black version it's not going to show
any<00:01:59.820> dirt<00:02:00.030> or<00:02:00.180> debris<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> orange<00:02:01.259> does

any dirt or debris like the orange does

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.649
