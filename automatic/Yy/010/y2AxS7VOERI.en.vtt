I don't know if you guys have heard about
these scary drone things

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.210
that have been flying around in the skies,
but today we're going to

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.090
exercise our second amendment rights and
shoot them out of the sky.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.739
Let's do this.

&gt;&gt; Here's what's going to happen.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.160
I'm gonna take this drone off, I'm gonna
fly it over your heads.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.640
Moving it passes over your heads,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.280
