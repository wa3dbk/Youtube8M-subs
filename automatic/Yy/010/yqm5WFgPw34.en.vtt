of course seen the final smash that gets
unleashed<00:01:54.030> when<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.360> get<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.750> these

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
unleashed when you get one of these

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.800 
unleashed when you get one of these
smash<00:01:55.110> balls<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> mechanic<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.250> them<00:01:56.369> is

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
smash balls but the mechanic of them is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.060 
smash balls but the mechanic of them is
really<00:01:57.810> interesting<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.469> though<00:01:58.770> they

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really interesting actually though they

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
really interesting actually though they
appear<00:01:59.430> on<00:01:59.460> screen<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.270> start<00:02:00.540> floating

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
appear on screen and start floating

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.010 
appear on screen and start floating
around<00:02:00.990> sort<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.619> randomly<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.579> oh<00:02:03.360> isn't<00:02:03.899> a

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
around sort of randomly and oh isn't a

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.219 
around sort of randomly and oh isn't a
sister<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.469> hangout

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
sister of a hangout

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.000 
sister of a hangout
that's<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.500> Advance<00:02:08.039> Wars

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.380 

so<00:02:13.010> smash<00:02:13.430> balls<00:02:13.670> basically<00:02:13.879> appear<00:02:14.329> on

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
so smash balls basically appear on

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.610 
so smash balls basically appear on
screen<00:02:14.540> hopefully<00:02:14.870> they'll<00:02:15.140> be<00:02:15.170> won<00:02:15.349> in<00:02:15.439> here

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
screen hopefully they'll be won in here

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.789 
screen hopefully they'll be won in here
and<00:02:16.489> you<00:02:17.420> don't<00:02:17.599> just<00:02:17.719> automatically<00:02:18.200> grab<00:02:18.469> oh

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.119 
and you don't just automatically grab oh
there's<00:02:19.099> nothing<00:02:19.430> in<00:02:19.519> there<00:02:19.670> terrible<00:02:21.129> what

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.319 
really really simplifies things and
actually<00:03:40.099> in<00:03:40.220> my<00:03:40.340> mind<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.639> sort<00:03:40.819> of<00:03:40.879> it<00:03:41.090> takes

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.300 
actually in my mind is sort of it takes
me<00:03:41.449> back<00:03:41.629> to<00:03:41.659> NES<00:03:42.440> days<00:03:42.650> because<00:03:42.949> you're<00:03:43.069> doing

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
me back to NES days because you're doing

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.460 
me back to NES days because you're doing
a<00:03:43.370> lot<00:03:43.489> of<00:03:43.519> the<00:03:43.639> similar<00:03:44.000> movements<00:03:44.629> you<00:03:45.319> move

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
a lot of the similar movements you move

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.430 
a lot of the similar movements you move
around<00:03:45.590> with<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.400> d-pad<00:03:47.079> DoubleTap<00:03:48.079> to<00:03:48.109> dash

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
around with the d-pad DoubleTap to dash

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.349 
around with the d-pad DoubleTap to dash
so<00:03:48.949> again<00:03:49.639> it's<00:03:49.819> sort<00:03:50.000> of<00:03:50.030> similar<00:03:50.329> to

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:50.359 
so again it's sort of similar to

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:53.979 
so again it's sort of similar to
old-school<00:03:50.720> fighters<00:03:51.280> attack<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.459> to<00:03:52.989> special

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
old-school fighters attack is to special

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.689 
old-school fighters attack is to special
attack<00:03:54.229> is<00:03:54.439> one<00:03:54.709> your<00:03:55.159> shield<00:03:55.400> button<00:03:55.609> is

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
attack is one your shield button is

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.580 
attack is one your shield button is
actually<00:03:55.819> under<00:03:56.150> here<00:03:56.359> so<00:03:57.199> that's<00:03:57.349> the<00:03:57.409> thing

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
actually under here so that's the thing

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.559 
actually under here so that's the thing
that's<00:03:57.709> gonna<00:03:57.889> take<00:03:58.129> the<00:03:58.970> most<00:03:59.120> getting<00:03:59.389> used

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
that's gonna take the most getting used

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.000 
that's gonna take the most getting used
to<00:03:59.659> I<00:03:59.689> think<00:03:59.780> for<00:03:59.989> a<00:04:00.109> lot<00:04:00.229> of<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.409> guys<00:04:00.530> I'm

your middle finger and depending on the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.979 
your middle finger and depending on the
size<00:04:03.620> of<00:04:03.739> your<00:04:03.769> hands<00:04:04.419> grab<00:04:05.419> to<00:04:05.569> me<00:04:05.689> minus
