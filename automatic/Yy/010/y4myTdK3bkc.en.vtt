actually<00:03:28.489> showed<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:29.060> like<00:03:29.269> where<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.900> are

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
actually showed you like where you are

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.420 
actually showed you like where you are
relation<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.620> your<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.860> then<00:03:30.950> you<00:03:31.010> put<00:03:31.160> a<00:03:31.250> lot

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
relation to your and then you put a lot

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.720 
relation to your and then you put a lot
of<00:03:31.459> these<00:03:31.670> different<00:03:32.890> attacks<00:03:33.890> actually<00:03:34.250> have

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
of these different attacks actually have

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.130 
of these different attacks actually have
properties<00:03:35.269> or<00:03:35.390> you'll<00:03:35.510> do<00:03:35.690> more<00:03:35.900> for

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
properties or you'll do more for

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.180 
properties or you'll do more for
instance<00:03:36.380> like<00:03:36.440> steal<00:03:36.650> away<00:03:36.739> produções

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
instance like steal away produções

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.009 
instance like steal away produções
backslash<00:03:38.150> obviously<00:03:38.570> didn't<00:03:38.780> more<00:03:38.900> in<00:03:38.959> the

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
backslash obviously didn't more in the

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.479 
backslash obviously didn't more in the
back<00:03:39.140> but<00:03:39.410> it<00:03:39.500> didn't<00:03:39.709> tell<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:39.950> exactly<00:03:40.280> when

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
back but it didn't tell you exactly when

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:41.860 
back but it didn't tell you exactly when
you<00:03:40.610> were<00:03:40.730> there<00:03:40.910> in<00:03:41.120> relation<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.630> enemy

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
you were there in relation to the enemy

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.270 
you were there in relation to the enemy
and<00:03:42.140> now<00:03:42.290> they<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.470> that<00:03:42.769> series<00:03:43.070> on<00:03:43.190> the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
and now they have that series on the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.470 
and now they have that series on the
back<00:03:43.459> now<00:03:43.700> on<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.900> side<00:03:45.430> in<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.700> front<00:03:46.970> so

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
back now on the side in the front so

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.610 
back now on the side in the front so
