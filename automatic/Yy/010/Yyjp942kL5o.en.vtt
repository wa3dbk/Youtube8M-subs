00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
definitely reaches over that I don't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.900 
definitely reaches over that I don't
think<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.820> we've<00:00:36.000> gotten<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.750> seats<00:00:37.050> I

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
think that we've gotten into the seats I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.160 
think that we've gotten into the seats I
wonder<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> warrants<00:00:39.540> temp<00:00:39.750> looking<00:00:40.050> at

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
wonder if that warrants temp looking at

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.010 
wonder if that warrants temp looking at
the<00:00:40.290> replay<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.000> they<00:00:42.000> are<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> three

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
the replay and they are going to three

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.420 
the replay and they are going to three
of<00:00:43.110> them<00:00:43.230> will<00:00:43.380> march<00:00:43.620> off<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:44.250> at<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
of them will march off and look at the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
of them will march off and look at the
replay<00:00:45.080> they<00:00:46.080> torch<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.470> telephone<00:00:46.860> would

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
replay they torch the telephone would

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.350 
replay they torch the telephone would
have<00:00:47.070> hit<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.310> yellow<00:00:47.550> line<00:00:47.790> Kenny<00:00:48.150> it's

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
have hit that yellow line Kenny it's

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
have hit that yellow line Kenny it's
gonna<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.720> very<00:00:48.900> different<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.680> don't<00:00:49.920> think

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
gonna be a very different I don't think

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.350 
gonna be a very different I don't think
they'll<00:00:50.190> overturn<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:50.880> because<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.180> don't

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
they'll overturn it because I don't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.640 
they'll overturn it because I don't
think<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:51.660> enough<00:00:51.930> evidence<00:00:52.110> let's<00:00:52.530> see

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
think there's enough evidence let's see

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.710 
think there's enough evidence let's see
if<00:00:52.740> this<00:00:52.890> gives<00:00:53.040> us<00:00:53.250> any<00:00:56.060> from<00:00:57.060> that<00:00:57.270> angle<00:00:57.450> it

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
if this gives us any from that angle it

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.580 
if this gives us any from that angle it
looks<00:00:57.900> like<00:00:58.110> it<00:00:58.320> had<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> chance<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> they'll

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
looks like it had a chance and they'll

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.140 
looks like it had a chance and they'll
get<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> chance<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.250> look<00:01:02.400> at<00:01:02.550> many<00:01:02.790> angles

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.650 

I'm<00:01:10.660> not<00:01:10.960> sure<00:01:11.230> but<00:01:12.220> I'm<00:01:12.370> not<00:01:12.850> sure<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.300> it's

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
I'm not sure but I'm not sure that it's

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.570 
I'm not sure but I'm not sure that it's
enough<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.170> overturn<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:14.920> because<00:01:15.430> the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
enough to overturn it because the

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.430 
enough to overturn it because the
on-field<00:01:15.760> call<00:01:16.450> is<00:01:16.660> a<00:01:16.690> double
