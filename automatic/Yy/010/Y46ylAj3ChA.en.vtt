00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
bottom so that we can work this up in

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
bottom so that we can work this up in
through<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.320> all<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.890> way

through here all right all the way
throughout<00:01:20.250> both<00:01:20.490> sides<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.330> when<00:01:21.450> we<00:01:21.540> drop

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
throughout both sides then when we drop

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
throughout both sides then when we drop
this<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.200> be<00:01:22.259> much<00:01:22.470> much<00:01:22.650> longer<00:01:22.950> because<00:01:23.670> we

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
this to be much much longer because we

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.280 
this to be much much longer because we
clipped<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> off<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.900> we'll<00:01:24.990> be<00:01:25.080> able<00:01:25.140> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
clipped it off and then we'll be able to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.690 
clipped it off and then we'll be able to
have<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> nice<00:01:25.590> flow<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.220> goes<00:01:26.310> shorter

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have a nice flow where it goes shorter

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490

let's<00:03:08.690> say<00:03:09.410> his<00:03:09.740> hair<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.040> about<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.900> don't<00:03:11.900> know

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
let's say his hair is about I don't know

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.070 
let's say his hair is about I don't know
I'd<00:03:12.140> say<00:03:12.380> about<00:03:13.390> two<00:03:14.390> and<00:03:14.510> a<00:03:14.570> half<00:03:14.600> inches<00:03:15.050> or

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
I'd say about two and a half inches or

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.530 
I'd say about two and a half inches or
so<00:03:15.320> on<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.500> top<00:03:15.710> two<00:03:16.010> inches<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.940> be<00:03:17.030> longer

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
so on the top two inches to be longer

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.800 
so on the top two inches to be longer
let's<00:03:18.230> cut<00:03:18.680> short<00:03:19.100> so<00:03:19.160> longer<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.610> way<00:03:19.850> all

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
let's cut short so longer this way all

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.180 
let's cut short so longer this way all
right<00:03:20.870> it's<00:03:21.170> probably<00:03:21.470> gonna<00:03:21.560> be<00:03:21.620> end<00:03:22.010> up

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
right it's probably gonna be end up

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.040 
right it's probably gonna be end up
being<00:03:22.370> a<00:03:22.430> lot<00:03:22.580> shorter<00:03:22.940> in<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.180> front<00:03:23.450> but

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
being a lot shorter in the front but

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.390 
being a lot shorter in the front but
you're<00:03:24.170> better<00:03:24.350> to<00:03:24.530> have<00:03:24.709> a<00:03:24.739> little<00:03:25.070> bit<00:03:25.310> of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
you're better to have a little bit of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.430 
you're better to have a little bit of
length<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.850> work<00:03:26.030> with<00:03:26.270> than<00:03:26.900> cutting<00:03:27.140> it<00:03:27.290> all

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
length to work with than cutting it all

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.590 
length to work with than cutting it all
off<00:03:27.650> and<00:03:27.950> being<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.730> then<00:03:29.060> it's<00:03:29.390> too<00:03:29.570> late

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
off and being and then it's too late

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.650 
off and being and then it's too late
okay<00:03:30.440> so<00:03:31.190> here<00:03:31.580> we<00:03:31.610> go<00:03:31.790> we're<00:03:32.120> gonna<00:03:32.180> comb<00:03:32.480> this

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
okay so here we go we're gonna comb this

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:33.460 
okay so here we go we're gonna comb this
up<00:03:32.840> like<00:03:32.989> this

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
up like this

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.550 
up like this
there's<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.610> length<00:03:34.820> from<00:03:35.060> before<00:03:35.480> keep<00:03:36.380> that

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
there's the length from before keep that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.540 
there's the length from before keep that
left<00:03:36.860> elbow<00:03:37.330> pretty<00:03:38.330> pretty<00:03:39.020> parallel<00:03:39.830> to<00:03:40.430> the

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:40.550 
left elbow pretty pretty parallel to the

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.910 
left elbow pretty pretty parallel to the
section<00:03:41.140> okay<00:03:42.140> let's<00:03:42.320> come<00:03:42.470> back<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:42.769> this

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
section okay let's come back on this

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.620 
section okay let's come back on this
side<00:03:43.130> now<00:03:43.280> bring<00:03:43.550> everything<00:03:43.820> straight<00:03:44.540> up

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:44.630 
side now bring everything straight up

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.509 
side now bring everything straight up
for<00:03:44.780> kind<00:03:45.050> of<00:03:45.110> towards<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.470> middle<00:03:45.709> there's

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
for kind of towards the middle there's

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:53.350 
for kind of towards the middle there's
the<00:03:46.760> guide<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:48.400> now<00:03:49.400> we've<00:03:49.670> got<00:03:50.260> most<00:03:51.260> of<00:03:52.360> the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
the guide and now we've got most of the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360 
the guide and now we've got most of the
longer<00:03:53.959> lengths<00:03:54.200> out<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.680> way<00:03:54.890> but<00:03:55.160> now<00:03:55.310> we

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
longer lengths out of the way but now we

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.520 
longer lengths out of the way but now we
still<00:03:55.580> have<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:56.000> really<00:03:56.660> blend<00:03:56.989> this<00:03:57.080> all<00:03:57.320> in

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
still have to really blend this all in

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.100 
still have to really blend this all in
throughout<00:03:58.459> the<00:03:58.519> whole<00:03:58.700> top<00:03:58.940> okay<00:03:59.450> so<00:03:59.989> what

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
throughout the whole top okay so what

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.949 
throughout the whole top okay so what
we're<00:04:00.200> gonna<00:04:00.260> do<00:04:00.470> is<00:04:01.480> continue<00:04:02.480> to<00:04:02.570> work<00:04:02.750> in

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
we're gonna do is continue to work in

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.560 
we're gonna do is continue to work in
cutting<00:04:03.320> towards<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.680> face<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.519> we're<00:04:05.480> gonna

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
cutting towards the face and we're gonna

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.240 
cutting towards the face and we're gonna
cut<00:04:05.870> short<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.260> longer<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:06.709> that<00:04:06.830> everything

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
cut short to longer so that everything

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.210 
cut short to longer so that everything
works<00:04:07.910> in<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:09.080> it<00:04:09.200> blends<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:09.590> in<00:04:09.709> but<00:04:10.070> as<00:04:10.160> you

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
works in and it blends it in but as you

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.940 
works in and it blends it in but as you
can<00:04:10.400> see<00:04:10.459> now<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.480> drying<00:04:11.780> we<00:04:12.739> have

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
can see now that it's drying we have

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.430 
can see now that it's drying we have
more<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.300> work<00:04:14.480> with<00:04:14.660> now<00:04:14.810> and<00:04:15.110> we<00:04:15.230> can

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
more to work with now and we can

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.800 
more to work with now and we can
actually<00:04:15.890> go<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:16.970> there<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.180> little<00:04:17.299> bit<00:04:17.419> easier

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
actually go in there a little bit easier

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.370 
actually go in there a little bit easier
now<00:04:18.019> and<00:04:18.459> start<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.700> blend<00:04:20.390> this<00:04:20.570> in<00:04:20.810> a<00:04:20.989> lot

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
now and start to blend this in a lot

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.380 
now and start to blend this in a lot
easier<00:04:21.739> than<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.160> was<00:04:22.220> super<00:04:22.940> super<00:04:23.240> long

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
easier than if it was super super long

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.020 
easier than if it was super super long
and<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.750> kind

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
and you kind

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.420 
and you kind
get<00:04:24.180> lost<00:04:24.389> so<00:04:24.750> let's<00:04:25.650> continue<00:04:25.830> to<00:04:26.100> work<00:04:26.280> this

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
get lost so let's continue to work this

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.710 
get lost so let's continue to work this
in<00:04:26.639> cutting<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.060> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.270> bit<00:04:27.360> shorter

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
in cutting it's a little bit shorter

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.480 
in cutting it's a little bit shorter
especially<00:04:28.620> in<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.740> front<00:04:28.950> here<00:04:29.190> I<00:04:29.220> think<00:04:29.430> it

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
especially in the front here I think it

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.879 
especially in the front here I think it
definitely<00:04:29.639> needs<00:04:30.180> to<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.330> shorter<00:04:31.290> alright

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
definitely needs to be shorter alright

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.470 
definitely needs to be shorter alright
and<00:04:32.070> there<00:04:32.250> you<00:04:32.280> can<00:04:32.430> see<00:04:32.669> there's<00:04:33.090> a<00:04:33.150> guy<00:04:33.330> from

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
and there you can see there's a guy from

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.300 
and there you can see there's a guy from
the<00:04:33.600> corner<00:04:33.900> and<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.740> can<00:04:34.830> cut<00:04:34.980> that<00:04:35.100> off

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
the corner and you can cut that off

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.710 
the corner and you can cut that off
right<00:04:35.400> there

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
right there

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.790 
right there
but<00:04:36.960> there's<00:04:37.110> definitely<00:04:37.200> to<00:04:37.500> be<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.620> little

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
but there's definitely to be a little

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.500 
but there's definitely to be a little
bit<00:04:37.889> shorter<00:04:38.160> front<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:38.940> now<00:04:39.090> at<00:04:39.270> least<00:04:39.419> you

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
bit shorter front but now at least you

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.270 
bit shorter front but now at least you
have<00:04:39.690> a<00:04:39.720> lot<00:04:39.960> of<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.139> link<00:04:40.320> that'll<00:04:40.500> away<00:04:40.740> so

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
have a lot of the link that'll away so

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.710 
have a lot of the link that'll away so
you<00:04:41.370> can<00:04:41.490> hold<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.790> straight<00:04:42.030> up<00:04:42.090> this<00:04:42.270> way<00:04:42.450> and

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
you can hold it straight up this way and

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.620 
you can hold it straight up this way and
cut<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.960> parallel<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:43.980> let's<00:04:44.940> continue<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
cut it parallel so let's continue to

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.480 
cut it parallel so let's continue to
work<00:04:45.870> on<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.200> I'm<00:04:46.470> gonna<00:04:46.770> dry<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.280> little

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
work on this I'm gonna dry it a little

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.070 
work on this I'm gonna dry it a little
bit<00:04:47.580> more<00:04:47.820> and<00:04:48.060> then<00:04:48.389> do<00:04:48.540> some<00:04:48.690> more<00:04:48.720> scissor

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
bit more and then do some more scissor
