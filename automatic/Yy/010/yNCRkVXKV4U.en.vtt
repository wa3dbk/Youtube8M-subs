00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:10.090
 What are you doing? 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.100
 here again the service of mechanics of the 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.510
 Honda Civic 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.770
 We're going to exchange kinetic love. 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.009
 The one I showed you in the other. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.689
 video that had been authorized 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.750
 So what are we going to do to each other? 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.339
 the first will take the wheel for us can 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.980
 take that cap here she is 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.839
 pushing behind to put the wheel 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.930
 in the place of new I will use this key 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:40.900
 here and put here to loosen a nut 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 same as the one inside here that 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:47.080
 holds the genetic girl in a place 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.050
 So, I'll take the wheel. 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.500
 We're going to loosen that nut. 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 I wanted to show you a detail here. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.200
 she has a lock 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.410
 You see, she has a shoulder and she 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.960
 here you have to 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.750
 say but there is this tip here to 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:13.810
 Turn it on when it's ready 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.750
 You see, it was wrinkled here. 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.930
 Now we already say kneaded to be able to 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.900
 release the rotating door with a key 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.659
 crack a reference goes crashing here 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.710
 forcing here leveraging you here 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:32.350
 can disarm it here folks here O 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.830
 I'll turn it a little sideways to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.760
 Anglo's power on the power cord does not 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:45.880
 knocking on the door to close the 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:55.710
 door and now we'll put a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 iron to release the wheel here 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.890
 So guys, we're going to let go. 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:17.269
 here o 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:22.030
 the bottom balance pivot and the 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:24.500
 right up here for what? 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.230
 It is so we can move this 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.950
 all set here from the tower of the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.330
 bumper with disc out for power 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.519
 pull the kinetic girl from here 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.580
 so guys here the tip is already 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.730
 loose loosened the nut the pivot here 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:46.130
 underneath also only that he is still trapped 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.530
 table is stuck it gets stuck even 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.690
 with the loose nut by which the socket 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.700
 here it is conical so when you press 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.739
 pressure it gets stuck 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.959
 What are we going to do now? 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.720
 is going to give a pat here with the 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.120
 hammer here is not here on the shaft end 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.459
 it's not here 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.620
 with the impact it will loose and people 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.290
 You have to leave the door here at the 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.739
 of the thread for if you miss the blow 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.350
 you do not ruin the thread of the pivot attack 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.079
 the tip here then you will do 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.930
 this up here and the pivot that is 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.600
 here behind the disk I'm going to give 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:34.940
 blow here I show you I 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 I'm going to let go and saw a little 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.819
 delicacy is a little delicacy and the 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.920
 ask only then we now the people 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.190
 gave the blows here also in the part of 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.980
 down where there is a pierrô right here and 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.299
 let's make a lever in the southall that 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:57.920
 I'm off the scale 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:04:03.049
 Look, you let it go, and now you see everything. 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.970
 forward so you can release the 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.790
 homokinetics from within 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.780
 fix well push with your finger in the middle 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.600
 called kinetics and turns the 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.970
 be right there 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.400
 the homokinetics that we are going to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:25.450
 now replace kinetic people released the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.440
 coifa away the color was side tac 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.310
 semi-axle I held under the car 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.350
 with the hand 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.690
 my brother-in-law gave the three strokes here 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.100
 with a hammer and the ethical girl left I'm just going 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.410
 do it here to demonstrate to you 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.300
 How did it go? 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.750
 he gave the three strongest strokes of the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:47.410
 that this logic but this is how it takes and 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.450
 Now we're going to clean everything, take it easy. 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.770
 this thing of the arsenal something new and 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.410
 we kinetic new and ready 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.240
 so the homocinética here already was 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.490
 placed in place 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.700
 it was only embedded in the tip of the 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.830
 semi-axis and is struck in the 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.460
 contrary to what we give time 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.470
 We took her away from the place. 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:15.400
 Now we're going to fit her into the stria. 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:19.240
 of the hub passing through the axis of the 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:23.410
 not the axis of the brake disc us 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:27.610
 to pull out the set and in her box 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.910
 there in the middle of the scale 'dinha back and 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:35.770
 bye, she 'll fit the stria ready 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:38.140
 passed from the outside and now it's just 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.540
 put what I go down there doing 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.200
 a lever in the balance as we did 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.200
 at the time of withdrawal 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.050
 ready 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:00.790
 here we have already fitted the pivot 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.530
 balance 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:09.340
 we're putting the nut you squeeze 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:11.770
 with the key and do not forget to 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.290
 alcohol stack thinks cindy latch that has 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.230
 in that kind of nut you after 

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:20.770
 tightens you put a pin lock yes 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.540
 and fold that the door does not loosen with the 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.920
 vibration 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:29.440
 Now we're going to put the tip of the 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.700
 direction that is that it picks up of the tower 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.230
 people loose the nut 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:40.030
 just fits her up there 

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:45.450
 this way in dog it puts the nut 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:49.060
 in place and this sow and she also has 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.800
 a locking battery color that has a 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.840
 into that axis after you 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.290
 tighten the nut, you put the 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.100
 she does not loose with the vibration of the car 

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.100
 abandoned 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:06.220
 So, people are going to push the 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:08.410
 nut to tighten the nut you have 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:10.690
 two options or you lose someone to 

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:14.080
 on the brake or else you lock the 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.880
 disk with a screwdriver that the disc 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:22.410
 is leaked here in the month was with the key 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:22.410
 slit and tighten with the wrench 

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:27.989
 Good people, now it's all tight. 

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:34.209
 We can not forget to lock the door. 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:35.949
 here's most of her here for us 

00:07:34.209 --> 00:07:38.349
 We're going to hang out, people. 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:43.329
 window here and knead this little bit 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:47.679
 here it is projected to three strokes 

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:50.679
 lines here is crumpled into the 

00:07:47.679 --> 00:07:52.299
 door does not come out with the 

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:56.049
 wheel 

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:58.629
 the guy leaving now we put the wheel 

00:07:56.049 --> 00:08:01.869
 and you're done you like it 

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:03.609
 forget to give the joinha here put in the 

00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:08.969
 your social networks 

00:08:03.609 --> 00:08:08.969
 A hug and until the next video
