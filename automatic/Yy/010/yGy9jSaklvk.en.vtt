00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.919
 hello how are you, I am but again a 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.809
 friend sent me an email to my facebook 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.429
 he said that if he could do something for the 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.650
 people who have battered hair or 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.690
 damaged so much dye all hopefully that what 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.760
 be this I recommend two types of 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.240
 shampoos this one 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.439
 What is it 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:29.279
 and from my portal is that this base to put 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.279
 of bee is very good and the other is 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.490
 sainz 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.980
 This is also very good the shampoo 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.040
 what you have to when we were 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 hand is made like crystals and this one 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.820
 no but it's the most natural 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.190
 this he 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.010
 after you take a bath 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.140
 the first thing you have to do next 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.980
 that after the hair you put on 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.500
 the good because I play you know the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.440
 shower and you put the conditioner 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.420
 but do not wash you leave it because if 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.940
 you leave it you give more time to your 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.990
 hair that absorbs attention to d'or and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.479
 all nutrients because if you wash it and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.310
 then after tea jumps the base 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.830
 of the hair with the putter for that 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.520
 counter this makes everything 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.350
 have you go to the cane more well and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.319
 Well, it's not absorbed by your hair. 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.800
 leaves it still east-west but the 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.750
 conditioner does not come out of harrison was 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.480
 this is a tip of now for me to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.550
 all of you many stylists we 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.830
 they say many 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:40.060
 They are very expensive but if you use this west 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.800
 but the conditioner and everything leaves this 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.510
 the day go by that your hair is going to 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.670
 be for sooner what you think is 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.280
