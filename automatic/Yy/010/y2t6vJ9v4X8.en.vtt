inches<00:00:56.239> shorter<00:00:56.750> now<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.920> a<00:00:57.949> 380<00:00:58.610> version

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
inches shorter now this is a 380 version

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.869 
inches shorter now this is a 380 version
but<00:00:59.360> they<00:00:59.510> also<00:00:59.720> make<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.170> smaller<00:01:00.769> one<00:01:01.190> that's

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
but they also make a smaller one that's

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.760 
but they also make a smaller one that's
three<00:01:02.269> hundred<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:02.690> fifty<00:01:02.989> five<00:01:03.200> feet<00:01:03.559> per

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
second well the new matrix 355 is even

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.810 
second well the new matrix 355 is even
an<00:01:08.360> inch<00:01:08.630> shorter<00:01:09.229> than<00:01:09.440> this<00:01:09.619> 380<00:01:10.190> version

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
an inch shorter than this 380 version

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.749 
an inch shorter than this 380 version
and<00:01:11.000> this<00:01:11.750> thing<00:01:11.990> is<00:01:12.200> just<00:01:12.619> blistering<00:01:13.369> speeds

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
