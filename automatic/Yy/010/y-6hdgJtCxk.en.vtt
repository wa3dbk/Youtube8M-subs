00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:15.549
 There are several situations in which 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.770
 windows clock starts to show a 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.439
 wrong time if you notice that in your 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.390
 team starts to pass you this I'll tell you 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.029
 what can be the causes of why 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.700
 is happening and how can it be fixed 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:30.879
 the first cause is the battery of the 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.219
 motherboard or also called stack this 

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:35.710
 is the most likely cause especially 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:37.360
 If your equipment is not new, the battery 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.570
 found on the motherboard of your 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.640
 computer and provides power to the chip 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.920
 this chip stores information about the 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.950
 system configuration between which 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.020
 The time and date of the battery are included 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.360
 makes the chip can store these 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.570
 data even when the computer is 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.550
 off or not connected to the current if 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.590
 the battery goes wrong the chip starts to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.540
 lose information and one of the symptoms 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.449
 is that the computer does not provide the 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:07.659
 date and time correctly the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.180
 second cause is the time zone this 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.490
 problem is very easy to solve 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.800
 if you see on your watch that the minutes are 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.720
 correct but the time is not likely 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.760
 that it is not well established 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.710
 the time zone 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.590
 If you are in Spain, look at the area 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.400
 Time is marked gmt 1 brussels 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.060
 Copenhagen 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.770
 madrid / paris for it click on it 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.530
 of the clock and select change the 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.160
 Date and time setting if you are not 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.840
 established the time zone you want 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.930
 change it to yours and save the changes 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.869
 before leaving the third cause is the 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.060
 malware and once checked what 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.890
 explained earlier the clock 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.810
 windows keeps showing one hour 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.720
 wrong it is very possible that your team 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.610
 is infected by a virus 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.270
 First of all, make sure that you 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.619
 antivirus is updated in addition 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.590
 download a good malware detector 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.649

 Once you have downloaded these 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.790
 tools updates and installs 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.430
 start in safe mode and execute the 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.290
 it is important to start in safe mode and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.239
 that the malware will not start or 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.299
 will activate when this mode of 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:25.569
