Bowerman<00:01:43.229> named<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.770> moon<00:01:44.070> shoe<00:01:44.430> over<00:01:44.640> here

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
Bowerman named the moon shoe over here

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.940 
Bowerman named the moon shoe over here
the<00:01:45.149> moon<00:01:45.420> shoe<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> original

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the moon shoe is because the original

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.639 
the moon shoe is because the original
moon<00:01:47.220> boots<00:01:47.460> left<00:01:47.880> tracks<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.750> moon<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
moon boots left tracks on the moon that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.830 
moon boots left tracks on the moon that
made<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.430> imprints<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.240> Bowerman

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
made these imprints that Bowerman

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.990 
made these imprints that Bowerman
thought<00:01:52.049> resembled<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> waffles<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.939> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
thought resembled the waffles and you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
thought resembled the waffles and you
can<00:01:54.119> see<00:01:54.299> right<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:54.540> how<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.960> waffles<00:01:55.530> would

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
can see right here how the waffles would

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.639 
can see right here how the waffles would
make<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.100> mark<00:01:56.369> but<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.360> this

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
make that mark but you can see this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.319
