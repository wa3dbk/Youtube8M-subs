the tension the first stage you need to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
the tension the first stage you need to
uh<00:01:37.100> see<00:01:38.100> when<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> pull<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.610> trigger<00:01:38.790> it

uh see when you pull the trigger it

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.789 
uh see when you pull the trigger it
compresses<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.530> spring<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:42.799> it's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
compresses this or this spring and it's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
compresses this or this spring and it's
two<00:01:44.070> settings<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.060> snap<00:01:45.420> ring

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
two settings for this little snap ring

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.990 
two settings for this little snap ring
keeps<00:01:46.170> it<00:01:46.350> up<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> place<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.399> move<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> snap

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
ring back to compresses of spring so

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.749 
ring back to compresses of spring so
give<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> more<00:01:52.770> tension<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.340> your<00:01:53.399> first

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
give you more tension on your first

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
give you more tension on your first
stage<00:01:54.290> to<00:01:55.290> me<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:56.009> soft<00:01:57.049> really

light first stage and I could feel the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.730 
light first stage and I could feel the
second<00:02:00.360> stage<00:02:00.719> because<00:02:01.649> my<00:02:02.040> second<00:02:02.430> stage<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
second stage because my second stage is
