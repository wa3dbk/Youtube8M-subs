00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
but on another note personally I wanted

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.750 
but on another note personally I wanted
us<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:24.000> drop<00:00:24.210> noah<00:00:24.480> vonleh<00:00:24.980> my<00:00:25.980> reasoning<00:00:26.609> for

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
us to drop noah vonleh my reasoning for

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.179 
us to drop noah vonleh my reasoning for
this<00:00:26.820> is<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.539> felt<00:00:27.840> Julius<00:00:28.380> Randle<00:00:28.769> was<00:00:28.920> too

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
this is I felt Julius Randle was too

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.500 
this is I felt Julius Randle was too
small<00:00:29.929> wasn't<00:00:30.929> as<00:00:31.080> good<00:00:31.380> defensively<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
small wasn't as good defensively and I

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
small wasn't as good defensively and I
just<00:00:33.750> wanted<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.230> player<00:00:34.469> that<00:00:34.710> would<00:00:34.890> offer<00:00:35.160> us

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
just wanted a player that would offer us

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.690 
just wanted a player that would offer us
defense<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.239> well<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.630> offense<00:00:37.370> however<00:00:38.370> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
defense as well as offense however I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.420 
defense as well as offense however I
guess<00:00:38.989> Vonleh<00:00:39.989> was<00:00:40.200> more<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> project<00:00:40.890> type

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
guess Vonleh was more of a project type

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.470 
guess Vonleh was more of a project type
of<00:00:41.610> player<00:00:41.879> he<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:43.230> not<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.800> much<00:00:44.520> of<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.210> sure

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of player he was not as much of a sure

of player he was not as much of a sure

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pairing him a Kobe Bryant should bring

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.010 
pairing him a Kobe Bryant should bring
out<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> best<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.820> young<00:01:24.030> rookie<00:01:24.450> either

out the best of a young rookie either

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
out the best of a young rookie either
that<00:01:25.320> or<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.560> completely<00:01:26.189> demolish<00:01:26.850> any

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that or just completely demolish any

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.510 
that or just completely demolish any
competency<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:27.900> whatsoever<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.189> pick

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.850 

but<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.850> my<00:01:33.119> thought<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.689> us<00:01:33.930> drafting

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
but that's my thought on us drafting

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.550 
but that's my thought on us drafting
Julius<00:01:35.400> Randle<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.509> I<00:01:36.540> think<00:01:36.630> he's<00:01:37.049> gonna<00:01:37.170> get

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
Julius Randle do I think he's gonna get

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.899 
Julius Randle do I think he's gonna get
Kobe<00:01:37.920> Bryant<00:01:38.520> his<00:01:38.900> sixth<00:01:39.900> ring<00:01:40.170> no<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.759> think

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
Kobe Bryant his sixth ring no do I think

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.600 
Kobe Bryant his sixth ring no do I think
it's<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.390> step<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:42.930> right<00:01:43.200> direction

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it's a step in the right direction

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.580 
it's a step in the right direction
definitely<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:45.360> needed<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.810> draft<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.350> player

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
definitely we needed to draft a player

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.700 
definitely we needed to draft a player
for<00:01:46.890> after<00:01:47.490> kobe<00:01:47.729> bryant<00:01:48.210> in<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.479> draft<00:01:48.780> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
for after kobe bryant in this draft and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.429 
for after kobe bryant in this draft and
i<00:01:49.770> believe<00:01:50.100> we<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.720> drafted<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
i believe we we did so we drafted a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.319 
i believe we we did so we drafted a
player<00:01:52.649> with<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> build<00:01:53.159> around<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.149> could

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
player with a build around and we could

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.240 
player with a build around and we could
draft<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.869> player<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.829> can<00:01:56.070> feel

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
draft a player that you can feel

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.050 
draft a player that you can feel
confident<00:01:57.030> in<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> future

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
confident in the future

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.819 
confident in the future

and that's what Julius Randle is going

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.789 
and that's what Julius Randle is going
