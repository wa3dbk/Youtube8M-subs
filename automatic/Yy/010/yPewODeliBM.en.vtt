that's<00:01:26.939> gonna<00:01:27.060> save<00:01:27.330> all<00:01:27.689> right<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.770> what

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that's gonna save all right so what

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.200 
that's gonna save all right so what
we're<00:01:29.040> gonna<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.340> here<00:01:29.490> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> hundred

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
we're gonna do here this is a hundred

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
we're gonna do here this is a hundred
meters<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:32.689> it's<00:01:33.689> pretty<00:01:33.900> simple<00:01:34.200> what<00:01:34.439> I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
meters so it's pretty simple what I'm

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.899 
meters so it's pretty simple what I'm
going<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:36.030> see<00:01:37.610> or<00:01:38.610> look

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
going to get you to do is to see or look

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.810 
going to get you to do is to see or look
at<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> speedo<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.579> actually

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
at the speedo and see what we actually

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:51.469 
at the speedo and see what we actually
get<00:01:41.939> up

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:00.630 

that<00:01:52.479> is<00:01:53.640> quicker<00:01:54.640> then<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.560> amazing<00:02:00.250> over

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
that is quicker then it is amazing over

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.779 
that is quicker then it is amazing over
that<00:02:00.790> distance<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:02.229> gas<00:02:03.210> guess<00:02:04.380> obviously

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
that distance the gas guess obviously

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.559 
that distance the gas guess obviously
birds<00:02:06.789> quicker<00:02:07.119> than<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:08.970> takeoff<00:02:09.970> at<00:02:10.270> the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
birds quicker than that takeoff at the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.780 
birds quicker than that takeoff at the
end<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.869> it<00:02:10.959> yes<00:02:11.140> it<00:02:11.319> runs<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.709> but<00:02:12.400> over<00:02:12.640> that

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
end of it yes it runs in but over that
