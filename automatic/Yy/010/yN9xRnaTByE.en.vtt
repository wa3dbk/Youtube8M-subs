it<00:00:26.380> down<00:00:26.410> a<00:00:26.590> little<00:00:26.830> in<00:00:27.039> storm<00:00:27.340> 3<00:00:27.550> restricting

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.820 
it down a little in storm 3 restricting
our<00:00:28.300> movements<00:00:28.750> more<00:00:28.960> leaving<00:00:29.529> us<00:00:29.650> pretty

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
our movements more leaving us pretty

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.439 
our movements more leaving us pretty
much<00:00:29.920> bare<00:00:30.220> boned<00:00:30.490> now<00:00:30.970> don't<00:00:31.150> get<00:00:31.300> me<00:00:31.420> wrong

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
much bare boned now don't get me wrong

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.030 
much bare boned now don't get me wrong
you<00:00:31.810> can<00:00:31.930> still<00:00:32.080> do<00:00:32.230> that<00:00:32.349> in<00:00:32.470> storm<00:00:32.710> free<00:00:32.890> but

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
you can still do that in storm free but

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.890 
you can still do that in storm free but
not<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.400> extent<00:00:33.699> of<00:00:33.850> how<00:00:34.180> generations<00:00:34.720> was

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
not to the extent of how generations was

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.020 
not to the extent of how generations was
so<00:00:35.440> this<00:00:35.680> time<00:00:35.860> for<00:00:36.100> storm<00:00:36.309> revolution<00:00:36.430> it

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.030 
so this time for storm revolution it

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.360 
so this time for storm revolution it
looks<00:00:37.420> like<00:00:37.629> we're<00:00:37.930> raising<00:00:38.110> the<00:00:38.379> bar<00:00:38.589> of<00:00:38.920> what

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370 
looks like we're raising the bar of what

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.340 
looks like we're raising the bar of what
they<00:00:39.460> had<00:00:39.489> in<00:00:39.640> generations<00:00:40.269> as<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.989> mentioned

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
they had in generations as I mentioned

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.780 
they had in generations as I mentioned
in<00:00:41.440> one<00:00:41.470> of<00:00:41.589> my<00:00:41.710> older<00:00:42.010> news<00:00:42.190> update<00:00:42.489> videos

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
in one of my older news update videos

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.460 
in one of my older news update videos
for<00:00:43.000> Naruto<00:00:43.239> evolution<00:00:43.690> you<00:00:44.140> could<00:00:44.350> do<00:00:44.440> a

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
for Naruto evolution you could do a

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.070 
for Naruto evolution you could do a
ninja<00:00:44.920> move<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.400> cancel<00:00:46.089> that<00:00:46.239> into<00:00:46.720> a<00:00:46.750> normal

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
ninja move and cancel that into a normal

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.530 
ninja move and cancel that into a normal
combo<00:00:47.710> so<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:48.339> made<00:00:48.489> me<00:00:48.610> wonder<00:00:48.790> are<00:00:49.180> they

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
combo so it made me wonder are they

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.479 
combo so it made me wonder are they
trying<00:00:49.839> to<00:00:50.019> bring<00:00:50.260> more<00:00:50.470> cancels<00:00:51.010> into<00:00:51.400> this

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
trying to bring more cancels into this

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.250 
trying to bring more cancels into this
game<00:00:51.790> because<00:00:52.299> I<00:00:52.510> don't<00:00:52.690> think<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:52.960> could<00:00:53.110> ever

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
game because I don't think we could ever

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.170 
game because I don't think we could ever
do<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:53.470> before<00:00:53.710> now<00:00:54.309> back<00:00:54.549> at<00:00:54.670> wondercon

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.399 
in slow motion I noticed that his chakra
depletes<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.509> name<00:01:34.689> of<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.929> jutsu

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
depletes and the name of the jutsu

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.800 
depletes and the name of the jutsu
appears<00:01:36.039> on<00:01:36.249> the<00:01:36.340> screen<00:01:36.429> so<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:37.420> leads<00:01:37.659> me

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
appears on the screen so this leads me

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.840 
appears on the screen so this leads me
to<00:01:38.020> believe<00:01:38.049> that<00:01:38.259> there<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.829> in<00:01:39.130> fact<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.549> due

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
to believe that there is in fact a due

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.760 
to believe that there is in fact a due
to<00:01:40.030> cancel<00:01:40.509> and<00:01:40.719> to<00:01:40.990> back<00:01:41.140> it<00:01:41.259> up<00:01:41.320> even<00:01:41.560> more

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
to cancel and to back it up even more

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.219 
to cancel and to back it up even more
after<00:01:42.009> he<00:01:42.520> did<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.700> cancel<00:01:43.210> more<00:01:43.659> chakra<00:01:43.990> was

after he did to cancel more chakra was

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.929 
after he did to cancel more chakra was
being<00:01:44.439> drained<00:01:44.770> just<00:01:45.340> like<00:01:45.520> what<00:01:45.670> happens

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939

when you use a combo cancel you see that

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.709 
when you use a combo cancel you see that
yellow<00:01:47.890> flesh<00:01:48.189> that's<00:01:48.700> what<00:01:48.880> happened<00:01:49.210> so<00:01:49.479> i'm
