over here the regular black one actually

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.340 
over here the regular black one actually
the<00:01:37.220> original<00:01:37.280> one<00:01:37.640> it<00:01:37.729> came<00:01:37.880> in<00:01:38.060> you<00:01:38.869> can<00:01:39.050> see

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.880 
the original one it came in you can see
that<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.890> is<00:01:40.600> like<00:01:41.600> a<00:01:41.630> whiter<00:01:41.930> almost<00:01:42.680> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
that it is like a whiter almost the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.620 
that it is like a whiter almost the
white<00:01:43.040> one<00:01:43.190> is<00:01:43.340> bigger<00:01:43.580> I<00:01:43.880> don't<00:01:44.360> know<00:01:44.450> why<00:01:44.600> I

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
white one is bigger I don't know why I

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.999 
white one is bigger I don't know why I
guess<00:01:44.869> it's<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.110> it's<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:45.470> British<00:01:45.800> me

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009

or something anyway I think we can get
it<00:01:49.460> up<00:01:49.580> already<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.979> we<00:01:51.979> have<00:01:52.130> activation<00:01:52.759> I<00:01:53.060> do
