00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
user device stupid I know some people

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.800 
user device stupid I know some people
that<00:01:19.890> are<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.130> their<00:01:20.340> phones<00:01:20.689> 24-7<00:01:21.689> was

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
that are on their phones 24-7 was

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
that are on their phones 24-7 was
constantly<00:01:22.290> like<00:01:22.500> searching<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> web<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
constantly like searching the web and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.940 
constantly like searching the web and
for<00:01:24.150> them<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.479> probably<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.860> effect

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
for them it probably will have an effect

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.359 
for them it probably will have an effect
I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.820> large<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.650> widest<00:01:29.159> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
I think on the large like the widest but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.490 
I think on the large like the widest but
then<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> would<00:01:29.670> say<00:01:29.880> they're<00:01:30.509> like<00:01:30.630> majority

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
then I would say they're like majority

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.530 
then I would say they're like majority
of<00:01:31.530> people<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.700> wouldn't<00:01:32.970> really<00:01:33.119> affect<00:01:33.420> them

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
of people it wouldn't really affect them

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.539 
of people it wouldn't really affect them
too<00:01:33.659> much<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.530> hopefully<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.130> intended

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
too much but hopefully is intended

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
too much but hopefully is intended
because<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.479> life<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.960> much

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
because I would just make life so much

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
because I would just make life so much
