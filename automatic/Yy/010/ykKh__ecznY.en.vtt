00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello guys and welcome to another one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
 video and how they saw in the title as 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.730
 enter the house of lester super easy 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.349
 what then we're going to start with the 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.840
 trick since it's a pretty group 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.059
 simple ok the first thing we need 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 make will come to the house of lester 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.580
 and we will need a motorcycle ok yo 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.980
 I recommend the 801 bat because in my 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.480
 opinion is the motorcycle with greater power and 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.220
 how do you see it we will have to come to 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 this part of the map because this is where 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.539
 is the madras house ok this 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.610
 mention that he has and the truth that is 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 something that is quite beautiful and with this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 trick you can see all your interiors not 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.700
 thing that normally can not be done and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.770
 will have to come to this part that already 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.750
 is the house of the neighbor of madrazo and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.940
 they will have to jump down this ramp and 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.620
 will see that we can jump to the roof that and 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.539
 once they are on the roof what 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.980
 we will have to do as they see it there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 pretty simple there in there like a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 kind of ramp and is the easiest way 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.800
 to go up ok because I've seen that other 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.030
 people climbed one but they had to jump 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 from house to house and I saw it quite 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.260
 difficult and this is the best method ok a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 once they are already right here what 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.650
 we will have to do will be to go to 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.040
 the wooden platforms that are 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.350
 right here behind 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.480
 home and we must let ourselves fall 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.930
 slowly ok once they have done 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.190
 this will see that everything is going pure 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.290
 texture for saying some form because 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.510
 If these crystals kill them, we can 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.400
 go through without any problem ok 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.650
 here as they see it we just throw ourselves 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.750
 and now they have to be careful to 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.600
 that do not fall and in this corner that 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.430
 is also the right thing here we will have 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.470
 say it in some way that crash towards 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.880
 in ok if you want to enter with a 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.680
 friend then let your friend do what he did 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.720
 my friend and how do you see here simply 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.790
 we enter and may already be inside the 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.650
 madras house ok and they go there 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.240
 they will simply fall down so I do not know 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.340
 go right now they will see where I fell 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.810
 and can enter the bedrooms and other 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.150
 things ok as they see it is practically 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.590
 pure texture but I think that this 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.600
 they did more than anything to realize 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.310
 that later there will be some 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.380
 kind of mansion or anything like that 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.940
 and now I'm going to show you another 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.100
 trick that is also around here that 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.869
 a friend taught it to me and now 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.490
 is going to teach ok here how do you see it if you 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.649
 They fall where you simply go there 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.880
 to appear next ok this little trick 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.070
 where men wanted to teach them since 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.170
 I found it funny and it's just back 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.790
 from madrazo's house ok as you can 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.129
 notice is right back in this one 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.750
 I am showing you on the map and here 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.239
 simply what we are going to do will be 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.069
 come to this part with either motorcycles and 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.659
 bike here gives exactly the same and 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.549
 we will simply have to put 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.829
 this part of the house in that little triangle 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.170
 ok here as they see how we will play with 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.420
 something and here we can do anything 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.400
 how to fly go under the map or 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.590
 anything ok it should be noted that if 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.810
 After a while he quoted what will happen 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.959
 is that he's going to come back ok then 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.819
 if they stay long like this or if they 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.680
 are used in parallel that 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.879
 are turned around will be very much 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.620
 time there the truth that is something 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.329
 fun and something to troll friends 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.159
 since your friends will never find you 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.079
 then but they liked the video of 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.519

 liked without saying more than saying goodbye

 goodbye
