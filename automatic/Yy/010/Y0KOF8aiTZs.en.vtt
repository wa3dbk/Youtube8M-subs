00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770 
that'd be a very fair assumption I mean

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
marathon and I think a lot of people

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
marathon and I think a lot of people
especially<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> new<00:01:43.830> information<00:01:44.400> age

especially in the new information age
view<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.540> more<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.900> sprint<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:47.430> mean<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
view it more as a sprint and I mean that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.789 
view it more as a sprint and I mean that
