00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.170

the mists of pandaria bear and an

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.619 
the mists of pandaria bear and an
in-game<00:00:32.320> map<00:00:32.559> now<00:00:33.520> it's<00:00:33.850> pretty<00:00:34.149> obvious<00:00:34.600> that

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
in-game map now it's pretty obvious that

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.419 
in-game map now it's pretty obvious that
this<00:00:34.899> was<00:00:35.079> successful<00:00:35.710> I<00:00:35.890> think<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.280> there

00:00:36.419 --> 00:00:36.429 
this was successful I think that there

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:38.369 
this was successful I think that there
were<00:00:36.550> about<00:00:36.789> million<00:00:37.329> people<00:00:37.870> I<00:00:37.989> think<00:00:38.230> that's

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379 
were about million people I think that's

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:41.309 
were about million people I think that's
a<00:00:38.530> cup<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.859> offer<00:00:39.030> me<00:00:40.030> included<00:00:40.179> but<00:00:40.899> despite

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:41.319 
a cup the offer me included but despite

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.319 
a cup the offer me included but despite
this<00:00:41.589> I<00:00:41.829> don't<00:00:42.159> think<00:00:42.519> blizzard<00:00:42.879> will<00:00:43.179> offer

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
this I don't think blizzard will offer

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.529 
this I don't think blizzard will offer
it<00:00:43.510> to<00:00:43.539> us<00:00:43.749> again<00:00:43.839> this<00:00:44.140> year<00:00:44.199> NT<00:00:45.039> is<00:00:45.190> why<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:46.529 --> 00:00:46.539 
it to us again this year NT is why the

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:49.200 
it to us again this year NT is why the
starters<00:00:47.019> there's<00:00:47.460> absolutely<00:00:48.460> no<00:00:48.699> incentive

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
starters there's absolutely no incentive

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.639 
starters there's absolutely no incentive
for<00:00:49.239> Blizzard<00:00:49.629> to<00:00:49.719> offer<00:00:49.870> as<00:00:50.079> an<00:00:50.199> annual<00:00:50.469> pass

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
for Blizzard to offer as an annual pass

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:52.979 
for Blizzard to offer as an annual pass
this<00:00:50.859> time<00:00:51.069> round<00:00:51.309> one<00:00:52.179> of<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.359> main<00:00:52.569> reasons

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
this time round one of the main reasons

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.750 
this time round one of the main reasons
I<00:00:53.139> believe<00:00:53.319> they<00:00:53.589> even<00:00:53.620> gave<00:00:53.979> a<00:00:54.039> Samuel<00:00:54.549> passed

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
I believe they even gave a Samuel passed

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.610 
I believe they even gave a Samuel passed
last<00:00:54.999> year<00:00:55.210> was<00:00:55.510> because<00:00:55.870> they<00:00:56.109> knew<00:00:56.409> that

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
last year was because they knew that

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.259 
last year was because they knew that
there<00:00:56.769> would<00:00:56.829> be<00:00:56.889> a<00:00:57.010> massive<00:00:57.309> lack<00:00:57.699> of<00:00:57.819> content

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269 
there would be a massive lack of content

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:00.629 
there would be a massive lack of content
I<00:00:58.510> think<00:00:59.260> like<00:00:59.499> most<00:00:59.829> people<00:01:00.280> we<00:01:00.370> didn't

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:00.639 
I think like most people we didn't

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:02.039 
I think like most people we didn't
realize<00:01:01.030> there<00:01:01.269> was<00:01:01.389> going<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.690> be<00:01:01.749> about<00:01:01.870> 10

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
realize there was going to be about 10

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.110 
realize there was going to be about 10
months<00:01:02.649> between<00:01:03.010> dragon<00:01:03.699> solar<00:01:03.879> mists<00:01:04.089> of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
months between dragon solar mists of

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.390 
months between dragon solar mists of
pandaria<00:01:04.269> which<00:01:04.960> and<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.799> was<00:01:05.920> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.340> be

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:06.400 
pandaria which and I was going to be

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.609 
pandaria which and I was going to be
shorter<00:01:06.760> than<00:01:06.790> I<00:01:06.970> sconset<00:01:07.450> out<00:01:07.630> but<00:01:08.020> at<00:01:08.409> least

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
shorter than I sconset out but at least

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.580 
shorter than I sconset out but at least
with<00:01:09.159> that<00:01:09.399> we<00:01:09.640> had<00:01:09.820> ruby<00:01:10.539> sanctum<00:01:10.780> as<00:01:11.049> well<00:01:11.289> as

with that we had ruby sanctum as well as

with that we had ruby sanctum as well as
icecrown<00:01:12.430> citadel<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:13.060> i<00:01:13.920> personally<00:01:14.920> found

that last patch too much more

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.709 
that last patch too much more

likely already planning to buy the
expansion<00:02:36.580> anyway<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.569> why<00:02:37.900> would<00:02:38.140> they<00:02:38.290> give

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
expansion anyway so why would they give

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.070 
expansion anyway so why would they give
it<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.769> us<00:02:38.920> for<00:02:38.950> free<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:39.700> we've<00:02:40.510> already<00:02:40.720> seen

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
it to us for free and we've already seen

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.809 
it to us for free and we've already seen
the<00:02:41.260> prices<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.830> it's<00:02:41.950> currently<00:02:42.730> available

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
the prices and it's currently available

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.020 
the prices and it's currently available
to<00:02:43.450> purchase<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.950> highly<00:02:45.340> unlikely<00:02:45.670> that

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
to purchase so it's highly unlikely that

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.509 
to purchase so it's highly unlikely that
mr.<00:02:46.420> Pandaria<00:02:46.989> would<00:02:47.230> be<00:02:47.410> if<00:02:47.769> they<00:02:47.950> did<00:02:48.190> decide

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
mr. Pandaria would be if they did decide

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.780 
mr. Pandaria would be if they did decide

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
to give is it and lastly there's no

extra financial incentive for Blizzard
to<00:02:54.310> do<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.670> I'm<00:02:55.299> willing<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.810> bet<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.200> there

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
to do it I'm willing to bet that there

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.699 
to do it I'm willing to bet that there
were<00:02:56.829> a<00:02:56.890> lot<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.489> players<00:02:58.269> with<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:59.109> included

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
were a lot of players with me included

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.740 
were a lot of players with me included
that<00:03:00.220> took<00:03:00.579> up<00:03:00.760> Daniel<00:03:01.120> past<00:03:01.420> that<00:03:01.630> had

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
that took up Daniel past that had

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.990 
that took up Daniel past that had
absolutely<00:03:02.410> no<00:03:02.650> intention<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.220> buying<00:03:03.430> diablo

absolutely no intention of buying diablo
3<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.510> thought<00:03:05.319> it<00:03:05.530> looked<00:03:05.560> interesting<00:03:05.950> but

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
3 I thought it looked interesting but

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.240 
3 I thought it looked interesting but
I've<00:03:07.120> never<00:03:07.540> played<00:03:07.900> any<00:03:08.290> of<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> Diablo<00:03:09.040> game

I've never played any of the Diablo game

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.970 
I've never played any of the Diablo game
so<00:03:09.430> far<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:09.880> I<00:03:10.420> wasn't<00:03:10.840> willing<00:03:11.079> to<00:03:11.590> commit<00:03:11.920> to

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
so far and I wasn't willing to commit to

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.789 
so far and I wasn't willing to commit to
a<00:03:12.100> game<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.760> wasn't<00:03:13.000> too<00:03:13.269> sure<00:03:13.299> about<00:03:13.799> when

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
a game that I wasn't too sure about when

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.590 
a game that I wasn't too sure about when
they<00:03:15.040> announced<00:03:15.609> Daniel<00:03:15.910> pass<00:03:16.180> i<00:03:16.359> thought

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
they announced Daniel pass i thought

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.059 
they announced Daniel pass i thought

their new real money auction house this
is<00:03:41.470> one<00:03:41.620> of<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.739> main<00:03:41.950> reasons<00:03:42.430> i<00:03:42.549> think<00:03:42.790> they

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
is one of the main reasons i think they

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.460 
is one of the main reasons i think they
even<00:03:43.060> introduced<00:03:43.780> down<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.139> hall<00:03:44.260> pass

even introduced down the hall pass

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.920 
even introduced down the hall pass
anywhere<00:03:44.950> because<00:03:45.700> then<00:03:46.269> you<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.780> they

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
anywhere because then you that they

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.569 
anywhere because then you that they
could<00:03:47.139> potentially<00:03:47.680> be<00:03:47.799> making<00:03:48.100> a<00:03:48.160> crap<00:03:48.549> ton

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
could potentially be making a crap ton

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.190 
could potentially be making a crap ton
of<00:03:48.940> money<00:03:49.120> off<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.750> real<00:03:49.900> money<00:03:50.139> auction

myself i know people who have made up to
a<00:04:00.459> thousand<00:04:00.970> pounds<00:04:01.120> selling<00:04:01.840> things<00:04:02.019> on

there and with a 15-percent cook pulse

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.930 
there and with a 15-percent cook pulse
the<00:04:05.380> listing<00:04:05.829> fee<00:04:06.070> they

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
the listing fee they

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.780 
the listing fee they
definitely<00:04:07.450> had<00:04:07.600> the<00:04:07.750> right<00:04:07.960> idea<00:04:07.990> for<00:04:08.560> that

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
definitely had the right idea for that

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.670 
definitely had the right idea for that
so<00:04:09.790> with<00:04:10.150> all<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.360> these<00:04:10.660> reasons<00:04:10.720> combined

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
so with all of these reasons combined

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.040 
so with all of these reasons combined
even<00:04:12.310> though<00:04:12.460> I<00:04:12.490> would<00:04:12.790> love<00:04:13.060> to<00:04:13.420> see<00:04:13.690> them<00:04:13.870> do

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
even though I would love to see them do

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.259 
even though I would love to see them do
it<00:04:14.170> again<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:14.620> year<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.880> don't<00:04:16.060> see<00:04:16.239> how

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
it again this year I just don't see how

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.640 
it again this year I just don't see how
it<00:04:16.480> would<00:04:16.540> make<00:04:16.810> sense<00:04:16.900> from<00:04:17.290> Liz's

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
it would make sense from Liz's

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.229 
it would make sense from Liz's
perspective<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.250> give<00:04:18.430> us<00:04:18.610> another<00:04:18.820> annual
