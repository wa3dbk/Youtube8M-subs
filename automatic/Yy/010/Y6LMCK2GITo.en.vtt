all right now since this is a Revoltech
figure<00:02:20.720> well<00:02:21.720> obviously<00:02:22.050> it<00:02:22.620> has<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:24.180> very

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
Revoltech join this entire end piece

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.420 
Revoltech join this entire end piece
actually<00:02:44.340> moves<00:02:45.210> like<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.650> kind<00:02:47.340> of
