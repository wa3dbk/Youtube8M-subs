00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.290
Dear friends welcome once more in one  of our videos

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:28.120
In this one we are going to see something completely different

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.090
It's an idea we've got for a long time ago and we decided to provide to you

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.010
As you can see, we've got here an iPad

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.630
This is the iPad and a special stand, so we can face it directly

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.160
This one is the stand. As you can see we can flip it etc.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.280
It can hold if from 3 points and it's very usefull.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.140
On the screen you can see the Xbox 360 menu

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.770
I've decided to play my Xbox 360 games and here is my controller too.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.820
I'm moving around the home screen and try to use the 360 interface.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.200
Don't worry, it's not any type of hack, it's something as simple as it gets.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.110
It's a method we will show you later on this  video, but it's funny.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:27.570
Just to take a look first of how is the feeling of playing Xbox 360 games on iPad.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.470
Just left the game I played, and now we are waiting FIFA Street to load

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:42.110
We've loaded the game to Xbox 360 on the console drive

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:53.130
It's 3 metres away from the iPad and now I am going to show you how it works

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.700
using also the Xbox 360 controller

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.970
Let's put the volume down, because it's too loud

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.000
Everything is running on Xbox 360, but  we are just using the iPad screen for display.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:22.020
we have a wireless connection and we play through our PC, because ths is the only way.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.430
You can take the iPad and go wherever you want for your game session.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.660
You can play on your iPad, without worries about the distance from Xbox 360.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.720
The touch screen is deactivated for this tip

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:48.640
The iPad is used only for display purpose so we put it back on the stand

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:58.090
Once more we have to say, it's not any type of hack

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.980
Let's play FIFA Street for a while, we'll show you later what we've done

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.270
so you can do it yourself during this period of summer.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:19.730
It's a usefull method to use while at home and it's better if the Xbox 360

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.500
is connected to a TV, while someone else is watching a show.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.890
You can use this method to avoid any problem and play from your couch

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.730
your favorite video game without each one interrupting the other.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.010
As you can see, I got the controller and I'm playing, while it's connected

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.820
to the Xbox 360, not with the iPad.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:52.490
Xbox 360 has the game on it's tray and we are just  ready to play.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.650
As you can see, there's no lag on every button press on the controller.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.620
I'm playing FIFA Street, but you can use any game you want

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.130
and of course you can use also any other game console you have at home

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:24.330
for example you can also use your PS3 or your Wii.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:40.210
Not that the game seems not to be interesting, let's take a look at the method.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.470
I'll first of all open the monitor that's connected to our PC

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:50.850
and you will notice that we have the same display result we saw on the iPad

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.080
on both our displays you can take a look at the FIFA Street video game.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:07.520
The LG monitor behind is connected to our gaming PC

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.170
and through the capture card we use for the video reviews on Enternity.gr

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.830
to the Xbox 360 so we can get the HD images and video flow.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:32.990
Meanwhile we've used a software, which lets the iPad

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.060
work as a wireless connected monitor for the PC.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.810
So, if you go there on the lower section  of the iPad screen you can see the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.760
iPad keyboard and wherever I touch the screen you can see the mouse cursor

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.140
cause the software allows us this type of emulation through the AverMedia

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:05.440
server 3D. This is the software we use for the video capture procedure.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.360
It's an interesting method, mainly because it's very simple to use

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:22.860
and can help anyone who doesn't want to play on a TV screen

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:30.120
but prefers to enjoy PS3/Xbox 360 etc games on it's iPad screen.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.120
So, to achieve all this you need an HD capture card

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:39.140
which has HDMI or Component input. Xbox 360 can be connected through

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.160
HDMI. PS3 must be connected through component

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.880
and we also need an iPad or any Android tablet (the app is also available on these).

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:57.270
I'll stop the stream so I can show you the app

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:05.020
which is called on iPad SplashTop HD and this is how it looks like.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:12.360
It works as a wireless display for our PC so you can use it to stream

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:16.850
whatever you want throug the wireless network you have.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:23.160
On the software you use both the IPs so it can connect the devices wireless

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:36.390
and display the same image/videos on both and this is how you can have

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.580
your Xbox 360/PS3 games on your iPad/tablet screen.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:47.740
As I've told you from the beginning it's not a hack, it's just a trick

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.100
and it's funny and easy to achieve.
