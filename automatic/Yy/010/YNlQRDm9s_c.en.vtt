 to braid a fishtail braid 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.630
 divide the hair into 2 parts 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:18.960
 and we will add each of the parts 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 thin strands from the opposite side 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.390
 we 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.390
 on right 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.170
 left 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.110
 so that the spit tried to press more than once 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:56.980
 thumb weaving head 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.970
 and add strands between the index and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.970
 middle finger 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.970
 on the right added strand 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.450
 do not forget weaving head press 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.450
 left strand 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.420
 right 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.600
 to make the spit more accurate 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.720
 try to separate strands of the same 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.720
 thickness 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.390
 right strand 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.390
 added it in weaving 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.390
 left 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.270
 we press weave to neck 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:36.470
 again right 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.700
 left again 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.640
 and so we continue to weave along the entire length 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.909
 hair 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.909
 right strand 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.120
 left 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.830
 and finish weaving fasten 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.190
 pigtail rubber band to spit more 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:18.000
 volumetric pull out a little strands 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.000
 plexus 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.810
 next time i will show you how to weave 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.810
