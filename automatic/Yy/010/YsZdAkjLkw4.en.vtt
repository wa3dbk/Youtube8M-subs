I<00:02:20.420> couldn't<00:02:21.420> confirm<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.989> from<00:02:22.139> their

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
I couldn't confirm that from their

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.979 
I couldn't confirm that from their
website<00:02:22.799> but<00:02:23.159> that's<00:02:23.849> what<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.540> been<00:02:24.780> told

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
website but that's what I have been told

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.739 
website but that's what I have been told
in<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> past<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:26.549> that's<00:02:26.730> kind<00:02:26.969> of<00:02:26.999> nice<00:02:27.180> I

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749 
in the past so that's kind of nice I

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:30.559 
in the past so that's kind of nice I
mean<00:02:28.739> either<00:02:28.950> way<00:02:29.219> you<00:02:29.280> need<00:02:29.549> to<00:02:29.579> sterilize

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
mean either way you need to sterilize

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.839 
mean either way you need to sterilize
your<00:02:30.750> plants<00:02:31.200> before<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.769> put<00:02:31.950> them<00:02:32.069> in<00:02:32.129> an

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
your plants before you put them in an

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.280 
your plants before you put them in an
aquarium<00:02:33.120> no<00:02:33.420> matter<00:02:33.599> where<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.989> get<00:02:34.139> them

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
aquarium no matter where you get them

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.539 
aquarium no matter where you get them
from<00:02:34.500> it's<00:02:34.709> always<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> good<00:02:35.250> idea<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
from it's always a good idea to

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.069 
from it's always a good idea to
sterilize<00:02:36.120> them<00:02:36.359> first<00:02:36.569> because<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.930> just

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
sterilize them first because you just

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.770 
sterilize them first because you just
never<00:02:37.290> know<00:02:37.700> what<00:02:38.700> plants<00:02:39.090> can<00:02:39.269> bring<00:02:39.510> into

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
never know what plants can bring into

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.239 
never know what plants can bring into
your<00:02:39.810> aquarium<00:02:41.659> but<00:02:42.739> anyway<00:02:43.739> so<00:02:43.799> I've<00:02:44.069> had

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.249 
your aquarium but anyway so I've had

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:46.190 
your aquarium but anyway so I've had
really<00:02:44.639> great<00:02:44.969> experiences<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.870> them<00:02:46.049> they

actually think I ordered two of them to

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.740 
actually think I ordered two of them to
start<00:03:02.280> with<00:03:02.400> and<00:03:02.639> they've<00:03:02.730> just<00:03:02.760> taken<00:03:03.449> off<00:03:03.599> I

start with and they've just taken off I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.899 
start with and they've just taken off I

checking they may have had it up at some

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.090 
checking they may have had it up at some
point<00:05:28.960> maybe<00:05:29.110> I<00:05:29.230> just<00:05:29.470> didn't<00:05:29.710> see<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:29.890> and

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.390 

Christmas<00:05:54.280> mas<00:05:54.490> was<00:05:54.729> $4.99<00:05:55.389> each<00:05:56.009> so<00:05:57.009> this<00:05:57.220> is

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
Christmas mas was $4.99 each so this is

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.170 
Christmas mas was $4.99 each so this is
two<00:05:57.610> orders<00:05:58.060> there<00:05:59.669> you<00:06:00.669> can<00:06:00.789> see<00:06:00.970> it's<00:06:01.120> a

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
two orders there you can see it's a

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.649 
two orders there you can see it's a
pretty<00:06:01.300> decent<00:06:01.599> amount<00:06:03.210> especially<00:06:04.210> for

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
pretty decent amount especially for

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:06.330

Christmas<00:06:05.020> moss<00:06:05.199> which<00:06:05.470> tends<00:06:05.740> to<00:06:05.860> be<00:06:05.949> kind<00:06:06.250> of

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
Christmas moss which tends to be kind of

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:14.640 
Christmas moss which tends to be kind of
rare<00:06:08.789> and<00:06:09.789> it's<00:06:10.060> in<00:06:10.240> good<00:06:10.569> condition<00:06:11.729> and<00:06:13.620> so<00:06:14.620> I

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
rare and it's in good condition and so I

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.260 
rare and it's in good condition and so I
ordered<00:06:15.039> this<00:06:15.220> separately<00:06:15.639> after<00:06:15.879> I<00:06:16.060> had
