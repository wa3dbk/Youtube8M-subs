three in the path to the 11 we might

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
also take away a jump shot possibility

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.680 
also take away a jump shot possibility
in<00:00:59.250> case<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.670> don't<00:00:59.760> leave<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.090> cue<00:01:00.239> ball<00:01:00.420> very

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
in case we don't leave the cue ball very

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:09.560 
in case we don't leave the cue ball very
close<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.109> our<00:01:01.140> blockers<00:01:02.149> here's<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.329> shot

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.930 

with<00:01:10.440> more<00:01:10.680> speed<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.340> could<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.610> really

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
with more speed we could have really

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.640 
with more speed we could have really
tied<00:01:12.120> up<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> cue<00:01:12.510> ball<00:01:12.690> but<00:01:13.050> this<00:01:13.170> safety<00:01:13.500> was

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
tied up the cue ball but this safety was

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.810 
tied up the cue ball but this safety was
still<00:01:13.830> effective

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
still effective

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.910 
still effective
here's<00:01:16.630> an<00:01:16.780> example<00:01:16.870> where<00:01:17.320> we<00:01:17.380> have<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.590> choice

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
here's an example where we have a choice

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.770 
here's an example where we have a choice
in<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.340> direction<00:01:18.610> we<00:01:18.880> head<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.330> hide<00:01:19.480> the<00:01:19.630> cue

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
in the direction we head to hide the cue

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.960 
in the direction we head to hide the cue
ball<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.650> could<00:01:20.890> go<00:01:21.010> off<00:01:21.130> the<00:01:21.340> far<00:01:21.550> side<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.820> the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
ball we could go off the far side of the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.440 
ball we could go off the far side of the
one<00:01:22.150> and<00:01:22.390> head<00:01:22.720> across<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.110> hiding<00:01:23.650> area<00:01:24.450> here

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
one and head across the hiding area here

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:32.500 
one and head across the hiding area here
is<00:01:25.540> that<00:01:25.690> option

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.780 

that<00:01:33.110> actually<00:01:33.500> worked<00:01:33.950> partly<00:01:34.370> because<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
that actually worked partly because the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.550 
that actually worked partly because the
hiding<00:01:35.060> area<00:01:35.360> is<00:01:35.510> fairly<00:01:35.810> large<00:01:36.110> with<00:01:36.440> the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
hiding area is fairly large with the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.610 
hiding area is fairly large with the
shot<00:01:37.510> however<00:01:38.510> if<00:01:38.780> we<00:01:38.960> want<00:01:39.080> just<00:01:39.320> a<00:01:39.410> touch

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
shot however if we want just a touch

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.650 
shot however if we want just a touch
longer<00:01:39.950> or<00:01:40.280> came<00:01:40.520> up<00:01:40.700> short<00:01:40.910> we<00:01:41.390> would<00:01:41.540> give

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
longer or came up short we would give

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.800 
longer or came up short we would give
our<00:01:41.690> opponent<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.260> look<00:01:42.500> at<00:01:42.650> the<00:01:42.770> 11<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.810> much

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
our opponent a look at the 11 a much

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.540 
our opponent a look at the 11 a much
better<00:01:44.990> option<00:01:45.290> here<00:01:45.740> is<00:01:45.920> to<00:01:46.160> go<00:01:46.250> off<00:01:46.400> the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
better option here is to go off the

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.370 
better option here is to go off the
other<00:01:46.700> side<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.180> one<00:01:47.360> and<00:01:47.570> come<00:01:47.870> more<00:01:48.110> into

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
other side of the one and come more into

the line of the hiding area this will

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:52.240 
the line of the hiding area this will
give<00:01:50.630> us<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.840> much<00:01:51.050> larger<00:01:51.500> margin<00:01:51.770> for<00:01:52.040> error

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
give us a much larger margin for error

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:01.390 
give us a much larger margin for error
with<00:01:52.520> speed<00:01:53.350> here's<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:54.530> shot
