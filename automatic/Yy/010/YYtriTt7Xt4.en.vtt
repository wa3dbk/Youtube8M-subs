all

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.300 
all
once<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.180> that's<00:02:13.780> how<00:02:14.019> you<00:02:14.079> get<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.500> fuel<00:02:14.769> EXO

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
once and that's how you get the fuel EXO

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.500 
once and that's how you get the fuel EXO
now<00:02:15.909> it<00:02:16.329> this<00:02:16.840> took<00:02:17.379> me<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:18.150> started<00:02:19.150> doing<00:02:19.420> this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
now it this took me I started doing this

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.309 
now it this took me I started doing this
probably<00:02:19.780> on<00:02:20.290> October<00:02:21.010> 6<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.730> believe<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.989> it

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
probably on October 6 I believe and it

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.849 
probably on October 6 I believe and it
took<00:02:23.530> me<00:02:23.709> around<00:02:24.209> like<00:02:25.209> a<00:02:25.269> month<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.409> do<00:02:26.620> this

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
took me around like a month to do this

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:30.839 
took me around like a month to do this
so<00:02:27.609> it<00:02:27.969> definitely<00:02:28.480> was<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.319> easy<00:02:29.709> and<00:02:30.250> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
so it definitely was not easy and the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.000 
so it definitely was not easy and the
reason<00:02:31.180> why<00:02:31.299> I<00:02:31.329> did<00:02:31.659> this<00:02:31.810> is<00:02:32.079> because<00:02:32.109> I<00:02:32.469> like

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
reason why I did this is because I like

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.599 
reason why I did this is because I like
to<00:02:33.250> be<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:34.209> one<00:02:34.569> guy<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:35.079> has<00:02:35.319> the<00:02:35.799> unique
