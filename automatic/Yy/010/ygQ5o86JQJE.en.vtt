notice is we put a panel in here which
we<00:05:44.490> put<00:05:45.140> tension<00:05:46.140> bars<00:05:46.530> across<00:05:47.430> here<00:05:47.670> which<00:05:48.030> is

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
we put tension bars across here which is

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.860 
we put tension bars across here which is
velcro<00:05:48.600> in<00:05:48.750> place<00:05:49.700> what<00:05:50.700> this<00:05:50.850> does<00:05:51.090> it<00:05:51.600> keeps

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
velcro in place what this does it keeps

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.230 
velcro in place what this does it keeps
the<00:05:51.990> actual<00:05:52.290> sling<00:05:52.560> open<00:05:53.370> so<00:05:54.030> you<00:05:54.090> can

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
the actual sling open so you can

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.970 
the actual sling open so you can
actually<00:05:54.360> see<00:05:54.630> what<00:05:55.230> that<00:05:55.350> does<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.770> will

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:55.980 
actually see what that does that will

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.610 
actually see what that does that will
float<00:05:56.160> on<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.460> surface<00:05:56.490> and<00:05:57.120> it<00:05:58.110> stops<00:05:58.410> all

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
float on the surface and it stops all

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.170 
float on the surface and it stops all
the<00:05:58.740> actual<00:05:58.980> material<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.580> over<00:05:59.910> the<00:06:00.000> fish

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
the actual material going over the fish

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.280 
the actual material going over the fish
now<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.390> fish<00:06:00.570> can<00:06:00.720> move<00:06:00.870> backwards<00:06:01.230> and

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
now the fish can move backwards and

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.490 
now the fish can move backwards and
