00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.519
 fibromyalgia 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.890
 this time is fashionable if it is a 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.289
 facilitating processes that trigger 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.840
 pain decreasing tolerance threshold 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.210
 even a light touch a person with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.849
 Fibromyalgia can bring severe pain in the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 many people underestimate the 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.599
 importance of this disease due to the fact 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.790
 does not display labels 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.460
 specific signs such as 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.350
 inflammation to blood tests but it is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.239
 a condition that brings real suffering 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.219
 their carriers 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.040
 its beginning happens a time of life 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.500
 generally between 30 and 50 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
 years of age more sex takes place 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.570
 being the most common cause of pain 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.449
 in widespread musculoskeletal 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.000
 women between the ages of 20 and 55 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.399
 epidemiological studies also show that 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.410
 an increased risk of up to eight times 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.989
 develop the disease in family members of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 carriers showing a possible pre- 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.530
 genetic arrangement 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.659
 the first step to mistrust 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.060
 same is the appearance of a 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.850
 pain in the whole body involving the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.470
 tendons muscles and joints that do not 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 can be justified by other 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.070
 diseases 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.450
 when one examines the painful places 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.220
 no abnormality is found 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.990
 beyond pain 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.820
 this leads to the hypothesis that the cause 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.950
 is in the neurological system 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.020
 the sleep disorder also a complaint 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.840
 very frequent the patient sleeps 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.840
 tired you wake up several times during the 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.329
 night and the body does not reach the states 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.979
 deep relaxation and 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.720
 consequently upon waking sensation 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 that the tiredness is much worse than 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.460
 when he tried many of the patients 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.619
 symptoms as well. 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 Clinical record headaches and 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.700
 irritable bowel syndrome 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.040
 the incidence of depression or anxiety 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.280
 among these patients is very high 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.860
 reaching 60 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.740
 the center in some studies classically 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.659
 to make the diagnosis of fibromyalgia 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.670
 the physician searched among patients with 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.200
 diffuse pain the presence of dots 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.880
 painful tendons or tendons that are 18 points 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.890
 pre-marked that respond with a lot of pain 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.980
 the pressure with the thumb 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.959
 since 2010 , 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.030
 these points is made through the 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.660
 the application of questionnaires assessing 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.120
 extent and severity of symptoms for 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.519
 close the diagnosis of fibromyalgia 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.470
 doctor needs a lot of criteria because 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.410
 there are numerous conditions that can 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 to minimize this diffuse pain 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.989
 autoimmune diseases endocrine diseases 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.610
 for example what I had and gizmo 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.790
 vitamin D deficiency diseases 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.170
 neurological disorders 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.780
 margin depression and also diseases 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.450
 infectious diseases such as hepatitis c 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.980
 treatment is recommended. 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.680
 an association of analgesics 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.110
 antidepressants and low mastics that are 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.180
 prescribed not for depression but because 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.810
 they have the property of tiller a 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.920
 sensitivity to painful stimuli 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.200
 Note that the anti 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.030
 inflammatory with whip or siblings 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.430
 pressures do not work in this disease 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.720
 because in it there is no information has been 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.670
 target to be beaten 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.739
 I would like to point out that 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.090
 medications help a lot but are just 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.799
 a trampoline 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.350
 this disease is impossible to be 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.630
 if there is no 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.430
 paradigm before the allied lifetime 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.470
 behavior change 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.650
 regular physical exercise 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.959
 is very important but it is necessary to 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.780
 increase the theoretical position and this 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:40.329
 gets through hiking race swimming 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.150
 cycling therapies to reduce 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.739
 stress are also indicated between them 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.930
 stresses cognitive therapy 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.269
 behavioral problem that tries through 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.160
 clearly defined technical strengthen 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.620
 brain connections that are relevant 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.489
 to decrease the moon and improve the 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.160
 welfare 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.930
 some patients benefit greatly from 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.480
 meditation that I believe to be fundamental 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.549
 for self-knowledge 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.740
 but internally I do not believe there is 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.680
 any possibility 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.990
 healing that does not pass through high forgiveness is 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.230
 important to close your eyes every day 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.880
 and wish the same command to go out 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.850
 thought any excess of 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.670
 self-criticism any mobility without there 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.700
 any negative thinking feeling 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.840
 negative or negative actions aimed at 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.270
 yourself 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.280
 I hope you have enjoyed leaving a 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.320
 here below about what you 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.070
 Did you find the story? 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.070
 thank you very much
