00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.090
 from the geek world he hears the geek zone in 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.090
 30 30 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.060

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.750
 the people 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.330
 on this Tuesday afternoon we want 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.680
 offer you the geek zone 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.660
 on this day diego fernando can not 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.790
 be with us because it is for the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.650
 north of Spain installing antennas for 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.230
 that people can enjoy rkm 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.470
 radio and in this afternoon we already have the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.470
 space 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.519
 This is a contribution that we have been sent to 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.260
 facebook.com 30 plus 30 we have a 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:09.020
 environment from burgos that is called 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.450
 carmen she listens to the program always 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.310
 that can be an older person but 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.470
 he really likes how the focus is 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.870
 program likes spaces and you 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.810
 cats really like 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.240
 and a study has sent us this news 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.830
 confirm what everyone suspected 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.830
 cats do not pay attention to us 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.530
 anyone who has had dogs and 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.150
 cats can confirm that unless 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.100
 there is a promise of food in between 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.080
 cats do not do the same thing as 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.000
 dogs when they are called though this 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.280
 it seems already quite evident two 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.780
 Japanese researchers have decided 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.480
 delve into the part of the 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.250
 psychological in this case for 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.080
 determine if the cats are not 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.120
 able to recognize our voice or 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.120
 it's just that it does not do it in my case 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.469
 if I have to say the names mother of mine 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:07.600
 atsuko saito and casita casinos uca de la 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.340
 Tokyo University have carried out 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.379
 an experiment to try to analyze 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.390
 the capacity for verbal recognition of 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.099
 cats just results 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.340
 be published in the animal magazine 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.420
 cognition in a study entitled 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.379
 recognition of owners voice 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.379
 of domestic cats 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.750
 basically the study has consisted of 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.840
 rea in analyzing the behavior of 20 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.400
 cats 19 domestic and 1 street 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 hear different voices of beings 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.030
 humans calling them by name the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.890
 good news is that cats if they are 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.690
 able to distinguish the voices of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.300
 people with whom they live in 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.040
 in opposition to the des of strangers 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.190
 of the same age or sex do what 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190
 contrary 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:55.450
 the bad news is that although they do 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.430
 signs of greater recognition to 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.110
 Pussies simply do not care 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430
 call them and do not go to the 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.250
 call or respond as they do 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.780
 dogs according to saito and if not his k this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.329
 behavior can be due cei and 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.069
 simply to the fact that cats 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:12.129
 they have been domesticated for less time 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:14.200
 actively 9500 years versus 15 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.659
 thousand years of the dogs well this what 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.600
 It is or what scientists say these 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.610
 Japanese 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.610
 jump and if not your k 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.640
 the researchers also suggest that 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.230
 it's been the cats themselves that 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.850
 historically they have approached the 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.740
 human beings and these have affected 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.020
 willingly their presence for their work in 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.000
 the control of domestic pests ie 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.340
 If you have rats in your house you catch a 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.340
 cat and kill them for example 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.630
 despite this lack of response 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.459
 communicative on the part of the cats the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.410
 The authors of the study recognize that 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.180
 owners of these animals are so 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.830
 emotionally bound to them as what 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.440
 are the owners of the dogs 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.420
 to start the cats are animals 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.730
 loners not gregarious like dogs 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.080
 therefore it does not have a social structure 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.790
 predetermined that forces them to 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.250
 respond to the other individuals of your 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.250
 group are dominant or are not 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.430
 on the other hand in spite of not being creatures 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.230
 social if they are very adaptable that's why 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.019
 can assume social dynamics and 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:22.120
 it is an advantage for both a cat 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.430
 responds or not according to your mood and also 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.830
 the circumstances if you are wanting to 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.570
 socialize and call him is going to get closer if 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.670
 is not in a good mood because it will happen 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.980
 If you feel like interacting with your 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.380
 masters will approach without being called and 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.080
 if you are treated great but if you are not 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:42.060
 ignoring it will insist until you drop, 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.060
 will continue with his things as if nothing 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.610
 in summary all we have had 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.870
 cats and dogs we know that judged a 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.610
 cat comparing them as a 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.530
 behavior is gregarious like those of 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.330
 a dog is a mistake every cat is a 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.880
 world has all its own personality 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.860
 some are more sociable and others more 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.270
 is independent are customizable 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.490
 they are accustomed to every situation with 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.920
 overwhelming ease and they are emotionally 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.470
 independent and few social but that 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:09.870
 does not mean they are cold or social 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.940
 in fact if the social interaction is 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.430
 fair and egalitarian usually respond 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
 well what does not work is never 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.020
 impose a social role that is the one that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.640
 when it comes to mastering them 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.920
 they will reveal and if they see you submissive you 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:26.690
 they ignore instead respect anyone 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.690
 that treats them like another equal 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:33.210
 they simply have a social dynamic 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.190
 complex and adaptable emotional 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.840
 simplify a cat in terms of 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.330
 he does or does not do when he calls him 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.280
 bullshit to say it in a way this 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.170
 study already fails from the beginning because 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.010
 asks the wrong question to cats 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.260
 they do not work in such simplistic terms 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:51.300
 postscript by the way the Japanese study 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.980
 which is one of the most gregarious cultures 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.630
 of this planet it is evident that he had 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.650
 that result in indifference 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:57.320
 of cats 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:59.640
 the average Japanese sees the world in terms 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.890
 obey or send anything to do with the 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.540
 cat psychology in a more culture 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:07.430
 independent the results would have 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.430
 been totally different 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:17.300
 I 've seen cats that you call them and they pass 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.690
 of you I imagine that it is happening the same 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:25.400
 there are other cats that you see them and call them 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.200
 they look at you they look at one side they look at the other and 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.830
 then it makes them is the typical sound that 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.440
 of 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.330
 and they begin to approach already when you go 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.430
 adapting that goes they go 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.780
 there are others that follow there are others that you 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.000
 approach from behind and start 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.360
 purr from the leg of things as well as 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.360
 the movies 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:50.110
 thank you carmen for attracting this contribution 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:52.389
 to the geek zone this contribution of cats to 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:54.400
 those who have cats at home a study 

00:06:52.389 --> 00:06:56.740
 confirms what was suspected by 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.190
 some cats do not usually do 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.580
 cats 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:02.680
 perhaps there are some that if others do not 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.020
 this is the geek zone in this section 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:07.360
 we put many frikadas and one of them 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.060
 he or cats long ago we talked about the 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:13.050
 dogs today has touched on the minimum 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.050
 The felines
