anything<00:01:27.400> you're<00:01:28.400> not<00:01:28.430> shaking<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.180> say

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
anything you're not shaking so I say

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:44.980 
anything you're not shaking so I say
that<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:31.220> good<00:01:34.690> do<00:01:35.690> just<00:01:35.930> fine<00:01:36.080> here<00:01:36.800> go<00:01:43.990> here

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that that good do just fine here go here

00:01:44.990 --> 00:02:00.800 
that that good do just fine here go here
I<00:01:45.759> guess<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:46.880> do<00:01:46.940> have<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.300> put<00:01:47.450> more<00:01:47.630> over

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:14.990 

I<00:02:01.490> think<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.610> less

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.900 

I<00:02:15.030> think<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.840> flooded<00:02:16.370> Eric<00:02:17.370> we'll<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.730> try

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
I think it's flooded Eric we'll just try

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:34.670 
I think it's flooded Eric we'll just try
more<00:02:18.060> carp<00:02:18.800> start<00:02:19.800> include

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.400 

hmm<00:02:35.680> well<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.610> fired<00:02:36.910> off<00:02:37.120> early<00:02:37.450> here<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.140> try

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
hmm well it fired off early here you try

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.770 
hmm well it fired off early here you try
putting<00:02:38.740> this<00:02:38.890> in<00:02:39.100> there<00:02:39.360> okay<00:02:40.360> we've<00:02:40.600> got<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
putting this in there okay we've got a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.390 
putting this in there okay we've got a
little<00:02:41.020> uh<00:02:42.330> instrument<00:02:43.330> panel<00:02:43.630> hooked<00:02:43.810> up

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
little uh instrument panel hooked up

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.630 
little uh instrument panel hooked up
here<00:02:45.400> because<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.970> oil<00:02:46.510> pressure<00:02:46.840> line<00:02:47.230> was

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
here because the oil pressure line was

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.690 
here because the oil pressure line was
spurting<00:02:48.640> out<00:02:48.880> oil<00:02:48.910> on<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:50.110> ground

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
spurting out oil on the ground

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.760 
spurting out oil on the ground
which<00:02:51.700> isn't<00:02:52.060> usually<00:02:52.570> a<00:02:52.600> good<00:02:52.780> thing<00:02:52.840> okay<00:02:53.590> so

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
which isn't usually a good thing okay so

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.280 
which isn't usually a good thing okay so
now<00:02:54.100> we've<00:02:54.310> kind<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.700> primed<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.840> up<00:02:55.959> here<00:02:56.200> in

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
now we've kind of primed it up here in

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.500 
now we've kind of primed it up here in
hopes<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:57.100> engine<00:02:57.730> will<00:02:57.790> fire<00:02:58.180> because

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
hopes that the engine will fire because

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:31.020 
hopes that the engine will fire because
it's<00:02:58.660> actually<00:02:58.959> sucking<00:02:59.200> gas<00:03:00.420> hit

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.580 

Oh<00:03:32.160> shake<00:03:33.160> it<00:03:33.190> up<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.940> sucking<00:03:34.300> gaseous<00:03:34.900> okay

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
Oh shake it up it's sucking gaseous okay

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.390 
Oh shake it up it's sucking gaseous okay
well<00:03:35.980> keep<00:03:36.550> cranking<00:03:36.910> them<00:03:38.070> what<00:03:39.070> we've<00:03:39.220> got

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
here is we've got smaller redneck gas

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:51.050 
here is we've got smaller redneck gas
tanks<00:03:42.490> so<00:03:42.580> we<00:03:42.700> can<00:03:42.880> hold<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.630> higher

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.820 

that's<00:04:34.810> a<00:04:34.930> gas<00:04:35.110> hog

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
that's a gas hog

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.620 
that's a gas hog
well<00:04:36.250> we<00:04:36.400> got<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.820> start<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.180> little<00:04:37.449> bit

00:05:39.899 --> 00:05:39.909 
what used to throttle backwards like I

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:56.249 
what used to throttle backwards like I
might<00:05:54.209> open<00:05:55.209> the<00:05:55.329> choke<00:05:55.539> this<00:05:55.749> time<00:05:55.959> see<00:05:56.139> what

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259
