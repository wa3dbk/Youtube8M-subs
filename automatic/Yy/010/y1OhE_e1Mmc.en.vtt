00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.589 
Excalibur personally I don't feel like
they<00:04:33.460> need<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.699> really<00:04:33.909> be<00:04:34.000> compared<00:04:34.330> to<00:04:34.389> much

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
they need to really be compared to much

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.300 
they need to really be compared to much
because<00:04:34.719> they<00:04:35.110> aren't<00:04:35.530> really<00:04:36.009> different

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
because they aren't really different

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.429 
because they aren't really different
strategies<00:04:36.789> in<00:04:37.000> certain<00:04:37.780> situations<00:04:37.930> wants

00:04:38.429 --> 00:04:38.439 
strategies in certain situations wants

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.749 
strategies in certain situations wants
better<00:04:38.530> than<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.740> other<00:04:38.889> you<00:04:39.430> know<00:04:39.550> if<00:04:39.639> you
