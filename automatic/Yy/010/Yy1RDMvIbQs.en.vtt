00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.420 
creating impingement and shoulder pain
so<00:05:29.630> it's<00:05:29.780> important<00:05:30.260> to<00:05:30.350> evaluate<00:05:30.560> all<00:05:31.370> of

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
so it's important to evaluate all of

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.840 
so it's important to evaluate all of
these<00:05:31.880> things<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.510> any<00:05:33.610> evaluation<00:05:34.610> of<00:05:34.760> the

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
these things and any evaluation of the

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.960 
these things and any evaluation of the
shoulder<00:05:35.919> includes<00:05:36.919> movement<00:05:37.789> of<00:05:37.880> the

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
shoulder includes movement of the

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:41.110 
shoulder includes movement of the
shoulder<00:05:38.270> blade<00:05:38.479> and<00:05:39.400> overall<00:05:40.400> mobility<00:05:40.789> and

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
shoulder blade and overall mobility and

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.800 
shoulder blade and overall mobility and
balance<00:05:41.600> of<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:41.900> muscles<00:05:42.520> anterior<00:05:43.520> and

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
balance of the muscles anterior and

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.730 
balance of the muscles anterior and
posterior<00:05:46.810> we<00:05:47.810> come<00:05:48.050> back<00:05:48.229> to<00:05:48.410> the<00:05:48.530> CA

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
posterior we come back to the CA

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.490 
posterior we come back to the CA
ligament<00:05:49.250> which<00:05:50.240> I<00:05:50.510> mentioned<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.169> a<00:05:51.200> very

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
ligament which I mentioned is a very

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.879 
ligament which I mentioned is a very
important<00:05:52.099> structure<00:05:52.400> because<00:05:53.389> it<00:05:54.320> completes

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:54.889 
important structure because it completes

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:57.940 
important structure because it completes
the<00:05:55.039> circle<00:05:55.430> and<00:05:55.550> also<00:05:56.030> limits<00:05:56.960> anterior

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
the circle and also limits anterior

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.879 
the circle and also limits anterior
superior<00:05:58.780> migration<00:05:59.780> of<00:05:59.900> the<00:05:59.990> humeral<00:06:00.320> head

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:02.889 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:09.550 

so<00:06:03.889> when<00:06:04.789> we<00:06:04.940> evaluate<00:06:05.770> shoulder<00:06:06.770> pain<00:06:07.010> or<00:06:08.560> see

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:09.560 
so when we evaluate shoulder pain or see

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.820 
so when we evaluate shoulder pain or see
ossification<00:06:10.190> of<00:06:10.610> the<00:06:10.910> CA<00:06:11.090> ligament<00:06:11.830> we

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:12.830 
ossification of the CA ligament we

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.879 
ossification of the CA ligament we
really<00:06:13.130> have<00:06:13.250> to<00:06:13.400> ask<00:06:14.020> why<00:06:15.020> is<00:06:15.080> the<00:06:15.560> humeral

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
really have to ask why is the humeral

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.430 
really have to ask why is the humeral
head<00:06:16.099> moving<00:06:16.520> abnormally<00:06:17.300> what's<00:06:18.139> causing

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
head moving abnormally what's causing

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.370 
head moving abnormally what's causing
weakness<00:06:19.039> of<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.310> rotator<00:06:19.669> cuff<00:06:19.789> is<00:06:20.200> there<00:06:21.200> a

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
weakness of the rotator cuff is there a

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.440 
weakness of the rotator cuff is there a
cult<00:06:21.710> instability<00:06:22.400> is<00:06:22.580> there<00:06:23.150> a<00:06:23.180> nerve

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
cult instability is there a nerve

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.839 
cult instability is there a nerve
problem<00:06:23.479> is<00:06:24.169> there<00:06:24.650> a<00:06:24.680> rotator<00:06:25.070> cuff<00:06:25.160> tear<00:06:25.610> is

00:06:25.839 --> 00:06:25.849 
problem is there a rotator cuff tear is

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.710 
problem is there a rotator cuff tear is
there<00:06:26.599> a<00:06:26.630> labrum<00:06:27.080> tear<00:06:28.389> persistent<00:06:29.389> shoulder

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
there a labrum tear persistent shoulder

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.170 
there a labrum tear persistent shoulder
pain<00:06:29.960> especially<00:06:30.650> after<00:06:31.220> previously<00:06:31.970> failed

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
pain especially after previously failed

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.500 
pain especially after previously failed
shoulder<00:06:32.690> surgery<00:06:33.139> requires<00:06:33.979> a<00:06:34.510> thoughtful
