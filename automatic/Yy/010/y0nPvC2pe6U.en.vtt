00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.419
 we started timidly making some 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 Marquitos for paintings from the year 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.849
 2008 2009 we started with therapy people 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.520
 Occupational that works in the hospital 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.070
 as a department to perform 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.489
 work in carpentry then here the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.660
 workshop was formed by carpenter 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 pens illustrator operator 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.740
 workshop that can be internal to the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.440
 hospital that is in its process 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.890
 outpatient recovery and cure me 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.890
 I am a vocal 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.070
 eyes without chemicals we do not always have 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.350
 the privilege of power 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.920
 uncertain people 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.960
 after the hospital the footprint is something 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.820
 that as it is doing with 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.590
 greater depth is already marked in the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.450
 path where to follow there are things 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.790
 thrown in the street in the corners 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.189
 we all come with something that we see that 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.540
 it serves us for ourselves in the 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.270
 hospital things that are going to throw away 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.220
 we repair the part that are broken and 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 after that, in a group we decided how 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.520
 do for example in this case it is said 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.159
 make a thousand drinks and a painting but 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.530
 we had processes set armed the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.960
 disk 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.960
 painting and finally a tango color 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:54.000
 thinking from 18 to 4 lucas it seemed very 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:57.350
 very clear but clear but with a 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.350
 Upholstery there is a price 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:05.900
 in store and the assembly we chatted about 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.860
 issues as the whole sale is formed 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.630
 once a week we make the assembly 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 what do they have to do with interests 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.460
 generals that summon us all to 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.070
 continue together we were also endowing 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.320
 to lower the schedule on Saturdays as 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.740
 so that it is open to the public has 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.740
 machinery 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:32.440
 if what happens is that it happens through 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:36.060
 mind to think that it can be useful for the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.060
 space for all that is beneficial 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.090
 talking about the trip 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.090
 well, it would really look like you 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.350
 our lion formed as a cooperative 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:08.100
 we work among all the work 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:12.390
 of all the end of months together with 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.400
 all operatives do not want to go through 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.090
 on top of the other but help more each other 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:21.240
 same but not in the first place I think 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.000
 that you have to name the hospital on 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:27.180
 hospital embroiders because the hospital 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.970
 gave all this space in the sun is a 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.150
 Italian government entity granted 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.370
 training scholarships we had talks 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.990
 about operating cooperatives that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.170
 it has to do with mental health of the 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.880
 university of quilmes shepherds 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.020

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.460
 different ventures that have 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.110
 what to do with different hospitals 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.130
 that all that have to do with health 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.380
 mental was involved for a way of 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.940
 integrate us all with the help 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.370
 problematic in a people of the 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.880
 university of quilmes also 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:03.650
 we participate in the 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.420
 of fairs is a social economy 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.110
 the losses that has to do with the 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.110

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.040
 about completely good color 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.110
 breathing 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.320
 whatever you want to put in there is a 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.690
 blanket or something moves quite the 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.400
