00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
here's a packaging I got the top part

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.170 
here's a packaging I got the top part
off<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.100> my<00:02:02.280> tooth<00:02:02.520> but<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:02.880> not<00:02:02.970> like<00:02:03.060> this

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
off of my tooth but it's not like this

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.880 
off of my tooth but it's not like this
plastic<00:02:03.750> stuff<00:02:03.990> around<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> paper<00:02:04.590> as<00:02:04.740> well

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
plastic stuff around the paper as well

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520 
plastic stuff around the paper as well
so<00:02:05.220> there<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.720> actual<00:02:07.080> thumb<00:02:07.290> drive

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
so there is the actual thumb drive

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.760 
so there is the actual thumb drive
itself<00:02:08.000> nice<00:02:09.000> black<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.600> blue<00:02:09.810> I'm<00:02:10.530> pretty

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
itself nice black and blue I'm pretty

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.890 
itself nice black and blue I'm pretty
sure<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.190> cap<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.570> if

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
sure this is the cap there you go if

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.370 
sure this is the cap there you go if
this<00:02:13.080> was<00:02:13.260> USB<00:02:13.739> 3.0<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.340> inside<00:02:14.820> would<00:02:15.030> be

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
this was USB 3.0 the inside would be

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.320 
this was USB 3.0 the inside would be
balloon<00:02:16.380> not<00:02:16.650> black<00:02:16.890> or<00:02:17.190> white<00:02:17.550> in<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.150> case

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
balloon not black or white in this case

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:28.670 
balloon not black or white in this case
is<00:02:18.480> black<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:24.410> hmm<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:27.410> always<00:02:28.410> have<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.560> good

right you guys I wouldn't even just

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.809 
right you guys I wouldn't even just
grabbed<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.170> dough<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> benchmark<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.580> drive

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
grabbed a dough to a benchmark the drive

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.229 
grabbed a dough to a benchmark the drive
is<00:02:42.090> for<00:02:42.510> whatever<00:02:42.660> reason<00:02:43.170> my<00:02:43.280> 2.0<00:02:44.280> ports<00:02:44.730> I'm

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
is for whatever reason my 2.0 ports I'm

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.180 
is for whatever reason my 2.0 ports I'm
not<00:02:45.480> getting<00:02:45.750> thing<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.110> anything<00:02:46.500> above<00:02:46.739> 10

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
not getting thing and anything above 10

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.350 
not getting thing and anything above 10
megabytes<00:02:47.790> which<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.269> odd<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:48.769> I've

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
megabytes which is odd because I've

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.539 
megabytes which is odd because I've
gotten<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.750> million<00:02:52.410> times<00:02:52.650> before<00:02:52.890> I've

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
gotten that million times before I've

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.120 
gotten that million times before I've
gotten<00:02:53.970> 20<00:02:54.329> you<00:02:54.570> know<00:02:54.690> USB<00:02:55.110> 2.0<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.799> give<00:02:56.070> you

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
gotten 20 you know USB 2.0 I give you

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.360 
gotten 20 you know USB 2.0 I give you
like<00:02:56.250> 20<00:02:56.780> 25<00:02:57.780> minute<00:02:58.019> bat<00:02:58.170> bites<00:02:58.500> per<00:02:58.890> second

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
like 20 25 minute bat bites per second

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.100 
like 20 25 minute bat bites per second
so<00:02:59.790> let's<00:03:00.000> try<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.209> dough<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.660> see<00:03:00.780> what<00:03:00.870> we<00:03:00.989> get

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
so let's try a dough and see what we get

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.770 
so let's try a dough and see what we get
here<00:03:01.610> as<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.850> seem<00:03:03.030> currently<00:03:03.510> right<00:03:03.690> in

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
here as you can seem currently right in

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.970 
here as you can seem currently right in
the<00:03:03.840> middle<00:03:04.019> of<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> benchmark<00:03:04.620> okay<00:03:04.829> we've

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
the middle of the benchmark okay we've

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.069 
the middle of the benchmark okay we've
been<00:03:05.010> up<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.250> about<00:03:05.459> 5<00:03:05.730> megabytes<00:03:06.410> there<00:03:09.079> well

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
been up to about 5 megabytes there well

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.699 
been up to about 5 megabytes there well
5<00:03:10.350> megabytes<00:03:10.680> read<00:03:12.350> they<00:03:13.350> might<00:03:13.500> have<00:03:13.590> put

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
5 megabytes read they might have put

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.849 
5 megabytes read they might have put
some<00:03:13.859> music<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.670> here<00:03:14.970> we<00:03:15.060> go<00:03:15.590> alright<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.739> goes

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
some music so here we go alright it goes

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:18.680 
some music so here we go alright it goes
well<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.340> went<00:03:17.670> ahead<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> stopped<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.420> biggis

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
well I went ahead and stopped it biggis

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.509 
well I went ahead and stopped it biggis

a little bit low but you know it's

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.279 
a little bit low but you know it's
though<00:04:23.639> USB<00:04:24.030> 2.0<00:04:24.479> and<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.630> can<00:04:24.720> expect<00:04:25.020> too<00:04:25.110> much

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
though USB 2.0 and I can expect too much

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.020 
though USB 2.0 and I can expect too much
and<00:04:25.610> reads<00:04:26.610> were<00:04:26.970> at<00:04:27.120> 20<00:04:27.510> which<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:27.870> what<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:29.030> is

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030
