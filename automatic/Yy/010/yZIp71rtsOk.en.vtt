life<00:00:33.780> cycle<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.380> think<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> game's<00:00:34.950> been<00:00:35.219> out

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
life cycle I think the game's been out

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.549 
life cycle I think the game's been out
for<00:00:35.640> like<00:00:35.670> nine<00:00:36.660> months<00:00:36.690> or<00:00:37.140> something<00:00:37.350> like

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
for like nine months or something like

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250 
for like nine months or something like
that<00:00:37.620> but<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.850> reason<00:00:39.059> this<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.540> huge<00:00:40.020> deal

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260

couple<00:00:57.329> years<00:00:57.539> especially<00:00:57.930> it's<00:00:58.859> been

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
couple years especially it's been

couple years especially it's been
absolutely<00:00:59.370> nuts<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> like<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.870> really

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
absolutely nuts so this is like a really

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.160 
absolutely nuts so this is like a really
big<00:01:01.710> deal<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.760> only<00:01:02.820> for<00:01:03.270> optic<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:03.899> for

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
big deal not only for optic but for

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.740 
big deal not only for optic but for
eSports<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.860> fact<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.970> only<00:01:06.210> there's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
eSports the fact that not only there's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.109 
eSports the fact that not only there's
two<00:01:07.170> eSports<00:01:07.920> organizations<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:09.000> are

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
two eSports organizations that are

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.149 
two eSports organizations that are
featured<00:01:09.390> within<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.020> game<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.100> is

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
featured within the game I think this is

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
featured within the game I think this is
a<00:01:11.340> type<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> thing<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.450> see<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
a type of thing that you can see a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.950 
a type of thing that you can see a
growing<00:01:13.530> eSports<00:01:14.400> not<00:01:14.670> just<00:01:14.939> like<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.509> really

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
growing eSports not just like it really

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.440 
growing eSports not just like it really
is<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.380> just<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> camo<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.580> your<00:01:18.060> soldier

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
is it's just like a camo on your soldier

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.730 
is it's just like a camo on your soldier
but<00:01:18.869> it's<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.140> much<00:01:19.200> more<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
but it's so much more than that

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
but it's so much more than that
represents<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.580> passion<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.299> represents

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
represents like passion it represents

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
represents like passion it represents
people<00:01:22.020> getting<00:01:22.890> behind<00:01:23.009> their<00:01:23.369> team<00:01:23.610> no

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
people getting behind their team no

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.460 
people getting behind their team no
matter<00:01:23.939> what<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.020> it's<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
matter what one it is I think it's a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.340 
matter what one it is I think it's a
really<00:01:25.799> awesome<00:01:26.130> thing<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.240> for<00:01:27.960> when<00:01:28.170> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
really awesome thing so as for when it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.830 
really awesome thing so as for when it's
coming<00:01:28.560> out<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.070> believe<00:01:29.640> they<00:01:30.150> said<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.810> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
coming out I believe they said on the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 
coming out I believe they said on the
broadcast<00:01:31.259> August<00:01:32.220> 10th<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.000> would<00:01:33.180> assume<00:01:33.540> it

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
broadcast August 10th I would assume it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.770 
broadcast August 10th I would assume it
will<00:01:33.900> be<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.470> next<00:01:35.070> couple<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.210> weeks<00:01:36.509> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
will be in the next couple of weeks so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.990 
will be in the next couple of weeks so
keep<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.290> lookout<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.220> believe

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
keep on the lookout for that I believe

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.179 
keep on the lookout for that I believe
they<00:01:39.270> are<00:01:39.299> not<00:01:39.570> purchasable<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.799> could<00:01:41.040> be

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
they are not purchasable I could be

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.859 
they are not purchasable I could be
wrong<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.790> that<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.329> have<00:01:42.659> to

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
wrong but I think that you just have to

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.170 
wrong but I think that you just have to
get<00:01:42.990> them<00:01:43.170> through<00:01:43.530> supply<00:01:44.490> drops<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.970> like

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
get them through supply drops just like
