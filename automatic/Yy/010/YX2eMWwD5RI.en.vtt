00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
it and everything's gone and then you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.410 
it and everything's gone and then you
have<00:01:21.600> delay<00:01:22.259> which<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.270> controls<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
have delay which is controls the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.240 
have delay which is controls the
interval<00:01:24.900> between<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.470> repeats<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
interval between the repeats of the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880 
interval between the repeats of the
sounds<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.390> have<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> listen<00:01:28.049> freeze<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
sounds you have the listen freeze and

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.050 
sounds you have the listen freeze and
clear<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:30.650> freeze<00:01:31.650> preserves<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.729> current

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
clear and freeze preserves the current

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.210 
clear and freeze preserves the current
pattern<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:34.229> can<00:01:34.380> click<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.710> no<00:01:34.950> keep

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
pattern so you can click that no keep

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.219 
pattern so you can click that no keep
playing<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.610> same<00:01:35.640> thing<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.600> won't<00:01:36.780> make

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
playing the same thing and it won't make

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
playing the same thing and it won't make
new<00:01:37.439> ones<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.850> listen<00:01:39.420> generates<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
new ones and then listen generates a

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.069 
new ones and then listen generates a
random<00:01:40.229> pattern<00:01:41.000> then<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.810> mood

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
random pattern then you have the mood

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.690 
random pattern then you have the mood
you<00:01:43.890> can<00:01:44.070> change<00:01:44.280> different<00:01:44.610> moods<00:01:44.970> right

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
you can change different moods right

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.510 
you can change different moods right
which<00:01:47.700> allows<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.590> has<00:01:50.250> different
