 very 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.670
 and a new day dawns, there I have to 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.710
 look for wood 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.670
 I have to get home and do the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.640
 food I have to do so many things but 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.160
 well it's always the same, the mornings are 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.370
 wonderful afternoons are wonderful 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.770
 and the nights a bit of the same do not 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.620
 It costs nothing to go out in the morning to look 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.140
 wood to eat to warm up together 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.900

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.239

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.150
 they have given us and therefore I enjoy more 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.570
 doing it I take advantage of the moment what 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.570

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.510
