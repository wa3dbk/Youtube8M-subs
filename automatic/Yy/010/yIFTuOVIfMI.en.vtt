english<00:01:15.180> video<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.689> yet<00:01:15.930> but<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
english video of this yet but there's a

english video of this yet but there's a
japanese<00:01:17.009> version<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.939> pretty<00:01:18.119> much

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
japanese version and you can pretty much

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.219

tell what's going on arm but what I'm

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.130 
tell what's going on arm but what I'm
thinking<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.390> don't<00:01:24.630> release<00:01:24.900> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
thinking is if they don't release it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.609 
thinking is if they don't release it
from<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.680> generations<00:01:26.580> 3ds<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:28.170> may<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.409> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
from this generations 3ds there may be a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.319 
from this generations 3ds there may be a
slight<00:01:29.070> chance<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> know<00:01:30.030> how<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.180> said

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
slight chance and you know how I said

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.260 
slight chance and you know how I said
earlier<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.990> might<00:01:31.380> release<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:32.270> 2015

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
earlier that might release in 2015

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
earlier that might release in 2015
because<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.140> marked<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.740> their<00:01:36.380> the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
this or what would be even better is if

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.149

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.589 
what stands for but
I'm<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.120> point<00:02:15.270> out<00:02:15.390> a<00:02:15.420> few<00:02:15.480> things

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
I'm going to point out a few things

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.110 
I'm going to point out a few things
first<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.319> all<00:02:16.700> you'll<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.790> them<00:02:18.000> more

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
first of all you'll see them more

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.210 
first of all you'll see them more
clearly<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.840> second<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.590> buttons<00:02:19.980> are

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
clearly in a second but the buttons are

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.030 
clearly in a second but the buttons are
now<00:02:20.400> colored<00:02:20.819> on<00:02:21.269> there<00:02:21.599> as<00:02:22.260> opposed<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
now colored on there as opposed to the

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.259 
now colored on there as opposed to the
black<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.519> white<00:02:23.730> on<00:02:24.030> here<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.810> also<00:02:25.110> has<00:02:25.739> two

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
black and white on here it also has two

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:28.430 
black and white on here it also has two
analog<00:02:27.269> sticks<00:02:27.300> although<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.080> one<00:02:28.290> is

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
analog sticks although this one is

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.160 
analog sticks although this one is
smaller<00:02:28.739> which<00:02:29.610> I<00:02:29.970> guess<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:30.780> camera

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
smaller which I guess it's for camera

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.720 
smaller which I guess it's for camera
angles<00:02:31.560> like<00:02:31.650> might<00:02:32.010> not<00:02:32.160> work<00:02:32.340> that<00:02:32.370> well<00:02:32.670> for

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
angles like might not work that well for

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.690 
angles like might not work that well for
first-person<00:02:33.599> shooters<00:02:34.050> but<00:02:34.349> yeah<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.459> think

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
first-person shooters but yeah I think

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.039 
first-person shooters but yeah I think
they'll<00:02:36.180> get<00:02:36.870> along<00:02:37.140> okay<00:02:38.040> issue<00:02:38.580> with<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.180> um

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
they'll get along okay issue with it um

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:42.410 
they'll get along okay issue with it um
this<00:02:40.890> is<00:02:41.040> from<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.280> Nintendo<00:02:41.910> Direct<00:02:42.060> that

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
this is from the Nintendo Direct that

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.220 
this is from the Nintendo Direct that
you<00:02:42.480> released<00:02:42.720> in<00:02:43.019> Japan<00:02:43.560> um<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:45.239> got<00:02:45.780> 3d<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
you released in Japan um it's got 3d I

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.070 
you released in Japan um it's got 3d I
guess<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> 3d<00:02:47.220> works<00:02:47.430> better<00:02:47.989> even<00:02:48.989> though

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
guess the 3d works better even though

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.880 
guess the 3d works better even though
you<00:02:49.170> can't<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.650> in<00:02:49.830> here<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.769> have

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
you can't see it in here so they have

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.470 
you can't see it in here so they have
new<00:02:53.069> 3d<00:02:53.910> viewing<00:02:54.150> whatever<00:02:54.540> that<00:02:54.780> is<00:02:54.989> um

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
new 3d viewing whatever that is um

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.920 
new 3d viewing whatever that is um
another<00:02:57.480> cool<00:02:58.019> thing<00:02:58.079> about<00:02:58.799> it<00:02:59.660> you'll<00:03:00.660> see

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
another cool thing about it you'll see

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.259 
another cool thing about it you'll see
it<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.290> second<00:03:02.660> they<00:03:03.660> added<00:03:03.870> amiibo<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.560> it

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
it in a second they added amiibo to it

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.390 
it in a second they added amiibo to it
evidently<00:03:06.269> it's<00:03:06.480> also<00:03:06.599> faster<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:08.160> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
evidently it's also faster and in the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.580 
evidently it's also faster and in the
main<00:03:08.549> menu<00:03:08.760> you'll<00:03:09.269> see<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.660> second<00:03:10.019> it's

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
main menu you'll see in a second it's

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.330 
main menu you'll see in a second it's

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.430 
be affordable actually I'm not sure on
this<00:04:30.090> but<00:04:30.330> i<00:04:30.360> think<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.230> was<00:04:31.470> around<00:04:33.410> 150<00:04:34.410> i

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
this but i think it was around 150 i

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.710 
this but i think it was around 150 i
could<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:35.010> wrong<00:04:35.040> but<00:04:35.310> that's<00:04:36.030> just<00:04:36.180> what<00:04:36.420> her

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
could be wrong but that's just what her

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.510 
could be wrong but that's just what her
but<00:04:36.960> if<00:04:37.320> so<00:04:37.680> that<00:04:37.920> would<00:04:37.980> be<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.130> pretty<00:04:38.430> good

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
but if so that would be a pretty good

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.610 
but if so that would be a pretty good
price<00:04:39.110> now<00:04:40.130> I'm<00:04:41.130> gonna<00:04:41.630> put<00:04:42.630> some<00:04:42.900> hope<00:04:43.350> out

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.770 
that would be great both systems could
use<00:05:01.890> it<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.310> we'd<00:05:02.490> finally<00:05:02.760> get<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.240> that
