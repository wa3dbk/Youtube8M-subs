00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
I'm going to so this little rubik's cube

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.800 
I'm going to so this little rubik's cube
which<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.569> standard<00:05:16.810> 3<00:05:17.409> x<00:05:17.620> 3<00:05:17.650> x<00:05:18.009> 3<00:05:18.810> let's

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
which is the standard 3 x 3 x 3 let's

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.439 
which is the standard 3 x 3 x 3 let's
just<00:05:19.990> scramble<00:05:20.620> this<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:21.009> little<00:05:21.250> bit<00:05:21.490> more<00:05:21.789> or

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
just scramble this a little bit more or

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.749 
just scramble this a little bit more or
the<00:05:22.509> skeptics<00:05:24.360> ok<00:05:25.650> scramble<00:05:26.650> egg<00:05:26.770> has<00:05:27.069> really

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
the skeptics ok scramble egg has really

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:31.469 
the skeptics ok scramble egg has really
random<00:05:28.090> there's<00:05:28.599> nothing<00:05:29.050> to<00:05:29.469> it<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:30.340> i<00:05:30.880> think

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
random there's nothing to it and i think

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.050 
random there's nothing to it and i think
that's<00:05:31.659> enough<00:05:32.229> that<00:05:32.949> is<00:05:33.099> completely

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
that's enough that is completely

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.930 
that's enough that is completely
scrambled<00:05:35.699> so<00:05:36.699> we'll<00:05:37.060> begin<00:05:37.419> in<00:05:38.050> three<00:05:38.940> two

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
scrambled so we'll begin in three two

00:05:39.940 --> 00:07:24.130 
scrambled so we'll begin in three two
one<00:05:42.210> go

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:29.270

that's it please be done let's check the

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:38.450 
that's it please be done let's check the
time<00:07:29.630> time<00:07:30.630> is<00:07:31.310> 139<00:07:34.010> 94<00:07:36.320> this<00:07:37.320> is<00:07:37.530> a<00:07:37.560> cool<00:07:37.920> side

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:38.460 
time time is 139 94 this is a cool side

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:44.350 
time time is 139 94 this is a cool side
for<00:07:39.230> testing<00:07:40.230> your<00:07:40.350> times<00:07:40.710> of<00:07:40.980> the<00:07:41.100> Rubies<00:07:41.400> too

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360
