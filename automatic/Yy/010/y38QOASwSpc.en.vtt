00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.333
- What a YouTube following
that is, huh?

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.866
- Yeah.
- So how did you get started?

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.500
- Well, I--it kind of happened
almost by accident.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.066
I really didn't expect

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.266
so many people
to want to watch my videos.

00:00:11.266 --> 00:00:13.933
So I was actually going through
a bullying experience

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:16.100
when I was about 12 years old.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.666
- Bullying at school
or cyberbullying?

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.500
- It was cyberbullying,
which is kind of funny,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.866
'cause then I decided to, like,
stay online for so long.

00:00:21.866 --> 00:00:23.466
I've been doing it
for six years.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.266
So it was a form of bullying
where

00:00:25.266 --> 00:00:27.666
it was people
that I actually knew.

00:00:27.666 --> 00:00:30.400
And they made this, like,
Facebook page about me,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.600
Myspace page about me,
and it was basically, like,

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.266
my face, my name,

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.833
but it was almost like I was
kind of making fun of myself,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.666
and, like, all the captions were
about my physical appearance

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:42.466
and just me making fun of
who I was.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.766
So seeing this when I was 12,
I was, like, so hurt by it.

00:00:45.766 --> 00:00:48.200
And I had never experienced
anything like it before,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.233
so naturally, I let it affect

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.933
my self-confidence
and my happiness about life

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:56.666
and kind of went into a form of
depression and anxiety

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.966
and all of these things
that lasted for maybe a year.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.866
And there was a point
in that time period

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.700
that I felt like, "This is how
my life is gonna be.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.900
"Like, I just have to accept it.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.100
"I'm never gonna be happy,

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.766
and I'm never gonna love
myself."

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.200
And then I started watching
YouTube videos,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.400
and I was like,
"This is cool."

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.066
And I just started watching
more and more,

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:15.800
and it kind of became
a distraction.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.966
And then I decided to make
my first video,

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.533
which was a lot,
because going from

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.466
feeling so insecure
and then literally

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:23.233
putting myself out there
for the world to see

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.233
was a huge step.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:25.300
And I did it,

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.933
and then after
that first video--

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:27.933
- What was the first video?

00:01:27.933 --> 00:01:29.500
- It was--it was, like,
me talking about

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.200
different makeup products,
which is funny

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.000
'cause I was never really
much of a girly girl,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.433
but I kind of just
found it fun.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:37.600
And I kind of got into
the beauty and fashion world

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.200
through YouTube,
so I was just talking--

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.533
- So you're talking
about makeup,

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:41.933
and then did you have
a lot of views,

00:01:41.933 --> 00:01:43.366
like, right off the bat?

00:01:43.366 --> 00:01:45.833
- No, actually, the first video
that I posted--

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:47.266
it's so hard,
because so many people

00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:48.666
are uploading videos
every second

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.333
that it's really hard
to get noticed.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.633
And I remember the first video
I uploaded,

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.700
I watched it over and over
to see if people were,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.866
you know, checking it out.

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:57.166
And I saw the view count
going up.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.333
I'm like, "Oh, my gosh.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.500
I'm getting views, like,
every second."

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.633
And then I realized
that they were from me.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.933
[laughter]

00:02:04.933 --> 00:02:06.433
So that answered that question.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:09.000
So it was definitely, you know,
a slow start, yeah.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.200
I was like, "Oh, that's me.
And that's my mom right there.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.433
Those two views.
Thanks, Mom."

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.533
- That's amazing.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:15.066
Well, then it makes
other people think

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:17.133
you're getting a lot of views,
even if it's yourself.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.266
- Yeah, no, then I was like,
"Maybe if I just watch this,

00:02:19.266 --> 00:02:21.000
like, 200 times,
then people will be like,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.200
'Wow, 200 people liked this.
I should check it out.'"

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.833
- So what is now--
so it's all fashion and beauty.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.900
And what's--what is
your main goal with this?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600
What do you want to do?

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.966
- Well, it kind of evolved into
more of a lifestyle channel.

00:02:31.966 --> 00:02:34.666
And even though--you know, I do
talk about beauty and fashion.

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.633
Some people might see it
as kind of superficial.

00:02:36.633 --> 00:02:40.333
But in the end,
my main goal for what I do

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.666
is to kind of just promote
self-love and self-confidence

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:45.233
and taking a bad situation

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.300
and making it into
something amazing.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.500
'Cause you can see the process.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.233
I've been doing videos
for six years.

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:51.500
I haven't deleted any.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.700
You can see me when
I was making my first video.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900
I was really shy
and really closed off.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.366
And I grew, and I, you know,

00:02:58.366 --> 00:03:00.333
really learned so much
about myself,

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.166
and I've really learned
the importance of

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:03.966
not worrying about
other people's opinions.

00:03:03.966 --> 00:03:06.933
Because even now, I still
experience the bullying online.

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.466
You know,
people leave hate comments.

00:03:08.466 --> 00:03:10.366
It's something that
so many people experience.

00:03:10.366 --> 00:03:12.900
And I've really allowed it
to not affect me anymore,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.800
so that's what I want to push
for my audience,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.733
and that's what I want
to inspire them to do.

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.966
And just recently,
I partnered up with

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:23.200
PACER'S national
anti-bullying organization,

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.433
and I'm really excited.

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:25.900
We're still in
the beginning stages,

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.566
but just any way
that I can really inspire

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:30.433
my viewers to love themselves
is my main goal.

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.133
- Well, good for you
for getting out of that

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.266
and turning it around
like that.

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:35.266
That's pretty amazing.

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:36.266
- Thank you.
