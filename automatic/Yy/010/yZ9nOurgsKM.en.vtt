00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.360 
I'm sure part of the idea now I'll give
you<00:02:22.629> a<00:02:22.660> quick<00:02:22.870> size<00:02:23.110> comparison<00:02:23.800> this<00:02:23.920> is<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.129> u

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
you a quick size comparison this is a u

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.729 
you a quick size comparison this is a u
kpk<00:02:27.060> as<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.300> can<00:02:28.420> see<00:02:28.690> i'll<00:02:29.080> put<00:02:29.349> them<00:02:29.530> down

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
kpk as you can see i'll put them down

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:41.070 
kpk as you can see i'll put them down
here<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.860> light<00:02:36.160> somewhere<00:02:36.670> else<00:02:37.030> yes<00:02:40.080> there

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
here that light somewhere else yes there

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.009 
here that light somewhere else yes there
we<00:02:41.200> go<00:02:44.519> so<00:02:45.519> as<00:02:45.580> you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.880> see<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.209> u<00:02:46.330> kpk<00:02:46.810> is

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
we go so as you can see the u kpk is

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.880 
we go so as you can see the u kpk is
substantially<00:02:47.799> larger<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.459> is<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> u<00:02:49.239> kpk<00:02:49.630> is

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
substantially larger which is a u kpk is

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.309 
substantially larger which is a u kpk is
this<00:02:50.890> I<00:02:51.400> think<00:02:51.970> it's<00:02:52.120> almost<00:02:52.390> same<00:02:52.780> size<00:02:53.049> as

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
this I think it's almost same size as

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.490 
this I think it's almost same size as
the<00:02:53.349> delica<00:02:57.569> appellate<00:02:58.569> so<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.959> can<00:02:59.110> see<00:02:59.349> the

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
the delica appellate so you can see the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.870 
the delica appellate so you can see the
cutting<00:02:59.799> edge<00:02:59.950> is<00:03:00.130> substantially<00:03:00.849> shorter

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
cutting edge is substantially shorter

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.949 
cutting edge is substantially shorter
but<00:03:01.299> it's<00:03:01.480> got<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:01.720> nice<00:03:01.930> sweet<00:03:02.349> to<00:03:02.590> it<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:02.950> that

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
but it's got a nice sweet to it so that

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.240 
but it's got a nice sweet to it so that
it<00:03:04.959> does<00:03:05.170> give<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.709> little<00:03:05.890> bit<00:03:06.040> more<00:03:06.220> length

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
it does give it a little bit more length

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.670 
it does give it a little bit more length
but<00:03:09.250> this<00:03:09.819> will<00:03:09.970> make<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.180> good<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:11.530> know

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
but this will make a good you know

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.870 
but this will make a good you know
people<00:03:12.519> friendly<00:03:13.470> EDC<00:03:14.470> or<00:03:15.299> secondary<00:03:16.299> knife

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
people friendly EDC or secondary knife

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.809 
people friendly EDC or secondary knife
for<00:03:18.880> most<00:03:19.120> people<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:21.250> pretty<00:03:21.579> cool

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
for most people so that's pretty cool

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.039 
for most people so that's pretty cool
and<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.120> i<00:03:22.299> said<00:03:22.389> i<00:03:22.540> don't<00:03:22.660> have<00:03:22.900> any

and like i said i don't have any
experience<00:03:23.680> with<00:03:23.859> the<00:03:23.980> steals<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:24.579> can't

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
experience with the steals I can't

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.280

the BD one but this I'm sure if you go

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.860 
the BD one but this I'm sure if you go
to<00:03:52.900> spider<00:03:53.590> ko's<00:03:54.329> website<00:03:55.329> they'll<00:03:55.540> have<00:03:55.720> all

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
to spider ko's website they'll have all

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.740 
to spider ko's website they'll have all
the<00:03:55.959> product<00:03:56.380> information<00:03:57.420> from<00:03:58.420> what<00:03:58.599> I<00:03:58.630> can

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
the product information from what I can

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.720 
the product information from what I can
tell<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.139> this<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.980> steel<00:04:00.280> seems<00:04:00.549> to

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
tell that this the steel seems to

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.180 
tell that this the steel seems to
scratch<00:04:01.180> quite<00:04:01.870> easily<00:04:02.139> I<00:04:02.380> haven't<00:04:02.739> even<00:04:02.859> used

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
scratch quite easily I haven't even used

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.140 
scratch quite easily I haven't even used
it<00:04:03.370> yet<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.790> blade<00:04:04.030> is<00:04:04.150> all<00:04:04.299> scratched<00:04:04.690> up

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
it yet and the blade is all scratched up

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.920 
it yet and the blade is all scratched up
so<00:04:07.150> hopefully<00:04:07.750> that's<00:04:07.959> not<00:04:08.109> a<00:04:09.930> spyderco

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
so hopefully that's not a spyderco
