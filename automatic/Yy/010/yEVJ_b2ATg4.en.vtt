20,000 hours running time now if you
increase<00:00:48.100> the<00:00:48.249> brightness<00:00:48.429> also<00:00:49.059> that<00:00:49.659> will

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
increase the brightness also that will

and then go down to your backlight right

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.750 
and then go down to your backlight right
here<00:01:00.459> and<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:02.199> shouldn't<00:01:02.440> be<00:01:02.499> set<00:01:02.739> to<00:01:02.889> max<00:01:03.129> you

here and it shouldn't be set to max you

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.950 
here and it shouldn't be set to max you
want<00:01:03.909> to<00:01:03.969> lower<00:01:04.180> that<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:05.259> mid<00:01:05.439> setting<00:01:06.009> 5

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
want to lower that to your mid setting 5

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.410 
want to lower that to your mid setting 5
midway<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:09.070> if<00:01:09.310> you<00:01:09.490> don't<00:01:09.640> like<00:01:09.820> if<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.119> want

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
midway now if you don't like if you want

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.359 
midway now if you don't like if you want
more<00:01:10.600> brightness<00:01:10.869> only<00:01:11.860> thing<00:01:12.039> we<00:01:12.130> would<00:01:12.250> have

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
more brightness only thing we would have

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.240 
more brightness only thing we would have
to<00:01:12.490> do<00:01:12.670> is<00:01:12.969> adjust<00:01:13.479> your<00:01:14.020> contrast<00:01:14.380> your

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
to do is adjust your contrast your

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.399 
to do is adjust your contrast your
brightness<00:01:15.729> settings<00:01:16.090> and<00:01:16.390> your<00:01:17.200> color

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
brightness settings and your color

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.459 
brightness settings and your color
settings<00:01:18.030> don't<00:01:19.030> increase<00:01:19.479> their<00:01:19.750> backlight

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
settings don't increase their backlight

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.349 
settings don't increase their backlight
because<00:01:20.859> that<00:01:21.159> uses<00:01:21.490> up<00:01:21.549> the<00:01:21.759> most<00:01:21.969> wants

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:22.359 
because that uses up the most wants

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.660 
because that uses up the most wants
increases<00:01:23.259> the<00:01:23.380> temperature<00:01:23.799> inside<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.130> TV

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
increases the temperature inside the TV

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.999 
increases the temperature inside the TV
and<00:01:25.079> it's<00:01:26.079> more<00:01:26.380> wear<00:01:26.560> and<00:01:26.590> tear<00:01:26.829> on<00:01:26.950> the

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
and it's more wear and tear on the

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.550 
and it's more wear and tear on the
backlight<00:01:27.399> inverter<00:01:27.520> boards<00:01:28.210> and<00:01:28.560> also

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
backlight inverter boards and also

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.249 
backlight inverter boards and also
shortens<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.369> life<00:01:30.520> on<00:01:30.820> your<00:01:31.149> CCFL<00:01:31.840> your

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
shortens the life on your CCFL your

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.160 
shortens the life on your CCFL your
first<00:01:32.560> lamps<00:01:32.979> that<00:01:33.280> run<00:01:33.729> behind<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.149> LCD<00:01:34.539> now

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
first lamps that run behind the LCD now

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.679 
first lamps that run behind the LCD now
if<00:01:35.289> you<00:01:35.409> have<00:01:35.530> an<00:01:35.619> LED<00:01:35.770> TV<00:01:36.280> y<00:01:36.700> le<00:01:37.060> d--<00:01:37.299> TVs

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
if you have an LED TV y le d-- TVs

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.029 
if you have an LED TV y le d-- TVs
actually<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.649> LEDs<00:01:39.009> produce<00:01:39.729> less<00:01:40.149> heat<00:01:40.179> and

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
actually the LEDs produce less heat and

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.209 
actually the LEDs produce less heat and
run<00:01:42.039> about<00:01:42.250> 50,000<00:01:43.210> running<00:01:43.570> hours<00:01:43.960> so<00:01:44.799> it

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
run about 50,000 running hours so it

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.489 
run about 50,000 running hours so it
will<00:01:45.249> last<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.850> even<00:01:46.509> more<00:01:46.659> more<00:01:46.960> than<00:01:47.140> twice

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:47.499 
will last you even more more than twice

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.469 
will last you even more more than twice
the<00:01:47.799> life<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.249> your<00:01:48.820> backlight<00:01:49.270> on<00:01:49.329> a
