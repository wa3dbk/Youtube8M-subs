okay<00:00:01.350> so<00:00:01.439> what<00:00:01.740> we<00:00:01.860> got<00:00:02.070> here<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:03.020> two<00:00:04.020> cheap

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
okay so what we got here is two cheap

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.320 
okay so what we got here is two cheap
solar<00:00:04.950> panels<00:00:05.430> on<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.700> Left<00:00:05.970> which<00:00:06.569> oh<00:00:08.330> don't

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
solar panels on the Left which oh don't

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.839 
solar panels on the Left which oh don't
quote<00:00:09.480> me<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:09.990> I<00:00:10.200> think<00:00:10.590> I<00:00:10.980> think

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
quote me on this but I think I think

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.530 
quote me on this but I think I think
they're<00:00:12.059> rated<00:00:12.599> at<00:00:12.750> 15<00:00:13.290> watts<00:00:13.650> apiece<00:00:14.070> but

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
they're rated at 15 watts apiece but

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.210 
they're rated at 15 watts apiece but
between<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.780> me<00:00:15.990> they're<00:00:16.320> pretty<00:00:16.890> shitty

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
between you and me they're pretty shitty

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.120 
between you and me they're pretty shitty
and<00:00:17.520> then<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.869> other<00:00:19.020> two<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.590> small<00:00:19.890> ones

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
and then the other two the small ones

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.710 
and then the other two the small ones
are<00:00:20.369> good<00:00:20.580> ones<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:21.000> they're<00:00:21.800> ten<00:00:22.800> watts<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
are good ones and they're ten watts so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.429 
are good ones and they're ten watts so
in<00:00:24.720> theory<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> got<00:00:25.500> oh

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
in theory you got oh

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.759 
in theory you got oh
maybe<00:00:28.439> 30<00:00:29.240> 40<00:00:30.240> maybe<00:00:30.750> 50<00:00:31.050> watts<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.619> solar

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540 
panels there's not really as much as it
looks<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.750> then<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:37.770> blue<00:00:37.950> box<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
looks like and then the blue box on the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.299 
looks like and then the blue box on the
right<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:40.129> cheap-ass<00:00:41.190> shunt<00:00:42.090> based<00:00:43.309> seven

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309

to<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.079> surge<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.739> 20<00:01:02.160> volts<00:01:02.609> so<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> solar

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
to a surge of 20 volts so the solar

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.299 
to a surge of 20 volts so the solar
charge<00:01:03.840> controller<00:01:04.500> make<00:01:04.769> sure<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
charge controller make sure that you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.770 
charge controller make sure that you
don't<00:01:05.460> blow<00:01:05.880> up<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.420> audio<00:01:07.170> capacitor<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
don't blow up the audio capacitor and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
don't blow up the audio capacitor and
then<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> goes<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:11.100> 12<00:01:11.850> volt

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
then from there it goes into a 12 volt

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.859 
then from there it goes into a 12 volt
outlet<00:01:12.299> into<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.320> inverter<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
outlet into an inverter and then the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
outlet into an inverter and then the
guitar<00:01:16.049> amplifier<00:01:16.799> plugs<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
guitar amplifier plugs into that

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.560 
guitar amplifier plugs into that
inverter<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.400> converts<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:22.400> 110<00:01:23.400> all<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
inverter and converts that 110 all the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.260 
inverter and converts that 110 all the
way<00:01:24.689> up<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.900> 400<00:01:25.380> volts<00:01:25.790> so<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> start<00:01:27.150> off

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
way up to 400 volts so you start off

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.749 
way up to 400 volts so you start off
with<00:01:27.330> toy<00:01:27.630> volts<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.220> 400<00:01:29.759> volts<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
with toy volts and if with 400 volts and

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.560 
with toy volts and if with 400 volts and
it's<00:01:32.759> part<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.090> reason<00:01:33.329> why<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it's part of the reason why the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's part of the reason why the
conversion<00:01:34.020> factors<00:01:34.409> no<00:01:34.560> like<00:01:34.799> great<00:01:35.009> because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
conversion factors no like great because

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
conversion factors no like great because
it's<00:01:35.430> Class<00:01:35.729> A<00:01:35.939> amplifier<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.020> uses<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.470> way

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
it's Class A amplifier so it uses a way

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.700 
it's Class A amplifier so it uses a way
lot<00:01:38.100> more<00:01:38.280> power<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.970> puts<00:01:39.150> out<00:01:39.470> anyway

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
lot more power than it puts out anyway

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.080 
lot more power than it puts out anyway
it<00:01:40.890> sounds<00:01:41.220> cool<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> tube

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
it sounds cool because you got a tube

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.149 
it sounds cool because you got a tube
amp<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.750> there's<00:01:43.290> no<00:01:43.500> batteries<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
amp and there's no batteries in the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:03:07.260 
amp and there's no batteries in the
setup<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:45.030> show<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.210> how<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> goes<00:01:45.600> here

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.640 

here<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:08.510> now<00:03:08.660> I'll<00:03:08.810> give<00:03:08.959> you<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.140> little<00:03:09.290> tour

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
here so now I'll give you a little tour

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.380 
here so now I'll give you a little tour
of<00:03:09.800> the<00:03:09.950> area<00:03:12.580> here's<00:03:13.580> the<00:03:13.790> house

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
of the area here's the house

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.170 
of the area here's the house
it's<00:03:15.380> rated<00:03:15.620> at<00:03:15.830> 5<00:03:16.100> watts<00:03:16.459> it's<00:03:17.120> a<00:03:17.239> tube<00:03:17.480> app<00:03:22.180> so

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
it's rated at 5 watts it's a tube app so

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.600 
it's rated at 5 watts it's a tube app so
you<00:03:23.269> can<00:03:23.420> see<00:03:23.600> that's<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.080> guess<00:03:24.980> you<00:03:25.190> can<00:03:25.400> see

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
you can see that's I guess you can see

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.240 
you can see that's I guess you can see
there's<00:03:25.819> a<00:03:25.940> chance<00:03:26.180> farmer<00:03:26.600> in<00:03:26.720> there<00:03:27.130> you<00:03:28.130> can

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
there's a chance farmer in there you can

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.479 
there's a chance farmer in there you can
see<00:03:28.340> it's<00:03:28.700> tubes<00:03:29.860> so<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:30.980> know<00:03:31.100> that's<00:03:31.220> for

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
see it's tubes so you know that's for

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.650 
see it's tubes so you know that's for
around<00:03:32.000> 400<00:03:32.510> volts<00:03:32.780> or<00:03:32.870> some<00:03:34.569> transformer<00:03:35.569> to

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
around 400 volts or some transformer to

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.070 
around 400 volts or some transformer to
step<00:03:35.690> up<00:03:37.120> here's<00:03:38.120> a<00:03:38.209> little<00:03:38.480> blue<00:03:38.600> box<00:03:38.840> that<00:03:38.989> I

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
step up here's a little blue box that I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.600 
step up here's a little blue box that I
used<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.470> use<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:39.680> batteries<00:03:40.630> but<00:03:41.630> now<00:03:42.610> all

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
used to use for batteries but now all

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.240 
used to use for batteries but now all
that<00:03:43.670> is<00:03:43.880> in<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:46.100> an<00:03:46.459> audio<00:03:46.640> capacitor<00:03:48.250> some

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
that is in it is an audio capacitor some

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.000 
that is in it is an audio capacitor some
