00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and depending obviously what round

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
and depending obviously what round
you're<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.050> things<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:02.039> you

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.350 
actually go up to him and you can
collect<00:01:04.140> some<00:01:04.290> money<00:01:04.619> now<00:01:05.610> sometimes<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> does

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
collect some money now sometimes it does

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.539
