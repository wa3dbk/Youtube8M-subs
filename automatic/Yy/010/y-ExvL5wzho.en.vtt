00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
another good way is for two rewards
right<00:01:35.610> now<00:01:35.820> for<00:01:36.150> two<00:01:36.329> rewards<00:01:36.450> are<00:01:36.810> not

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
right now for two rewards are not

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
right now for two rewards are not
working<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:38.640> not<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.030> really<00:01:39.150> touch

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
working so I'm not going to really touch

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.760 
working so I'm not going to really touch
upon<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.750> but<00:01:39.930> when<00:01:40.290> they're<00:01:40.409> working<00:01:40.710> I'm

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
upon it but when they're working I'm

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.929 
upon it but when they're working I'm
going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> whole<00:01:41.310> video<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.640> for<00:01:41.880> two

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
going to do a whole video on for two

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.370 
going to do a whole video on for two
rewards<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.360> how<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> manipulate<00:01:43.049> them<00:01:43.200> how<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
rewards of how to manipulate them how to

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.980 
rewards of how to manipulate them how to
get<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> most<00:01:43.890> money<00:01:44.130> possible<00:01:44.450> from<00:01:45.450> them<00:01:45.630> so

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
get the most money possible from them so

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.810 
get the most money possible from them so
expect<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> future<00:01:46.710> another<00:01:47.549> really
