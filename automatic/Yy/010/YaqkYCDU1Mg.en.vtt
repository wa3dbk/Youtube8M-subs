in healing did you get permission no

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
in healing did you get permission no
because<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:33.390> such<00:00:33.570> a<00:00:33.600> natural<00:00:33.930> thing<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.469> do

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
because it's such a natural thing to do

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
because it's such a natural thing to do
in<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.800> feel<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.280> good<00:00:35.309> but<00:00:35.760> if<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.540> have

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
in it feel so good but if you do have

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.900 
in it feel so good but if you do have
concerns<00:00:37.200> about<00:00:37.500> doing<00:00:37.950> distant<00:00:38.370> healing<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
concerns about doing distant healing and

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.479 
concerns about doing distant healing and
getting<00:00:39.480> permission<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> suggest<00:00:41.250> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
getting permission what I suggest is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.170 
getting permission what I suggest is
that<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> send<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> energy<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.879> highest

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that you send the energy to the highest

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.680 
that you send the energy to the highest
good<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:46.350> somebody's<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.950> coma<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:48.000> somebody

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
good so somebody's in a coma or somebody

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.470 
good so somebody's in a coma or somebody
for<00:00:49.320> whatever<00:00:49.559> reason<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.370> not<00:00:50.550> understand

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
for whatever reason would not understand

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.240 
for whatever reason would not understand
why<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.379> doing<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.770> thing<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.190> they

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
why you're doing this thing and they

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.799 
why you're doing this thing and they
think<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.610> some<00:00:53.760> kind<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:54.000> voodoo<00:00:54.629> or

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think it's some kind of voodoo or

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.170 
think it's some kind of voodoo or
something<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.440> scary<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.879> send

everybody<00:01:52.560> who's<00:01:52.710> here<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:56.990> what<00:01:57.990> we'll<00:01:58.079> have

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
everybody who's here and what we'll have

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
everybody who's here and what we'll have
you<00:01:58.380> do<00:01:58.560> is<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.060> make<00:02:00.090> them<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.659> small

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you do is you can make them very small

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.720 
you do is you can make them very small
and<00:02:01.380> put<00:02:02.130> them<00:02:02.280> between<00:02:02.369> your<00:02:02.729> hands

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.850 

so<00:02:06.730> yeah<00:02:06.850> there's<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.150> little<00:02:07.540> tiny<00:02:07.690> people<00:02:07.930> and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
so yeah there's a little tiny people and

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.059 
so yeah there's a little tiny people and
you<00:02:08.950> put<00:02:09.130> them<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.310> your<00:02:09.399> hands

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.759 

so<00:02:17.030> soft<00:02:17.510> hands<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:18.079> like<00:02:18.170> always<00:02:18.530> because

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
so soft hands just like always because

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:20.110 
so soft hands just like always because
you<00:02:18.860> run<00:02:19.010> energy<00:02:19.159> better<00:02:19.459> with<00:02:19.670> soft<00:02:19.879> hands

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
you run energy better with soft hands

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.270 
you run energy better with soft hands
and<00:02:20.859> we'll<00:02:21.859> do<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:23.590> distant<00:02:24.590> healing<00:02:24.769> on<00:02:25.069> the

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
and we'll do the distant healing on the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.089 
and we'll do the distant healing on the
whole<00:02:25.459> group<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.420> let's<00:02:26.629> begin<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.260> all

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
whole group so let's begin and all

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.979 
whole group so let's begin and all
watching<00:02:28.819> videotape<00:02:29.299> can<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:29.599> it<00:02:29.689> at<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.840> same

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
watching videotape can do it at the same

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.250 
watching videotape can do it at the same
time<00:02:30.049> well<00:02:30.769> I'll<00:02:30.829> do<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.040> together

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
time well I'll do it together

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.660 
time well I'll do it together
so<00:02:35.349> start<00:02:36.349> breathing<00:02:36.650> start<00:02:37.310> running<00:02:37.579> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
so start breathing start running the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.030 
so start breathing start running the
energy<00:02:38.060> doing<00:02:38.689> the<00:02:38.870> full-body<00:02:39.319> sweeps<00:02:39.709> and

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
energy doing the full-body sweeps and

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:46.509 
energy doing the full-body sweeps and
the<00:02:40.430> breathing<00:02:40.760> techniques<00:02:44.680> try<00:02:45.680> vortexing

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
the breathing techniques try vortexing

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.220 
the breathing techniques try vortexing
the<00:02:46.609> energy<00:02:46.969> get<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.269> spinning<00:02:47.750> up<00:02:47.870> your<00:02:48.049> legs

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
the energy get it spinning up your legs

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
the energy get it spinning up your legs
through<00:02:48.620> your<00:02:48.650> torso<00:02:48.920> down<00:02:49.549> your<00:02:50.120> arms<00:02:50.359> into

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
through your torso down your arms into

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.379 
through your torso down your arms into
your<00:02:50.599> hands<00:02:51.079> and<00:02:51.760> feel<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.939> difference<00:02:53.299> in

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:53.389 
your hands and feel the difference in

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:54.879 
your hands and feel the difference in
the<00:02:53.510> room<00:02:53.659> as<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.989> start<00:02:54.200> vortex<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.859> the

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
the room as you start vortex in the

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.310 
the room as you start vortex in the
energy
