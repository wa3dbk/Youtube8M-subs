this<00:01:00.210> by<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.500> by<00:01:01.769> making<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.190> little

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
this by this by making this little

great<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.180> microphone<00:01:09.630> um<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:10.229> is

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
great little microphone um it is

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.980 
great little microphone um it is
substantial<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.250> thought<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.760> be

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
substantial I thought it was gonna be

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.719 
substantial I thought it was gonna be
maybe<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.350> lighter<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.890> plastic<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
maybe a lot lighter and plastic you

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.060 
maybe a lot lighter and plastic you
feeling<00:01:15.150> plastic<00:01:15.900> key<00:01:16.140> feeling<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.710> should<00:01:16.890> say

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
feeling plastic key feeling I should say

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.100 
feeling plastic key feeling I should say
but<00:01:17.370> it<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.090> substantial<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
but it is actually really substantial it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.770 
but it is actually really substantial it
feels<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.460> really<00:01:20.460> good<00:01:20.780> condenser

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
feels like a really good condenser

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.810 
feels like a really good condenser
microphone<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:23.189> I'm<00:01:23.280> gonna<00:01:23.369> show<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
microphone and I'm gonna show it to you

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.389 
microphone and I'm gonna show it to you
right<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.810> mic<00:01:25.229> stand

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.010 

cool<00:01:29.399> the<00:01:29.880> other<00:01:30.030> great<00:01:30.359> thing<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
cool the other great thing is that it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020 
cool the other great thing is that it
has<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> gain<00:01:31.530> control<00:01:31.560> if<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> see<00:01:32.700> this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
has a gain control if you can see this

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
has a gain control if you can see this
the<00:01:33.570> little<00:01:33.810> green<00:01:34.020> light<00:01:34.049> check<00:01:34.560> check<00:01:34.799> check

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
the little green light check check check

the little green light check check check
check<00:01:35.039> check<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.609> I'm<00:01:35.759> raising<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
check check if I'm raising it

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.029 
check check if I'm raising it

over driving now and then check check
check<00:01:39.960> check<00:01:40.229> coming<00:01:40.770> back<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.159> so<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
check check coming back down so the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.399 
check check coming back down so the
great<00:01:44.100> thing<00:01:44.130> about<00:01:44.429> that<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.109> have

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
great thing about that is that you have

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.859 
great thing about that is that you have
control<00:01:47.219> of<00:01:47.280> your<00:01:47.490> gain<00:01:47.880> your<00:01:48.149> input<00:01:48.630> gain

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
control of your gain your input gain

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.929 
control of your gain your input gain
your<00:01:49.350> sound<00:01:49.710> pressure<00:01:49.890> level<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.369> never<00:01:50.640> going

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
your sound pressure level is never going

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.060 
your sound pressure level is never going
to<00:01:51.060> unless<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.109> wanted<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.740> never<00:01:52.920> going

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
to unless you wanted to it's never going

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
to unless you wanted to it's never going
to<00:01:53.130> overdrive<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:54.539> input<00:01:54.960> for<00:01:55.140> your<00:01:55.259> videos

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
to overdrive your input for your videos

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
to overdrive your input for your videos
so<00:01:55.859> literally<00:01:56.310> anywhere<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> go<00:01:57.060> concerts

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
so literally anywhere you go concerts

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.149 
so literally anywhere you go concerts
wherever<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.350> actually<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.890> these

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
wherever you can actually do these

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.529 
wherever you can actually do these
videos<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.320> great<00:02:01.590> sound<00:02:01.950> again<00:02:02.850> this

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
videos and have great sound again this

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:15.630 
videos and have great sound again this
is<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.749> mic
