00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
earth and ocean science you study topics

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.080 
earth and ocean science you study topics
from<00:00:46.070> learning<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.399> rocks<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.910> how

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
from learning about the rocks and how

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.369 
from learning about the rocks and how
they<00:00:48.239> were<00:00:48.300> made<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.079> are<00:00:49.170> formed

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
they were made and how they are formed

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.350 
they were made and how they are formed
and<00:00:49.739> therefore<00:00:50.399> how<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.760> find<00:00:50.910> mineral

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
and therefore how we can find mineral

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.389 
and therefore how we can find mineral
and<00:00:51.539> oil<00:00:51.690> resources<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:53.010> learning<00:00:53.309> about

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and oil resources to learning about

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.520 
and oil resources to learning about
ocean<00:00:53.850> currents<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.390> how<00:00:54.870> they<00:00:55.110> shape<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
ocean currents and how they shape the

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.209 
ocean currents and how they shape the
seabed<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> how<00:00:56.910> they<00:00:57.090> affect<00:00:57.329> climate<00:00:58.219> well

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
seabed and how they affect climate well

increasingly our students are actually

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.530 
increasingly our students are actually
going<00:01:13.860> into<00:01:14.130> hydrology<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.880> engineering

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540
