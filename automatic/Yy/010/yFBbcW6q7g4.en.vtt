 oenologist from home our lives our then 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.490

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.500
 you must have heard 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.400
 of a discussion or view on a 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.970
 label the grape variety mention then the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.369
 grape variety in the wine is primordial I 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.199
 will start with an example when you 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 go to the fruit and vegetable section of 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.820
 supermarket you have different kinds 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.430
 of apples of fat or golden of 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.090
 tramps every apple is an apple 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.829
 but each variety has a different taste 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 for wine it's the same you have 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
 grapes made from all the wines we at 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 the different grape varieties these 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:55.340
 varieties they are called grape varieties you 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.840
 have merlot syrah love sell 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.559
 hundred of several hundred 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.660
 different grape varieties 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.379
 it complicates things a little grape 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.850
 so is the basis of wine is the varietal 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.820
 will obviously influenced the taste of the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.130
 wine is a bit like jams and 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.010
 jam is always a fruit of 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.770
 sugar and yet you have 30 40 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.759
 different jam at the supermarket and 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 you do not have too much trouble getting there 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.650
 find 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 you choose the one you like the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.450
 better for the varietals we will do 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.700
 the same 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.869
 finally kind to take a dozen a 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 twenty of these pages and what they 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.990
 bring in grains like that when you 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.090
 go to the racking of wine and well you 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.380
 go to the wines compose with the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.400
 grapes that you like most and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.560
 now we're going to do a little tour of 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.930
 grape varieties starting with the grape varieties 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.170
 quite simple we will start with 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.900
 red 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.799
 basically the red ones we have different 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.049
 styles 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.270
 if you want a light red wine that 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.600
 you are not attacking the palace rather easy 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.189
 to drink 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.829
 you will favor red wines 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.130
 made from range and or pinot 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.100
 black 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.860
 if you prefer red wines rather 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.110
 gourmand fruity round enough in the mouth 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.979
 I advise you to go on 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.969
 merlot or grenache two others 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.239
 grape varieties finally for lovers of red 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:12.090
 very powerful rather austere type 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.240
 bordeaux went on cabernet franc du 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.510
 Cabernet Sauvignon 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.270
 or then Cahors malbec it remains 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.740
 Finally, the warm wines type ribs 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.740
 rhone and ain these are made in 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:26.770
 general with syrah or 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.430
 bad that gives very spicy wines 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.870
 very powerful for whites now 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.580
 the first style of white wine 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.640
 knows it all is bright white wine 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.440
 well fresh well refreshing there in 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 general the grape varieties that are used 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.950
 it is often sauvignon or chenin 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.840
 White 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.600
 we then have exuberant white wines 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.850
 very fragrant very smooth wines 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.230
 alsatian example here is the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:55.630
 gewurztraminer of muscat these grape varieties that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.910
 make very fragrant wines and if you 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.000
 want white wines rather on the 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.850
 fruity red I advise you to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.960
 retain the chardonnay and viognier who 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.240
 often bring fruity notes 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.760
 sheep and make quite greedy wines there 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.740
 it was simple it's for wines 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.010
 single varietal a single variety of grapes 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.300
 used to make wine in France we have 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.190
 the habit for a very long time of 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.830
 make wines that assembles the grape varieties 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.180
 that is, they put 2 3 up to 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.580
 ten different varieties in the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.530
 bottle each grape variety will bring 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.450
 something more they are not for 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.670
 as much better or worse than 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.890
 single varietal wines they are just a little 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.280
 more difficult to choose and this is to 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.820
 you get used to it and try to 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.520
 discover them 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.310
 most of the time the bottles carry 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.740
 the name of the varietals written on the label 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.580
 main and if it is not on 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.680
 the main label 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.380
 on the counter label so take the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.730
 bottle look there and try to 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.990
 find the mention of the varietal often the 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.120
 producer will specify this wine is made to 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.710
 from the Cabernet Sauvignon grape variety 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.440
 this wine is made from the grape variety 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:04.960
 carignan it is quite explicit of 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.490
 tradition in France some bottles 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.650
 in particular appellations of origin 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.660
 controlled does not mention the name of the 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.480
 grape variety never mentions about 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.310
 the main label is rarely on 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.840
 counter label for example this wine 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.730
 of bourgogne which a puli nÃ®mes will have at 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.980
 does not specify to him that he is made to 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.790
 from chardonnay 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.840
 why do I know that it's made from 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.660
 of chardonnay because in general 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.100
 in Burgundy almost all 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.730
 whites are made from grape varieties 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.889
 Chardonnay 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.020
 I invite you to look at 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.310
 in the rack the other bottles 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.320
 which are made in the same area the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.560
 burgundy and we have one that will specify 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.120
 with what grapes effect the wine finally the 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.949
 grape variety is not everything in the wine there 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.300
 there is also the work of the winemaker and the 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.030
 style that wants to give 120 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:51.870
 the passage in barrels for example goes 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.940
 bring a good wood 0.20 soften the 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.250
 tannins and will give him some power 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.250
 on the other hand a wine work so 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.760
 mellows where we keep sugar is going to have 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.960
 a very sweet taste very sweet 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.580
 like a jam 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.740
 we can also make wines 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.880
 sparkling hules of carbon dioxide to 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.300
 inside which will bring a lot 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.820
 of freshness and there the grape variety and no premium 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.440
 more about how we worked the 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.360
 wine so check on the label 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.630
 how was the wine made to know 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.770
 please in conclusion know 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.240
 the wine requires a little bit of 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.760
 work so I advise you 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.310
 to learn the grape varieties in my life a 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.440
 twenty to know to be curious about 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.720
 test them test the carignan test from 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.830
 Merlot was testing Sauvignon and then you 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.400
 go find the grape that you 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.530
 is better 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.360
 but then choose your bottles 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.870
 according to the grape varieties that you 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.870
 please the most
