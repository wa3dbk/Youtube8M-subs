 today we look at windows 8 tablet 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.299
 asus vivotab note 8 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.160
 which is quite capable of becoming good 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.730
 Assistant as consumption and when 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.350
 creating multiple types of content front

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.820
 light sensor center space 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.530
 under the display glitters asus logo 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.670
 The frames around the screen are wide enough. 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 just for convenient location 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.420
 tablet in hand 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 herewith due to wider indents 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.410
 above and below the screen to hold the tablet 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 even more horizontally more convenient 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.200
 the operating system is sharpened by 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.539
 use it in landscape 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.039
 screen orientation 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.110
 lovers of thin frames around the display do not 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.879
 should immediately get upset track case with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.649
 asus vivotab note 8 you have to 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.199
 use Matthew stylus water on 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.239
 front of the tablet with thin frames 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.970
 use the stylus as a normal pen 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.890
 it would not be comfortable on the side faces 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.900
 devices are power buttons 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 turn off the volume control three s 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.420

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 except for the usual elements on the ends

 tablet as well as a card slot 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.700

 the stylus wakom as well as the start button all 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 elements on the edges will get located 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.180
 very competently well accessible not 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.240
 back of the tablet first 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.530
 all it will be evaluated tactilely vzya 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.180
 will get your hands you will feel 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.829
 rubberized plastic which is very 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.270
 nice to hold in your hands that will not give 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.909

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 different surfaces among competitors in 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.930
 in its class asus vivotab note 8 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 distinguished by the presence of the wacom digitizer 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.549
 which is included in the package 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.930

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.180
 the process of using the stylus produced 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.950
 purely pleasant impression he was 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 fairly long a little shorter 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
 standard pencil because of what is convenient 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 in use when writing notes 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.950
 or drawing the screen is not particularly highlighted 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.439
 among other competitors 8-inch plays 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.959
 matrix with a resolution of 1280 by 800 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.810
 Pixels are not the best for today 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.030
 decision 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.830
 the image is quite rich but with 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.080
 balloon user any android 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.150
 flagship seem a little 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.650
 pixelated matrix fulfills 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.410
 seventy six and six percent 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.880
 srgb palette than lose a little 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.489
 average modern 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.470
 tablets 83 percent viewing angles 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.470
 great images don't fade and not 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.550
 tarnishes when viewed from any angle 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.780
 The maximum brightness is very 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.459
 good 365 337 lux new same problem 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.830
 It turned out to work with the device on 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.410
 open sun is not a matter of viewing angles 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.600
 or low brightness in the glass covering 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.580
 the front of the tablet glass 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.830
 perfectly collects fat prints 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.510
 other dirt is therefore worth it 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.690
 get a cloth for permanent 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.410
 wiping thus vivotab display 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.849
 note 8 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.650
 can be called excellent by 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.599
 color reproduction and brightness level 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.310
 good in terms of resolution but 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.730
 impression spoil the protective 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.209
 glass 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.530
 collecting dirt even neighboring gadget 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.239
 although able to solve this problem 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.150
 branded cover from asus which inside 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.829
 made of cloth speaker and driven 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.500
 sonicmaster technology is enough 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.900
 loud for tablet for comfortable 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.549
 listening to music background or sound 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.829
 tracks when watching a video is quite 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.630
 enough but here's an 8 tablet running 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.489
 os windows 81 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.010
 with all the consequences of it 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.359
 the consequences of a full Windows received 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.370
 looks very strange on a small 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.440
 screen but in the end most applications 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.200
 used in modern mode 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.100
 asus vivotab note 8 runs on chip from 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.579
 intel companies 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.100
 four nuclear intel atom z 3740 with 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.900
 frequency of 1 33 gigahertz and two 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.910
 gigabytes of ram 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.609
 make the devices fast enough 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.500
 especially considering its price in asus games 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.510
 vivotab note 8 not turn liv 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.359
 twitching often missing 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.620
 frame rate but critical in this 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:01.299
 This is not the case because 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.109
 the device is not initially positioned 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:04.359
 like play 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.459
 rather created to perform perfectly 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.230
 other kind of tablet tasks besides 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.150
 frontal 1 and 2 megapixel 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.819
 camera for making video calls 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.620
 main 5 megapixel 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.780
 shoot with this camera important points 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.549
 your life is not recommended but removed 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.289
 important document or capture something 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.470
 on the move when the friend was only 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.820
 the tablet itself the camera is fast 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.919
 can run directly from the screen 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.360
 lock has a convenient interface and 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.710
 can shoot not rot and video in 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.570
 720p quality 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.490
 battery life probably 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.070
 most important indicators are portable 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.110
 device and that's got apnut 8 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.539
 battery capacity of 3 thousand 950 miliamper 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.699
 hours average performance 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:43.699
 character hours surfing through 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:45.990
 standard browser with medium brightness 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.400
 The indicator is not the largest on the tablet 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.860
 just enough for the whole working day 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.050
 many notes and sketches a few 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.150
 feet surfing in the browser music and video 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.449
 in this mode asus vivotab note 8 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.650
 ask for the outlet later in the evening 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:00.780

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:04.590
 thirty two and 6 four gigabytes 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:07.229
 memory and the price is about 330 370 dollars 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.580
 accordingly considering all possibilities 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.740
 this tablet when working with documents 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.550
 to create notes and sketches then she 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.570
 very acceptable let's generalize 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.979
 asus vivotab note 8 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.259
 perfect device to create 

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:20.729
 notes and sketches the tablet allows 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:22.259

 in the usual way 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:28.380
 whether business notes notes or 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.090
 sketching your ideas you just take 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.750
 stylus and start writing or drawing 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.710
 how would you do it on plain paper 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.360
 synchronization in the application of his legs 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.330
 will make the process of transferring information to 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.190
 your so far invisible perhaps laptop 8 not 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.050
 becomes a leader among competitors in 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.000
 display autonomy screen brightness 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.919
 or processor performance 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.500
 but its reasonableness as a device for 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.880
 creating a record just struck this 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.979

 which will replace the mass of summaries 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:56.310
 able to store and sync the whole 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.699
 necessary information in the best 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.889
 way 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.870
 And with an extra stylus asus vivotab 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.120
