00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.650 
hiding space for aiyla
so<00:02:57.820> I<00:02:57.850> have<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> fern<00:02:58.660> down<00:02:59.230> here<00:02:59.770> this<00:03:00.580> is<00:03:01.030> the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
so I have the fern down here this is the

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570 
so I have the fern down here this is the
plant<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.230> likes<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.770> lot<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.100> water<00:03:03.280> in

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
plant that likes a lot of water in

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.220 
plant that likes a lot of water in
comparison<00:03:04.150> to<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.420> bromeliad<00:03:04.990> which

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
comparison to the bromeliad which

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.890 
comparison to the bromeliad which
doesn't<00:03:05.950> need<00:03:06.070> too<00:03:06.400> much<00:03:06.760> not<00:03:07.360> as<00:03:07.480> much<00:03:07.660> as<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
doesn't need too much not as much as the

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.320 
doesn't need too much not as much as the
fern<00:03:08.140> so<00:03:08.500> that's<00:03:08.950> why<00:03:10.470> you're<00:03:11.470> right<00:03:11.680> I<00:03:11.710> laugh

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
fern so that's why you're right I laugh

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.540 
fern so that's why you're right I laugh
so<00:03:13.330> that's<00:03:13.450> why<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.720> fern<00:03:14.020> is<00:03:14.320> down<00:03:14.590> here<00:03:14.950> now

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
so that's why the fern is down here now

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.520 
so that's why the fern is down here now
for<00:03:15.630> ornaments<00:03:16.630> I<00:03:16.720> didn't<00:03:16.990> want<00:03:17.110> to<00:03:17.170> put<00:03:17.320> too

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
for ornaments I didn't want to put too

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.080 
for ornaments I didn't want to put too
many<00:03:17.620> ornaments<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.250> here<00:03:18.430> but<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.610> do<00:03:18.670> still

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
many ornaments in here but I do still

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.650 
many ornaments in here but I do still
have<00:03:19.300> my<00:03:19.570> skull<00:03:20.080> hide<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.090> obviously<00:03:22.090> style

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
have my skull hide and obviously style

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.110 
have my skull hide and obviously style
is<00:03:22.900> bones<00:03:23.320> that's<00:03:24.040> completely<00:03:24.430> natural<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:24.910> it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
is bones that's completely natural so it

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.180 
is bones that's completely natural so it
sort<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.360> fits<00:03:25.540> in<00:03:25.690> with<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.960> natural<00:03:26.200> theme

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
sort of fits in with the natural theme

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:31.020 
sort of fits in with the natural theme
going<00:03:27.730> on<00:03:28.020> now<00:03:29.020> down<00:03:29.200> the<00:03:29.350> back<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.770> have<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
going on now down the back I have the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.660 
going on now down the back I have the
fern<00:03:32.020> panels<00:03:32.770> which<00:03:32.950> apparently<00:03:33.310> if<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.460> keep

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
fern panels which apparently if you keep

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.700 
fern panels which apparently if you keep
really<00:03:33.970> wet<00:03:34.300> they<00:03:34.720> eventually<00:03:35.020> grow<00:03:35.440> moss

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
really wet they eventually grow moss

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.040 
really wet they eventually grow moss
which<00:03:35.980> should<00:03:36.130> look<00:03:36.280> really<00:03:36.580> cool<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.840> upper

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
which should look really cool the upper

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.770 
which should look really cool the upper
plant<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.530> planted<00:03:39.130> was<00:03:39.400> a<00:03:39.430> smaller<00:03:40.180> bromeliad

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
plant I planted was a smaller bromeliad

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.410 
plant I planted was a smaller bromeliad
which<00:03:41.020> is<00:03:41.200> an<00:03:41.350> earth<00:03:41.560> star<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:43.000> is<00:03:43.180> just

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
which is an earth star and that is just

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.710 
which is an earth star and that is just
down<00:03:43.600> underneath<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.470> main<00:03:45.460> bromeliad<00:03:46.060> now

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
down underneath the main bromeliad now

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.510 
down underneath the main bromeliad now
you<00:03:46.780> may<00:03:47.200> remember<00:03:47.440> me<00:03:47.830> saying<00:03:48.040> that<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.370> was

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
you may remember me saying that I was

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.790 
you may remember me saying that I was
going<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.700> plant<00:03:48.940> house<00:03:49.240> leaks<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.900> here<00:03:50.170> but

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
going to plant house leaks in here but

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.140 
going to plant house leaks in here but
whilst<00:03:51.010> doing<00:03:51.280> some<00:03:51.430> more<00:03:51.550> research<00:03:51.940> I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
whilst doing some more research I

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.820 
whilst doing some more research I
realized<00:03:52.360> that<00:03:52.660> they<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:53.110> don't<00:03:53.260> like<00:03:53.530> too

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
realized that they really don't like too

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.310 
realized that they really don't like too
much<00:03:53.950> damper<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:54.880> for<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.660> health<00:03:55.900> of<00:03:56.110> the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
much damper so for the health of the

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.010 
much damper so for the health of the
house<00:03:56.890> leak<00:03:57.160> I<00:03:57.310> decided<00:03:57.640> not<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.940> include<00:03:58.780> it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.020 
house leak I decided not to include it

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.670 
house leak I decided not to include it
but<00:03:59.680> we<00:03:59.800> do<00:04:00.010> have<00:04:00.270> loads<00:04:01.270> and<00:04:01.660> loads<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:02.440> air

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
but we do have loads and loads of air

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.390 
but we do have loads and loads of air
plants<00:04:03.430> now<00:04:04.030> you<00:04:04.090> may<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.570> noticed<00:04:04.900> up<00:04:05.080> here

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
plants now you may have noticed up here

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.730 
plants now you may have noticed up here
we<00:04:06.400> have<00:04:06.760> what<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.840> call<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:08.170> squid<00:04:08.590> or

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
we have what I like to call a squid or

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.460 
we have what I like to call a squid or
an<00:04:08.830> octopus<00:04:09.900> airplane<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.930> great<00:04:11.230> thing<00:04:11.410> about

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
an octopus airplane a great thing about

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.370 
an octopus airplane a great thing about
air<00:04:11.680> plants<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.070> you<00:04:12.220> can<00:04:12.370> really<00:04:12.670> do<00:04:12.940> all

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
air plants is you can really do all

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.010 
air plants is you can really do all
different<00:04:14.380> things<00:04:14.410> with<00:04:14.800> them<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.540> a<00:04:16.540> lot<00:04:16.989> of

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
different things with them and a lot of

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.110 
different things with them and a lot of
them<00:04:17.260> can<00:04:17.500> grow<00:04:17.830> upwards<00:04:18.549> there<00:04:18.970> will<00:04:19.090> be

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
them can grow upwards there will be

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.460 
them can grow upwards there will be
attracted<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.780> light<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.109> their<00:04:20.260> turn

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
attracted to the light and their turn

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.570 
attracted to the light and their turn
themselves<00:04:20.620> around<00:04:20.920> so<00:04:21.160> this<00:04:21.310> should<00:04:21.460> look

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
themselves around so this should look

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.730 
themselves around so this should look
really<00:04:22.030> cool<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:22.480> actually<00:04:22.840> ran<00:04:23.230> out<00:04:23.260> of<00:04:23.410> room

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
really cool I actually ran out of room

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.820 
really cool I actually ran out of room
to<00:04:24.040> put<00:04:24.280> these<00:04:24.550> because<00:04:25.090> they<00:04:25.720> also<00:04:26.020> don't

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
to put these because they also don't

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.340 
to put these because they also don't
really<00:04:27.070> like<00:04:27.190> being<00:04:27.370> in<00:04:27.490> dirt<00:04:27.790> so<00:04:28.150> if<00:04:28.870> you<00:04:29.050> put

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
really like being in dirt so if you put

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.790 
really like being in dirt so if you put
them<00:04:29.590> in<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.880> eco<00:04:31.360> earth<00:04:31.540> or<00:04:32.050> nestling<00:04:32.650> that's

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
them in the eco earth or nestling that's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.350 
them in the eco earth or nestling that's
going<00:04:32.920> to<00:04:32.980> be<00:04:33.100> kept<00:04:33.340> really<00:04:33.550> damp<00:04:33.880> they're

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
going to be kept really damp they're

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.180 
going to be kept really damp they're
going<00:04:34.480> to<00:04:34.540> probably<00:04:34.780> rot<00:04:35.260> and<00:04:35.500> not<00:04:35.680> do<00:04:35.890> so<00:04:36.070> well

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
going to probably rot and not do so well

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.370 
going to probably rot and not do so well
so<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.970> was<00:04:37.180> important<00:04:37.630> that<00:04:37.660> I<00:04:37.810> kept<00:04:38.140> them

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
so it was important that I kept them

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.630 
so it was important that I kept them
apart<00:04:39.450> really<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:42.040> may<00:04:42.190> be<00:04:42.250> able<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.490> see

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
apart really then you may be able to see

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.790 
apart really then you may be able to see
in<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:42.910> background<00:04:43.060> here<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.750> actually<00:04:44.470> made<00:04:44.770> a

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
in the background here I actually made a

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.930 
in the background here I actually made a
little<00:04:44.950> hole<00:04:45.040> in<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.580> polystyrene

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
little hole in the polystyrene

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.060 
little hole in the polystyrene
background<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.900> literally<00:04:47.530> just<00:04:47.590> stuffed

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
background and literally just stuffed

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.730 
background and literally just stuffed
the<00:04:48.430> end<00:04:48.640> of<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.540> air<00:04:49.690> plant<00:04:50.050> in<00:04:50.229> that<00:04:50.470> because

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
the end of the air plant in that because

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.860 
the end of the air plant in that because
that<00:04:50.860> will<00:04:50.950> do<00:04:51.100> perfectly<00:04:51.760> fine<00:04:51.940> in<00:04:52.090> there<00:04:52.300> the

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
that will do perfectly fine in there the

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:54.360 
that will do perfectly fine in there the
good<00:04:53.020> thing<00:04:53.200> is<00:04:53.320> as<00:04:53.470> well<00:04:53.620> as<00:04:53.800> it's<00:04:53.979> easy

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
good thing is as well as it's easy

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.760 
good thing is as well as it's easy
to<00:04:54.460> remove<00:04:54.760> so<00:04:54.970> if<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.150> need<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.470> submerge<00:04:56.470> in

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
to remove so if I need to submerge in

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.070 
to remove so if I need to submerge in
water<00:04:56.940> to<00:04:57.940> give<00:04:58.060> it<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.210> good<00:04:58.389> watering<00:04:58.840> it's

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
water to give it a good watering it's

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.170 
water to give it a good watering it's
very<00:04:59.380> easy<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.889> put<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:00.550> in<00:05:00.699> take<00:05:00.970> it<00:05:01.030> out

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
very easy just put it in take it out

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.230 
very easy just put it in take it out
very<00:05:01.690> simple<00:05:02.280> now<00:05:03.280> some<00:05:03.550> of<00:05:03.580> the<00:05:03.729> air<00:05:03.880> plants

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
very simple now some of the air plants

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.600 
very simple now some of the air plants
are<00:05:04.360> lowered<00:05:04.900> to<00:05:05.050> the<00:05:05.080> ground<00:05:05.220> but<00:05:06.220> they

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
are lowered to the ground but they

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.460 
are lowered to the ground but they
actually<00:05:06.790> have<00:05:07.090> stones<00:05:07.510> underneath<00:05:07.900> them<00:05:08.260> so

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
actually have stones underneath them so

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.590 
actually have stones underneath them so
they're<00:05:09.040> not<00:05:09.070> actually<00:05:09.280> directly<00:05:09.880> on<00:05:10.150> the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
they're not actually directly on the

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.450 
they're not actually directly on the
damp<00:05:10.900> eco<00:05:11.350> earth<00:05:11.530> they're<00:05:11.770> actually<00:05:12.100> above

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
damp eco earth they're actually above

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.790 
damp eco earth they're actually above
that<00:05:12.729> so<00:05:13.600> hopefully<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.320> should<00:05:14.440> work<00:05:14.650> out

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
that so hopefully that should work out

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.030 
that so hopefully that should work out
well<00:05:15.070> for<00:05:15.100> them<00:05:15.430> as<00:05:16.020> for<00:05:17.020> moss<00:05:17.229> I<00:05:17.500> didn't<00:05:17.860> go

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
well for them as for moss I didn't go

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.150 
well for them as for moss I didn't go
for<00:05:18.340> the<00:05:18.400> eco<00:05:18.880> Earth<00:05:19.030> forest<00:05:19.810> moss<00:05:20.110> I<00:05:20.440> bought

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
for the eco Earth forest moss I bought

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.980 
for the eco Earth forest moss I bought
that<00:05:21.400> because<00:05:21.699> it<00:05:21.790> makes<00:05:21.940> 14<00:05:22.449> liters<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.810> moss

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
that because it makes 14 liters of moss

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.900 
that because it makes 14 liters of moss
and<00:05:23.260> it's<00:05:23.620> really<00:05:23.860> cheap<00:05:24.040> enough<00:05:24.220> less<00:05:24.460> ideal

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
and it's really cheap enough less ideal

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.370 
and it's really cheap enough less ideal
and<00:05:25.360> I<00:05:25.750> made<00:05:26.139> it<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.530> it<00:05:27.070> smelt<00:05:27.370> so<00:05:28.150> bad<00:05:28.539> it

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
and I made it and it smelt so bad it

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.200 
and I made it and it smelt so bad it
smells<00:05:29.710> like<00:05:29.800> a<00:05:29.949> swamp<00:05:30.400> or<00:05:30.669> like<00:05:30.910> if<00:05:31.060> you've

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
smells like a swamp or like if you've

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.850 
smells like a swamp or like if you've
been<00:05:31.360> down<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.539> beach<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.080> the<00:05:32.169> tide<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.740> out

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
been down the beach and the tide is out

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.430 
been down the beach and the tide is out
it's<00:05:33.130> so<00:05:33.550> disgusting<00:05:34.479> so<00:05:34.840> I<00:05:34.870> actually<00:05:35.050> found

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
it's so disgusting so I actually found

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.100 
it's so disgusting so I actually found
some<00:05:35.740> of<00:05:35.800> my<00:05:35.860> old<00:05:36.070> moss<00:05:36.430> and<00:05:36.820> that<00:05:37.720> I<00:05:37.750> hadn't

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
some of my old moss and that I hadn't

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.020 
some of my old moss and that I hadn't
actually<00:05:38.229> used<00:05:38.620> yet<00:05:38.860> added<00:05:39.280> some<00:05:39.430> water<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.880> it

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
actually used yet added some water to it

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.120 
actually used yet added some water to it

that
coconut<00:05:47.560> succulent<00:05:48.400> squid<00:05:48.850> hide<00:05:49.419> thing<00:05:49.870> she's

coconut succulent squid hide thing she's
actually<00:05:50.169> been<00:05:50.410> on<00:05:50.440> top<00:05:50.710> of<00:05:50.830> that<00:05:50.949> so<00:05:51.160> that's

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
actually been on top of that so that's

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.400 
actually been on top of that so that's
really<00:05:51.520> cool<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.880> see<00:05:51.940> remember<00:05:52.720> maybe<00:05:53.139> come

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
really cool to see remember maybe come

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.020 
really cool to see remember maybe come
back<00:05:53.620> in<00:05:53.889> a<00:05:54.370> few<00:05:55.270> weeks<00:05:56.100> also<00:05:57.100> and<00:05:57.430> all<00:05:57.820> of

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
back in a few weeks also and all of

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:59.460 
back in a few weeks also and all of
these<00:05:58.120> air<00:05:58.330> plants<00:05:58.780> may<00:05:59.080> have<00:05:59.260> grown<00:05:59.440> even

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
these air plants may have grown even

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.500 
these air plants may have grown even
more<00:05:59.919> and<00:06:00.310> the<00:06:00.460> ultimate<00:06:00.940> test<00:06:01.150> for<00:06:01.419> this

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
more and the ultimate test for this

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:03.659 
more and the ultimate test for this
light<00:06:01.990> that<00:06:02.020> I'm<00:06:02.289> using<00:06:02.440> which<00:06:02.620> is<00:06:02.800> an<00:06:02.919> Arcadia

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
light that I'm using which is an Arcadia

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.790 
light that I'm using which is an Arcadia
jungle<00:06:04.180> dawn<00:06:04.479> which<00:06:05.260> I'll<00:06:05.380> probably<00:06:05.500> do<00:06:05.770> a

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
jungle dawn which I'll probably do a

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.270 
jungle dawn which I'll probably do a
review<00:06:06.220> on<00:06:06.330> soon<00:06:07.500> but<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.620> ultimate<00:06:09.010> test<00:06:09.190> for

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 
review on soon but the ultimate test for

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.159 
review on soon but the ultimate test for
is<00:06:09.520> to<00:06:09.669> see<00:06:09.880> whether<00:06:10.180> this<00:06:10.360> earth<00:06:10.570> style<00:06:10.960> will

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
is to see whether this earth style will

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.690 
is to see whether this earth style will
change<00:06:11.380> color<00:06:11.680> because<00:06:11.889> apparently<00:06:12.550> with<00:06:12.669> a

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
change color because apparently with a

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:14.730 
change color because apparently with a
proper<00:06:13.060> lighting<00:06:13.270> it<00:06:13.660> will<00:06:13.810> turn<00:06:13.990> a<00:06:14.020> nice<00:06:14.260> red

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
proper lighting it will turn a nice red

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.460 
proper lighting it will turn a nice red
color<00:06:15.039> so<00:06:15.820> let's<00:06:16.360> hope<00:06:16.539> so<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:16.870> a<00:06:17.169> really<00:06:17.349> good

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
color so let's hope so and a really good

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:19.110 
color so let's hope so and a really good
thing<00:06:17.680> about<00:06:17.770> this<00:06:18.010> I<00:06:18.130> have<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.639> say<00:06:18.849> is

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
thing about this I have to say is

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.450 
thing about this I have to say is
Ireland<00:06:19.960> doesn't<00:06:20.110> seem<00:06:20.410> too<00:06:20.680> disturbed<00:06:21.190> by

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:21.460 
Ireland doesn't seem too disturbed by

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.310 
Ireland doesn't seem too disturbed by
this<00:06:21.610> lighting<00:06:21.940> but<00:06:22.750> I'm<00:06:22.870> not<00:06:23.020> going<00:06:23.199> to<00:06:23.260> be

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
this lighting but I'm not going to be

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.800 
this lighting but I'm not going to be
keeping<00:06:23.620> it<00:06:23.710> on<00:06:23.770> all<00:06:24.010> the<00:06:24.250> time<00:06:24.520> maybe<00:06:25.389> just<00:06:25.720> a

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810 
keeping it on all the time maybe just a

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.689 
keeping it on all the time maybe just a
little<00:06:25.840> bit<00:06:26.080> in<00:06:26.199> the<00:06:26.289> morning<00:06:26.710> so<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.310> plants

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
little bit in the morning so the plants
