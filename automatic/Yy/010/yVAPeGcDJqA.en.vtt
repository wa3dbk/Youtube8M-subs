00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:07.090
 Hmm 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 ni 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.210
 7 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.570
 It is a cub that was three months after planting 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:25.810
 Harvest until Hiæš´proceeds has been quite lush in the first flower cluster table 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:27.039
 The leaves of the lower part are moldy and sick if we leave this evening to meet the summer from here 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.880
 It causes 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.880
 Let the work of arranging the branch won in the is 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:43.440
 It is a leaf of the lower side, and Katsuchi Daiichi stock is the second or a rod is around the end of the harvest 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.129
 I will take from the leaves 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.129
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.510
 Turn 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.310
 Hmm 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.180
 This was in advance you whether firmly day hit is the real and 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.180
 We will increase the speed of chewing 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:24.090
 Thus entry of mold and disease by becoming airy vacant Kabumoto 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.960
 Then, because it was raining, harmful microorganisms in the soil bounced back and it was possible to invade. 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.960
 Can prevent 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:38.640
 Finally clean up here to continue the sperm directly below 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.230
 This way you can get pretty good airy and therefore lower the risk of illness 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.130
 And 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.130
 The first top and the second crop will be finished soon 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:53.500
 The tomato needs to be ripe from now 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.789
 There is no problem in the harvest if the leaves above the fruit remain 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:04.200
 The lower harvest ends because the loss so leaves around it 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:04.200
 In particular, it is recommended to remove the leaves below the grass very well
