 while serving guys and welcome to this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.039
 new video on my channel 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 this just a short one 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.090
 video because I just wanted to say that I 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.309
 go live streaming tonight 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.170
 probably from 8 am because I had 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.940
 put a poll online of barbecues live 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.829
 stream and I saw the most votes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.800
 were from 8 to 12 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.420
 now also on the options between 8 and 12 so 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.129
 I think from 8 to 12 or something 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.690
 I mention just look I am home alone 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.879
 still so i can actually 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.590
 stream as long as I want but then I have to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.120
 I just take breaks and stuff 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.379
 four consecutive hours has occurred 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.059
 by streaming 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.469
 I have little experience with stream 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.149
 and I also have to go him for four hours 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.670
 stream so I don't think it goes 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.640
 be where I go live three tonight 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.080
 hours on twitch.tv slash josh joris link 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.820
 is stated in the description on the left 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280
 particles can also click 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.100
 subscribe 11 fraver i'm new that 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.689
 he is just following me there because i am 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.040
 you just get such a message from it 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.390
 when I'm lazy 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.610
 you can also just look on twitter because 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.650
 I was asked on Twitter 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 making everyone want me to go live 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.580
 stream so you don't follow me yet 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.080
 twitter really just do this kind of thing 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.159
 so I only ask things on twitter and 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.329
 not on youtube 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.000
 discover that it is all about making video 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.020
 in which I ask how last will I be 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.490
 live streaming 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.409
 and then I need another video on it 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.630
 what time is it then the live stream 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.320
 easy because on him just on twitter 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.600
