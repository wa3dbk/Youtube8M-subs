this<00:00:02.820> short<00:00:03.720> video<00:00:03.870> looks<00:00:04.290> at<00:00:04.470> patterns

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
this short video looks at patterns

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.770 
this short video looks at patterns
within<00:00:05.490> number<00:00:06.150> grids<00:00:06.359> and<00:00:08.210> shows<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> simple

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
within number grids and shows a simple

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.330 
within number grids and shows a simple
example<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.559> algebraic<00:00:11.519> proof<00:00:13.040> now<00:00:14.040> if<00:00:14.219> we

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
example of algebraic proof now if we

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.760 
example of algebraic proof now if we
look<00:00:14.460> at<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.820> cross<00:00:15.480> shape<00:00:15.809> which<00:00:16.590> I've

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
look at this cross shape which I've

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.710 
look at this cross shape which I've
drawn<00:00:17.100> within<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.789> grid<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:19.910> if<00:00:20.910> we<00:00:21.180> add<00:00:21.449> up

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
drawn within the grid and if we add up

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:33.290 
drawn within the grid and if we add up
the<00:00:22.170> four<00:00:22.590> outer<00:00:23.430> numbers<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.260> grid<00:00:32.300> then

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the four outer numbers in the grid then

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:43.270 
the four outer numbers in the grid then
the<00:00:33.899> answer<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.540> particular<00:00:36.920> sum<00:00:38.270> is<00:00:41.180> 184

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
the answer to that particular sum is 184

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.190 
the answer to that particular sum is 184
now<00:00:44.280> interestingly<00:00:44.640> enough<00:00:45.180> if<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.930> look<00:00:46.079> at

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
now interestingly enough if you look at

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.540 
now interestingly enough if you look at
the<00:00:46.289> centre<00:00:46.860> number<00:00:47.480> 46<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:49.730> times<00:00:50.730> that<00:00:51.000> by<00:00:51.149> 4

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
the centre number 46 and times that by 4

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:01.819 
the centre number 46 and times that by 4
then<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.670> also<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:56.840> 184<00:01:00.140> so<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.260> appears<00:01:01.590> that

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
then we also get 184 so it appears that

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.969 
then we also get 184 so it appears that
if<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.370> add<00:01:02.609> up<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.090> four<00:01:03.539> outer<00:01:03.809> numbers<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
if you add up the four outer numbers the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.539 
if you add up the four outer numbers the
answer<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.610> 4<00:01:06.119> times<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:07.260> inner<00:01:08.159> number<00:01:08.640> and

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
answer is 4 times the inner number and

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.929 
answer is 4 times the inner number and
whenever<00:01:11.549> we<00:01:11.790> draw<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.450> cross<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.439> grid

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
whenever we draw this cross on the grid

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.770 
whenever we draw this cross on the grid
whilst<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.240> answer<00:01:15.780> will<00:01:15.900> change<00:01:17.509> it<00:01:18.509> will

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
whilst the answer will change it will

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.920 
whilst the answer will change it will
always<00:01:19.200> equal<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:20.369> lots<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.270> center

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
always equal for lots of the center

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.070 
always equal for lots of the center
number<00:01:22.409> now<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.460> can<00:01:23.729> prove<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.180> by<00:01:24.659> doing<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
number now we can prove this by doing a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
number now we can prove this by doing a
bit<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.380> algebra<00:01:27.140> if<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.409> call<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.130> number<00:01:29.759> in

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
bit of algebra if we call the number in

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.700 
bit of algebra if we call the number in
the<00:01:30.000> middle<00:01:30.030> n<00:01:32.930> that's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.170> general<00:01:35.509> number

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the middle n that's a general number

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.630 
the middle n that's a general number
that<00:01:37.710> could<00:01:37.860> be<00:01:37.979> 46<00:01:38.640> 76<00:01:39.439> 443<00:01:40.439> 15<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.340> doesn't

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
that could be 46 76 443 15 it doesn't

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.810 
that could be 46 76 443 15 it doesn't
matter<00:01:41.759> however<00:01:42.439> whenever<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.740> draw<00:01:44.040> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
matter however whenever you draw the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.100 
matter however whenever you draw the
cross<00:01:45.060> shape<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:46.500> number<00:01:46.920> above<00:01:47.899> will<00:01:48.899> always

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cross shape the number above will always

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.789 
cross shape the number above will always
be<00:01:49.259> 10<00:01:49.560> less<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.240> Center<00:01:51.600> number<00:01:51.799> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
be 10 less than the Center number so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.840 
be 10 less than the Center number so
this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.640> n<00:01:54.200> take<00:01:55.340> 10<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.380> number<00:01:58.710> below<00:01:59.280> will

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this is n take 10 the number below will

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
this is n take 10 the number below will
always<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> 10<00:02:00.719> more<00:02:01.229> than<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.500> number<00:02:02.340> n<00:02:03.469> plus

and<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.930> number<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:14.349> left<00:02:14.439> is<00:02:15.249> always<00:02:15.609> one

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
and the number to the left is always one

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:22.140 
and the number to the left is always one
less<00:02:16.150> that's<00:02:16.930> n<00:02:17.609> take<00:02:18.609> one<00:02:19.769> now<00:02:20.769> if<00:02:21.189> we<00:02:21.400> now<00:02:21.790> add

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
less that's n take one now if we now add

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.509 
less that's n take one now if we now add
up<00:02:22.450> these<00:02:22.659> four<00:02:23.230> outer<00:02:24.060> algebraic<00:02:25.060> answers<00:02:26.519> we

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
up these four outer algebraic answers we

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.839 
up these four outer algebraic answers we
have<00:02:27.549> an<00:02:27.790> N<00:02:27.999> minus<00:02:28.030> 1<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:30.459> have<00:02:30.609> a<00:02:30.639> n<00:02:31.200> minus<00:02:32.200> 10

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
have an N minus 1 we have a n minus 10

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:41.190 
have an N minus 1 we have a n minus 10
we<00:02:33.849> have<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.030> n<00:02:34.599> plus<00:02:35.590> 1<00:02:35.859> and<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.480> n<00:02:37.980> plus<00:02:38.980> 10<00:02:40.200> now

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
we have a n plus 1 and a n plus 10 now

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.369 
we have a n plus 1 and a n plus 10 now
here<00:02:41.469> I<00:02:41.500> can<00:02:41.769> see<00:02:41.919> an<00:02:42.040> N<00:02:42.280> and<00:02:42.489> N<00:02:42.969> and<00:02:43.359> n<00:02:43.659> which

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
here I can see an N and N and n which

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.720 
here I can see an N and N and n which
equals<00:02:44.859> 4<00:02:45.579> then<00:02:46.169> but<00:02:47.169> the<00:02:47.950> minus<00:02:48.370> 1<00:02:48.549> here

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
equals 4 then but the minus 1 here

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.839 
equals 4 then but the minus 1 here
cancels<00:02:49.510> with<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:49.750> plus<00:02:49.959> 1<00:02:50.169> here<00:02:50.439> the<00:02:51.340> minus

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
cancels with the plus 1 here the minus

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.080 
cancels with the plus 1 here the minus
10<00:02:52.299> cancels<00:02:53.079> with<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.349> plus<00:02:53.590> 10<00:02:53.859> here<00:02:54.129> so<00:02:54.280> that

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
10 cancels with the plus 10 here so that

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.339 
10 cancels with the plus 10 here so that
is<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.689> answer

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:56.349 
is just the answer

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.259 
is just the answer
oh<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:58.629> the<00:02:59.139> center<00:02:59.439> number<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.889> N<00:03:00.129> and<00:03:00.310> if<00:03:01.209> we

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
oh and the center number is N and if we

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.629 
oh and the center number is N and if we
do<00:03:01.389> n<00:03:01.599> times<00:03:01.959> 4<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:03.010> also<00:03:03.189> get<00:03:03.609> 4n<00:03:05.459> so<00:03:06.459> we've

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
do n times 4 we also get 4n so we've

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.899 
do n times 4 we also get 4n so we've
proven<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.419> result<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.469> doesn't<00:03:08.769> matter<00:03:08.919> what

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
proven the result it doesn't matter what

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.270 
proven the result it doesn't matter what
the<00:03:10.060> center<00:03:10.359> number<00:03:10.510> is<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.379> outer<00:03:11.620> numbers

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
the center number is the outer numbers

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.539 
the center number is the outer numbers
will<00:03:12.909> always<00:03:13.060> add<00:03:13.449> up<00:03:13.480> to<00:03:13.689> 4<00:03:14.530> lots<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
will always add up to 4 lots of the

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:19.439 
will always add up to 4 lots of the
center<00:03:16.439> number
