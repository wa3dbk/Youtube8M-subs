00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.500
 ladder drawn in two needles I have 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.680
 called to this point openwork ladder is 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.200
 very nice the scarves at this point is 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.869
 they look beautiful in thick wool 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.419
 in thin wool in a thread they look 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.500
 spectacular as a decoration for a 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.550
 sweater a full sweater whatever you want 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.460
 it is targeted has the characteristic 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.040
 that you go for the right is not 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 reversible clear that if you look at it 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.870
 well for the reverse it's very pretty should 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:52.289
 Always mount points multiples of 6 and 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 they must add two edge points to it 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.969
 first and last in the case of this 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:03.449
 Openwork lace always the edge point 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.810
 is done right by the right right 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.810
 on the reverse the first and the last 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.810
 forever 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.960
 go ahead these races so that you 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.490
 see how cute is the stitch but 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 in this case we are going to do the following 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:22.890
 of account finished assembling or molding 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.730
 the necessary points that is to say 18 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.330
 points 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:31.540
 that would be three reasons plus both 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.660
 edge points that gives me 20 points with 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.390
 which I worked on this sample we are going to 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:40.710
 start step by step making an account 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.870
 that we are going to start the first race 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.600
 one thing is pointed so beautiful no 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.270
 has but two races consequently 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.370
 It's not only pretty but easy 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.160
 we started with career number one the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.010
 edge point as I always told you what 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.830
 we do in a right point to 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.690
 then a loop is going to do 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.870
 well slowly so they do not run out 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.870
 no doubt then some step 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.509
 a point he took it in half I pass a 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.090
 point 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.659
 the next step means that step two 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.060
 points then some right point the 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.780
 following 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:25.560
 and then I return the two points that do not 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.700
 I have you over the knitting but I do 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.599
 first the 1 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.050
 and then the other that makes me this 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.050
 chain 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.360
 and then I make a loop 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.480
 a reverse point 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.870
 a right point 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:54.250
 a reverse point and that's where the first one ended 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.250
 design of the openwork staircase 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.720
 we are going to repeat it again so that 

00:02:57.189 --> 00:03:01.180
 they have no doubt in any way 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.489
 If you have any questions, visit me 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.620
 page how to knit dotcom and there 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.100
 find the written instructions of 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.780
 this video 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.600
 we started again 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.050
 a loop 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.890
 I pass a point 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:23.270
 step the second point 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:26.050
 I leave you in the right point the next one and 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.970
 of the two that I went through without knitting 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:35.840
 I return one and I return the second 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.790
 and a loop 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 a reverse point 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.610
 a right point 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.950
 and a reverse point to finish the 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:51.120
 second reason we're going to do it for 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.180
 third time slowly first a 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.860
 laced 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.440
 I pass a point 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.090
 step to the next 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:07.440
 yew at a right point the one that follows 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:11.730
 I return a point I return the yes or 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.050
 I pass the non-woven stitches the steps 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.050
 over the knitting 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.609
 a loop a backhand 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.700
 a right point 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.970
 a reverse point there ends the design that 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.560
 continue the last point at a point 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.560
 right that is the edge 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.660
 I finished the first race of the 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.120
 openwork stairway let's go to the second 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.600
 race on the wrong side like what 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.630
 we make the edge first at a point 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.560
 right always below we do 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.560
 a right 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.830
 a reverse point 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:01.630
 a right point 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:03.620
 and three points in backhand one 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:09.880
 two 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:11.950
 and 3a and I finished the first design 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.200
 repeat 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.190
 a right 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.190
 a reverse 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:23.430
 one right and three points in reverse point 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:27.500
 one 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.500
 2 and 3 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.350
 there are two designs and we will repeat it 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.449
 last time 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.460
 a right 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.160
 a reverse 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.590
 a right 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.360
 three points in backhand point one 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:50.750
 two 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.150
 and three the last point that is the one of 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.759
 edge as we already said always in a 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.650
 point of the bug when we have done these 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:06:00.490
 two lines these two races or rows 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:03.250
 we have done 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.789
 the first stitch design then 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:10.150
 then you who do repeat 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:12.479
 these two careers the law and the 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.310
 upside down as many times as necessary 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.650
 to finish for example the scarf 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.810
 let's say here I have 20 points if I 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.780
 I add another 20 I'm spectacular 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.120
 the scarf does not project if it is in wax 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.400
 everything depends on the size that we are going to 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.560
 make the tissue let's look at it for the point 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.610
 on the right side 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.070
 perfect then as I told you about 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.960
 please enter my page how to weave 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:41.320
 dotcom where you find not only 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.840
 the written part of this video and the 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:45.820
 same video but all the videos that 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:48.840
 we are constantly getting out of these 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.840
 stitches so pretty
