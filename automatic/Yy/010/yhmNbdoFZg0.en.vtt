twisty very very quickly on average is a

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.510 
twisty very very quickly on average is a
corner<00:01:04.699> about<00:01:05.000> every<00:01:05.650> 300<00:01:06.650> meters<00:01:06.950> or<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.310> and

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
everyone is pretty well a hairpin you

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.010 
everyone is pretty well a hairpin you
can<00:01:09.619> feel<00:01:09.800> the<00:01:09.950> size<00:01:10.220> of<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.490> seat<00:01:10.869> holding<00:01:11.869> me

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
up the lumbar supports there as we go

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.710 
up the lumbar supports there as we go
around<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:14.090> corners

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720

each<00:01:15.050> drop<00:01:15.619> off<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.970> probably<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:17.570> don't<00:01:17.690> look

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
each drop off is probably I don't look

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.650 
each drop off is probably I don't look
down<00:01:18.080> it<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.560> it's<00:01:19.400> pretty<00:01:19.790> yeah<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:20.450> pretty

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
down it so it's pretty yeah it's pretty

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.469

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
far is at least a 2 or 300 meters but

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.749

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
the wall is really the only thing

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:33.370 
the wall is really the only thing
between<00:01:27.560> you<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:28.330> nothing<00:01:32.200> now<00:01:33.200> we're<00:01:33.320> doing

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
between you and nothing now we're doing

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.290

about<00:01:33.500> 50<00:01:33.979> miles<00:01:34.130> an<00:01:34.310> hour<00:01:34.460> into<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.820> corner

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
about 50 miles an hour into the corner

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.530 
about 50 miles an hour into the corner
now<00:01:35.990> when<00:01:36.229> we<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.440> this<00:01:36.560> in<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.770> dark<00:01:37.360> we<00:01:38.360> won't

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.330 
front that's the infrared bulb and
without<00:03:59.599> that<00:03:59.780> we<00:03:59.930> wouldn't<00:04:00.110> see<00:04:00.349> anything<00:04:01.010> so

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
without that we wouldn't see anything so

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.400 
without that we wouldn't see anything so
it's<00:04:02.150> not<00:04:02.330> like<00:04:02.480> we're<00:04:02.660> cheating<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.170> haven't

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
it's not like we're cheating and haven't

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.289 
it's not like we're cheating and haven't
covered<00:04:03.709> up<00:04:03.830> all<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.190> bulbs<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:04.940> do<00:04:05.120> knew

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
covered up all the bulbs but you do knew

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.080 
covered up all the bulbs but you do knew
that<00:04:05.569> infrared<00:04:05.930> to<00:04:06.230> be<00:04:06.380> able<00:04:06.440> to<00:04:06.590> pick<00:04:07.519> out<00:04:07.730> all

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
that infrared to be able to pick out all

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.150 
that infrared to be able to pick out all
the<00:04:08.569> markings<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.140> look<00:04:09.319> at<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.530> screen<00:04:09.890> you

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
the markings but look at the screen you

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.860 
the markings but look at the screen you
can<00:04:10.489> see<00:04:10.640> the<00:04:10.730> wall<00:04:10.940> there's<00:04:11.480> there's<00:04:11.780> the

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
can see the wall there's there's the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.330 
can see the wall there's there's the
marker<00:04:12.290> coming<00:04:12.500> up<00:04:12.650> on<00:04:12.769> the<00:04:12.859> right<00:04:13.010> hand<00:04:13.220> side

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
marker coming up on the right hand side

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.860 
marker coming up on the right hand side
and<00:04:13.970> just<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.930> remind<00:04:15.200> you<00:04:15.470> out<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.310> window

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
and just to remind you out of the window

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.279 
and just to remind you out of the window
is<00:04:17.870> about<00:04:18.289> a<00:04:18.910> 300-foot<00:04:19.910> drop<00:04:20.090> and<00:04:20.989> beyond<00:04:21.260> that

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
is about a 300-foot drop and beyond that

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.380 
is about a 300-foot drop and beyond that
another<00:04:21.709> 300<00:04:22.220> foot<00:04:22.340> drop<00:04:22.640> and<00:04:22.850> another<00:04:23.060> 300

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
another 300 foot drop and another 300

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.219 
another 300 foot drop and another 300
foot<00:04:23.810> drop

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
foot drop

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.469 
foot drop
so<00:04:24.500> going<00:04:24.710> through<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:25.100> wall<00:04:25.280> would<00:04:26.150> end<00:04:26.360> up

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
so going through the wall would end up

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.790 
so going through the wall would end up
in<00:04:26.660> a<00:04:26.870> really<00:04:27.020> rather<00:04:27.410> nasty<00:04:27.770> sticky<00:04:28.340> mess<00:04:29.800> and

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
in a really rather nasty sticky mess and

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.870 
in a really rather nasty sticky mess and
here<00:04:30.950> we<00:04:31.039> are<00:04:31.070> we're<00:04:31.250> doing<00:04:31.310> about<00:04:31.490> 40

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
here we are we're doing about 40

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.680 
here we are we're doing about 40
kilometres<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.450> now<00:04:32.539> it's<00:04:32.690> 25<00:04:33.140> miles<00:04:33.380> an<00:04:33.590> hour

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
kilometres and now it's 25 miles an hour

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.210 
kilometres and now it's 25 miles an hour
the<00:04:35.690> vision<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.169> really<00:04:36.650> quite<00:04:36.919> impressive

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
the vision is really quite impressive

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.450 
the vision is really quite impressive
now<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.610> original<00:04:38.240> idea<00:04:38.930> for<00:04:38.990> this<00:04:39.350> is<00:04:39.740> not<00:04:40.160> so

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
now the original idea for this is not so

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.279 
now the original idea for this is not so
that's<00:04:40.610> idiots<00:04:41.060> like<00:04:41.240> us<00:04:41.479> driving<00:04:41.870> around<00:04:42.139> in

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
that's idiots like us driving around in

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.110 
that's idiots like us driving around in
the<00:04:42.410> pitch-black<00:04:42.669> doing<00:04:43.669> something<00:04:44.000> which

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
the pitch-black doing something which

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.150 
the pitch-black doing something which
possibly<00:04:44.360> we<00:04:44.720> shouldn't<00:04:44.990> be<00:04:45.080> doing<00:04:45.289> but<00:04:46.039> it's

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.160 
possibly we shouldn't be doing but it's

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.510 
possibly we shouldn't be doing but it's
to<00:04:46.340> highlight<00:04:46.580> animals<00:04:47.419> children<00:04:48.260> to<00:04:49.070> help<00:04:49.310> in

really low light situations in towns

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.010 
really low light situations in towns
maybe<00:04:52.970> go<00:04:53.180> through<00:04:53.360> a<00:04:53.419> forest<00:04:53.780> where<00:04:53.960> an

maybe go through a forest where an

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.080 
maybe go through a forest where an
animal<00:04:54.380> might<00:04:54.530> ran<00:04:54.770> out<00:04:54.919> in<00:04:55.070> front<00:04:55.310> if<00:04:55.910> you've

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
animal might ran out in front if you've

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.270 
animal might ran out in front if you've

bicycle or a motorbike or whatever you
can<00:05:03.620> see<00:05:03.830> how<00:05:04.130> those<00:05:04.400> bodies<00:05:04.850> light<00:05:05.600> up<00:05:05.840> really

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
can see how those bodies light up really

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.260 
can see how those bodies light up really
hot<00:05:06.620> and<00:05:07.039> it's<00:05:07.250> almost<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.639> same<00:05:07.820> thing<00:05:07.880> here

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
except it's reflection you can see it's

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.820

thanks to this infrared camera and then
it's<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.729> wall<00:05:42.879> it's<00:05:43.060> a<00:05:43.150> bigger<00:05:43.419> wall<00:05:43.689> to

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
it's the wall it's a bigger wall to

it's the wall it's a bigger wall to
don't<00:05:44.319> be<00:05:44.349> hitting<00:05:44.530> that<00:05:44.969> so<00:05:45.969> this<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.210> the
