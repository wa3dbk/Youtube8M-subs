different parts of your backstory

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.920 
different parts of your backstory
writing<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.939> can<00:01:59.090> see<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.360> all<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.510> front<00:01:59.840> of

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
writing you can see it all in front of

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.750 
writing you can see it all in front of
you<00:02:00.020> as<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.409> see<00:02:00.619> here<00:02:00.860> they<00:02:00.979> have<00:02:01.010> tabs

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
you as you can see here they have tabs

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.480 
you as you can see here they have tabs
that<00:02:02.060> go<00:02:02.270> across<00:02:02.960> here<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:03.950> I'm<00:02:04.130> I'm

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
that go across here and I'm I'm

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.690 
that go across here and I'm I'm
basically<00:02:05.119> I'm<00:02:05.390> right<00:02:06.200> now<00:02:06.350> I'm<00:02:06.700> reorganizing

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
basically I'm right now I'm reorganizing

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.149 
basically I'm right now I'm reorganizing
this<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:08.479> I<00:02:08.780> think<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.649> good<00:02:09.799> time<00:02:10.009> to

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:10.159 
this but I think it's a good time to

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.160 
this but I think it's a good time to
show<00:02:10.189> you<00:02:10.399> kind<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> way<00:02:11.330> I<00:02:11.360> work<00:02:11.870> with

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
show you kind of the way I work with

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.880 
show you kind of the way I work with
this<00:02:12.439> and<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.780> they<00:02:14.959> have<00:02:15.140> tabs<00:02:15.500> at<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.769> top

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
this and so they have tabs at the top

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.780 
this and so they have tabs at the top
and<00:02:16.459> then<00:02:17.030> when<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:17.450> click<00:02:18.049> on<00:02:18.230> each<00:02:18.500> tab<00:02:18.950> they

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
and then when you click on each tab they

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.580 
and then when you click on each tab they
have<00:02:21.790> notes<00:02:22.790> running<00:02:23.239> down<00:02:23.419> this<00:02:24.049> way<00:02:24.349> that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
have notes running down this way that

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.540

everything like that and I have worked
with<00:02:36.100> software<00:02:37.100> that's<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:38.420> geared

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
with software that's really geared

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.520 
with software that's really geared
towards<00:02:39.070> organizing<00:02:40.070> writing<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.530> the

towards organizing writing and the

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.030 
towards organizing writing and the
problem<00:02:42.980> I<00:02:43.130> have<00:02:43.400> with<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:45.560> other<00:02:45.590> software

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
problem I have with the other software

problem I have with the other software
I've<00:02:46.430> used<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.000> everything<00:02:47.420> is<00:02:47.690> pretty<00:02:47.990> much

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
I've used is everything is pretty much

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.210

worlds to it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.710 
worlds to it
so<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.440> pre-created<00:03:18.980> world<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.790> when<00:03:20.690> I

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
so in the pre-created world I when I

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.260 
so in the pre-created world I when I
first<00:03:20.810> started<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.590> story<00:03:21.890> I<00:03:22.280> basically<00:03:23.150> just

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
first started the story I basically just

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.150 
first started the story I basically just
had<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.660> text<00:03:24.080> document<00:03:24.230> that<00:03:24.770> I<00:03:24.890> called

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
had a text document that I called

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.490 
had a text document that I called
flushing<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.330> is<00:03:26.480> where<00:03:26.630> any<00:03:26.840> ideas

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
flushing and this is where any ideas

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.970 
flushing and this is where any ideas
about<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:29.060> pre-created<00:03:29.660> world<00:03:30.050> at<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:30.560> I

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
about the pre-created world at all I

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.930 
about the pre-created world at all I
would<00:03:31.790> just<00:03:32.530> jot<00:03:33.530> down<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:34.130> that<00:03:34.550> text

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
would just jot down in that text

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.980 
would just jot down in that text
document<00:03:35.480> but<00:03:36.410> as<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.740> story<00:03:37.040> has<00:03:37.220> progressed

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:37.990 
document but as the story has progressed

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.320 
document but as the story has progressed
new<00:03:38.990> categories<00:03:39.770> have<00:03:40.070> merged<00:03:40.640> so<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.150> can

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
new categories have merged so you can

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.500 
new categories have merged so you can
see<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.720> from<00:03:42.250> from<00:03:43.250> the<00:03:43.370> flushing<00:03:43.700> document

here<00:03:45.370> I'm<00:03:46.390> starting<00:03:47.390> a<00:03:47.450> new<00:03:47.890> document<00:03:48.890> called

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
here I'm starting a new document called

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.020 
here I'm starting a new document called
nature<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.240> which<00:03:50.570> kind<00:03:50.780> of<00:03:50.930> describes<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
nature of which kind of describes the

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.320 
nature of which kind of describes the
physics<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:54.080> and<00:03:54.560> sort<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.670> reasons<00:03:56.090> why

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
physics and and sort of the reasons why

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.700 
physics and and sort of the reasons why
the<00:03:56.390> world<00:03:56.780> is<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:57.110> way<00:03:57.380> it<00:03:57.410> is<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.160> then

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
the world is the way it is and then

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.910 
the world is the way it is and then
different<00:04:00.710> different<00:04:01.460> categories<00:04:02.180> like

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
different different categories like

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.890 
different different categories like
absurd<00:04:03.920> occupations<00:04:04.880> is<00:04:05.150> another<00:04:05.510> category

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
that is emerging you can see how I

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.220 
that is emerging you can see how I
create<00:04:09.770> new<00:04:09.800> categories<00:04:10.610> as<00:04:10.850> the<00:04:11.690> document

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
create new categories as the document

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.979 
create new categories as the document
develops<00:04:12.830> and<00:04:13.780> if<00:04:14.780> you're<00:04:15.440> like<00:04:15.650> me<00:04:16.510> you'll<00:04:17.510> at

writing that people will eventually see

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.920 
writing that people will eventually see
is<00:05:26.010> just<00:05:26.340> icing<00:05:26.550> on<00:05:26.940> the<00:05:27.030> cake<00:05:27.240> this<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.750> where

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
is just icing on the cake this is where

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.470 
is just icing on the cake this is where
all<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.320> real<00:05:28.500> cooking<00:05:28.920> goes<00:05:29.130> on<00:05:29.400> just<00:05:30.300> keep

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
all the real cooking goes on just keep

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:32.150 
all the real cooking goes on just keep
in<00:05:30.660> mind<00:05:30.690> that<00:05:31.200> you<00:05:31.470> can<00:05:31.590> always<00:05:31.800> change

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
in mind that you can always change

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.640 
in mind that you can always change
things<00:05:32.520> around<00:05:32.850> as<00:05:33.180> you<00:05:33.360> go<00:05:33.510> along<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:34.170> can

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
things around as you go along you can

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.670 
things around as you go along you can
see<00:05:34.860> how<00:05:35.100> over<00:05:35.430> here<00:05:35.790> I<00:05:35.820> started<00:05:36.540> for<00:05:37.230> I<00:05:37.260> had

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
see how over here I started for I had

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.890 
see how over here I started for I had
tabs<00:05:38.100> for<00:05:38.430> each<00:05:38.610> chapter<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.420> I<00:05:39.510> think<00:05:39.750> I'm

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
tabs for each chapter and I think I'm

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.070 
tabs for each chapter and I think I'm
going<00:05:40.110> to<00:05:40.200> change<00:05:40.530> that<00:05:40.830> because<00:05:41.400> in<00:05:42.080> working

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
going to change that because in working

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.240 
going to change that because in working
out<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:44.660> backstory<00:05:45.660> for<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.230> locations<00:05:47.010> I

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
out the backstory for the locations I

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.000 
out the backstory for the locations I
think<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.760> want<00:05:48.060> to<00:05:48.300> create<00:05:48.690> a<00:05:49.020> tab<00:05:49.650> here<00:05:50.100> of

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
think I want to create a tab here of

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.280 
think I want to create a tab here of
locations<00:05:53.010> and<00:05:53.250> then<00:05:53.430> as<00:05:53.750> my<00:05:54.750> main<00:05:54.990> character

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
locations and then as my main character

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.610 
locations and then as my main character
goes<00:05:55.950> through<00:05:55.980> each<00:05:56.760> new<00:05:57.120> location<00:05:57.900> I<00:05:58.170> want<00:05:58.410> to

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
goes through each new location I want to

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.370 
goes through each new location I want to
create<00:05:58.890> a<00:05:58.980> note<00:05:59.370> for<00:05:59.610> that<00:05:59.790> so<00:06:00.570> that<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.780> can<00:06:01.110> see

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
create a note for that so that I can see

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.510 
create a note for that so that I can see
it<00:06:01.650> creates<00:06:02.010> a<00:06:02.160> timeline<00:06:03.800> where<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:05.220> basically

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
it creates a timeline where I basically

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.640 
it creates a timeline where I basically
am<00:06:06.060> just<00:06:06.270> telling<00:06:06.690> the<00:06:06.840> story<00:06:06.870> of<00:06:07.320> the

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
am just telling the story of the

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.340 
am just telling the story of the
location<00:06:08.310> -<00:06:08.400> location<00:06:08.430> -<00:06:09.030> location<00:06:09.230> and<00:06:10.230> I

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
location - location - location and I

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.260 
location - location - location and I
think<00:06:10.620> that<00:06:10.950> is<00:06:11.160> going<00:06:11.340> to<00:06:11.400> work<00:06:11.430> better<00:06:11.880> for

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
think that is going to work better for

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.480 
think that is going to work better for
creating<00:06:12.720> this<00:06:13.320> story<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:13.860> I<00:06:13.890> can<00:06:14.100> change<00:06:14.280> that

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
creating this story so I can change that

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.080 
creating this story so I can change that
around<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:15.590> am<00:06:16.590> I<00:06:16.950> still<00:06:17.370> have<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:17.820> the<00:06:17.940> way<00:06:18.060> I

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
around I am I still have it the way I

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.570 
around I am I still have it the way I
started<00:06:18.570> it<00:06:18.720> out<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.290> later<00:06:19.830> I'm<00:06:20.040> going<00:06:20.370> to

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 
started it out and later I'm going to

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.630 
started it out and later I'm going to
kind<00:06:21.390> of<00:06:21.450> switch<00:06:21.750> and<00:06:21.960> change<00:06:22.170> that<00:06:22.410> up<00:06:22.640> change

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
kind of switch and change that up change

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.090 
kind of switch and change that up change
the<00:06:23.850> way<00:06:23.940> you<00:06:24.000> categorize<00:06:24.540> things<00:06:25.110> it<00:06:25.860> all

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
the way you categorize things it all

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.790 
the way you categorize things it all
will<00:06:26.490> kind<00:06:26.790> of<00:06:26.880> shuffle<00:06:27.420> and<00:06:27.660> work<00:06:28.140> itself<00:06:28.590> out

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
will kind of shuffle and work itself out

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.760 
will kind of shuffle and work itself out
and<00:06:29.070> fall<00:06:29.280> into<00:06:29.460> place<00:06:29.790> and<00:06:30.060> the<00:06:30.930> reason<00:06:31.380> this

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:31.770 
and fall into place and the reason this

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:37.700 
and fall into place and the reason this
is<00:06:32.130> such<00:06:32.400> helpful<00:06:32.910> work<00:06:33.390> is<00:06:33.690> that<00:06:35.300> it<00:06:36.710> when

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710
