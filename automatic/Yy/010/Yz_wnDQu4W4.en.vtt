00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
little spring the smallest one will go

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.410 
little spring the smallest one will go
into<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.920> switch<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> went<00:00:17.279> right<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:20.420> from

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
into the switch and went right in from

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.740 
into the switch and went right in from
here<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.930> blade<00:00:22.250> the<00:00:23.250> long<00:00:23.880> side<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.420> the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
here the blade the long side is the

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.820 
here the blade the long side is the
traditional<00:00:25.560> front<00:00:25.890> short<00:00:26.550> size<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.970> back<00:00:27.830> so

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
traditional front short size the back so

over<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> right<00:00:51.530> now<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.250> blade<00:00:53.789> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
over to the right now that the blade is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.040 
over to the right now that the blade is
in<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.600> knife<00:00:55.550> from<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.629> take<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
in the knife from here you take the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.479 
in the knife from here you take the
slider<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> top<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> slider

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
slider so this is the top of the slider

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.690 
slider so this is the top of the slider
where<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> comes<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.739> oops<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> camera

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
where that comes out oops at the camera

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.039 
where that comes out oops at the camera
string<00:01:06.000> out<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> way<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.510> there's<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
string out of the way and there's the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
string out of the way and there's the
bottom<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.510> bottom<00:01:10.220> goes<00:01:11.220> here

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
bottom of it and so the bottom goes here

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000 
bottom of it and so the bottom goes here
and<00:01:11.820> what<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.750> does<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> push<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.590> stop

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
and what that does is push is that stop

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.370 
and what that does is push is that stop
that<00:01:14.340> keeps<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.939> closed<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:18.020> same<00:01:19.020> thing<00:01:19.049> up

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
top on the top part of the slider that's

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.510 
top on the top part of the slider that's
what<00:01:21.210> opens<00:01:22.049> up<00:01:22.170> when<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:22.950> time<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> close

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
my phone plinks here the challenge is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.499 
my phone plinks here the challenge is
doing<00:02:01.830> one<00:02:02.009> hand<00:02:02.220> there<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:02.910> fit<00:02:03.240> now

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
doing one hand there and it just fit now

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.480 
doing one hand there and it just fit now
into<00:02:03.750> place<00:02:03.990> there's<00:02:04.800> no<00:02:04.920> other<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.369> could

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
into place there's no other way it could

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.340 
into place there's no other way it could
go<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.869> again<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> just<00:02:07.020> slips<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.440> easy<00:02:09.350> and

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
go in again it just slips out easy and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.610 
go in again it just slips out easy and
goes<00:02:10.619> right<00:02:10.800> into<00:02:10.950> place<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:12.300> from<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
goes right into place so from there the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.229 
goes right into place so from there the
spring<00:02:13.920> can<00:02:14.100> either<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:14.430> top<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.850> bottom<00:02:15.030> it

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
spring can either go top or bottom it

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.520 
spring can either go top or bottom it
doesn't<00:02:15.510> matter<00:02:15.660> when<00:02:15.989> it<00:02:16.020> can't<00:02:16.290> when<00:02:16.410> it

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
doesn't matter when it can't when it

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.130 
doesn't matter when it can't when it
came<00:02:16.680> apart<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.280> spring<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:17.700> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.780> top<00:02:18.959> of

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
came apart the spring was on the top of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.990 
came apart the spring was on the top of
the<00:02:19.200> knife<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.370> Matt<00:02:20.519> gets<00:02:20.730> lined<00:02:21.000> up<00:02:21.269> here

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
the knife so it Matt gets lined up here

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.750 
the knife so it Matt gets lined up here
and<00:02:24.000> held<00:02:24.750> into<00:02:24.989> place<00:02:25.250> then<00:02:26.250> all<00:02:26.459> I'm<00:02:26.610> going

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
