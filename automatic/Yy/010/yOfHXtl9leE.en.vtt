an inch away from the top of this washer

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.450 
an inch away from the top of this washer
here<00:01:07.200> basically<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.890> we're<00:01:08.010> gonna<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
here basically what we're gonna do is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
here basically what we're gonna do is
we're<00:01:08.580> gonna<00:01:08.670> hold<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.799> allen<00:01:10.799> head<00:01:10.920> bolt

we're gonna hold the allen head bolt

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.300 
we're gonna hold the allen head bolt
with<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> 5<00:01:11.970> millimeter<00:01:12.380> allen<00:01:13.380> wrench<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
with a 5 millimeter allen wrench and

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.240 
with a 5 millimeter allen wrench and
we're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> tighten<00:01:15.000> down<00:01:15.150> on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> nut

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
we're going to tighten down on the nut

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
we're going to tighten down on the nut
using<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> 10<00:01:17.520> millimeter<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.630> boxing<00:01:19.049> wrench

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
using a 10 millimeter just boxing wrench

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
using a 10 millimeter just boxing wrench
and<00:01:19.409> so<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.490> far<00:01:20.520> there's<00:01:20.850> been<00:01:20.909> no<00:01:21.000> drilling

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and so so far there's been no drilling

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.780 
and so so far there's been no drilling
involved<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.830> an<00:01:22.950> existing<00:01:23.220> hole<00:01:23.400> here

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
involved this is an existing hole here

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.060 
involved this is an existing hole here
in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:23.909> tailgate<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.530> gonna<00:01:25.650> use<00:01:25.860> that

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
in the tailgate so we're gonna use that

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.050 
in the tailgate so we're gonna use that
and<00:01:26.850> it's<00:01:27.840> specifically<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:29.430> instructions

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and it's specifically the instructions

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.429 
and it's specifically the instructions
specifically<00:01:30.630> say<00:01:31.520> 9<00:01:32.520> turns<00:01:33.290> so<00:01:34.290> I'm<00:01:34.350> gonna

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
specifically say 9 turns so I'm gonna

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.620 
specifically say 9 turns so I'm gonna
try<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.710> count<00:01:34.979> these<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.369> as<00:01:35.610> best<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.000> can

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
try and count these out as best I can

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.630 
try and count these out as best I can
it's<00:01:37.380> not<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.500> quarter<00:01:37.860> turn<00:01:38.009> at<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> time<00:01:43.640> so

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's not a quarter turn at the time so

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
it's not a quarter turn at the time so
here's<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.909> little<00:01:45.149> ball<00:01:46.020> bearing<00:01:46.320> thing<00:01:46.470> I

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
here's the little ball bearing thing I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.679 
here's the little ball bearing thing I
was<00:01:46.680> telling<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:46.979> about

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
was telling you about

front<00:04:00.370> of<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:00.790> truck<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:04.000> thread<00:04:04.269> it<00:04:04.299> in

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.210 

so<00:04:20.340> now<00:04:20.430> that<00:04:20.489> our<00:04:20.700> new<00:04:21.209> little<00:04:21.420> stud<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.840> tight

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
so now that our new little stud is tight

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:29.510 
so now that our new little stud is tight
you<00:04:23.220> know<00:04:23.340> Thor<00:04:24.150> came<00:04:24.420> back<00:04:24.690> on<00:04:27.350> and<00:04:28.350> then<00:04:28.560> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
you know Thor came back on and then and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.400 
you know Thor came back on and then and
a<00:04:29.610> kit<00:04:29.850> comes<00:04:30.090> this<00:04:30.240> little<00:04:30.420> looks<00:04:31.200> like<00:04:31.320> a

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
a kit comes this little looks like a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.680 
a kit comes this little looks like a
grommet<00:04:31.920> like<00:04:32.280> a<00:04:32.310> firewall<00:04:32.760> grommet<00:04:33.210> but

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
grommet like a firewall grommet but

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.540 
grommet like a firewall grommet but
actually<00:04:33.960> what<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.140> do<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.070> slide<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.460> in

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
actually what you do is you slide it in

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:41.570 
actually what you do is you slide it in
that<00:04:35.670> hole<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:37.620> prevents<00:04:38.040> the<00:04:38.460> cable<00:04:40.580> coming

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
that hole that prevents the cable coming

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.320 
that hole that prevents the cable coming
loose<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:44.250> slide<00:04:44.760> back<00:04:45.350> up<00:04:46.730> so<00:04:47.730> it's<00:04:48.030> just<00:04:48.120> a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
loose and slide back up so it's just a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.100 
loose and slide back up so it's just a
little<00:04:48.510> keeper<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:49.440> what<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.680> is

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
little keeper is what it is

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.530 
little keeper is what it is
so<00:04:52.110> pretty<00:04:52.320> much<00:04:52.440> last<00:04:52.620> step<00:04:52.920> here<00:04:53.100> is<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.550> snap

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
so pretty much last step here is to snap

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.200 
so pretty much last step here is to snap
our<00:04:54.720> little<00:04:54.930> cylinder<00:04:55.260> in<00:04:55.350> place<00:04:55.560> and<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
our little cylinder in place and in the

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.360 
our little cylinder in place and in the
diagram<00:04:57.630> it<00:04:57.990> shows<00:04:58.050> the<00:04:58.650> actual<00:04:58.890> cylinder

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
diagram it shows the actual cylinder

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.240 
diagram it shows the actual cylinder
itself<00:04:59.730> in<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.570> up<00:05:00.720> position<00:05:00.950> up<00:05:01.950> here<00:05:02.100> on<00:05:02.190> the

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
itself in the up position up here on the

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.240 
itself in the up position up here on the
side<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.580> bed<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:02.970> the<00:05:03.540> shaft<00:05:03.840> mounted

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
side of the bed and the shaft mounted

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.890 
side of the bed and the shaft mounted
down<00:05:05.250> here<00:05:05.460> on<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.610> tailgate<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.210> it's<00:05:06.690> pretty

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
down here on the tailgate so it's pretty

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:28.790 
down here on the tailgate so it's pretty
simple<00:05:07.590> it<00:05:08.370> just<00:05:08.430> snaps<00:05:09.360> into<00:05:09.540> place

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.090 

that's<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:29.980> that's<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.220> whole<00:05:30.310> install<00:05:32.100> real

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
that's it that's the whole install real

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.630 
that's it that's the whole install real
easy<00:05:33.340> took<00:05:34.150> me<00:05:34.270> about<00:05:34.420> 15<00:05:34.840> minutes<00:05:34.870> so<00:05:35.640> I

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
easy took me about 15 minutes so I

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.820 
easy took me about 15 minutes so I
