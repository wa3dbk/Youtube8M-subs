just filling up the room and the ads

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.689 
just filling up the room and the ads
were<00:04:02.790> appearing<00:04:03.419> on<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:03.959> platform<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.430> thing

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:05.699 
were appearing on the platform the thing

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.710 
were appearing on the platform the thing
is<00:04:05.729> that<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.569> ads<00:04:06.769> do<00:04:07.769> their<00:04:08.010> cost<00:04:08.489> almost<00:04:09.000> as

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
is that the ads do their cost almost as

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.219 
is that the ads do their cost almost as
soon<00:04:10.169> as<00:04:10.409> they<00:04:10.620> spawn<00:04:11.040> so<00:04:11.909> what<00:04:12.419> you've<00:04:12.629> got<00:04:12.930> is

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
soon as they spawn so what you've got is

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:16.039 
soon as they spawn so what you've got is
people<00:04:13.829> in<00:04:14.099> the<00:04:14.250> lava<00:04:14.459> or<00:04:14.849> just<00:04:15.239> coming<00:04:15.840> up

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:49.260 
to you I missed that interrupt the first

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.460 
to you I missed that interrupt the first
couple<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.800> times<00:04:50.120> yes<00:04:51.120> I'm<00:04:51.449> human<00:04:51.930> I<00:04:52.110> make

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
couple of times yes I'm human I make

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.189 
couple of times yes I'm human I make
mistakes<00:04:52.949> but<00:04:53.880> I<00:04:54.180> learned<00:04:54.479> from<00:04:54.660> those

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
mistakes but I learned from those

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.800 
mistakes but I learned from those
mistakes<00:04:55.260> and<00:04:55.949> I<00:04:56.430> developed<00:04:56.790> a<00:04:57.120> system<00:04:57.389> for

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
mistakes and I developed a system for

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.189 
mistakes and I developed a system for
myself<00:04:58.350> and<00:04:58.760> after<00:04:59.760> that<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.240> stopped<00:05:00.840> missing

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
myself and after that I stopped missing

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.689 
myself and after that I stopped missing
those<00:05:01.650> interrupts<00:05:02.250> so<00:05:03.240> here's<00:05:03.720> how<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.169> goes

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
those interrupts so here's how it goes
