surface you know you have to keep thick

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.199 
surface you know you have to keep thick
skin<00:03:08.660> and<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:09.080> have<00:03:09.200> to<00:03:09.350> just<00:03:09.530> keep<00:03:09.709> it's<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
skin and you have to just keep it's a

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.259 
skin and you have to just keep it's a
way<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.420> like<00:03:11.780> I<00:03:12.610> don't<00:03:13.610> know<00:03:13.700> how<00:03:13.910> you<00:03:13.940> deal

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
way of like I don't know how you deal

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:15.520 
way of like I don't know how you deal
with<00:03:14.450> the<00:03:14.540> energy<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.200> take<00:03:15.380> that

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
with the energy and you take that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.870 
with the energy and you take that
negative<00:03:15.709> energy<00:03:15.980> and<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.549> turn<00:03:16.760> it

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
negative energy and you just turn it

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.160 
negative energy and you just turn it
into<00:03:16.970> positivity<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.930> makes<00:03:18.080> you

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
into positivity and it makes you

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.590 
into positivity and it makes you
stronger<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:18.709> I'm<00:03:19.549> hoping<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:19.970> that's<00:03:20.269> I

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
stronger so I'm hoping that that's I

and<00:03:32.510> in<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.930> training<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.680> everything<00:03:34.070> then

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
and in the training and everything then

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.560 
and in the training and everything then
you<00:03:34.430> get<00:03:34.610> into<00:03:34.850> the<00:03:34.910> race<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.209> don't<00:03:35.330> even<00:03:35.510> get

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
you get into the race you don't even get

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.600 
you get into the race you don't even get
to<00:03:35.630> see<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.410> first<00:03:36.590> pit<00:03:36.860> stop<00:03:36.890> you<00:03:37.220> know<00:03:37.340> so

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
to see the first pit stop you know so

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.050 
to see the first pit stop you know so
that's<00:03:38.450> probably<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:38.989> gusting<00:03:39.410> in<00:03:39.500> anything

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
that's probably more gusting in anything

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.360 
that's probably more gusting in anything
surprise<00:03:41.060> know<00:03:41.299> about<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:42.350> actual<00:03:42.590> the

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
surprise know about the actual the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.750 
surprise know about the actual the
reliability<00:03:44.060> was<00:03:44.269> better<00:03:44.480> than<00:03:44.660> a<00:03:44.900> long

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
reliability was better than a long

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.599 
reliability was better than a long
across<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.909> field<00:03:48.829> yeah<00:03:49.829> we<00:03:50.099> are<00:03:50.280> definitely

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
across the field yeah we are definitely

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.910 
across the field yeah we are definitely
was<00:03:50.819> surprised<00:03:51.209> with<00:03:51.510> like<00:03:52.260> for<00:03:52.379> example<00:03:52.439> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
was surprised with like for example the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.500 
was surprised with like for example the
Red<00:03:53.069> Bulls<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.519> know<00:03:53.549> they<00:03:53.909> hadn't<00:03:54.269> even<00:03:54.329> done

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
Red Bulls you know they hadn't even done

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.849 
Red Bulls you know they hadn't even done
a<00:03:54.569> race<00:03:54.810> distance<00:03:55.200> I<00:03:55.379> don't<00:03:55.620> even<00:03:55.680> know<00:03:55.829> if

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
a race distance I don't even know if

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.459 
a race distance I don't even know if
they<00:03:55.980> had<00:03:56.069> done<00:03:56.159> more<00:03:56.370> than<00:03:56.489> 25<00:03:56.879> laps<00:03:57.090> so<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:58.379> be

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:58.469 
they had done more than 25 laps so to be

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:59.539 
they had done more than 25 laps so to be
able<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.650> then<00:03:58.769> just<00:03:58.980> go<00:03:59.099> in<00:03:59.280> and<00:03:59.459> do

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
able to then just go in and do

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.149 
able to then just go in and do
straightway<00:03:59.909> a<00:04:00.120> racist<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.260> was<00:04:01.439> very<00:04:01.709> very

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
impressed which is going to be a

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:05.809 
impressed which is going to be a
standard<00:04:04.650> test<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.129> does<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.489> eight<00:04:05.639> because

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
standard test it does the eight because

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:07.429 
standard test it does the eight because
Melvin<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.239> actually<00:04:06.599> cooler<00:04:07.290> than<00:04:07.379> it

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
Melvin was actually cooler than it

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.410 
Melvin was actually cooler than it

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
but this this weekend it's gonna be

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.310 
but this this weekend it's gonna be
really<00:04:43.830> hard<00:04:44.039> on<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:44.370> on<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.580> car<00:04:44.880> um<00:04:45.870> I<00:04:45.960> don't

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
really hard on the on the car um I don't

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.020 
really hard on the on the car um I don't
think<00:04:46.590> people<00:04:47.009> realize<00:04:47.250> but<00:04:47.520> every<00:04:47.729> time<00:04:47.849> you

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
think people realize but every time you

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.270 
think people realize but every time you
open<00:04:48.060> up<00:04:48.389> cooling<00:04:48.900> ducts<00:04:49.530> on<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.949> car<00:04:50.130> you

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
open up cooling ducts on the car you

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.860 
open up cooling ducts on the car you
lose<00:04:50.460> down<00:04:50.699> for<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.210> lose<00:04:51.360> performance

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
lose down for so you lose performance

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.920 
lose down for so you lose performance
and<00:04:52.169> of<00:04:53.010> course<00:04:53.220> when<00:04:53.430> the<00:04:53.460> car's<00:04:53.760> hotter<00:04:54.210> it

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
and of course when the car's hotter it

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.830 
and of course when the car's hotter it
is<00:04:55.169> known<00:04:55.590> as<00:04:55.710> fast<00:04:55.919> so<00:04:56.270> some<00:04:57.270> tough<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:57.659> tires

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
is known as fast so some tough and tires

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.140 
is known as fast so some tough and tires
will<00:04:58.199> be<00:04:58.229> tough<00:04:58.440> in<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.620> car<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.150> obviously

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
will be tough in the car and obviously

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.750 
will be tough in the car and obviously
this<00:05:00.990> year<00:05:01.229> we've<00:05:01.409> lost<00:05:01.650> weight<00:05:02.099> as<00:05:02.280> drivers

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
this year we've lost weight as drivers

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.159 
this year we've lost weight as drivers
so<00:05:02.909> it's<00:05:02.940> going<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.240> be<00:05:03.300> even<00:05:03.419> harder<00:05:03.810> on<00:05:03.960> door

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
so it's going to be even harder on door

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.469 
so it's going to be even harder on door
I<00:05:04.199> was<00:05:04.349> a<00:05:04.380> thing<00:05:04.590> this<00:05:04.680> year<00:05:04.740> I<00:05:05.240> lost<00:05:06.240> when<00:05:06.449> we

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
I was a thing this year I lost when we

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.570 
I was a thing this year I lost when we
obviously<00:05:06.630> didn't<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.169> dry<00:05:08.010> qualifying

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
obviously didn't have a dry qualifying

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.000 
obviously didn't have a dry qualifying
in<00:05:09.479> Australia<00:05:10.020> there's<00:05:10.470> every<00:05:10.680> chance<00:05:10.710> I

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
in Australia there's every chance I

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.310 
in Australia there's every chance I
might<00:05:11.159> not<00:05:11.280> get<00:05:11.460> one<00:05:11.639> here<00:05:11.970> but<00:05:12.300> that's<00:05:12.990> really

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
might not get one here but that's really

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.230 
might not get one here but that's really
where<00:05:13.440> we<00:05:13.590> see<00:05:13.770> the<00:05:13.889> cars<00:05:14.070> at<00:05:14.280> full<00:05:14.759> chat<00:05:15.000> in

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
where we see the cars at full chat in

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.480 
where we see the cars at full chat in
qualifying<00:05:15.690> it's<00:05:16.229> a<00:05:16.289> dry<00:05:16.500> yeah<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.400> the
