like<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.530> can<00:03:10.010> only<00:03:10.070> add<00:03:10.370> like<00:03:10.610> you<00:03:10.760> know<00:03:10.880> a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
like you can only add like you know a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.310 
like you can only add like you know a
pinch<00:03:11.269> and<00:03:11.510> cooking<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:11.810> makes<00:03:12.079> such<00:03:12.290> a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
pinch and cooking it makes such a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.990 
pinch and cooking it makes such a
