00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.690
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:07.330
 video of vegan experience today I'm going to 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.070
 explain how to make homemade essences is 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.570
 an easy video that helps us to make 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.130
 the essences that we are going to buy for 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.710
 make fly cake cakes or 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.840
 different dishes one more way 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.700
 sustainable and homemade and much more 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.230
 funny clear are very few 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.970
 I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.290
 payment and good for from that you can 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.770
 do more or less what that seems 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.690
 let's see ingredients we need 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.220
 well I will explain to you to do essence 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.140
 of orange that in this case as I have 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.510
 orange to make tangerine and 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.340
 vanilla what we need is that 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.390
 what do you need we want to do the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.080
 essence and an alcohol to take everything out 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.610
 the flavor but our ingredients in 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.310
 this case I will use vodka but 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.380
 you can also use rum later if 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.720
 you are going to use the essences to make 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.520
 tarts a good option is to add a 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.260
 little bit of sugar me in this case instead 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.210
 of sugar I'm going to use a little bit of 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.320
 agave syrup for the essence of 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.090
 vanilla 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.620
 another neutral area is to say without any 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.199
 sugar in case I want to add it to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.820
 different dishes well I'm going to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.460
 teach to recycle by essence that was 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.810
 more sustainable for example as they do 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.610
 missing a small boat for the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.610
 vanilla essence a good choice is 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.160
 use a pot of spices that you have 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.820
 remained empty so what you use and not 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.100
 you will say it is very easy first thing 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.250
 What we are going to do is take the pods 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 vanilla 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.310
 and then I explain what I do 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:34.890
 you have to do is cut in half 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.170
 and open it and take away what it has inside 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.549
 and we will move it in a corner in 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.610
 As long as I have done it, I come back with 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.640
 you as you see here I already have 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.130
 separated what is the scabbard of what 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.890
 inside for that you just cut by 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.830
 half 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.830
 as you can see here that is open 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.990
 and you pass the scraping knife as well as 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.630
 and to my finger and then you will be taking it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.340
 everything inside now the only thing that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.020
 let's do is in our boat that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.750
 you can use the one you want and I give you 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.739
 this idea then to recycle a boat 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.739
 add the vanilla pod 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.910
 and all the stuffing and now the only thing 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.250
 we have left is to add the alcohol that 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.900
 let's use as you see already what 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.959
 filled with alcohol and now what 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:29.490
 Only thing I have left is to add a 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.490
 little bit of agave syrup 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 so this is going to make it an essence 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.439
 sweet and it will give you a little bit of color 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.599
 what will make it perfect for 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.209
 biscuits now we have no more than 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.859
 cover, we can not move it a little if 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.959
 we want we are going to cover it so that it 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.959
 mix everything well and we would leave it 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.599
 ferment for a month in a place 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.150
 dark and dry now I will explain 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:03:00.349
 how to make orange tangerine lemon 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.790
 or any citrus is very easy what 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.130
 we do is with orange tangerines 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.470
 well washed lemons 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.880
 catch a peeler keep peeling the 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.450
 well I have here 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.010
 the peeled tangerines is very important 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.840
 that you use a good operator because 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.940
 As you can see here, this side is orange and 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 this side also so that all this 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.070
 part that you see here that is still tone 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.680
 orange do not take it to peel it 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.480
 and give the best possible flavor to our 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.850
 essence now only we have to 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.650
 to do is to take a boat 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.880
 the size of the boat will depend on the 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:41.760
 amount of skin you are going to use 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.760
 and put our skin inside 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.860
 we take everything well and we are going to throw 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.340
 and the only thing left is to return to 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.170
 checking and fill to top of 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.860
 alcohol and as you can see here I already have my 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.360
 orange essence pot prepared me 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.330
 what I traveled so that the photos are 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.460
 more beautiful is to pass this little boat 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.020
 here that you can also do 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.510
 so 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.730
 the more alcohol you throw and the less 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.440
 vanilla in this case softer will remain 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.160
 the essence that is also a thing 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.260
 interesting good 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.500
 I'm going to pass it from one to the other so that 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:23.560
 see how it looks and ready as you see here 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.290
 I already have my vanilla essence and my 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.360
 essence of orange as you have seen is 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.430
 a good recipe is a very easy trick 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.600
 what can you do in a moment and that 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.840
 it does not bring any difficulty 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.940
 that yes tell you that as I said before 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.850
 you have to keep it in one place 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.290
 dark and dry and then what 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.400
 I recommend it is every three or four 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.250
 days take the boat and put a little 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.110
 and good with that and everything would be good 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.610
 I hope you liked the idea and that 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.259
 you encourage to do it as you see is a 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:57.160
 very easy way to get essences 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:58.750
 natural and very cheap as 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.759
 important is the quality of alcohol that 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.949
 use according to the quality of alcohol 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.240
 we will be better or worse 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.740
 Well, here's the video today 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.630
 I hope you liked it if it has 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.669
 liked I would like it to be I like it 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.710

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.710
