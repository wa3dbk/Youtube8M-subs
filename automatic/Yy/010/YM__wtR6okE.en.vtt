see<00:02:05.759> whatever<00:02:05.909> i<00:02:06.060> tap<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.689> little<00:02:07.679> dot

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
see whatever i tap there's a little dot

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.440 
see whatever i tap there's a little dot
now<00:02:08.190> wherever<00:02:08.610> my<00:02:08.729> finger<00:02:09.000> goes<00:02:09.149> there's<00:02:09.390> a

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
now wherever my finger goes there's a

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.260 
now wherever my finger goes there's a
dot<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.380> that's<00:02:10.740> pretty<00:02:10.950> cool<00:02:11.060> it's<00:02:12.060> now<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.210> we

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
