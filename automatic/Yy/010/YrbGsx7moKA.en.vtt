00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.320
 For the 4th row we knit 3 stitches to replace the 1st stitch 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:22.990
 then we weave other 3 chains: 1, 2, 3 and in the fan of the previous row we go 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.270
 to weave the simple fan, this 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:38.000
 let's chop in the bow of 2 stitch chains to knit the high point 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:49.400
 now we knit 4 stitches: 1, 2, 3, 4 and we knit another high point 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:07.500
 in this way we have the simple fan now we knit 5 stitches chains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.630
 and in the central arch of the 4 groups 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.900
 from the previous row we are going to chop the double fan 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:33.800
 this is, let's chop to knit 2 high points 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:44.130
 1, 2 2 string points: 1, 2 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:58.180
 now we weave another 2 high points: 1, 2 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:09.160
 we knit now 5 stitches chains: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:15.300
 and we weave in the following fan, 1 simple fan 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:33.810
 1 high point, 4 point chains: 1, 2, 3, 4 and another high point 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.440
 we knit to finish the row 3 points chains: 1, 2, 3 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:51.800
 and 1 stitched high point in the 3rd string of the previous row 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.200
 in this way we have the 4th row 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 to weave the 5th row we must repeat the 3rd row 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:25.540
 that is, making the group of 3 incomplete closed double stitches 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:39.950
 together in this fan and in this or that is, always weave the group this in the fan 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:47.700
 simple and here repeat the double fan 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.400
 that is, the 3rd and 5th rows are always repeated.
