place the mirrors in any way in any
direction<00:00:54.379> you<00:00:54.710> want<00:00:54.799> them<00:00:55.220> making<00:00:55.549> sure<00:00:56.030> that

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:56.720 
direction you want them making sure that

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.070 
direction you want them making sure that
light<00:00:57.589> can<00:00:57.799> bounce<00:00:57.949> off<00:00:58.280> of<00:00:58.489> them<00:00:58.760> and

00:00:59.070 --> 00:00:59.080 
light can bounce off of them and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.399 
light can bounce off of them and
continue<00:01:00.080> to<00:01:00.559> go<00:01:01.420> but<00:01:02.420> before<00:01:02.809> I<00:01:02.839> can<00:01:03.080> show<00:01:03.350> you

this<00:01:04.269> experiment<00:01:05.269> in<00:01:05.479> action<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.320> will<00:01:07.100> need<00:01:07.310> to

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
this experiment in action I will need to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.690 
this experiment in action I will need to
turn<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.820> lights<00:01:08.030> off<00:01:11.979> now<00:01:12.979> we<00:01:13.039> are<00:01:13.369> ready<00:01:13.609> to

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
turn the lights off now we are ready to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.529 
turn the lights off now we are ready to
begin<00:01:15.549> once<00:01:16.549> you<00:01:16.759> have<00:01:16.939> your<00:01:17.090> mirrors<00:01:17.420> in

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
begin once you have your mirrors in

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:24.060 
begin once you have your mirrors in
place<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.200> can<00:01:18.469> press<00:01:19.189> you<00:01:19.880> can<00:01:20.079> start<00:01:21.079> your

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.050 

laser<00:01:25.070> pointer<00:01:25.609> get<00:01:26.539> see<00:01:27.289> if<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.500> reflects<00:01:28.060> now

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
laser pointer get see if it reflects now

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.370 
laser pointer get see if it reflects now
using<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.200> aerosol<00:01:30.649> can<00:01:31.630> we<00:01:32.630> can<00:01:32.840> see<00:01:33.229> it

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
using the aerosol can we can see it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.919 
using the aerosol can we can see it
reflecting<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:40.450> pretty<00:01:41.450> much<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
reflecting and that is pretty much the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.669 
reflecting and that is pretty much the
end<00:01:41.960> of<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.799> experiment<00:01:43.929> for<00:01:44.929> the<00:01:45.020> second

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
end of the experiment for the second

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:48.270 
end of the experiment for the second
experiment<00:01:46.490> I<00:01:46.729> will<00:01:47.539> be<00:01:47.659> showing<00:01:47.869> you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
experiment I will be showing you

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.830 
experiment I will be showing you
refraction<00:01:49.280> you<00:01:50.090> will<00:01:50.240> need<00:01:50.479> a<00:01:50.950> coin<00:01:52.509> taped<00:01:53.509> in

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
refraction you will need a coin taped in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.050 
refraction you will need a coin taped in
in<00:01:54.170> some<00:01:54.530> way<00:01:54.799> a<00:01:55.189> bowl<00:01:55.999> and<00:01:57.520> wait<00:01:58.520> some<00:01:58.789> water

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
in some way a bowl and wait some water

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.859 
in some way a bowl and wait some water
and<00:01:59.619> a<00:02:00.619> friend<00:02:01.219> who<00:02:01.429> can<00:02:01.700> pour<00:02:02.090> the<00:02:02.270> water<00:02:02.299> for

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
and a friend who can pour the water for

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.099 
and a friend who can pour the water for
you<00:02:03.049> now<00:02:04.039> for<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:04.639> experiment<00:02:05.060> you<00:02:05.509> must

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
you now for this experiment you must

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.650 
you now for this experiment you must
step<00:02:06.409> back<00:02:06.469> until<00:02:07.069> you<00:02:07.159> can<00:02:07.310> only<00:02:07.520> just<00:02:08.060> not

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
step back until you can only just not

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.190 
step back until you can only just not
see<00:02:08.990> the<00:02:09.170> coin<00:02:09.410> anymore<00:02:10.330> then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
see the coin anymore then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.010 
see the coin anymore then
you<00:02:12.980> have<00:02:13.190> your<00:02:13.370> friend<00:02:13.670> poured<00:02:14.060> water<00:02:14.450> until

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
you have your friend poured water until

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.910 
you have your friend poured water until
you<00:02:15.080> can<00:02:15.379> see<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> coin<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.230> experiment

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
you can see the coin for this experiment

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.979 
you can see the coin for this experiment
I<00:02:19.040> will<00:02:19.459> be<00:02:19.879> the<00:02:20.030> friend<00:02:20.300> pouring<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.810> water

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
I will be the friend pouring the water

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.430 
I will be the friend pouring the water
and<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:22.250> will<00:02:22.910> be<00:02:23.090> stepping<00:02:23.599> back<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.290> can

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
and you will be stepping back so you can

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.380 
and you will be stepping back so you can
no<00:02:24.590> longer<00:02:24.830> see<00:02:25.129> the<00:02:25.160> coin<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:28.360> walk<00:02:29.360> back

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
no longer see the coin now walk back

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.509 
no longer see the coin now walk back
until<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> can<00:02:30.440> no<00:02:30.470> longer<00:02:30.950> see<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.519> coin<00:02:33.519> now

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
until you can no longer see the coin now

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:49.650 
until you can no longer see the coin now
I'm<00:02:34.760> going<00:02:35.120> to<00:02:35.269> pour<00:02:35.540> the<00:02:35.720> water

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.470 

can<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.780> see<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.140> coin<00:02:51.350> yet<00:02:53.020> good<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:56.090> reason

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
can you see the coin yet good the reason

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.990 
can you see the coin yet good the reason
why<00:02:56.630> you<00:02:56.690> could<00:02:57.080> now<00:02:57.260> see<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.800> coin<00:02:58.340> was

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
why you could now see the coin was

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.320 
why you could now see the coin was
because<00:02:59.450> the<00:03:00.350> light<00:03:00.620> was<00:03:01.520> being<00:03:01.850> refracted

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
because the light was being refracted

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.510 
because the light was being refracted
through<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.930> water

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
through the water

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.650 
through the water
pretty<00:03:04.520> cool<00:03:04.760> huh<00:03:04.790> by<00:03:06.100> oh<00:03:07.100> I'm<00:03:07.910> going<00:03:08.480> from

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
pretty cool huh by oh I'm going from

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.710 
pretty cool huh by oh I'm going from
