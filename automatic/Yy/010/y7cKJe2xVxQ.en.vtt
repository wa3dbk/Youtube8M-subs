00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.019
 our test for ps4 exclusive third 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.639
 adventure like order 18 86 is already 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.330
 online we just hope you have it 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 already read it 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320
 if not or if you just think 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
 the eye always eats somehow 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.449
 Of course we have or play with 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 also added a test video 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.150
 come directly to the main point in the 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.710
 There were always many on the apron 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.859
 Discussions about the playing time of the 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170
 order 18 86 about excessive use 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 from quicktime events and cutscenes and 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 We can not handle all these issues 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.090
 we can defuse some blurs 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.070
 and above all, we'll tell you why 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:48.120
 We still find the prioritization first 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:49.860
 80 a good game become what going on 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.850
 on the one hand, of course, would be the atmosphere 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 and the staging 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.710
 I was the substance away many 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
 Scenes in the game are very cinematic 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 that's not really playful though 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 challenging when a quick time event 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 in the next hunt but the whole thing is great 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.719
 implemented as for example these knives 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.719
 fight against a werewolf 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.299
 we can already see in impressions 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.799
 it is nothing more than a simple one 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:14.659
 button press one dodges with one 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.670
 analog stick out attacks with the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.590
 shoulder buttons to that is playful 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.329
 Of course not very demanding 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.130
 but it looks very nice and 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.080
 Above all things make these scenes 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.549
 just not the bulk of the game 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:37.880
 but when it comes up maybe 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:40.209
 a third or a fourth for one 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.500
 There are also a few changes 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:43.490
 climbing passages jump passage as well 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.080
 always you want to call it 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.140
 that is nothing innovative 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.569
 This is known as uncharted or even so 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.939
 before or similarly stored play however 

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.319
 it just cares for a little bit different 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.970
 rhythm in the whole fight and the 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.689
 whole cinematic scenes and the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.689
 whole cutscenes 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.500
 which is also very good for us 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.060
 It has been that the game for 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.740
 a shooter a very quiet 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.750
 there has been a lot of narrative tempo 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.220
 cutscenes as already mentioned it 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.470
 There are very many passages in those 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.180
 you walk around and talk to people and it 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.730
 even partially correct sneak 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 passage the longest of which you can see here 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.209
 we want with our main character 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.900
 Grayson infiltrate a house and allowed to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.900
 but not get caught 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.860
 the nice thing is that in these 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.450
 also the degree of difficulty 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.260
 bit attracts because who is discovered 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.970
 dead immediately 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.230
 You can not avoid it anymore 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.760
 actually do not mind if you do 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.380
 first seen and there too 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.370
 The ammunition is very tight as is 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.260
 we see we only have here now 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 It is also very good with three shots 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.260
 important that you tactical as possible 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.550
 Maybe the opponent is doing too 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.630
 in the back it is so close to them 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.310
 turns off the only problem 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.709
 This sneaking passage is that the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.580
 somewhat inaccurate control of 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.150
 Covering system that bothers then already 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.150
 put these 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.980
 passages like the control completely 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.140
 Do not disturb, for example, of course 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.580
 such battles that works completely 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.110
 well you go by pressing a button in cover 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.040
 and picks up with another button 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.170
 the opponents on the grain 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.790
 how do jean behave in a typical way? 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.950
 relatively modest 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.480
 There are one or the other 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.190
 adversary type of a bit different 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.480
 For example, tactics require it 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.640
 soldiers flit with one 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.740
 shotgun on you but in the 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.240
 Normally, it's nothing 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.930
 better than a few moorriemer again 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.930
 to run towards you 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.860
 Of course, there are also in the 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.690
 otherwise quite standard shooter 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.340
 insert a little special feature the 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.320
 black ones we see here is one 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.300
 kind of wool part how to get out of the max 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.530
 Payne knows and must, of course, play 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.870
 accordingly only charged 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.700
 the stupid is just actually 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.440
 she does not need it then as she already did 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.150
 The opponents do not mention that 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.290
 just the smartest impression and 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.850
 Accordingly, she comes without 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.600
 This feature is actually quite good 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.600
 the battles through 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.470
 I strike 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.740
 As already mentioned, the seti is one 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.860
 the biggest strengths of the order 18 86 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.800
 and just this Victorian one 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.180
 steampunk scifi fantasy mix is ​​alright 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.050
 also one of the biggest strengths of the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.569
 order 18 86 only the big problem the 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.310
 whole haifa elements the lightning weapons 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.770
 the color beings like here these werewolves 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.300
 they do not happen very often 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.759
 most of the time it just fights 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.379
 against human opponents and thereby 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:21.349
 it just so that the game is very very 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:23.150
 we can forgive the many opportunities 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.000
 order 18 86 so unrestricted 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.169
 Unfortunately, do not recommend 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.180
 the game has a nice setting it has 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.020
 with a good story with a little too unfortunately 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.360
 open end 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.349
 It has cool characters but it has 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.210
 own unfortunately no 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.979
 replay the levels hose i 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.710
 There are hardly any works that one collects 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.400
 There can only be one end and find 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.349
 accordingly, the whole is for one 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.460
 full price title just a bit 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:48.379
 lean who likes cinematic games 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.699
 He can certainly be fun with the 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.409
 or have a good game 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.940
 Gameplay tourists or all those who 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:54.680
 hope absolute action kracher im 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.819
 the style of an uncharted have hoped the 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.819
 are, however, be disappointed
