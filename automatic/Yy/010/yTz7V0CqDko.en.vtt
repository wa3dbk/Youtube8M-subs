hi<00:00:05.260> let's<00:00:05.649> talk<00:00:05.830> about<00:00:05.980> tree<00:00:06.819> dinary<00:00:07.240> tapes

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
hi let's talk about tree dinary tapes

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.770 
hi let's talk about tree dinary tapes
today<00:00:08.549> foresters<00:00:09.549> use<00:00:10.120> diameter

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
today foresters use diameter

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.770

formula for the scale is circumference
divided<00:01:17.200> by<00:01:17.499> PI<00:01:17.920> or<00:01:19.799> 3.1416<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:22.299> you<00:01:22.359> can<00:01:22.600> use

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
divided by PI or 3.1416 so you can use

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.260 
divided by PI or 3.1416 so you can use
this<00:01:23.049> to<00:01:23.319> make<00:01:24.039> your<00:01:24.279> own<00:01:25.319> tape<00:01:26.319> or<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:28.060> can
