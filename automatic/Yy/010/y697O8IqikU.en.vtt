00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.189
 Hello everybody 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.500
 as part of my series of tips and tricks 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'll give you a tip today like you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 can refresh ten rolls again 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.839
 The rolls can be up to three days old 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.789
 his 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 you should but in one 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.220
 kept plastic bag 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 this bun is her two days old 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.000
 You see, it hardly gives way and is right 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.680
 firmly 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.289
 it has been steadily up to now moisture 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 lost thereby it became goal 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.219
 and stale 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.230
 the missing moisture must be before the 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.010
 to bake again 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.050
 and I do that with water, the water 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 turn up the small and the bun 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 quickly do it all around 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.649
 You have to take care that the bun 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.620
 not too wet and therefore muddy 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.289
 good shake off and then a moment 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.620
 set aside until the water is drawn 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.270
 is 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:06.680
 but that works very fast if you are here 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.299
 let's see it's all moved in 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 Now you can bake the bun 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.810
 if you have several, that's fine too 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 in the oven 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.670
 but one or two is enough 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
 a toaster with buns tower that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.240
 also saves energy 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.210
 As you can see , the bun is whole 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.420
 dried off the toaster you set up 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.860
 the highest level and puts the bun 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.259
 on top while the bread is toasting 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 should you turn it once or twice 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.579
 you should have older rolls 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.680
 Can you then put them in as a dumpling bread 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.930
 slice or completely 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.310
 let it dry and then dry 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.740
 process breadcrumbs 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.729
 how that works shows you in one 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.070
 another video 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.610
 You can also see from stale ones 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.750
 bread and rolls still make something 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.229
 in between you can go on it 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 to press 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.360
 and if the crust is appetizing 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.790
 feels it is done when there is something else left 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.009
 is fixed then the toaster again to 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.920
 Do not forget to turn 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.869
 because it should not burn anything 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.760
 the toaster is off and the bun 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.740
 can still briefly on the residual heat 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 pull through 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.830
 now it is finished but still very hot 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 it may cool down a bit by that 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.070
 moisten it is outside this around 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.200
 not dry and does not flake off 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.600
 The bun is cold now and like you 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.540
 look pretty soft almost like 0 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.640
 it can also be fresh 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.460
 break apart and here it is 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.890
 beautiful elastic does not crumble 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.880
 when slicing and the krome is like 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.740
 freshly baked 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.080
 now you can have fresh sunday 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.370
 enjoy bread without going to the bakery 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.650
