also<00:00:00.299> the<00:00:00.390> science<00:00:00.630> for<00:00:00.989> gonna<00:00:01.199> lead

00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 
also the science for gonna lead

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.100 
also the science for gonna lead
yeah<00:00:02.280> he's<00:00:03.000> gonna<00:00:03.179> see<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.540> now<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:03.959> we'll

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
yeah he's gonna see that now so we'll

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.660 
yeah he's gonna see that now so we'll
see<00:00:04.259> if<00:00:04.319> she<00:00:04.380> goes<00:00:04.650> after<00:00:04.799> that<00:00:05.040> next<00:00:05.220> or<00:00:05.520> if<00:00:05.609> he

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
see if she goes after that next or if he

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.940 
see if she goes after that next or if he
just<00:00:05.700> tries<00:00:06.060> to<00:00:06.210> cap<00:00:06.390> his<00:00:06.600> own<00:00:06.750> res<00:00:06.960> that's

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
just tries to cap his own res that's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.790 
just tries to cap his own res that's
almost<00:00:08.250> harsh<00:00:08.630> quadra<00:00:09.630> take<00:00:09.960> take<00:00:10.590> the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
almost harsh quadra take take the

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.740 
almost harsh quadra take take the
expansion<00:00:11.400> right<00:00:11.580> next<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.910> she<00:00:12.120> faced<00:00:12.480> right

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
expansion right next to she faced right

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.129 
expansion right next to she faced right
there<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.880> that's<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:14.940> thing<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.269> yeah<00:00:15.389> she

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
there and that's the thing is yeah she

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.689 
there and that's the thing is yeah she
needs<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.710> have<00:00:16.800> taken<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.340> autumn<00:00:17.609> by

sure<00:00:21.660> if<00:00:21.900> he<00:00:21.990> actually<00:00:22.199> could<00:00:22.529> have<00:00:22.560> because

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
sure if he actually could have because

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.890 
sure if he actually could have because
he's<00:00:23.250> talking<00:00:23.670> water<00:00:23.880> than<00:00:24.180> keeping<00:00:24.570> pressure

he's talking water than keeping pressure
on<00:00:25.140> constantly<00:00:26.039> that's<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> things<00:00:26.490> it

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730

my take on it because he's corner was

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.410 
my take on it because he's corner was
just<00:01:46.950> been<00:01:47.070> pressuring<00:01:47.520> pressure<00:01:47.850> impression

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
large enough force to go take that

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.530 
large enough force to go take that
expansion<00:02:39.370> out<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.849> once<00:02:40.030> he<00:02:40.120> does<00:02:40.299> that's

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
expansion out and once he does that's

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.780
