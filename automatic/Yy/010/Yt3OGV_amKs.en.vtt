00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 hey look my channel and their service 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.980
 nice that you look for a new one 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.379
 video because today I can have a new one 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.760
 get a game monitor from asus 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.679
 I already have one at home than me 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.719
 may come to pick one up so me 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.679
 have a great time so let's 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.509
 go inside 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.490
 once inside then I arrive here 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.289
 joined at sven and is the man who 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.060
 everything in detail knows differently 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 van haasjes and is the man who gives me more 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.260
 is going to explain about the please me 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.519
 have a home or are you a jar 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.840
 might have in the video from previous 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.090
 week I can see by the way too 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.489
 already played a lot on it and so did 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.570
 decent difference between the Nazis white 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.460
 and standard 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.290
 Gaming monitor also movement that you make 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.180
 the super smooth maybe you like it that way 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 known as your own gaming gaming 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 monitor or your motorcycle I'm home again 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.530
 used on got here is about it 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.510
 to give 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 do you sometimes have those images with you? 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.280
 so introduction 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.930
 terms you have a monitor and that is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 so with that completely remedied 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 as you can see you now see the right 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.780
 there should be a circle where you can 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.370
 see what tering is you see the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 images no longer together well 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.420
 walk as you can see now let's 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.900
 example see what a jig monitor 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 and doing a standard monitor consumption 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.439
 then you see the links a little bit every 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.430
 city ​​ring is just that right 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.010
 all the time 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.119
 okay also explain more about the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.890
 swift and this is the wreathing variant 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.470
 that is leasing from jan vis infoland 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.960
 new model that is just out with 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.479
 stand tall 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.869
 the big difference between the two is therefore 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.720
 that zinc and freezing jigging is for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.590
 a video if you have a cow and a nvidia 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.780
 video card 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.360
 you come and have the teasing 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.610
 You must descartes the freezer in what 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.610
 free sync and those singing make those worries 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.460
 sure the freedom of the video card 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.689
 in split screen so if you are four 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.409
 each other and press moment only 40 can 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.810
 back to 40 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.360
 the screen goes on my and 40 and on it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.240
 moment that high end 80 goes along 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 not along but what is the max then of 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.960
 about four since are going to be these 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.110
 all 440 hertz 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.090
 you can record a maximum of 144 images per second 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.459
 I learn this is quite something 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.379
 choose increasing especially one 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.569
 advantage with the low frame rate 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.500
 yes at higher frame rates then you notice 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.209
 already not very pretty new 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.580
 computer is wild and hr games 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.250
 as a counter-strike there so kind of free 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.860
 less quickly so that you can also get a free one 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.620
 it is high framerate player man 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.230
 fine that screen higher 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.670
 higher number would go there because to species 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.400
 just for that you want to go to school more 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.800
 go see but vision and it will sing 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.810
 therefore you have less influence on leasing 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.739
 car leasing have a particular advantage if 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:49.140
 you gta a very advanced game 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.150
 want to play fluently without being hated there and 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.599
 You just have a walk on it 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.510
 freeze as understand is therefore one 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.760
 gaming monitor specifically for nvidia and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.980
 the specific for this so that you 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.569
 there is an amd bruycker and a nvidia 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.159
 use arrived at 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.590
 same campi so they don't have that tari 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.080
 yes yes that's all sorts of both of us 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.000
 we use platforms quickly to d 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.099
 video card has futures in your ears 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.950
 go buy video card and you know you 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.150
 you can also go for the cheese 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.790
 just be connected 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.280
 but freeze a part in energy think 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.530
 the baptism was only on 102 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.450
 platforms and as I understood because that 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.980
 I noticed my back every time you 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.080
 I see game more than anyone else wants 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.599
 screen so my audience also broader or 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.019
 bigger is correct yes the resolution is a lot 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.970
 higher 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.060
 yes resolution unyielding percent 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
 higher than a full hd screen whatever you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.799
 previously this screen had that 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:52.019
 all with a resolution of 2560 by 1440 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:54.720
 points so compared to 1920 at around 7 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.790
 percent more picture and is not alone 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.959
 but also play that in windows like you 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.060
 it's going to edit video 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.049
 then you can just take on more versus you 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.580
 get your screen 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.260
 I myself also really enjoy being mega 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.980
 to play on this I also have a whole one 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.989
 other gaming experience gained where 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.930
 you actually notice a difference 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.250
 quality and also just tearing as you 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.959
 once 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.269
 now seen the video you know what i mean 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.040
 then you irritate death 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.049
 and if you have this monitor 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.880
 then there is just a world there 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.040
 of difference but yes then you have one 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.440
 monitor for gaming actually because that is how it is 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.090
 I like it because yes I can put it on you every day 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.570
 also do other nice things anyway 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.610
 because our understanding was enough and you actually want it 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.710
 convince your parents to also use this engine 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.010
 to get and say waste looks can 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.449
 then you go on the one 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.030
 and your dad can easily do it easily 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.130
 read a newspaper well it's ideal then 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.530
 do you have a great hi rose on the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.389
 gaming and dad has an i can page 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:51.919
 from top to bottom number it is 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:53.690
 super easy all if you 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.250
 actually programs because is 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.320
 actually a programming option for that 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.760
 for programmers code writers want 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.320
 then they can get the full code or one 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.729
 very nice to see what is of course 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.539
 very cool 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.539
 feature yes 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.120
 Another question is to hang it on the wall 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.190
 Yes 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.010
 models and g's hand so beautiful is one 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.539
 buy a block at 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:16.669
 I returned home from this asus wit 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.919
 I only have a second one 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.380
 yes can never be missing 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:23.780
 I can still give you an exclusive 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.510
 ar oh gee i gave you are only there 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.520
 50 of them in the Benelux then have it too 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.200
 one of course but what do you want 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.430
 to win it 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.090
 the question that you must answer 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.889
 what is the response time of the arabic 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.090
 writing and by that I mean 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:40.310
 milliseconds 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.180
 exactly how many are you allowed 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.650
 go look up 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.810
 I would put you a link at the bottom 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.000
 where you can find out in great detail 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.039
 leave a comment below with 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.380
 how many milliseconds is exactly and do 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:51.950
 also add your twitter so who ate you 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.419
 are 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.400
 then I would follow back on twitter 

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:56.000
 and then i would have this i got to you 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.490
 send it 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.080
 I am now really going to take you again 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.450
 off because I want me because if you go 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.680
 by giving of course so on you alone 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.570
 I'm going to do that now 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.250
 people let us have more than 1000 likes 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.870
 forget to push the thumbs up 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.010
 not to support me 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.590

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.669
 was the engine off than me and me

 a house like anger by the time 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.740
 yes yes
