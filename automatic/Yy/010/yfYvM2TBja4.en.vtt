00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.340
 First, attention was paid here 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.870
 that you have a lot of freedom too 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.600
 maneuver 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 this place was equipped with 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 ground inlet and on the side have 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.580
 We then the disposal station as 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 such progressive with one 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.330
 retractable hose can firstly 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.790
 flush the cash register 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.430
 and second, if you have something somewhere 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.890
 spilled the possibility of the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.960
 to spray clean again with it 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.050
 the odor formation as low as possible 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.300
 stay and no syringe on the side 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.760
 You can kick this one here 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.460
 inlet for the cassette created 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 would like to empty another container 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 you can open the flap up here 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.940
 So now is the disposal issue 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.729
 solved 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.130
 but what do we do when we are 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.670
 at a parking space in the tvo it just for 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.740
 gray water no disposal gives completely 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:46.119
 simply we hold the container 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 under the discharge-jannis still has a 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.740
 advantage because the gray water toothpastes 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.409
 detergent shampoo et cetera in it 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.369
 it cleans the tanker of them 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.799
 even with the supply you have 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.439
 then for the battery star of leisure 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.479
 Reisch decided and that it has the 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.280
 Advantage here you can get a small amount 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.670
 So that's about ten 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.870
 liter for ten cents or between 80 and 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.090
 100 liters with a one euro piece with 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:22.060
 the adapter piece can be here 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.650
 then connect your own hose and to 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.890

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.019
 the whole floor of this station is 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.290
 slightly sloping that is if 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:35.890
 something goes wrong the water goes 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.959
 in a direction in a trough and comes 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:44.200
 then the right place to the sewer 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.900
