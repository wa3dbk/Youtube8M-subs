00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.110
 as if he wanted to say hey people 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.230
 Today we have the topic cliché 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.849
 topic students and have us there three 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.770
 chosen where we think that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.029
 which could be quite interesting 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.489
 Of course not all the time 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.329
 to talk about these three clichés 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.700
 but that is very trying 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.930
 to make varied and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 actually starts with the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.130
 First, where students are concerned 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.000
 always be a bit conceited 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.649
 should talk and be pompous and who 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 Now we do not know what we are talking about 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.489
 Now he has to watch where I am 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.609
 I already need a student 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.379
 few foreign words in my language watch 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.879
 I'm a bit trivial after a while 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.570
 ordinary, usually nothing conspicuous 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.570
 respectively 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.549
 the weapon only ideal 

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:16.920
 my lecture was very trivial and the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.200
 conversations were very trivial and mine 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.740
 head was very trivial 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.479
 okay what is actually once again the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.299
 does not you think that the 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.159
 I think it's the best 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.549
 my alter ego ported everything attractive 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.380
 so welcome back that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 was one of our little clips 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.859
 have turned around the video a bit 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.799
 to relax and now we would like 

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:46.439
 still quick to report on her 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.689
 have experience with this cliché yes 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.250
 that's exactly what I'm doing with myself 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.390
 have a few people talked to me 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.679
 have told that often the experience 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.590
 somehow it would have stood up 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.750
 can be dented a bit and me 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.129
 believe it would be synonymous one under 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.259
 others will definitely give something 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:02:03.599
 pompously from live talks or so but 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.069
 By and large, that is actually 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.679
 I do not think much of that and that 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:09.299
 yes, I do not believe that the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.489
 situation was of course very exaggerated 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.200
 I think so individuals 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.530
 are there any of these but they do 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:32.579
 most will always talk so yes I have 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:35.099
 also the arc of library and one 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.880
 do something home with it 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.880
 soon to be 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.110
 So the video was almost our say I 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.700
 time artistic interpretation of the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.900
 Clichés, student life is always like that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.069
 a bit annoying and easy seen 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.810
 will and how are you how many 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.930
 sleep is already changes 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.640
 Library counted relatively many honestly 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 That's what this learning area is 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.390
 where everything is so rita busy so that 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.040
 you think oh god i should too 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.290
 definitely do more and right next to it 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.239
 are the sofas where everyone sleeps and 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:31.260
 I have never had any musikanten with thinking 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.260
 maybe I should do that too 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.820
 Not so not so 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.070
 sometimes lends itself just sort of 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.959
 if you sat in the evening so far 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:43.269
 has and then really tired is just times 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.650
 so half an hour short says the eyes 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.800
 he go home but half 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.269
 good hour but I think there too 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.500
 the bulk part certainly learn and there 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.630
 even gives some crazy yes even 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.739
 so at night, do not think to think 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.850
 I think that's easy , too 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.480
 even we now after a few 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.480
 months 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.440
 june application I have to go here now 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.230
 with the really 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:38.899
 then 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:49.179
 Here it goes completely 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:49.179
 the picture is gone 

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:59.849
 The Internet is new territory for us all 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.829
 exactly what law against that one 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.659
 little puzzle so to speak 

00:05:01.829 --> 00:05:05.009
 and we just wanted that one 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.779
 bit to show that this 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.549
 Application always very easy and 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.249
 is kept simple according to the motto 

00:05:08.549 --> 00:05:12.389
 if I have fever with 46 degrees and im 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.789
 but it is already end 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.459
 sometimes a bit tricky 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.569
 just as internet generation seems 

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:21.360
 you are already a bit in favor 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.939
 if you really panic before that 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.649
 Like me, for example, this university application 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.119
 to make and I also very much 

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:29.399
 I have always been easy for a long time 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.899
 I had such a stress with it and 

00:05:29.399 --> 00:05:31.259
 I can always do the same 

00:05:30.899 --> 00:05:33.929
 Not 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:35.189
 that is certainly complicated in the 

00:05:33.929 --> 00:05:36.329
 Ultimately, it is actually mine 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:37.739
 If you really noticed the 

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:38.789
 whole text reads survives is 

00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:40.110
 actually not that hard 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.809
 but often it's just a bit lazy 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.119
 And finally , I can still do so 

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:46.919
 and in the end something will happen 

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:48.360
 wrong, so you should not go wrong 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.039
 otherwise we would sit here 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.360
 but we have a long time on facebook 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:52.369
 to observe that of some 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.229
 a little yes problems 

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:57.179
 that's why I took alone and 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.069
 I think that was a triangle and that 

00:05:57.179 --> 00:06:03.139
 is good too but now enough prejudices 

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:03.139
 served and until next time
