for you guys now trying to make it more
interesting<00:03:48.180> in<00:03:48.690> a<00:03:48.750> minute<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:50.310> finally<00:03:50.760> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
interesting in a minute so finally the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:04:06.220 
interesting in a minute so finally the
white<00:03:51.239> side<00:03:52.550> and<00:03:54.680> get<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.769> pieces<00:03:56.010> back<00:03:56.190> in

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.980 

the<00:04:07.230> piecing<00:04:07.680> pretty<00:04:08.100> quickly<00:04:08.630> start<00:04:09.630> to<00:04:09.750> turn

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
the piecing pretty quickly start to turn

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.150 
the piecing pretty quickly start to turn
oh<00:04:12.020> so<00:04:13.020> there's<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:13.440> already<00:04:13.830> a

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
oh so there's actually already a

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.210 
oh so there's actually already a
noticeable<00:04:15.000> difference<00:04:15.500> in<00:04:16.500> how<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:16.860> keep

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
noticeable difference in how to keep

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.880 
noticeable difference in how to keep
turns<00:04:17.549> is<00:04:17.850> still<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.209> think<00:04:18.540> very<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:19.140> bit<00:04:19.680> too

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
turns is still I think very a bit too

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.060 
turns is still I think very a bit too
loose<00:04:20.130> especially<00:04:20.400> with<00:04:20.850> Whiteside<00:04:21.830> this<00:04:22.830> one

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
loose especially with Whiteside this one

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.230 
loose especially with Whiteside this one
the<00:04:23.580> bit<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:24.060> lose<00:04:24.270> see<00:04:24.810> how<00:04:24.870> it<00:04:24.960> cooks<00:04:25.200> columns

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
the bit to lose see how it cooks columns

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.700 
the bit to lose see how it cooks columns
ok<00:04:27.240> so<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.480> can<00:04:27.600> actually<00:04:27.690> already<00:04:28.080> do<00:04:28.410> line

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
ok so it can actually already do line

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.500 
ok so it can actually already do line
two<00:04:28.950> line<00:04:28.980> without<00:04:29.580> break-in<00:04:30.090> and<00:04:30.240> that's

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
two line without break-in and that's

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.180 
two line without break-in and that's
something<00:04:30.750> which<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.140> don't<00:04:31.380> actually<00:04:31.740> get<00:04:31.920> on

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
something which I don't actually get on

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.120 
something which I don't actually get on
many<00:04:33.150> new<00:04:33.660> Diane<00:04:34.080> cubes<00:04:34.530> when<00:04:34.740> I<00:04:34.770> first

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
many new Diane cubes when I first

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.790 
many new Diane cubes when I first
unboxing<00:04:35.520> so<00:04:35.970> that's<00:04:36.150> quite<00:04:36.450> cool<00:04:36.780> but<00:04:37.710> again

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
unboxing so that's quite cool but again

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.210 
unboxing so that's quite cool but again
it<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.520> pretty<00:04:38.760> loose<00:04:39.090> and<00:04:39.450> I<00:04:40.170> will<00:04:40.920> need<00:04:41.100> to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
it is pretty loose and I will need to

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.770 
it is pretty loose and I will need to
tighten<00:04:41.460> this<00:04:41.640> up<00:04:41.790> a<00:04:41.970> lot<00:04:44.510> well<00:04:45.510> yeah<00:04:45.660> I<00:04:45.720> can

cube<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:54.150> actually<00:04:54.570> do<00:04:54.990> prefer<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.530> to<00:04:55.880> my

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
cube and I actually do prefer it to my

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.340 
cube and I actually do prefer it to my
normal<00:04:57.120> goo<00:04:57.420> hyung<00:04:57.600> which<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.960> was<00:04:58.110> playing

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
normal goo hyung which I was playing

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.380 
normal goo hyung which I was playing
with<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.560> little<00:04:58.800> bit<00:04:58.950> before<00:04:59.100> this<00:04:59.370> video<00:04:59.730> so<00:05:00.150> I

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
with a little bit before this video so I

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.200 
with a little bit before this video so I
would<00:05:01.350> do<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.470> comparison<00:05:01.890> right<00:05:02.220> now<00:05:02.400> but<00:05:02.820> I'm

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
would do a comparison right now but I'm

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.170 
would do a comparison right now but I'm
going<00:05:03.660> to<00:05:03.720> save<00:05:03.960> that<00:05:03.990> for<00:05:04.410> another<00:05:04.530> video<00:05:05.180> so

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
going to save that for another video so

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.140 
going to save that for another video so
I'll<00:05:06.540> probably<00:05:06.630> go<00:05:06.960> in<00:05:07.140> tension<00:05:07.770> this<00:05:07.980> etc<00:05:08.880> and

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
I'll probably go in tension this etc and
