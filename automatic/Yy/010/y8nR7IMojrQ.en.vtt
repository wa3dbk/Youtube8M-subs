00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
powers just this example right here I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
powers just this example right here I
mean<00:01:33.740> there's<00:01:34.740> also<00:01:34.890> example<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.490> can

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
to stay on there and it's also home

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.870 
to stay on there and it's also home
shows<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.430> actually<00:01:41.610> get

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
