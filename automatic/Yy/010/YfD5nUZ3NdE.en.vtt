00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.619 
been able to play as spire in this
section<00:00:49.530> because<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.160> meant<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.460> be

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
section because you meant to be

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.959 
section because you meant to be
exploring<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.840> basically<00:00:52.079> defending<00:00:52.969> but

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
exploring and basically defending but

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
exploring and basically defending but
puffin<00:00:54.360> palace<00:00:54.690> from<00:00:54.870> Spyro<00:00:55.350> 4<00:00:55.620> but<00:00:55.860> we<00:00:55.949> meant

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
puffin palace from Spyro 4 but we meant

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
puffin palace from Spyro 4 but we meant
to<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.399> defending<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.989> that

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to be defending them now if you see that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.599 
to be defending them now if you see that
we<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> walk<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> water<00:00:59.100> because<00:00:59.430> this

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
we can walk on the water because this

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
we can walk on the water because this
actually<00:00:59.850> isn't<00:01:00.239> water<00:01:00.690> it's<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.440> an

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
actually isn't water it's just an

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.549 
actually isn't water it's just an
illusion<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.219> its<00:01:02.399> water<00:01:02.640> basically<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:04.350> it

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
illusion that its water basically if it

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.609 
illusion that its water basically if it
was<00:01:04.769> water<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.700> game<00:01:05.909> probably<00:01:06.560> may<00:01:07.560> be

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
was water the game probably may be

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.460 
was water the game probably may be
edited<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.369> 50/50<00:01:09.090> chance<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> crash<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
edited to 50/50 chance of the crash it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.170 
edited to 50/50 chance of the crash it
usually<00:01:10.650> crashes<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:11.850> Sheila

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
usually crashes in the you know Sheila

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.469 
usually crashes in the you know Sheila
or<00:01:12.600> other<00:01:13.290> levels<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.369> yeah<00:01:14.850> now

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
or other levels like that but yeah now

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.789 
or other levels like that but yeah now
it's<00:01:15.720> all<00:01:15.900> something<00:01:16.110> how<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
it's all something how to do this you

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.200 
it's all something how to do this you
can<00:01:16.860> actually<00:01:17.100> destroy<00:01:17.430> them<00:01:17.640> without<00:01:17.759> using

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
can actually destroy them without using

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.719 
can actually destroy them without using
the<00:01:18.299> super<00:01:18.509> flame<00:01:18.890> it's<00:01:19.890> funny<00:01:20.100> because<00:01:20.340> think

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the super flame it's funny because think

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.050 
the super flame it's funny because think
about<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> threat<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.250> coding<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> these

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
about in the threat the coding of these

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.999 
about in the threat the coding of these
enemies<00:01:24.450> right<00:01:24.869> they're<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.470> exact<00:01:25.890> same

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
enemies right they're the exact same

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
enemies right they're the exact same
enemies<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.150> are<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.860> Spyro<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
enemies as they are in Spyro in in the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.620 
enemies as they are in Spyro in in the
Bentley<00:01:31.140> minigame<00:01:31.650> right<00:01:32.100> only<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.329> time

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
Bentley minigame right only this time

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.310 
Bentley minigame right only this time
you<00:01:34.759> can<00:01:35.759> hurt<00:01:36.030> them<00:01:36.240> when<00:01:36.869> you're<00:01:37.020> playing<00:01:37.170> as

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you can hurt them when you're playing as

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.710 
you can hurt them when you're playing as
Bentley<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.100> can't<00:01:39.090> hurt<00:01:39.299> them<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.570> you're

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
Bentley you can't hurt them when you're

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.210 
Bentley you can't hurt them when you're
Spira<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.290> must<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.770> different

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
Spira so they must have a different

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.249 
Spira so they must have a different
nurse<00:01:41.369> be<00:01:41.549> coded<00:01:42.000> differently<00:01:42.119> where<00:01:42.630> only<00:01:43.049> a

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
nurse be coded differently where only a

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.039 
nurse be coded differently where only a
certain<00:01:43.530> attack<00:01:43.979> will<00:01:44.759> hurt<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.450> I'm

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
certain attack will hurt them now I'm

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.899 
certain attack will hurt them now I'm
just<00:01:46.200> trying<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> think<00:01:46.470> could<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.369> charge

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
just trying to think could you charge

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
just trying to think could you charge
them<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.210> death<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.780> don't<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> can

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
them to death I don't think you can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.679 
them to death I don't think you can
right<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:50.909> say<00:01:51.060> Kenny

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
right let's say Kenny

solid<00:02:44.900> is<00:02:45.019> bamboo<00:02:45.440> actually<00:02:45.739> isn't<00:02:45.860> bamboo

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
solid is bamboo actually isn't bamboo

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.710 
solid is bamboo actually isn't bamboo
kind<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.430> hollow<00:02:46.610> yeah

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
kind of hollow yeah

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.900 
kind of hollow yeah
but<00:02:48.079> not<00:02:48.230> yet<00:02:48.410> anyway<00:02:49.130> look<00:02:49.519> at<00:02:49.610> that<00:02:49.730> we've

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
but not yet anyway look at that we've

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.670 
but not yet anyway look at that we've
destroyed<00:02:50.269> every<00:02:50.629> enemy<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.200> when<00:02:51.379> we<00:02:51.500> do<00:02:51.650> our

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
destroyed every enemy so when we do our

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.250 
destroyed every enemy so when we do our
first<00:02:52.069> rotation<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:53.420> becomes<00:02:53.780> incredibly

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
first rotation this becomes incredibly

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
first rotation this becomes incredibly
simple<00:02:54.920> now<00:02:56.319> it's<00:02:57.319> basically<00:02:57.500> no<00:02:57.829> way<00:02:58.069> of

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
simple now it's basically no way of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.979 
simple now it's basically no way of
being<00:02:58.489> administered<00:02:58.940> saves<00:02:59.299> data<00:02:59.540> just<00:02:59.900> to

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
being administered saves data just to

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.039 
being administered saves data just to
see<00:03:00.230> basically<00:03:01.030> it's<00:03:02.030> circum<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.600> walk<00:03:02.840> on

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
see basically it's circum you walk on

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:11.059 
see basically it's circum you walk on
here<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:05.660> second<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.139> hit<00:03:06.410> this

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:19.660 

ready<00:03:16.609> whoa

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.230 

 look<00:03:20.750> at<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.960> I<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.910> that's<00:03:22.910> awesome

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
look at that you see how I did that I

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.000 
look at that you see how I did that I
basically<00:03:25.280> just<00:03:26.270> managed<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.810> get<00:03:27.110> that<00:03:27.380> it's

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
basically just managed to get that it's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.940 
basically just managed to get that it's
actually<00:03:28.340> really<00:03:28.940> quite<00:03:29.270> difficult<00:03:29.540> because

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
actually really quite difficult because

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.000 
actually really quite difficult because
ok<00:03:30.950> let's<00:03:31.130> give<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.310> a<00:03:31.400> go<00:03:32.590> because<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.680> way<00:03:33.830> it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
ok let's give it a go because the way it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.460 
ok let's give it a go because the way it
sort<00:03:34.250> of<00:03:34.310> looks<00:03:34.490> like<00:03:34.640> it's<00:03:34.790> like<00:03:35.170> designed<00:03:36.170> if

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
sort of looks like it's like designed if

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.110 
sort of looks like it's like designed if
you<00:03:36.620> step<00:03:36.890> in<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:37.340> can<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> bit<00:03:37.910> you're<00:03:38.030> gonna

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
you step in you can a bit you're gonna

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:48.309 
you step in you can a bit you're gonna
talk<00:03:38.600> to<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> dude<00:03:41.200> see<00:03:43.750> that's<00:03:44.750> good

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.520 

there<00:03:48.980> we<00:03:49.219> go<00:03:49.400> all<00:03:49.969> right<00:03:50.000> now<00:03:50.420> if<00:03:51.319> you<00:03:51.409> have

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:51.530 
there we go all right now if you have

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.740 
there we go all right now if you have
some<00:03:51.709> fun<00:03:51.950> using<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.819> fireball<00:03:53.269> here<00:03:53.450> as<00:03:53.569> well

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
some fun using the fireball here as well

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.809 
some fun using the fireball here as well
of<00:03:54.170> course<00:03:54.230> be<00:03:54.799> actually<00:03:55.310> this<00:03:55.459> kind<00:03:55.640> of<00:03:55.670> makes

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
of course be actually this kind of makes

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.170 
of course be actually this kind of makes
it<00:03:55.939> an<00:03:56.689> interesting<00:03:56.959> challenge<00:03:57.530> because

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
it an interesting challenge because

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.119 
it an interesting challenge because
typically<00:03:59.180> I'd<00:03:59.510> say<00:03:59.930> that<00:04:00.200> it's<00:04:00.349> almost<00:04:00.859> more

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
typically I'd say that it's almost more

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:02.440 
typically I'd say that it's almost more
likely<00:04:01.489> we<00:04:01.640> might<00:04:01.819> be<00:04:01.939> able<00:04:02.030> to<00:04:02.090> hit<00:04:02.269> these

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
likely we might be able to hit these

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.750 
likely we might be able to hit these
guys<00:04:02.510> if<00:04:03.469> we're<00:04:03.650> not<00:04:03.739> careful<00:04:03.980> we<00:04:04.370> might<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:04.700> a

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
guys if we're not careful we might get a

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.679 
guys if we're not careful we might get a
bit<00:04:04.879> lazy<00:04:07.090> but<00:04:08.090> if<00:04:08.180> you<00:04:08.239> look<00:04:08.390> at<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.540> they're

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
bit lazy but if you look at that they're

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.369 
bit lazy but if you look at that they're
all<00:04:08.840> gone

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
all gone

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.800 
all gone
