that is considered unsliced op it um I
figured<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.269> during<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.080> game<00:00:28.140> during<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
through experiments you got to figure

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.709 
through experiments you got to figure
out<00:00:32.009> how<00:00:32.219> you're<00:00:32.369> gonna<00:00:32.430> slow<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.759> down<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.420> at

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
out how you're gonna slow it down and at

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.030 
out how you're gonna slow it down and at
first<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.110> definitely<00:00:34.590> gave<00:00:34.710> me<00:00:34.860> some

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
first it definitely gave me some

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
first it definitely gave me some
troubles<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.640> um<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.510> all<00:00:36.809> about<00:00:37.079> being

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
troubles but um it's all about being

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
missed a few reads here and there we

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.029 
missed a few reads here and there we
definitely<00:00:48.719> had<00:00:48.870> our<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.230> right<00:00:49.469> away<00:00:49.590> and

you're going to want to do is call a
play<00:00:55.350> action<00:00:55.530> play<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:57.030> you're<00:00:57.149> going

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
play action play and then you're going

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.840 
play action play and then you're going
to<00:00:57.300> want<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.570> pinch<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.039> offensive<00:00:59.039> line<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to want to pinch the offensive line and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.430 
to want to pinch the offensive line and
that<00:00:59.940> will<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.149> pick<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.079> gap

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
that will actually pick up the a gap

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.950 
that will actually pick up the a gap
portion<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.910> blitz<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.600> if<00:01:03.750> you're<00:01:03.870> only

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
portion of the blitz now if you're only

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.289 
portion of the blitz now if you're only
blocking<00:01:04.320> 5<00:01:04.799> because<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.820> send<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.090> running

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
blocking 5 because you send the running

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.780 
blocking 5 because you send the running
back<00:01:06.450> out<00:01:07.100> basically<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.250> that's<00:01:08.400> going<00:01:08.670> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
back out basically what that's going to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.200 
back out basically what that's going to
do<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.740> allow<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.159> edge<00:01:11.400> defenders<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
do is allow one of the edge defenders to

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.960 
do is allow one of the edge defenders to
get<00:01:12.390> off<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.080> come<00:01:13.710> through<00:01:13.740> but<00:01:14.310> again<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
get off and come through but again you

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
get off and come through but again you
would<00:01:15.090> rather<00:01:15.270> have<00:01:15.840> an<00:01:16.020> edge<00:01:16.170> defender<00:01:16.740> than

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
would rather have an edge defender than

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.039 
would rather have an edge defender than
an<00:01:17.009> egg<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.400> Blitzer<00:01:17.820> hopefully<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.509> then<00:01:18.930> if

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
an egg at Blitzer hopefully and then if

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
an egg at Blitzer hopefully and then if
you<00:01:19.170> block<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> running<00:01:19.890> back<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.220> well<00:01:20.400> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you block the running back as well you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.060 
you block the running back as well you
can<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:20.880> ahead<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.090> pick<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.950> you<00:01:22.950> know

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
can go ahead and pick it up you know

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.880 
can go ahead and pick it up you know
which<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.060> ended<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.570> starting<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.049> do<00:01:25.259> but

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
which we ended up starting to do but

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
which we ended up starting to do but
with<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> Giants<00:01:26.850> being<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> Giants<00:01:27.509> they're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
with the Giants being the Giants they're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
with the Giants being the Giants they're
gonna<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.200> black<00:01:28.470> sheds<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
gonna get a lot of black sheds and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.039 
gonna get a lot of black sheds and
things<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> take<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:30.990> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
things like that so we had to take it a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.830 
things like that so we had to take it a
step<00:01:31.079> further<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.770> counter<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.570> was

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
step further to counter that so that was

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
step further to counter that so that was
the<00:01:34.170> adjustments<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> we<00:01:35.369> made<00:01:35.400> throughout

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the adjustments that we made throughout

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.539 
the adjustments that we made throughout
this<00:01:36.090> game<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.049> hopefully<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:38.220> will<00:01:38.369> pay

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
this game and hopefully they will pay

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.249 
this game and hopefully they will pay
off<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.659> defense<00:01:40.110> has<00:01:40.229> been

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
off right now the defense has been

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
right here driving down the field

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.160 
right here driving down the field
getting<00:03:26.280> into<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> end<00:03:26.760> zone<00:03:26.850> so<00:03:27.300> at<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
getting into the end zone so at this

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.460 
getting into the end zone so at this
point<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.769> time<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.700> get<00:03:29.820> another<00:03:30.030> touchdown

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470

involved<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.140> game<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.650> right<00:03:35.580> here<00:03:36.060> as

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:36.350 
involved in the game and right here as

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.860 
involved in the game and right here as
I've<00:03:37.350> said<00:03:37.530> before<00:03:38.150> certain<00:03:39.150> run<00:03:39.330> plays<00:03:39.630> are

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
I've said before certain run plays are

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.509 
I've said before certain run plays are
very<00:03:40.110> effective<00:03:40.590> against<00:03:40.769> certain<00:03:41.010> blitzes

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
very effective against certain blitzes

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.490 
very effective against certain blitzes
you<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.880> have<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.180> find<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.630> right<00:03:42.900> run<00:03:43.230> play

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you just have to find the right run play

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.040 
you just have to find the right run play
again<00:03:44.459> not<00:03:44.730> every<00:03:45.180> run<00:03:45.360> play<00:03:45.570> is<00:03:45.720> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.930> be

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
again not every run play is going to be

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.340 
again not every run play is going to be
good<00:03:46.200> against<00:03:46.560> various<00:03:47.280> blitzes<00:03:47.760> but

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
good against various blitzes but

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.660 
good against various blitzes but
depending<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.440> which<00:03:49.620> blitz<00:03:49.920> they're<00:03:50.100> using<00:03:50.550> a

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
depending on which blitz they're using a

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.850 
depending on which blitz they're using a
certain<00:03:51.330> run<00:03:51.480> play<00:03:51.690> might<00:03:51.900> work<00:03:52.110> a<00:03:52.230> counter<00:03:52.680> a

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
certain run play might work a counter a

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.550 
certain run play might work a counter a
power<00:03:53.280> of<00:03:53.489> a<00:03:53.670> stretch<00:03:54.030> even<00:03:54.420> a<00:03:54.870> dive<00:03:55.110> against

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
power of a stretch even a dive against

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.400 
power of a stretch even a dive against
certain<00:03:55.830> blitz<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.370> dependent<00:03:56.850> on<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:56.970> Blitz

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
certain blitz is dependent on the Blitz

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.410 
certain blitz is dependent on the Blitz
it<00:03:58.410> could<00:03:58.680> be<00:03:58.800> the<00:03:58.950> perfect<00:03:59.220> play<00:03:59.850> call<00:04:00.120> for

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
it could be the perfect play call for

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.900 
it could be the perfect play call for
that<00:04:00.540> situation<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.530> right<00:04:02.280> here<00:04:02.310> he<00:04:02.670> gets<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that situation and right here he gets a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.150 
that situation and right here he gets a
nice<00:04:03.060> inside<00:04:03.450> pass<00:04:03.690> lead<00:04:04.019> against<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.860> zones

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
nice inside pass lead against the zones

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.910 
nice inside pass lead against the zones
and<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:06.239> do<00:04:06.420> not<00:04:06.630> don't<00:04:07.080> believe<00:04:07.320> shaved<00:04:07.709> our

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
and we do not don't believe shaved our

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640 
and we do not don't believe shaved our
coverage<00:04:08.250> inside<00:04:08.640> enough<00:04:08.970> but<00:04:09.840> matt<00:04:10.049> forte<00:04:10.620> is

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
coverage inside enough but matt forte is

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.190 
coverage inside enough but matt forte is
able<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.070> recover<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.549> onside<00:04:11.580> kick<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.450> now

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
able to recover the onside kick and now

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.840 
able to recover the onside kick and now
it's<00:04:13.500> time<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:13.920> just<00:04:14.070> kill<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.430> rest<00:04:14.610> of<00:04:14.790> this

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
it's time to just kill the rest of this
