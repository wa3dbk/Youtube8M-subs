some more Opie anarchy this is a little
bit<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.279> hack<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.150> thought<00:00:06.600> it<00:00:06.660> was<00:00:06.899> because

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
bit of a hack I thought it was because

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.160 
bit of a hack I thought it was because
this<00:00:08.220> dude<00:00:08.400> right<00:00:08.460> here<00:00:08.670> he'd<00:00:09.450> mine<00:00:09.780> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
this dude right here he'd mine and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.459 
this dude right here he'd mine and
instead<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.250> gold<00:00:11.519> or<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:11.969> iron<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:13.200> come

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
instead of the gold or the iron it come

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.709 
instead of the gold or the iron it come
out<00:00:13.590> in<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.009> ignis<00:00:14.519> or<00:00:14.820> Ignatz<00:00:15.240> whenever<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
out in the ignis or Ignatz whenever the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
out in the ignis or Ignatz whenever the
hell<00:00:15.750> he<00:00:15.870> has<00:00:16.080> one<00:00:16.289> call<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.619> and<00:00:16.859> I<00:00:17.730> thought<00:00:18.300> it

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
hell he has one call it and I thought it

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.529 
hell he has one call it and I thought it
was<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> hack<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.619> what<00:00:20.250> I<00:00:20.279> did<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.119> went<00:00:21.150> back

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
was a hack so what I did is I went back

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.460 
was a hack so what I did is I went back
to<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.810> plot<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:23.310> go<00:00:23.789> get<00:00:24.000> my<00:00:24.330> pickaxe<00:00:24.810> just<00:00:25.320> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
to my plot to go get my pickaxe just to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
to my plot to go get my pickaxe just to
make<00:00:25.619> sure<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.490> don't<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.359> was<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
make sure and I don't know if this was a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.259 
make sure and I don't know if this was a
new<00:00:28.260> plug-in<00:00:28.590> implemented<00:00:29.550> because<00:00:29.760> I

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
new plug-in implemented because I

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.600

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
couple'a days i was at E and then I'd

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.770 
couple'a days i was at E and then I'd
make<00:00:44.280> him<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> box<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.210> stuff<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.719> that

like<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:26.909> was<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.270> hack<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> beginning<00:01:27.990> but

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.960 
they implemented that I don't know if
it's<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.770> new<00:01:43.920> plug-in<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.369> anything<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.850> that
