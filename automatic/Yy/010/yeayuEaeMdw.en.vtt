00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
excuse my breathing I'm sort of breath

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:34.090 
excuse my breathing I'm sort of breath
um<00:00:25.460> think<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:28.039> D<00:00:29.039> B<00:00:29.609> G<00:00:31.189> B<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.489> E<00:00:32.640> strings

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
um think of the D B G B and E strings

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.350 
um think of the D B G B and E strings
and<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.520> would<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.760> zero<00:00:37.730> seven<00:00:38.730> eight<00:00:38.940> seven

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and it would be zero seven eight seven

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.869 
and it would be zero seven eight seven
which<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.530> basically<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:41.040> D<00:00:41.250> chord<00:00:41.520> up<00:00:41.670> at<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
which is basically a D chord up at the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.680 
which is basically a D chord up at the
sentence<00:00:42.180> right

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.979 

and<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.770> second<00:00:47.160> chord<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:48.560> serial<00:00:49.560> six<00:00:49.890> five

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
and then second chord is serial six five

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:58.460 
and then second chord is serial six five
seven<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:53.630> then<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:56.790> know<00:00:56.910> when<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.470> drop

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
seven and then you know when you drop

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.560 
seven and then you know when you drop
the<00:00:58.620> e<00:00:58.650> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> 5<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.970> second<00:01:00.360> little

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the e to the 5 in the second little

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.920 
the e to the 5 in the second little
thing<00:01:06.380> okay<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.979> all<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.520> do<00:01:09.210> mine

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
thing okay I'm we all do it I do mine

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.580 
thing okay I'm we all do it I do mine
differently<00:01:10.860> but<00:01:11.190> you<00:01:11.940> know<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.410> just<00:01:13.410> want<00:01:13.530> to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
differently but you know I just want to

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
differently but you know I just want to
give<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.800> basic<00:01:14.009> chords<00:01:14.960> well<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.080> I

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
give the basic chords well what I

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.730 
give the basic chords well what I
figured<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.619> now<00:01:16.830> might<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.040> wrong<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:18.740> what

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
figured out now might be wrong so what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:31.450 
figured out now might be wrong so what
can<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:24.680> okay

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.910 

get<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.299> now<00:01:34.369> 2/3<00:01:35.369> would<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:37.520> 0<00:01:38.520> 5<00:01:39.920> 7

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
get that and then now 2/3 would be 0 5 7

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.690 
get that and then now 2/3 would be 0 5 7
5<00:01:42.500> I've<00:01:43.500> seen<00:01:43.740> somebody<00:01:44.040> else<00:01:44.190> do<00:01:44.369> 0<00:01:45.030> 7<00:01:45.540> 7<00:01:45.840> boy

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
5 I've seen somebody else do 0 7 7 boy

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.600 
5 I've seen somebody else do 0 7 7 boy
but<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.420> gonna<00:01:48.570> do<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.610> that's

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
but I'm just gonna do it this way that's

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.910 
but I'm just gonna do it this way that's
the<00:01:50.909> way<00:01:50.940> I<00:01:51.060> learned<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.830> change<00:01:52.830> it

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
the way I learned it and change it

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.370 
the way I learned it and change it
around<00:01:53.040> if<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.670> don't<00:01:53.729> know<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.390> then

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
around if you want I don't know and then

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:04.150 
around if you want I don't know and then
0<00:01:55.890> for<00:01:56.280> 3<00:01:56.580> 3<00:01:58.610> then<00:01:59.610> back<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.060> zero<00:02:02.179> seven<00:02:03.179> seven

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
0 for 3 3 then back to zero seven seven

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:12.220 
0 for 3 3 then back to zero seven seven
five<00:02:05.899> back<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.110> zero<00:02:07.440> zero<00:02:08.899> four<00:02:09.899> three<00:02:10.200> three

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
five back to zero zero four three three

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:27.600 

do<00:02:13.230> that<00:02:13.410> twice<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> then<00:02:17.220> back<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.110 

do<00:02:28.610> that<00:02:28.760> again<00:02:29.090> and<00:02:29.330> then<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:29.870> got<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.050> 0<00:02:30.620> 3<00:02:30.860> 3

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.690 

the<00:02:35.120> other<00:02:35.240> part<00:02:35.600> is<00:02:35.900> so<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:36.920> did<00:02:37.490> it<00:02:37.780> was<00:02:39.700> five

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
the other part is so I did it was five

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.180 
the other part is so I did it was five
four<00:02:41.300> three<00:02:41.740> zero

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:56.920 

four<00:02:46.190> zero<00:02:46.989> three<00:02:47.989> zero<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.659> do<00:02:56.780> that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
four zero three zero so you do that

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.490 
four zero three zero so you do that
twice<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:58.519> then<00:02:58.970> I<00:02:59.000> went<00:02:59.239> down<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.659> three<00:03:00.080> two

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
twice and then I went down to three two

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.520 
twice and then I went down to three two
one<00:03:00.860> zero<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:04.000> two<00:03:05.000> zero<00:03:05.480> zero<00:03:05.840> zero<00:03:06.140> zero

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
one zero and two zero zero zero zero

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:15.880 
one zero and two zero zero zero zero
zero<00:03:09.909> zero<00:03:10.909> one<00:03:11.420> zero

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:32.570 

so<00:03:16.890> altogether<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.880> would<00:03:18.030> be

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.700 

okay<00:03:33.580> because<00:03:34.120> after<00:03:34.390> the<00:03:34.690> zero<00:03:34.960> zero<00:03:35.470> one

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:35.710 
okay because after the zero zero one

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.250 
okay because after the zero zero one
zero<00:03:35.740> when<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.430> to<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.730> zero<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.270> three

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
zero when you go up to the zero to three

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.240 
zero when you go up to the zero to three
two<00:03:38.560> which<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.040> a<00:03:39.070> D<00:03:39.370> chord<00:03:40.500> now<00:03:41.500> I've<00:03:41.800> seen

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
two which is a D chord now I've seen

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.410 
two which is a D chord now I've seen
somebody<00:03:42.520> else<00:03:42.670> do<00:03:43.030> it

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
somebody else do it

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.310 
somebody else do it
I<00:03:44.220> guess<00:03:45.220> some<00:03:46.440> where<00:03:47.440> they<00:03:48.340> did<00:03:50.010> five<00:03:51.010> five

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
I guess some where they did five five

00:03:52.320 --> 00:04:04.710 
I guess some where they did five five
three<00:03:53.320> zero<00:03:59.250> might<00:04:00.250> be<00:04:00.430> more<00:04:00.640> correct<00:04:03.510> no<00:04:04.510> no

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
three zero might be more correct no no

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.840 
three zero might be more correct no no
I'm<00:04:04.990> like<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.410> said<00:04:05.620> I<00:04:05.650> did<00:04:05.950> this<00:04:06.130> trying<00:04:06.760> to

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
I'm like I said I did this trying to

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.120 
I'm like I said I did this trying to
figure<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.120> out<00:04:07.300> because<00:04:07.540> I<00:04:07.810> always<00:04:08.710> loved<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
figure it out because I always loved the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.260 
figure it out because I always loved the
song<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.450> then<00:04:11.410> when<00:04:11.650> he<00:04:11.860> went<00:04:11.980> down<00:04:12.270> the

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
song and then when he went down the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.650 
song and then when he went down the
second<00:04:13.660> part<00:04:13.840> he<00:04:14.020> was<00:04:14.970> he<00:04:15.970> totally<00:04:16.299> changed

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
second part he was he totally changed

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.370 
second part he was he totally changed
instead<00:04:16.870> of<00:04:16.989> doing<00:04:17.230> this<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:19.120> three<00:04:19.570> two<00:04:20.080> one

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
instead of doing this the three two one

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.060 
instead of doing this the three two one
he<00:04:20.709> just<00:04:21.010> did<00:04:21.250> a<00:04:21.280> deep<00:04:21.930> minor<00:04:22.930> which<00:04:23.770> would<00:04:23.950> be

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
he just did a deep minor which would be

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.380 
he just did a deep minor which would be
zero<00:04:24.970> two<00:04:25.540> three<00:04:25.900> one<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.070> did<00:04:28.060> a<00:04:28.090> pull-off

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
zero two three one and did a pull-off

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:42.990 
zero two three one and did a pull-off
and<00:04:28.750> one<00:04:31.260> and<00:04:32.310> then<00:04:33.310> two<00:04:33.460> a<00:04:33.490> see<00:04:38.520> you<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:42.000> and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
and one and then two a see you know and

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.640 
and one and then two a see you know and
then<00:04:43.930> goes<00:04:44.290> back<00:04:44.320> to<00:04:44.530> the<00:04:46.110> zero<00:04:47.110> zero<00:04:47.200> one<00:04:47.590> zero

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.920 

I<00:04:52.040> think<00:04:53.040> that's<00:04:53.220> actually<00:04:53.490> more<00:04:53.940> what<00:04:54.300> Roger

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
I think that's actually more what Roger

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.439 
I think that's actually more what Roger
was<00:04:55.199> singing<00:04:55.669> but<00:04:56.669> it<00:04:56.760> sounds<00:04:57.000> really<00:04:57.120> cool

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
was singing but it sounds really cool

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.320 
was singing but it sounds really cool
you<00:04:57.870> know

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
you know

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:16.309 
you know
so<00:05:01.940> guess<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.090> did<00:05:03.270> this<00:05:03.419> way

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.070 

that's<00:05:17.319> pretty<00:05:17.499> cool<00:05:17.740> I<00:05:17.770> guess<00:05:18.009> I<00:05:18.219> don't<00:05:18.520> know

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
that's pretty cool I guess I don't know

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.390 
that's pretty cool I guess I don't know
so<00:05:20.080> you<00:05:20.319> can<00:05:20.650> do<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.860> either<00:05:20.979> way

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
so you can do it either way

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.429 
so you can do it either way
anyway<00:05:21.819> and<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.569> me<00:05:22.749> trying<00:05:22.779> to<00:05:23.110> do<00:05:23.289> it
