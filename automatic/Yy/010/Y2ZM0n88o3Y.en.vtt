00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hi guys today the video is going to be explain 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.930
 how to use the crosses is everyone 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.099
 using but a lot of people are using 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.429
 wrong way 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.549
 so it's two songs, first one 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.020
 it has to appear at most four or 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.869
 five of them belly 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.779
 our which is so because otherwise 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.730
 vulgar and the second rule the friend does not 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.730
 then this track appears 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:34.390
 there are several models is the most fair 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.520
 the koscheck type each 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.780
 will bring to light the situation 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.940
 This is mine here, the body is applied 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.790
 for the night he has more than kot 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.090
 Show me another one, there we use it. 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.530
 for us this my genetic here the cadet 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.320
 Then you can use it everyday. 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.890
 taking place as you go from the day to 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.170
 day 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.910
 another thing I wanted to say that 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.190
 a lot of people ask me where I can 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.690
 find a show monique wants to buy 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.640
 first that the team is not difficult 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.199
 find you go on the coins and ask 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.150
 if you have proof that the person does not even know 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.900
 it means what is the self 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.450
 so the tip is you look at you 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.220
 at home and if others do not know if 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:20.070
 They inscribed that it's a little bit going there. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.070
 it is a bodice moment that the sober and 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:35.229
 so I use it that way, I can not even 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.240
 realize you do not have to care because 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.899
 then do not want to wear jeans 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:44.609
 a used place as I said I cut 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:46.810
 so try to adapt to mercy 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:51.250
 it will be cool 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.920
 medical advice will find a way 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.899
 And another thing I was going to talk about is 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.189
 used the right way 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.960
 if you are a little overweight 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.549
 people are not recommended 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.920
 we always assume the principle 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:07.149
 He hid that we were wrong. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.250
 so if you have a tummy 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.370
 stand out if you have a little out there 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.780
 so do not use that will end 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.530
 showing once you do not you 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.530
 show faith has helped and soya 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.460
