00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.100 
same way that they do in animation so
I'm<00:02:23.500> wondering<00:02:23.769> if<00:02:24.159> if<00:02:25.060> everyone<00:02:25.780> seems<00:02:26.049> to

I'm wondering if if everyone seems to

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.410 
I'm wondering if if everyone seems to
lie

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
lie

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.500 
lie
for<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.590> same<00:02:27.830> reason<00:02:28.310> or<00:02:28.819> people<00:02:29.120> like<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
for the same reason or people like it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.440 
for the same reason or people like it
for<00:02:29.650> different<00:02:30.650> and<00:02:30.950> obscure<00:02:31.310> reasons<00:02:31.730> I'm

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
for different and obscure reasons I'm

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.570 
for different and obscure reasons I'm
thinking<00:02:33.020> probably<00:02:33.620> different<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.160> obscure

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
thinking probably different and obscure

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
thinking probably different and obscure
reasons<00:02:35.030> for<00:02:35.209> instance<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.170> anime

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
reasons for instance I like anime

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
reasons for instance I like anime
because<00:02:36.800> I<00:02:37.190> like<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.580> look<00:02:37.730> at<00:02:37.849> the<00:02:37.940> color<00:02:38.150> I

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
because I like to look at the color I

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.280 
because I like to look at the color I
think<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.349> find<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.800> animation<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.610> be

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
think I find the animation to be

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
think I find the animation to be
particularly<00:02:42.290> striking<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.160> about

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
particularly striking and just about

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.920 
particularly striking and just about
everything<00:02:43.550> I<00:02:43.730> watch<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.090> like<00:02:44.420> to<00:02:44.600> see<00:02:44.780> the

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
everything I watch I like to see the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.960 
everything I watch I like to see the
fluid<00:02:45.230> motions<00:02:45.590> I<00:02:45.770> think<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:46.340> very<00:02:46.580> cool

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
fluid motions I think it's very cool

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.210 
fluid motions I think it's very cool
that<00:02:47.000> someone<00:02:47.510> can<00:02:47.690> create<00:02:48.110> something<00:02:48.860> that

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
that someone can create something that

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.340 
that someone can create something that
has<00:02:49.459> so<00:02:49.700> much<00:02:49.850> motion<00:02:50.330> so<00:02:50.540> much<00:02:50.720> life<00:02:50.959> with<00:02:51.319> a

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
has so much motion so much life with a

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.860 
has so much motion so much life with a
hand-drawn<00:02:52.100> or<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:53.090> computer<00:02:53.569> scanned

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
hand-drawn or just computer scanned

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.809 
hand-drawn or just computer scanned
images<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.500> find<00:02:54.739> that<00:02:54.860> to<00:02:54.980> be<00:02:55.010> fascinating

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
images I find that to be fascinating

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:58.720 
images I find that to be fascinating
also<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.750> anime<00:02:57.080> because<00:02:57.380> I<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:58.459> seen

also like anime because I have seen

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.670 
also like anime because I have seen
plenty<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.360> TV<00:02:59.690> shows<00:02:59.900> in<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.140> past<00:03:00.350> and

plenty of TV shows in the past and

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.750 
plenty of TV shows in the past and
movies<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.880> must<00:03:02.209> say<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:03.069> I<00:03:04.069> just<00:03:04.250> don't

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
movies and I must say that I just don't

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.229 
movies and I must say that I just don't
find<00:03:05.000> anything<00:03:05.299> deep<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.080> don't<00:03:06.920> find<00:03:07.310> myself

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
find anything deep I don't find myself

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.229 
find anything deep I don't find myself
to<00:03:08.630> be<00:03:08.660> is<00:03:09.110> attached<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.980> real<00:03:10.220> characters<00:03:10.850> and

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
to be is attached to real characters and

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
cinema and TV as I do anime characters

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.039 
cinema and TV as I do anime characters
and<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.670> might<00:03:13.819> seem<00:03:14.000> kind<00:03:14.209> of<00:03:14.269> weird<00:03:14.510> to<00:03:14.870> you

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
and that might seem kind of weird to you

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.620 
and that might seem kind of weird to you
that<00:03:15.920> I've<00:03:16.430> attached<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:17.030> something<00:03:17.390> fake

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
that I've attached to something fake

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.110 
that I've attached to something fake
instead<00:03:17.989> of<00:03:18.110> real<00:03:18.260> but<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.530> do<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:19.519> I<00:03:19.610> think<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
instead of real but I do and I think the

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.300 
instead of real but I do and I think the
main<00:03:20.360> reason<00:03:20.390> that<00:03:20.900> I<00:03:21.049> like<00:03:21.290> anime<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.799> because

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
main reason that I like anime is because

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.059 
main reason that I like anime is because
it's<00:03:23.150> just<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:24.140> just<00:03:24.170> has<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.890> much

it's just it just has so much

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:26.890 
it's just it just has so much
imagination<00:03:25.700> from<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.269> directors<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:26.840> the

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
imagination from the directors and the

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.930 
imagination from the directors and the
creators<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.739> just<00:03:27.950> has<00:03:28.130> so<00:03:28.370> much<00:03:28.549> heart

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
liked it a lot and I could almost go far

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.479 
liked it a lot and I could almost go far
to<00:03:38.060> say<00:03:38.239> is<00:03:38.480> that<00:03:38.690> anime<00:03:39.079> is<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.340> massive<00:03:40.340> part

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
to say is that anime is a massive part

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.340 
to say is that anime is a massive part
of<00:03:40.670> my<00:03:40.760> life<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.570> I<00:03:41.660> know<00:03:41.720> that<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.109> lot<00:03:42.320> of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
of my life and I know that a lot of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:43.810 
of my life and I know that a lot of
people<00:03:42.709> might<00:03:42.920> have<00:03:43.100> it<00:03:43.250> is<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> big<00:03:43.549> part<00:03:43.790> of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
people might have it is a big part of

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.640 
people might have it is a big part of
their<00:03:43.940> life<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.570> that's<00:03:44.780> that's<00:03:45.200> really<00:03:45.470> good
