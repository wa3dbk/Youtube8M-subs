00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.630
 season you also scored the others 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.610
 championship players since these are 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.050
 who elected you and you scored 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.180
 also christophe dugarry our 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.220
 consultant who commented on almost all 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.510
 your zlatan matches seen by dugarry that's 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.510
 a subject prepared by olivier tallaron 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.090
 I sell 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.760
 Beyond its technical qualities here 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.020
 it's the man when he gets off the bus 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.810
 when he walks on the red carpet 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.420
 his pace his charisma is more than a 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.770
 player what is a real star who 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.770
 assumes as he is 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.310
 me I 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:59.300
 because the most revealing it has been 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.470
 against nice on his caught civelli and you 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.790
 sense that it was because the last thing 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.069
 what had to be done to make that 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.080
 almost allowed him to get into 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.840
 his match he found himself in a duel 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.640
 and there you can not play can not the 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.890
 win what guys and it's a monster 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.110
 physically he has so much experience 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.590
 he's so much about you his game of this 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.120
 he knows how to do 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.270
 this is a player who feeds on 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.270
 it 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:27.440
 franck the two goals in marseille are 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:31.040
 quite symbolic of what this represents 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.990
 boy is the agility the force the 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.090
 power 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:38.180
 and then the responsibility is him who 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.060
 leave the team a very bad pass 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.360
 by catastrophic catastrophic 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.000
 and all by itself agility with this 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.550
 For this purpose the stubble 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.830
 karate shot what gestures she 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.830
 throws equalizer of zlatan ibrahimovic 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.400
 the power on on the free kick the 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:59.760
 balloon that arrived with such force 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.760
 here 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.120
 motionless 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.930
 it's all this strength that emerges from 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.480
 night 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.110
 balloon he is able to hurt him 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.580
 he is also able to pet him 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.350
 the trajectory it takes when 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.510
 it takes on a ball touch on 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.430
 here he comes to go all to the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.579
 delicacy and rare power at the same 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.579
 time 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.630
 when he arrived free to ask himself 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 how she would behave vis 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.500
 understood first training he put 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.970
 three guys on the carpet who are realizing 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.540
 understood from a grain curvature he took 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.560
 elbow 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.000
 they quickly realized that they were 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.870
 not there to laugh this football was 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.430
 neither 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.870
 the enchanted carousel we have in all 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.360
 clubs and character players what 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.790
 who comes to me three that ronaldo to the real 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.470
 if he has no character 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:55.020
 rooney to manchester van persie or 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.590
 else when teams are not 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.850
 do not go well 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.890
 we tell them where are the players from 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.890
 character and bella for the honor blow 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.280
 this cache not what he assumes what he is 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.410
 that's why he's here that's it and it's a 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.919
 warrior what is a gladiator what 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.919
 that's for sure 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.560
 I think it's an example 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.150
 this is an example here and even if will have 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.250
 always bad languages ​​that are going 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.140
 to say that his character is too strong and 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.940
 sensitive some no no no no I 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.550
 I am delighted for the league and to me it is 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.350
 I am a passionate football cdc 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.310
 kind of players me who me who 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.240
 makes you want to go to the stadium 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.890
 this is despite everything my passion and my 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.420
 football career that I still have 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:39.220
 the eyes that sparkle when I have the 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.370
 chance to see players play like 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.370
 it 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.270
 no 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:55.189
 flamethrower attack there will also be 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.840
 attack file hours 

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:58.840
 after the game is theirs 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:12.230
 I was afraid to see my hair 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:13.550
 ignite and already won the 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.020
 championships so that was my 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.840
 main goal this season 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.310
 then did his best at the 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.030
 individual but it's mostly because 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.130
 the team is good 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.450
 know you can go it alone 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.980
 but finally a trophy is like 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.740
 this last year already 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.000
 it was a trophy for me we are at 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.520
 play the season was not excellent 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.420
 because I 'm going in a few trophies 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.650
 even though I was not the best 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.100
 scorer there would still have been 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:43.280
 someone terrific confirmed of 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:46.900
 trophies the season finally it's not 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:49.190
 really a success so with a trophy 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:52.100
 this kind of trophy this kind of 

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:53.240
 reward there is a bonus but what 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.830
 is important it's really it's the 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.820
 collective play so here it's really a 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:07:01.430
 reward in addition your reaction to 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:07.210
 imminent departure of carlo 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:07.210
 Ancelotti or water 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.229
 I had a great season 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.900
 yes I scored goals like never 

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:27.699
 in my life thanks to him and more so 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.289
 I hope for the future anyway 

00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:30.789
 he will stay in Paris because he is a 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:34.000
 good project a nice team and he is 

00:07:30.789 --> 00:07:37.240
 really perfect fit his sicav 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.930
 it goes away but journalists they go 

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.930
 to talk about what finally 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.419
 everything will depend on the coach no no 

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:51.629
 no I'm kidding 

00:07:49.419 --> 00:07:53.650
 still pleasant two years of contract 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:55.240
 but I am very happy here at 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.650
 Paris is a beautiful curve 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.210
 learning for me I have a lot 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:00.819
 learned to milan if I played in 

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.650
 other numerous clubs but paris for 

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:04.629
 me it was really the challenge of challenge 

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:06.210
 our goal was to win and he 

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:09.750
 is that we just win so 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:09.750
 I hope to be there again 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.580
 it's its president philippe jean 

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.970
 jacques amorfini manu piumi and the team 

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.970
 of channel
