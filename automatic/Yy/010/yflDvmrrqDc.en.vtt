00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.939
 I'm about to start talking in Japan 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.229
 here is decided to make this world in Italian as you can hear 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:31.659
 because it won't be very easy to explain to me what's inside 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:33.770
 that package 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.740
 because already got a box in because john morris parcel there is obviously from 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.900
 japan herbal I pounded through ip but let's not waste any more time and see that 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.900
 what's inside 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.410
 earth test stand to protect the contents 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.020
 photo 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.020
 water 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.450
 ok guys here 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.700
 so what we have is a series of vehicles from the batman universe or better 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.800
 of the batman film universe 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.460
 it is basically two collections while I am part of 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.450
 a promotion of a well-known Japanese drink called bosso sets up the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.120
 copy mail.ru 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.429
 the first collection consisting of 10 vehicles 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.180
 forum style 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.030
 made of plastic and about 4 5 centimeters long 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.440
 these vehicles are motorized dust cars 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.110
 and magnetized 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.810
 there is a magnet underneath 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.110
 then it will show you later what the utility of this magnet is 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.360
 the second collection instead consists of five constraints 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.090
 non-performing and therefore simple scale models 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.209
 about 8 9 cm long 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 and bay castro 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.899
 these models are also motorized 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:18.899
 handcuffed zatti 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:26.319
 each of the vehicles the font has with it this little book in which you can see 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.149
 the entire collection 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.039
 of vehicles 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.219
 and of course instructions on how they work 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.109
 while the others the other vehicles those do not take off this booklet 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.609
 in which 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.919
 bethesda poste also see the entire collection in this case 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.989
 for instructions on how it works I don't know how to make them work 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:59.099
 it was about how to mount some parts as you can see batman's batmobile 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.099
 forever the one of bacco - milano electronic mail 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:05.049
 that you mount 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.389
 and they are made of plastic unlike the vehicle you give fuck to show you 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.829
 quickly 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.200
 up close these models from the casts I think are made really very well 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.229
 so I would like to show you another three hundred and sixty degrees more quickly 

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:21.609
 close 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.829
 let's start with the batmobile of batman batman returns 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.049
 that of batman forever 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:48.159
 that of marcon robin 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.899
 not found 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.899
 by batman begins and dark knight 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:15.069
 anvil 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.069
 the batt. 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.999
 I just have to show you 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:39.139
 how they work so they are paul mccartney you simply have to press 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.479
 pull backwards 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.479
 that they leave 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.709
 the bot founded a slightly different functioning, that is to say an affectionate one 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:55.009
 so you have to get the front wheel up a little 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.310
 perfect the red vault obsession itself magix 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.740
 but we see a real gem of the collection 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.590
 fondue models as not mentioned have a magnet below 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.599
 we take a little can in the evening 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.120
 Always load the vehicle by pulling backwards by pushing and pulling 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.129
 backwards 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.100
 put with agricultural tractors with 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.100
 hymn to the morning and leave you alone 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
 does 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.370
 verycool 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.580
 so to conclude omnio I highly recommend these vehicles if 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.520
 you are at least batman fans in my opinion 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.440
 you don't have to take those the truth I'm those not de fonds if you are of 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.120
 super fans of batman as i think i am 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.319
 you have to take them all if they are absolutely adorable 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.539
 as for the price they cost me $ 64 99 + shipping 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.710
 so let's say price might seem a little high for it's paper I followed 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.779
 several auctions where ms price is limited over 100 dollars 

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:08.829
 I realize that the piece might seem a void but you have to 

00:06:08.829 --> 00:06:12.849
 consider the fact that they are exclusive to the Japanese market ie the market 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.829
 they are a Japanese exclusive so obviously the Japanese have sniffed 

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.259
 the deal 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.069
 also because it is a batman puzzle 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:24.150
 as merchandising it is always very strong especially if we talk about the films of 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:25.680
 batman 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.230
 having said that, I greet you and give you an appointment at the next video
