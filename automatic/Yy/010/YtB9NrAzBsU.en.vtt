00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
of them so it's just kind of um just

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.060 
of them so it's just kind of um just
kind<00:02:51.970> of<00:02:52.000> ash<00:02:52.269> at<00:02:52.570> this<00:02:52.750> point<00:02:52.989> and<00:02:53.860> I'm<00:02:53.980> gonna

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
kind of ash at this point and I'm gonna

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
kind of ash at this point and I'm gonna
go<00:02:54.310> ahead<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.790> broom<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.330> I<00:02:56.310> guess<00:02:57.310> as

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
go ahead with the broom now I guess as

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:18.590 
go ahead with the broom now I guess as
much<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.630> act<00:02:58.870> out<00:02:59.140> as<00:02:59.290> possible

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:25.370 

doesn't<00:03:19.600> have<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.780> be<00:03:20.020> crazy<00:03:20.350> crazy<00:03:20.920> clean<00:03:21.370> but

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.810 

next<00:03:26.380> thing<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.650> do<00:03:26.710> is<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:27.040> go<00:03:27.190> in<00:03:27.370> with<00:03:27.400> a<00:03:27.550> wet

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
next thing I do is I go in with a wet

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.510 
next thing I do is I go in with a wet
rag<00:03:28.090> I<00:03:28.510> don't<00:03:29.500> have<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.740> proper<00:03:30.100> tool<00:03:30.280> for

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
rag I don't have the proper tool for

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.730 
rag I don't have the proper tool for
this<00:03:30.640> just<00:03:30.910> yet<00:03:33.840> right<00:03:34.840> on<00:03:34.990> a<00:03:35.020> swivel

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
this just yet right on a swivel

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.820 
this just yet right on a swivel
I<00:03:35.770> guess<00:03:36.460> anyway<00:03:37.000> deal<00:03:37.540> thinkin<00:03:38.410> they<00:03:38.530> kind<00:03:38.770> of

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
I guess anyway deal thinkin they kind of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:47.540 
I guess anyway deal thinkin they kind of
spin<00:03:39.160> it

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:54.810 

put<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.670> on<00:03:48.790> top<00:03:48.820> of<00:03:49.180> my<00:03:49.330> post<00:03:53.520> this<00:03:54.520> will<00:03:54.700> give

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
put it on top of my post this will give

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.490 
put it on top of my post this will give
me<00:03:54.940> an<00:03:55.030> idea<00:03:55.120> how<00:03:55.480> hot<00:03:55.720> the<00:03:55.870> bricks<00:03:56.110> are<00:03:56.320> too

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
me an idea how hot the bricks are too

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.840 
me an idea how hot the bricks are too
based<00:03:56.770> on<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:56.980> amount<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.280> sizzle<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.760> I

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
based on the amount of sizzle that I

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.020 
based on the amount of sizzle that I
hear<00:03:58.890> kind<00:03:59.890> of<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.040> funny<00:04:00.280> way<00:04:00.459> to<00:04:00.490> measure<00:04:00.820> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
hear kind of a funny way to measure the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.810 
hear kind of a funny way to measure the
temperature<00:04:01.150> but<00:04:02.010> all<00:04:03.010> right<00:04:03.100> phone<00:04:03.400> system

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
temperature but all right phone system

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:09.690 
temperature but all right phone system
out<00:04:03.940> perfect<00:04:04.920> not<00:04:05.920> too<00:04:06.100> overly<00:04:07.830> loud<00:04:08.830> but<00:04:09.490> just

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
out perfect not too overly loud but just

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.470 
out perfect not too overly loud but just
a<00:04:09.820> nice<00:04:09.940> little<00:04:10.180> light<00:04:10.680> sizzle<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:13.060> really

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
a nice little light sizzle it's really

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.069 
a nice little light sizzle it's really
really<00:04:13.750> hot<00:04:14.100> um<00:04:15.239> if<00:04:16.239> it<00:04:16.390> sounds<00:04:16.750> like<00:04:16.900> it's

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
really hot um if it sounds like it's

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.740 
really hot um if it sounds like it's
bursting<00:04:17.410> in<00:04:17.769> there<00:04:17.950> I'll<00:04:18.609> go<00:04:18.760> back<00:04:19.239> with<00:04:19.570> the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
bursting in there I'll go back with the

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.860 
bursting in there I'll go back with the
same<00:04:19.959> rag<00:04:20.260> a<00:04:20.709> handful<00:04:21.519> of<00:04:21.580> times<00:04:21.940> maybe<00:04:22.720> a

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
same rag a handful of times maybe a

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.380 
same rag a handful of times maybe a
little<00:04:23.169> bit<00:04:23.410> wetter<00:04:23.730> this<00:04:24.730> is<00:04:24.880> just<00:04:25.090> wet

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
little bit wetter this is just wet

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.700 
little bit wetter this is just wet
enough<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.750> kind<00:04:25.960> of<00:04:25.990> squeeze<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.320> little<00:04:26.560> bit

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
enough to kind of squeeze a little bit

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.680 
enough to kind of squeeze a little bit
of<00:04:26.890> juice<00:04:27.070> out<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.790> looks<00:04:27.940> really<00:04:28.120> dirty<00:04:28.360> but

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
of juice out it looks really dirty but

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.170 
of juice out it looks really dirty but
let's<00:04:28.810> just<00:04:29.080> ash<00:04:31.320> go<00:04:32.320> over<00:04:32.500> it<00:04:32.560> once<00:04:32.740> or<00:04:32.890> twice

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
let's just ash go over it once or twice

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.490 
let's just ash go over it once or twice
and<00:04:34.180> again<00:04:34.270> it<00:04:34.570> sounds<00:04:34.720> like<00:04:34.960> it's<00:04:35.110> just<00:04:35.320> about

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
and again it sounds like it's just about

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.120 
and again it sounds like it's just about
perfect<00:04:35.979> try<00:04:36.669> to<00:04:36.729> get<00:04:36.970> any<00:04:37.120> remaining<00:04:38.130> coals

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
perfect try to get any remaining coals

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.570 
perfect try to get any remaining coals
and<00:04:39.490> ashes<00:04:40.120> and<00:04:40.270> things<00:04:40.510> out<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.560> there<00:04:41.740> that

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
and ashes and things out of there that

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.610 
and ashes and things out of there that
seems<00:04:42.880> just<00:04:42.970> about<00:04:43.330> right<00:04:43.660> for<00:04:43.840> purposes

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
seems just about right for purposes

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.400 
seems just about right for purposes
today<00:04:46.860> at<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.040> point<00:04:48.310> you're<00:04:48.460> pretty<00:04:48.669> much

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
today at that point you're pretty much

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.070 
today at that point you're pretty much
ready<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.530> load<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.070> dough<00:04:51.310> in<00:04:51.990> what<00:04:52.990> I'm

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
ready to load the dough in what I'm

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.420 
ready to load the dough in what I'm
gonna<00:04:53.200> do<00:04:53.470> right<00:04:53.500> now<00:04:53.680> is<00:04:53.830> just<00:04:53.950> go<00:04:54.190> ahead<00:04:54.250> and

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
gonna do right now is just go ahead and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.469 
gonna do right now is just go ahead and
throw<00:04:54.550> the<00:04:54.669> door<00:04:54.820> back<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.150> because<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.390> think

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
throw the door back on because I think

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.590 
throw the door back on because I think
our<00:04:55.720> dough<00:04:55.900> has<00:04:56.220> another<00:04:57.220> five<00:04:57.850> minutes<00:04:58.120> or<00:04:58.390> so

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
our dough has another five minutes or so

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:06.710 
our dough has another five minutes or so
for<00:04:58.840> rising<00:05:01.620> door<00:05:02.620> that<00:05:02.860> mom

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.360 

trying<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.440> keep<00:05:07.590> all<00:05:07.740> that<00:05:07.770> heat<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.220> there

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
trying to keep all that heat in there

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:16.270 
trying to keep all that heat in there
for<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.640> time<00:05:14.030> and<00:05:15.030> that's<00:05:15.180> pretty<00:05:15.420> much<00:05:15.540> it

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
for the time and that's pretty much it

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.470 
for the time and that's pretty much it
fairly<00:05:17.280> quick<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.610> easy<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:17.970> think<00:05:18.060> that<00:05:18.300> maybe

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
fairly quick and easy I think that maybe

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.520 
fairly quick and easy I think that maybe
took<00:05:18.750> just<00:05:18.990> about<00:05:19.200> five<00:05:19.440> minutes<00:05:19.710> or<00:05:19.950> so<00:05:20.130> and

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
took just about five minutes or so and

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.780 
took just about five minutes or so and
then<00:05:22.530> what<00:05:22.740> I'll<00:05:22.830> do<00:05:22.980> is<00:05:23.130> go<00:05:23.280> ahead<00:05:23.400> and<00:05:23.490> load

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
then what I'll do is go ahead and load

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.270 
then what I'll do is go ahead and load
our<00:05:23.820> dough<00:05:24.180> right<00:05:24.810> onto<00:05:25.080> our<00:05:25.110> peel<00:05:25.410> here<00:05:25.680> and

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
our dough right onto our peel here and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.070 
our dough right onto our peel here and
start<00:05:26.730> sliding<00:05:27.000> them<00:05:27.270> in<00:05:27.420> from<00:05:27.780> the<00:05:27.900> back

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
start sliding them in from the back

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.500 
start sliding them in from the back
first<00:05:28.470> kind<00:05:28.860> of<00:05:28.950> line<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.910> back<00:05:30.090> of<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.360> oven

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
first kind of line the back of the oven

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570 
first kind of line the back of the oven
with<00:05:30.780> dough<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.770> then<00:05:31.860> start<00:05:32.130> filling<00:05:32.280> in

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
with dough and then start filling in

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.890 
with dough and then start filling in
like<00:05:32.910> the<00:05:33.060> sides<00:05:33.300> in<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.660> middle<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:35.900> get

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
like the sides in the middle and get
