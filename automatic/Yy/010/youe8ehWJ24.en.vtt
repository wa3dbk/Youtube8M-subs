00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
hopefully between the two angles you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.510 
hopefully between the two angles you
should<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.449> able<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.630> see<00:00:30.810> exactly<00:00:31.079> one<00:00:31.349> day<00:00:31.560> so

notes<00:00:37.199> a<00:00:38.570> middle<00:00:39.570> C<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.019> F<00:00:40.260> sharp<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> it's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
notes a middle C and F sharp and it's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:55.119 
notes a middle C and F sharp and it's
three<00:00:43.109> whole<00:00:43.350> tones<00:00:43.620> between<00:00:44.429> the<00:00:45.000> two<00:00:45.179> notes

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.369 

and<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.429> can<00:00:56.550> flip<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.910> either<00:00:57.629> way<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.109> you

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379

can stop and it's still I try it's on

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.280 
can stop and it's still I try it's on
