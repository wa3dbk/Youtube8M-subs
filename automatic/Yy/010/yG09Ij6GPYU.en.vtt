00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 all his friends today we find ourselves 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:06.540
 for power agreements at the 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.710
 guitar the anc is what it is so in 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.300
 face every time you see a bar and 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.160
 on the guitar is agreements 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.840
 of power then as you know 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.000
 the guitar is composed of ms. hillary 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.060
 shy ground and between mid and if between mi fa 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.650
 and 6 and water there is a half tone if we 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.869
 knows that rates then advancing 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 each time on the guitar a freight have 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.300
 in fact we take two myths and not 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.399
 torment so not to be a little 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.380
 little joke so let's bet that if I 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.270
 am in half and I want to go in front 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.719
 seeing that it's between mid and end I'm doing a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.000
 half tone so I advance that a freight 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.780
 but if I want to go from faa'a sol he 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.690
 must be a tone so these two freight 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:52.020
 if I make a strawberry here we feel that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.800
 it's actually a zhu fardier one 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.910
 flat I think finally brief so women and 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.039
 ground so your two boxes 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.860
 art is the same as it is a tone 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.170
 going to jump it's not it's not good but 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 your 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:14.119
 there I am it is more chic mi fa 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:16.009
 soil so low it's the same against 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.090
 between 6 and daring and so invite to 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.659
 mayor can get closer 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.890
 it's not a gift but it's a way 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.940
 but mocked totally h techniques and 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.080
 I have never used 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.090
 but hey it does not matter it can 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.729
 always serve that's so now 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.049
 that you know a little what I 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.909
 will tell you not so long ago 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.509
 that you do not know I was doing 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.740
 the guitar is like that and it's my 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.050
 teacher actually he had taught me that puts a 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.009
 a little bit late so I leave u20 ya 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.470
 not so long ago that there is still 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.960
 a little but but here it was a 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.000
 little revelation already for me after 1 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.270
 so you have power agreements 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.229
 who have the particle the peculiarity 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.759
 to have the same how to say the same 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.759
 form in fact we can see that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.470
 applies everywhere for example if I 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.239
 am in a thousand flagship ground there if I 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.920
 want to make a there from this box 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.690
 there with a contribution of power 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.420
 I make my power agreement that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.109
 I will explain in two minutes 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:21.440
 and I find here it's not pretty 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.209
 still 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.930
 and you want to do that everywhere if I 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:32.609
 want to do so if I make a floor 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:36.989
 ground and it works everywhere it's great 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.900
 even a balance us flat 3.6 no but 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.760
 here we can do anything so 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.840
 to do it it's not difficult I 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.569
 you learn directly on the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.420
 first box you put your index 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.849
 at this point your middle finger here so 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.079
 between fourth body too much second 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.079
 sorry box your 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.170
 auricular third third string 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:06.360
 box and ring in second rope 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:08.550
 third box and that's it can 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.380
 use it now everywhere good on 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.000
 can tell me here I agree I 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.930
 to do the same pretty much because 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.070
 since it's a bar it's still 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.090
 quite different not exactly the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:20.550
 same notes but in the end it's when 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.700
 even the same chord and how do I do 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.290
 if I want to do a minor and well 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.640
 simply remove the middle finger on 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.640
 remove the middle finger make a minor 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.530
 magical that still lifted a finger 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.800
 to make you major or minor 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.390
 sails and that applies for all after 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.130
 so we did everything that was on 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.600
 the rope half but we can do too 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.989
 on the rope two there a little good 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.220
 parenthesis if we do an E major it's 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.750
 well this position there 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.030
 well we look that if we want to do 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.240
 a bar and for an E major comes the 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.670
 barrel will miss next half box 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.910
 normally who should be behind 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:07.210
 here and we put our fingers like that at 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.500
 final we find at the same position and 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.650
 are going to make an imager and that's it 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.650
 the same 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:17.139
 and well to make a there there we play 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:22.259
 all these bodies from there all these bodies 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.259
 of the sof the put on the agenda 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.050
 to have a minor 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.010
 well if we make a bar and like everything 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.800
 on time for the here I am entered as 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:38.610
 this and there we can apply anywhere 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:44.910
 wait what I did I actually do 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:46.199
 like that and replace fleeing you 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.610
 understand it's exactly the same 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.479
 diagram for the other but with a 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.280
 different position 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:51.930
 you know it almost already 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.699
 the position is simply 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.900
 put his bar and besides and you do not 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:58.530
 do not play the rope 2000 this is not it 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.270
 it's not magic 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:14.400
 for example I'm in good standing watch the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:16.050
 if I do d I do a major D major and for 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.280
 to make a minor by cons eh well he 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.289
 must do the same position as corot 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.360
 but finally here you have the same 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.889
 half position for the major and 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.130
 you come down from one you are there you 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.440
 have a minor so there actually saw that I 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:32.280
 play on this rope there which is so in 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.260
 the fifth box the yoke a real nice 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.870
 I go back from there I do not play anymore 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:44.900
 dream I play well major is no longer a 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:44.900
 minor but I'm in mid ground at the 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.210
 minor but 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.590
 so here I hope you'll have a 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.000
 little cleared me frankly when I 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.580
 on that but I was really but 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.169
 really bluffed what I see I 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.509
 started a little really to know 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:00.550
 this sick instrument that is 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.560
 yet not easy to tame so 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.680
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.819
 will have a little cleared and stones 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:07.840
 go see a little on the internet for the 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.970
 schema what can not put the 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.259
 ac diagrams that's a shame I you 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:13.259
 say to the next year of things world
