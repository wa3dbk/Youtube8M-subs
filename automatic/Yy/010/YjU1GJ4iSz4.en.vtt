00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.450
 What the hell do you say? 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.640
 half a kilo are all welcome more 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.619
 a video of black ops 2 and in the video of 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.079
 today I will bring back a video here 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.910
 self-help guide series and the theme of 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.550
 Today's video will be about the up time 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.070
 for flu will be really flu 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.599
 improvement in our accuracy of the weapon will be 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.579
 that he does not let our gun shake 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.480
 so much so that it actually becomes more 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.300
 need 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.309
 well let's start by doing 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.070
 this little drive test I chose here 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.230
 gun skhira with you can realize her 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.399
 is without any tactics is nothing and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.620
 will see if this weapon is really 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.719
 flu really works or not the last 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.660
 scar h remembering that it is one that has the 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.399
 worse the cure of all leads all to 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.469
 save the here then we will do a test 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.210
 here will start here on the right with the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.570
 same distance as here in this crisis and 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.570
 come on 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.780
 The first test, it turned up. 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:16.150
 Look, then let's go, let's do one more 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.150
 Test to our rose too damn 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.970
 to go up a little less but finally the three 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.440
 shooting sequences all of them gun 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.990
 It ended up going to hell now let's go 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.950
 do a test with the flu will see 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.800
 if beauty really improves, let's get 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:39.280
 position here and let's go there and start 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:45.640
 do a test only confirming for flu 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 so there the first first wonder 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.350
 attempt has not improved absolutely 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.320
 nothing we go there once again seemingly 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.850
 It's improved a little and come on let's do it 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.800
 one more test, let's go and make one 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.220
 last test just so we really have 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.869
 sure if it works or not 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.330
 Good folks with you could see the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.500
 apparently in some 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.750
 situations 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.850
 it slightly decreased for example the 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.670
 first it did not diminish anything in the others 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.350
 three in the other three attempts 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.060
 the retreat as you could accompany 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.980
 disappears that this crap is over 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.480
 disappearing but you will see a comparative 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.940
 before and after him 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.030
 apparently the indentation decreased somewhat 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.670
 He did not go up so much, but I confess to 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.190
 You guys are the first flu to us. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.220
 test was not very efficient now I'm going 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:45.640
 take another weapon that is the vector to 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.390
 vector is a sum that comes from one of 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.239
 have the best 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.700
 the cure of all one arrives if then 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.430
 Come on, let's take a look at the 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.150
 same point we made of scar scar 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.150
 let's do a test 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.500
 re-up cool 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.850
 we use as a basis that the part 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.770
 central, we're just going to be able to test 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.430
 good shot went up let's do more 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.430
 a test here 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.900
 basically all of them have risen more or 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.730
 less standard of a slightly modified 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.830
 in the shot sometimes a strip more up 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.260
 another takes a bit down but 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.020
 she has a little high recoil now 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.960
 Let's get the same gun, according to 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.660
 to see if it really improves or not 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:39.870
 let's position the same point come 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.820
 let's use it here to decrease 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:48.710
 apparently it decreases a little 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.710
 in second no longer 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:57.420
 The third least thing we'll go back to. 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.420
 here we will see 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.670
 Good folks, how could you? 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.960
 to accompany in my point of view 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.270
 absolutely nothing has changed so much with the 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.680
 rocket as without flu continues to 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.530
 same thing 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.860
 Lastly I'm going to take a liqueur test 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.440
 machine gun that bbl sw that another tear 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.950
 that one of the worst is the cure if 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.530
 all class light machine gun let's get 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.440
 test drive with her 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.550
 and leza takes in the line or pull that 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.550
 line there we go too 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.040
 well she has gone up a little but like you 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.780
 they could see it basically does not spread 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:49.120
 the team takes off the team goes the shot goes well 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:51.370
 aligned the same thing has now given 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.350
 much less resources than the first shot 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.630
 Come on, let's do another test that 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:57.840
 They'll pick up again first, come on. 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.840
 to see 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.410
 well she had more or less a backlash all over 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.360
 is very similar to the three lines of 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.190
 shot we did not do much 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.560
 difference now let's do the same 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.170
 I only tested using flu 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.720
 come on the gun equipped with strong flu 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:26.820
 they will do a test that will see how it is 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:28.740
 it will be her feature is good for 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.630
 Mind people continue the same thing. 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:35.570
 seems to have even worsened since she 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.570
 climb a little more in the sights than before 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.140
 apparently is at the same pace yet 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.180
 good staff you could accompany the 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.280
 We did test with three such weapons. 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.590
 fans is a reasonable distance from you 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.210
 make a confrontation with the opponent if the 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.040
 People do a test of more more 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.080
 next probably the resource will 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.480
 be smaller if we make a test more 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.820
 far away, the recoil of the gun is going 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.340
 be a little bigger than we did 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.110
 this our test here what we can 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.780
 take the flu forum if 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:18.370
 really worth it or I do not confess 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.310
 for you that is not worth since 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.260
 with the flu or without flu or the indentation 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.750
 pretty much the same sometimes you have 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.670
 a slightly larger assessment that is 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.460
 more likely but up something 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.590
 but this is a game of the scheme itself 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:35.080
 game does not have a rhythm of shot if it goes 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.750
 go up more or not so it was not flu 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:41.440
 It is for us reduce the decline of 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:44.170
 Our weapon then stays there is the tip is a 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:46.270
 tactic is basically say so 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.670
 no use since he does not do the function 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:52.000
 of it correctly and detail that I 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:54.070
 I used here an assault aifu that the 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.690
 scale that has a curve too 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.730
 bad maybe with another weapon maybe 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.640
 better or not, we also made a 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.650
 test with the vector which is a sum arrives 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:04.840
 that has the best curve if not 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:07.600
 solved nothing and we did a test with 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.520
 this machine gun art that also has the 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.950
 worse the colors of the light machine gun class 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.380
 and did not solve anything then we can 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:18.070
 to conclude that influenza is not 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.630
 practically nothing at black ops 22 h 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.640
 I hope you have enjoyed video 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.730
 thank you very much for the company and the people 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.000
 see you in the next video bye to you 

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.000
 went
