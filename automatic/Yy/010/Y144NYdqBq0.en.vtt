00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.509
 I'm really going to pay tribute and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 montpellier because it's the first 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.870
 hive not club here I think we are 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.760
 proud is happy we went to room 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 with the structure code it amuses me and 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.010
 have fun gastier but it's a beautiful 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.800
 team and I'm not fooled into that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 enjoy tonight the fact that 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 rugby anomalies that's because they 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.819
 be disabled it has benefited us well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.739
 that the tri nations be played in this 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.569
 moment what weariness is a victory 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:30.960
 which pleasant we will not make the 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:32.850
 refuse 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.260
 but we will not pretend to say 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.090
 we would have made the same score 6 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.590
 montpellier was full 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.090
 here we played Montpellier like when 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.650
 I hear that we play toulouse during the 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.970
 six nations tournament 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.720
 because he's going to stop the lead 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.280
 first team who want to beat us 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.480
 it will be case it will be toulouse will be well 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.310
 fast and we do not want to do 26 matches six 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.420
 victories six have made 26 matches 26 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.690
 victories i have not everything i'm going to paris 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.320
 on foot or running if you want a 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.140
 impossible bet and is dressed in like 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.460
 we call it playboy girls 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.130
 I do not have to do it if we do 26 mad men 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.559
 see you so I'm right here I bet 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.500
 that's what I take more dull I am 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.159
 sure of me here but today we 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 collect points 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.490
 here we had a fist 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 in five games I think we have a real 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.890
 leader then we have four matches to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 outside and we'll forget about it and a 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.579
 home alone at English goalkeeper goal 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.009
 we must have more than 1000 on 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.210
 other bulthÃ© does not mean that we do not 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.710
 will lose no match to mayol ya a 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.030
 leaf season 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.650
 she gets ready during 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
 several months and there is one thing that gets 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.710
 preparing in may is called star wars the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.080
 Star Wars there are six that 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.640
 are elected and at that moment they strike 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.409
 our jada it's on the lawn it will be 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.940
 already the first goal if they can 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.950
 avoid a battle and have only the 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.720
 battle of two finals to compete this 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.500
 will be great but for the moment we are doing 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:47.080
 just so to have 23 jedi in 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.440
 group 2 leaving for the war of 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.409
 shoulders that will take place in May we hoped 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.899
 best of this match we did not take by the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.369
 good end even if we talk about time otherwise 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.360
 who we create opportunities have 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.399
 too strong for their line 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.100
 we had not scored one attempt 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.530
 is five meters closer to the test have 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.229
 unfortunately done 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.149
 drop the ball and what marks a 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.770
 test against and who make the break at 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.630
 half time it penalizes us that we 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.480
 was very expensive it's 0 at half time 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 it's difficult mentally 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.819
 to come back but the team is close to 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.540
 give up and go from the front 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.500
 and in the end, of course, there was the space 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.390
 of a moment it is in eight years that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.790
 was going to do the unthinkable come back to 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.379
 score and unfortunately again 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.480
 we take it on an error 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.280
 individual or a tackle and employs 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.280
 directly against a team of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.819
 classes there that we do not forgive but I 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.819
 am shared between 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.660
 against some satisfaction on 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.670
 the commitment and the sound anyway 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.320
 set up and the fighting spirit that we have 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.180
 done tonight and disappointment because 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.180
 there we make the task even harder 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.330
 keep pushing 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.160
 it's the fifth wheel but that's it 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.160
 all these positive things 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.160
 and 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.910
 it's okay 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.250
 the positive things to do his show of 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.480
 it's not all black tonight 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.740
 to lie down with t 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.860
 it would be interesting 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.860
 not 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.670
 we will arrive Monday with a little head 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.670
 sad mine be 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.730
 yes it's really the shared feeling 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.930
 since it is true that we have returned to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.050
 halftime 16-0 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.850
 and I think that we were made a 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.330
 big job we have a big under their 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.160
 second business being one is happy 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:45.750
 because we have learned the happiness of being 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.100
 here and it's true we have to take 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.830
 all positive sides in a second 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.060
 time 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.620
 dynamic for the next match there are 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.300
 little things of mistakes 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.200
 individual but we will show must 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.940
 to stay together 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.070
 but you look like me for 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.130
 it's the fifth day of cazaux 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.880
 respectful so 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.400
 with all that is possible 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.730
 the staff in two essays 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.069
 it's not bad yeah it's thanks to them 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.109
 France's decision to public a 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.579
 mamba enclosure 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.989
 it's a day without a fix 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.989
 so that marc reiser the same 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.350
 c 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:32.020
 difficult difficult me that three tries 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.700
 we call all the time French half time 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.700
 why this port at the foot 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:46.499
 it's a 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.300
 I want to say young team in super 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:49.680
 macho it's beautiful 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.110
 and finally this commission 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.880
 little in place who is able to do 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.240
 the round back and counter on 100 m on 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.990
 the six behind 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.990
 I do not know if it's a machine 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.660
 No, because you're going by the magistrate 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.530
 was actually good games but lost 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.530
 wendel training
