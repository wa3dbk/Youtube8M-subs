gonna be showing you guys a circuit that

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.110 
gonna be showing you guys a circuit that
I<00:00:04.710> just<00:00:04.950> built<00:00:05.190> sorry<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.580> haven't<00:00:05.759> been<00:00:05.879> on

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
I just built sorry I haven't been on

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.750 
I just built sorry I haven't been on
YouTube<00:00:06.600> lately<00:00:07.589> I've<00:00:07.859> had<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> lot<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.400> stuff

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
YouTube lately I've had a lot of stuff

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.850 
YouTube lately I've had a lot of stuff
to<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.030> busy<00:00:09.809> with<00:00:09.900> school<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.290> all<00:00:10.380> that<00:00:10.590> but

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
to do busy with school and all that but

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.879 
to do busy with school and all that but
uh<00:00:10.889> come<00:00:11.820> back<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.240> guys<00:00:12.530> built<00:00:13.530> a<00:00:13.679> cool

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
uh come back to you guys built a cool

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.760 
uh come back to you guys built a cool
little<00:00:14.009> circuit<00:00:14.460> right<00:00:14.580> here<00:00:15.560> it's<00:00:16.560> actually

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
little circuit right here it's actually

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.580 
little circuit right here it's actually
a<00:00:17.070> microphone<00:00:17.970> circuit<00:00:18.810> right<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.199> we<00:00:19.500> have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
a microphone circuit right here we have

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.130 
a microphone circuit right here we have
a<00:00:19.619> microphone<00:00:19.980> amplifier<00:00:20.220> right<00:00:20.699> here<00:00:21.140> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
a microphone amplifier right here you

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.679 
a microphone amplifier right here you
know<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> microphone<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.369> using<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.789> lm386

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
know a microphone and I'm using a lm386

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.359 
know a microphone and I'm using a lm386
I<00:00:25.350> actually<00:00:25.470> got<00:00:26.010> this<00:00:26.189> off<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.939> fro<00:00:27.689> tech<00:00:27.930> mods

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
I actually got this off a fro tech mods

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.650 
I actually got this off a fro tech mods
tutorials<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.580> things<00:00:29.789> slopped<00:00:30.029> after<00:00:30.330> Tec

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
tutorials so things slopped after Tec

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.569 
tutorials so things slopped after Tec
Mota<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.439> just<00:00:31.619> modified<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.399> bit

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
Mota and I just modified it a little bit

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.389 
Mota and I just modified it a little bit
to<00:00:32.700> suit<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.030> needs<00:00:33.140> but<00:00:34.140> um<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.890> essentially

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
to suit my needs but um it's essentially

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.910 
to suit my needs but um it's essentially
the<00:00:35.520> same<00:00:35.550> exact<00:00:36.059> things<00:00:36.329> different<00:00:37.260> ICS<00:00:37.680> and

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the same exact things different ICS and

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.799 
the same exact things different ICS and
stuff<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.399> uh<00:00:38.430> yeah<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:39.780> have

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
stuff but uh yeah so right here we have

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.049 
stuff but uh yeah so right here we have
a<00:00:40.100> or<00:00:41.100> well<00:00:41.219> actually<00:00:41.370> I'll<00:00:41.640> tell<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> guys

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
a or well actually I'll tell you guys

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.520 
a or well actually I'll tell you guys
what<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.570> it's<00:00:42.870> um<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:44.070> uh<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:45.350> don't<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
what it is it's um it's uh I don't know

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.190 
what it is it's um it's uh I don't know
it's<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.770> microphone<00:00:47.460> amplifier<00:00:47.670> circuit<00:00:48.539> with

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's a microphone amplifier circuit with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.020 
it's a microphone amplifier circuit with
an<00:00:49.320> op-amp<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.070> with<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.340> comparator

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
an op-amp and then with a comparator

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.500 
an op-amp and then with a comparator
circuit<00:00:51.260> another<00:00:52.260> op<00:00:52.440> amp<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> yeah<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> fro

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
circuit another op amp so yeah a fro

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.490 
circuit another op amp so yeah a fro
tech<00:00:54.719> mod<00:00:54.899> he<00:00:55.170> used<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.770> was<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.100> LM<00:00:56.430> 324

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
tech mod he used I think was that LM 324

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.330 
tech mod he used I think was that LM 324
a<00:00:58.500> quad<00:00:59.280> comparator<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.180> I<00:01:00.210> just<00:01:00.510> use<00:01:00.750> 2<00:01:01.340> LM

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
a quad comparator but I just use 2 LM

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.740 
a quad comparator but I just use 2 LM
through<00:01:02.609> 20<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.619> 386<00:01:04.700> op<00:01:05.700> amps<00:01:06.119> so<00:01:06.180> basically

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
through 20 or 386 op amps so basically

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.090 
through 20 or 386 op amps so basically
all<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> does<00:01:08.090> I'll<00:01:09.090> flip<00:01:09.810> it<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.979> can

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
all it does I'll flip it on so you can

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.670 
all it does I'll flip it on so you can
see<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.430> LEDs<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.060> right<00:01:12.210> now<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.080> kind

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
see the LEDs on right now and it's kind

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.660 
see the LEDs on right now and it's kind
of<00:01:14.330> it's<00:01:15.330> lighting<00:01:15.689> up<00:01:15.840> when<00:01:16.110> I'm<00:01:16.860> talking<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
of it's lighting up when I'm talking and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.410 
of it's lighting up when I'm talking and
so<00:01:18.150> basically<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.430> -<00:01:20.430> voltage<00:01:20.880> set<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
so basically I have the - voltage set to

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.510 
so basically I have the - voltage set to
on<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> comparator<00:01:22.200> set<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.710> 2.5<00:01:23.250> 4

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
on the comparator set to about 2.5 4

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.370 
on the comparator set to about 2.5 4
volts<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> our<00:01:25.890> four<00:01:26.729> five<00:01:27.000> volts<00:01:27.330> sorry<00:01:27.570> so

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
volts so our four five volts sorry so

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
volts so our four five volts sorry so
any<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:29.159> voltage<00:01:29.430> that's<00:01:29.880> higher<00:01:30.060> than<00:01:30.090> that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
any any voltage that's higher than that

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.300 
any any voltage that's higher than that
the<00:01:30.780> LEDs<00:01:31.170> gonna<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> don't<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.159> know

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
the LEDs gonna go on I don't really know

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.380 
the LEDs gonna go on I don't really know
why<00:01:32.579> there's<00:01:33.560> why<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.920> uh<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.790> kind

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
why there's why there's a uh it's kind

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840 
why there's why there's a uh it's kind
of<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.630> right<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> gets<00:01:38.189> brighter<00:01:38.460> so

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
of on right now but it gets brighter so

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
of on right now but it gets brighter so
that's<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> only<00:01:39.210> thing<00:01:39.329> that<00:01:39.810> counts<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that's the only thing that counts so

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.600 
that's the only thing that counts so
I'll<00:01:41.040> just<00:01:41.250> test<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.790> here's<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.090> clap<00:01:42.299> and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.039 

works<00:01:47.610> pretty<00:01:47.880> well<00:01:48.000> with<00:01:48.240> music<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:48.840> I'll

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
works pretty well with music but I'll

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.889 
works pretty well with music but I'll
throw<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> clip<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.770> there<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.159> guys

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
throw in a clip in there for you guys

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.630 
throw in a clip in there for you guys
except<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.140> tried<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.770> with<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> radio

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
except I tried it with a radio

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.789 
except I tried it with a radio
I<00:01:53.670> haven't<00:01:54.149> plugged<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.020> ipod<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.409> kind<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
I haven't plugged in my ipod I kind of

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.050 
I haven't plugged in my ipod I kind of
want<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.520> see<00:01:56.700> what<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:56.969> like

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
want to do that just see what it's like

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.410 
want to do that just see what it's like
the<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.540> bass<00:01:58.079> detector<00:01:58.680> so<00:01:59.549> um<00:01:59.790> yeah

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
the little bass detector so um yeah

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
the little bass detector so um yeah
that's<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.049> was<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> pretty<00:02:01.619> easy<00:02:01.680> circuit

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
that's it it was a pretty easy circuit

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.889 
that's it it was a pretty easy circuit
to<00:02:02.490> build<00:02:02.960> it<00:02:03.960> was<00:02:04.229> pretty<00:02:04.500> cool<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> get<00:02:05.040> the

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
to build it was pretty cool to get the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.369 
to build it was pretty cool to get the
microphone<00:02:06.979> finally<00:02:07.979> hooked<00:02:08.220> up<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:09.360> yeah<00:02:09.899> so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
microphone finally hooked up but yeah so

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.120 
microphone finally hooked up but yeah so
um<00:02:10.679> yeah<00:02:11.280> that's<00:02:11.430> about<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.940> also<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.390> a

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
um yeah that's about it I also have a

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.470 
um yeah that's about it I also have a
potentiometer<00:02:13.970> right<00:02:14.150> here<00:02:15.340> yeah<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.760> think

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
potentiometer right here yeah I think

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.460 
potentiometer right here yeah I think
it's<00:02:17.690> like<00:02:17.750> a<00:02:17.900> 5<00:02:18.440> ohm<00:02:18.710> or<00:02:19.330> 500<00:02:20.330> kampot<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.290> then

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it's like a 5 ohm or 500 kampot and then

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:32.280 
it's like a 5 ohm or 500 kampot and then
uh<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:22.880> can<00:02:23.120> tune<00:02:23.390> it<00:02:23.570> ooh<00:02:28.090> hold<00:02:29.090> on

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.800 

test<00:02:33.290> test<00:02:33.760> yes<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:34.910> that's<00:02:35.030> about<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.330> best

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
test test yes so that's about the best

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.690 
test test yes so that's about the best
voltage<00:02:36.320> that's<00:02:36.920> actually<00:02:37.250> really<00:02:37.370> good

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
voltage that's actually really good

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.830 
voltage that's actually really good
but<00:02:38.120> uh<00:02:38.350> yes<00:02:39.350> so<00:02:39.650> um<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.220> then<00:02:40.910> I<00:02:41.030> also<00:02:41.300> thrown

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
but uh yes so um and then I also thrown

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.580 
but uh yes so um and then I also thrown
a<00:02:41.870> clip<00:02:42.170> for<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.410> guys<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.950> my<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:44.600> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
a clip for you guys of my of the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.190 
a clip for you guys of my of the
microphone<00:02:46.430> actually<00:02:47.120> working<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:48.050> can

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
microphone actually working you can

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.170 
microphone actually working you can
actually<00:02:48.470> hear<00:02:48.620> the<00:02:48.650> amplified<00:02:49.580> signal<00:02:49.790> and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
actually hear the amplified signal and

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.480 
actually hear the amplified signal and
everything<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.630> modulated<00:02:51.080> signal<00:02:51.490> plug

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
everything the modulated signal plug

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.310 
everything the modulated signal plug
down<00:02:52.610> on<00:02:52.760> my<00:02:52.850> computer<00:02:53.240> sounded<00:02:53.780> pretty<00:02:53.870> good

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
down on my computer sounded pretty good

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.470 
down on my computer sounded pretty good
actually<00:02:55.130> pretty<00:02:55.400> high<00:02:55.550> quality<00:02:55.610> for<00:02:56.210> just<00:02:56.390> a

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
actually pretty high quality for just a

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.300 
actually pretty high quality for just a
cheapo<00:02:56.930> microphone<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:57.830> I<00:02:57.890> pulled<00:02:58.100> out<00:02:58.190> or

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
cheapo microphone that I pulled out or

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.280 
cheapo microphone that I pulled out or
no<00:02:58.430> old<00:02:58.670> phone<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> uh<00:02:59.270> you<00:02:59.660> know<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.960> couple
