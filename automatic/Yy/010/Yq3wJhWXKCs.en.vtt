00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 the base is still completely destroyed 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.690
 have been attacked seven 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.510
 medals lost but support is 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:12.110
 of course directly into the empire and do 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.549
 first the ram full collector 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.809
 harvest and what have we got now 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.150
 the spaceship I've got it in 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.539
 last video already announced and one 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.460
 can here as orders a spaceship 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.060
 we have the option right now 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.310
 I know more de next 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.840
 Training a two hunter quickly 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.399
 overwhelm big numbers of the opponents 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.270
 you should aim for individual users 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.969
 high damage 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.649
 and as you can on as usual just 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.410
 what are you typing then accordingly 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.760
 be formed 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.309
 otherwise we can do the same 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 request troops here 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.489
 and here we have among our stops 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 only everything full of the hero's command 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.149
 and then you just have it new 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.199
 spaceship commando have my best 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.550
 have rebuilt a little bit the 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.289
 have cleansed walls with here all 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.430
 also right back in the added on level 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.840
 3 brought it inside here too 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.090
 have something restructured here as the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.650
 new defense, units of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.299
 Show is protected and the same time up 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.270
 level 2 can take 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.700
 and then we have one more 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.670
 second rockets get protected 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.070
 that you know already according to 42 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.500
 synonymous equal to level 2 and then bring 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.970
 I would say we can too 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.680
 directly into the battle what 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.939
 do we have everything with us now? 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 up here once and I do not know 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.860
 to what extent we can show off here 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.079
 to run a replay 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.060
 here you have attacked cool I am 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.600
 completely flattened with beard 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.390
 tank so before time because my know what 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.259
 the exact name but there 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.140
 Unfortunately, I'm not like that 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.790
 Connection error is not bad either 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.070
 ammerbuch booked one tries it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 directly to a new one if it works 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.829
 not so here and there you say that 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.479
 the game is going to be real 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.130
 I regularly say with updates 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.520
 supplied but here and there you notice 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.890
 that it does not work so well 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.810
 Until that's what I say to the gameplay 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.060
 what the round of the clash of 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 plants it arrives then I think 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.640
 It still definitely take to 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.260
 example of the attack seems easy 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.910
 not available 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.580
 that means I can unfortunately give you that 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.230
 do not show but in exchange throw 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.280
 We then go directly to the battle 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.020
 and look that in chapter 7 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.190
 keep going 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.960
 we have forgotten secrets here 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.780
 Attack 10 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.610
 look something better here 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.470
 expected and we have it again 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.240
 At the same time we still have a rebel 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.260
 outpost of the desert from waiting 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.120
 your mission 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.530
 All right then I would say grab 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.440
 We have a lot down here 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.760
 what supports us, we sit down 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.190
 here similar or equal you will find out 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.290
 to lure a unity and the theme 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.120
 right there is a lot going on 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.370
 defenders are still putting here 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.410
 Let's go and here comes a lot of evil 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.730
 Fussfolk and that came from I think 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.040
 really finally managed to dress up 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
 Try them all somewhere 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.150
 beckons and then the me could 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:02.280
 endure air raid 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.200
 Here we really the problem 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.990
 to have 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.550
 okay, they move here a few times 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.920
 have a look it was already one 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.420
 Couple turning off the tristan machine 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.350
 Just put it in here and put it 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.610
 everything we have 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:19.380
 there is nothing and here the one in 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.780
 I still have an air attack on 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.370
 the balloons in here and leave the 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.100
 the nice units off that has 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.420
 already works great and 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.519
 now the opponents are here too 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.860
 focused on our big bad 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.090
 something and we all have that 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.920
 turned off and it should be the time 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.200
 even for 50 percent at least rich 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.430
 on the complete destruction reaches 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.750
 you have to look, we have one more 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.640
 minute so i have mentioned many times 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.500
 that at star wars is generally currently 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.660
 aspect really plays a big role 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.550
 So the magic clash of trance first 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.860
 Very rarely happens in the end times that 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.390
 you just manage to do the whole thing 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.300
 So the really time problem has because 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.950
 star wars it really is not him 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.540
 the troops are all but that the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.120
 time is often insufficient and I am 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:06.239
 curious to what extent is here at the end 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.180
 priest or not so it looks 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.439
 I think should work but also 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.090
 relatively short so we have 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:18.400
 30 seconds left I think in the end 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.690
 so get somewhere 25 out of 27 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.669
 hit the troops 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.530
 tell me that you have a lot of data 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.210
 could the basis of that could 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.479
 break through on the wg have waited 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.919
 hopes times the rebels outpost 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.110
 we have pulverized so with it 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.610
 very little resources but that is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.199
 not here either and six chapters 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.580
 but rather such a long-term motivation 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.830
 anmal what next us 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.150
 expects a defense very nice 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.250
 then we can also look directly 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.560
 okay, of course, you're two 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.910
 things from what suboptimales we also 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 much more to defend here now 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.150
 what we can use ten from here 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.600
 above is the same attack with 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.280
 a healing ruin is behind it and there come 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.570
 now all the storm squads and we 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.539
 shoot here equal to even a 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:04.030
 it comes Tui because unfortunately out there and 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:05.680
 make time here again and full 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.380
 on this truiden the hamburg 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.370
 turned off excellently and the 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:14.169
 come also just use here 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.520
 and this one too, and then we'll look 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.720
 how far can it get through in the end? 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.889
 For example, I think that's it 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.020
 So there is again a 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.960
 attack wave you have one 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.370
 Protective shield destroys but rather 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.750
 he does not seem to go is yet 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.970
 think very well here but off 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.380
 and that was really easy commander the 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.639
 task has with the decryption their 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.580
 I have to admit that I am 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.460
 impressed by their achievements 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.470
 subsector command end excellent 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.940
 they are only 16 percent 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.610
 caught so we get here three 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:48.849
 stars as a reward see what here 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.280
 was attacked below and now 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.840
 I guess it will be very difficult as 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.720
 attack again next 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.639
 30 of 42 9 build in for a long time 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.190
 research laboratory with at least level 2 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:01.570
 delicious commander due to her 

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.800
 recent successes which they depend 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.479
 but to their units 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.979
 improve and research building if it 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.220
 afterward clouded up further 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.360
 can 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.069
 the improvement units none 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.699
 difference between victory and cheers and 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:17.259
 defeat and damage mean shame 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:19.000
 but also managed that has me already 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.050
 quite a long time now I think coming 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.650
 probably never attack 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.840
 build up 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.550
 helen come two we already have 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.680
 long so that we have good campaign ahead 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.970
 spouse now where this behave 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.410
 we should not have come 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.500
 maybe better in the long term more 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:34.240
 to have heroes available and it 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.620
 is already checked which 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.880
 understand imperial data correctly 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.440
 We can do that by improving the 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.080
 income several help at the same time 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.160
 mobilize so it is the enlightener has 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.449
 the decryption of your data 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.250
 finished I think we have obi 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.349
 wan kenobi hiding on kathrin 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.710
 made up make up 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:52.680
 for immediate use already too 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.389
 We have completed this mission 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.099
 Look how it goes now 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.440
 again an attack that means that in 

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.509
 This is also the perfect one 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.970
 time that we say the one 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.949
 take a look at what we'll do next time 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:06.940
 attack 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.430
 we can now our little one here 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:12.940
 update then get a new troop was 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:15.639
 it is currently not quite enough gold or 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.199
 hot not gold but credits but 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:18.460
 we wanted to go out again like me 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.750
 selected so far I am now 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.409
 really come to you 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:28.990
 8 of our tanks then I always have 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:30.159
 4 of those and eight of those and now 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.909
 I probably also have the option 

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:37.030
 mean, I say so nice my 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:39.009
 units transport 65,000 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:40.330
 then I get more space we have 

00:07:39.009 --> 00:07:42.250
 not right now but when I'm on everyone 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.750
 I can see that until the sixth 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:45.729
 The result is also a new factory 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:48.340
 we have built in the last follow 

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:49.330
 and say today was in the chapter really 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:52.210
 very successful, of course I hope 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:54.009
 I liked friends of the rating 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.449

00:07:54.009 --> 00:07:57.870
