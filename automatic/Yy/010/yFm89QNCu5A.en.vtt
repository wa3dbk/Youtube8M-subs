00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
about 27 and I definitely couldn't do it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
about 27 and I definitely couldn't do it
with<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> sniper<00:01:35.729> rifle<00:01:35.909> even<00:01:36.360> though<00:01:36.450> sniper

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
with a sniper rifle even though sniper

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.870 
with a sniper rifle even though sniper
rifles<00:01:37.020> one<00:01:37.170> shot<00:01:37.380> kill<00:01:37.590> doesn't<00:01:38.159> matter<00:01:38.369> bolt

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
rifles one shot kill doesn't matter bolt

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.700 
rifles one shot kill doesn't matter bolt
action<00:01:39.240> would<00:01:39.390> just<00:01:39.540> kill<00:01:39.900> me<00:01:40.020> every<00:01:40.140> time<00:01:40.409> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
action would just kill me every time and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.100 
action would just kill me every time and
I'm<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.220> awful<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.759> snipers<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.390> ah<00:01:42.570> yeah

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
I'm just awful with snipers so ah yeah

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.450 
I'm just awful with snipers so ah yeah
but<00:01:43.470> today<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.040> thought<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.280> would<00:01:44.340> be

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
but today I thought it would be

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
but today I thought it would be
appropriate<00:01:44.520> enough<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> talk<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.659> these

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
appropriate enough to talk about these

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.899 
appropriate enough to talk about these
snipers<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.409> advanced<00:01:46.979> warfare<00:01:47.369> give<00:01:47.610> my<00:01:47.759> own

in<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.369> game<00:01:56.549> honestly<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.240> don't<00:01:57.390> find<00:01:58.079> them

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
in this game honestly I don't find them

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
in this game honestly I don't find them
as<00:01:58.409> annoying<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.399> did<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.759> past<00:01:59.909> call<00:02:00.240> of

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
as annoying as I did in past call of

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
as annoying as I did in past call of
duties<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.780> my<00:02:00.930> reason<00:02:01.350> behind<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.860> is<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
duties and my reason behind that is the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
duties and my reason behind that is the
fact<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.119> EXO<00:02:03.450> abilities<00:02:03.479> kind<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.619> gets

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
fact that the EXO abilities kind of gets

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.990 
fact that the EXO abilities kind of gets
you<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> a<00:02:05.159> lot<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.340> situations<00:02:05.520> where

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you out of a lot of situations where

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.730 
you out of a lot of situations where
snipers<00:02:06.360> would<00:02:06.509> normally<00:02:06.899> kill<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.439> think

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
snipers would normally kill you I think

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
snipers would normally kill you I think
that<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.429> EXO<00:02:08.700> abilities<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
that because of the EXO abilities it is

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.910 
that because of the EXO abilities it is
harder<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:09.869> snipers<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> hit<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.830> because

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
harder for snipers to hit you because

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.380 
harder for snipers to hit you because
you're<00:02:11.099> kind<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.280> flying<00:02:11.580> all<00:02:11.849> around<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.330> all

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you're kind of flying all around and all

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.729 
you're kind of flying all around and all
that<00:02:12.510> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> crazy<00:02:12.870> stuff<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.560> didn't

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
that kind of crazy stuff that we didn't

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.500 
that kind of crazy stuff that we didn't
see<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:13.920> past<00:02:14.340> call<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> duty's<00:02:14.970> now<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.330> black

ops 2 I did find a snipe being very very

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.070 
ops 2 I did find a snipe being very very
annoying<00:02:18.030> i<00:02:18.090> would<00:02:18.239> get<00:02:18.330> killed<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.750> lot<00:02:18.959> by

snipers and it was just really

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100 
snipers and it was just really
frustrating<00:02:20.760> but<00:02:20.849> so<00:02:21.090> far<00:02:21.420> in<00:02:21.720> advanced
