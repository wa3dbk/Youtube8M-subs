00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.790
 the next step is to transform the single 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:11.910
 father-in-law of cocoa and chocolate with us 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.210
 will put it on a machine like that 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.750
 this machine will grind and mother 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 this grain until it will stay in that 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.550
 texture the roses that is called mass of 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:30.779
 cocoa cocoa or chocolate 100% 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.480
 and then when he gets harder 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:37.380
 he's going to have this face is this one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.340
 100% chocolate in here only has cocoa 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.340
 Ana, it's for you. 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.460
 My father says only that the brand divides up 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.350
 Chocolate Cabral show now I'm 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.840
 here in the cocoa mass 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.850
 We're not going to see what happens here now. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:02.480
 this bitter as hell also in 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:05.550
 Most arrive happened with very good ones 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.070
 I do not talk about waiting, it's good that there 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:13.020
 I was upset business until I worked there 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.000
 the more so far our why it will be that 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.399
 It happens in chocolate 100% case of kaka 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.340
 clean air environment is good without adding 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.990
 sugar changed has changed but always has 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.670
 those who like to play a little bit 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.160
 more in latin america 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.810
 this is a cocoa even those 100% already 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.780
 started to the center 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.200
 if you want to do a sport more 12 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.479
 Just add sugar if you can. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.600
 example add 20% sugar 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.509
 Do you have a chocolate with 86 talks? 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.399
 80 percent chocolate means you have 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.580
 people can already sugar 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.700
 if you add 30% of sugar and 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.030
 put 30% 300 grams you have one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.990
 70% cocoa chocolate and select 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.060
 50 Sergio Silva is 50% chocolate and ipod 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.099
 add our new trancoso imagine 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.770
 It's really cool for us, we have to pay 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.140
 attention on the labels you will buy 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.170
 sometimes we read that a certain 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.480
 chocolate has a lot of cocoa but never knows 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.880
 that it actually has a lot of butter 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.950
 cacao or so it seems that we are 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.440
 eating something healthier 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.069
 but actually eating too much butter 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 cocoa butter and cocoa fat and 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.430
 I dropped the fat removed from the table I understood 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.430
 difference
