that<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> bench<00:01:45.180> press<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.229> most

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that the bench press is the most

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.550 
that the bench press is the most
relative<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.610> body<00:01:47.820> weight<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
relative to your body weight and is the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.490 
relative to your body weight and is the
most<00:01:49.799> affected<00:01:50.399> by<00:01:50.430> your<00:01:50.700> caloric<00:01:51.060> intake

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
most affected by your caloric intake

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.850 
most affected by your caloric intake
meaning<00:01:52.500> many<00:01:52.979> many<00:01:53.250> guys<00:01:53.549> tend<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> gain

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
meaning many many guys tend to gain

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.530 
meaning many many guys tend to gain
strength<00:01:55.860> faster<00:01:56.610> on<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> bench<00:01:57.090> press<00:01:57.270> when

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
strength faster on a bench press when

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.850 
strength faster on a bench press when
they're<00:01:57.659> bulking<00:01:58.020> than<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.290> will<00:01:58.500> on<00:01:58.680> say

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
they're bulking than they will on say

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.649 
they're bulking than they will on say
their<00:01:59.070> squat<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.520> deadlift<00:02:00.000> or<00:02:00.119> proportion

their squat or deadlift or proportion

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.929 
their squat or deadlift or proportion
and<00:02:00.810> some<00:02:01.710> people<00:02:02.009> when<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:02.520> go<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.909> a

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
and some people when they go at a

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
and some people when they go at a
caloric<00:02:03.329> deficit<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:03.930> lose<00:02:04.110> benchpress

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
caloric deficit will lose benchpress

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.630 
caloric deficit will lose benchpress
strength<00:02:04.890> that's<00:02:05.070> something<00:02:05.340> like<00:02:05.460> their

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
strength that's something like their

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.459 
strength that's something like their
deadlift<00:02:06.030> shamefull<00:02:06.360> go<00:02:06.479> up<00:02:06.570> they'll<00:02:06.930> add<00:02:07.140> 10

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
deadlift shamefull go up they'll add 10

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.210 
deadlift shamefull go up they'll add 10
pounds<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.890> their<00:02:08.039> deadlift<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> cut

pounds of their deadlift on a cut

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.490 
pounds of their deadlift on a cut
but<00:02:09.490> they<00:02:09.640> lose<00:02:09.880> 15<00:02:10.360> pounds<00:02:10.390> or<00:02:10.869> 20<00:02:11.110> pounds<00:02:11.410> off

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
but they lose 15 pounds or 20 pounds off

but they lose 15 pounds or 20 pounds off
the<00:02:11.650> bench<00:02:11.860> press<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.790> just<00:02:13.060> seems<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.420> very

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the bench press it just seems to very

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.680 
the bench press it just seems to very
very<00:02:13.720> very<00:02:14.680> subject<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.580> changes<00:02:16.120> in<00:02:16.330> body

weight<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.490> calorie<00:02:18.490> intake<00:02:18.700> so<00:02:19.090> yeah<00:02:19.330> if

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
weight and calorie intake so yeah if

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.540 
weight and calorie intake so yeah if
your<00:02:19.660> bench<00:02:19.840> press<00:02:20.140> is<00:02:20.290> really<00:02:20.770> stagnating

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
your bench press is really stagnating

your bench press is really stagnating
the<00:02:21.670> other<00:02:21.850> two<00:02:21.970> lifts<00:02:22.240> are<00:02:22.330> going<00:02:22.600> up<00:02:22.780> it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the other two lifts are going up it

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.230 
the other two lifts are going up it
could<00:02:23.830> be<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.040> programming<00:02:24.610> issue<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.970> could<00:02:25.120> be

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
could be a programming issue it could be

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.640 
could be a programming issue it could be
a<00:02:25.270> calorie<00:02:25.630> issue<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:26.110> might<00:02:26.260> need<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.500> pump

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
a calorie issue you might need to pump

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.220 
a calorie issue you might need to pump
calories<00:02:27.160> or<00:02:27.460> you<00:02:27.970> might<00:02:28.210> need<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.720> back<00:02:28.930> off

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
calories or you might need to back off

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.410 
calories or you might need to back off
the<00:02:29.680> focus<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.310> little<00:02:30.550> bit<00:02:30.790> on<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> other<00:02:31.090> two

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
the focus a little bit on the other two

the focus a little bit on the other two
big<00:02:31.630> lifts<00:02:32.020> if<00:02:32.110> you're<00:02:32.230> really<00:02:32.560> concerned

big lifts if you're really concerned

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.190 
big lifts if you're really concerned
about<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.310> bench<00:02:33.490> press<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.960> you<00:02:35.050> can

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
about the bench press so that you can

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
about the bench press so that you can
bring<00:02:35.380> it<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.590> because<00:02:35.800> it's<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.420> non

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690

bring it up because it's for a non
novice<00:02:38.080> lifter<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:39.060> extremely<00:02:40.060> difficult

them each month and keep the other one
pretty<00:02:58.870> much<00:02:58.959> where<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.350> is<00:02:59.500> and<00:02:59.770> then<00:02:59.860> back

a<00:03:22.209> standard<00:03:22.630> rule<00:03:22.870> on<00:03:22.989> this<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.410> then<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.590> was

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
a standard rule on this and then I was

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.470 
a standard rule on this and then I was
chatting<00:03:24.010> with<00:03:24.130> Alan<00:03:24.550> Air<00:03:24.640> God<00:03:24.940> about<00:03:25.300> this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
chatting with Alan Air God about this

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.540 
chatting with Alan Air God about this
about<00:03:25.720> two<00:03:25.930> years<00:03:26.170> ago<00:03:26.530> and<00:03:26.800> he<00:03:26.950> shot<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.430> all

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
about two years ago and he shot it all

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.130 
about two years ago and he shot it all
to<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.030> said<00:03:28.360> now<00:03:28.480> there's<00:03:28.930> data

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
to and said now there's data

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.650 
to and said now there's data
showing<00:03:29.470> if<00:03:29.680> that's<00:03:30.269> outdated<00:03:31.269> and<00:03:31.390> we<00:03:31.450> don't

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
showing if that's outdated and we don't

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.840 
showing if that's outdated and we don't
even<00:03:31.750> actually<00:03:32.230> know<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.500> answer<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:33.489> energy

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
even actually know the answer the energy

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.580 
even actually know the answer the energy
used<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.239> be<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.660> we<00:03:34.810> used<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.140> say<00:03:35.320> that<00:03:35.470> it

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
used to be that we used to say that it

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.890 
used to be that we used to say that it
was<00:03:35.709> around<00:03:36.150> and<00:03:37.150> this<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.570> something<00:03:37.750> I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
was around and this is something I

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.390 
was around and this is something I
learned<00:03:38.049> in<00:03:38.200> nutrition<00:03:38.769> classes<00:03:39.190> at<00:03:39.310> at

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
learned in nutrition classes at at

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.539 
learned in nutrition classes at at
university<00:03:39.970> but<00:03:40.720> that<00:03:41.709> you<00:03:42.100> could<00:03:42.310> lose

university but that you could lose

university but that you could lose
approximately<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:43.690> upper<00:03:43.930> threshold<00:03:44.170> seems

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
approximately the upper threshold seems

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.539 
approximately the upper threshold seems
to<00:03:44.950> be<00:03:45.130> thirty<00:03:45.670> calories<00:03:46.320> per<00:03:47.320> pound<00:03:47.709> of<00:03:48.040> body

actually turns out it isn't that

things going on who could retain muscle

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.960 
things going on who could retain muscle
pretty<00:04:22.629> well<00:04:22.780> even<00:04:23.020> surpassing<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:23.860> in<00:04:24.129> the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
pretty well even surpassing that in the

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.839 
pretty well even surpassing that in the
right<00:04:25.150> environment<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.490> we<00:04:27.490> don't<00:04:27.699> really

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
right environment so we don't really

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.309 
right environment so we don't really
have<00:04:28.060> an<00:04:28.180> answer<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.750> question<00:04:29.169> is

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:29.319 
have an answer this question is

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.110 
have an answer this question is
unfortunately<00:04:30.280> we<00:04:30.460> thought<00:04:30.699> we<00:04:30.909> had<00:04:31.090> it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
unfortunately we thought we had it

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.809 
unfortunately we thought we had it
pinned<00:04:31.509> down<00:04:31.840> 15<00:04:32.379> years<00:04:32.650> ago<00:04:32.949> but

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:33.819 
pinned down 15 years ago but

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:35.520 
pinned down 15 years ago but
unfortunately<00:04:34.509> these<00:04:34.659> questions<00:04:35.080> now<00:04:35.259> I<00:04:35.289> like

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
unfortunately these questions now I like

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.580 
unfortunately these questions now I like
asking<00:04:35.860> how<00:04:36.009> long<00:04:36.069> is<00:04:36.310> a<00:04:36.340> piece<00:04:36.400> of<00:04:36.580> strength

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
asking how long is a piece of strength

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.990 
asking how long is a piece of strength
there<00:04:38.590> probably<00:04:39.039> isn't<00:04:39.280> really<00:04:39.639> an<00:04:39.729> upper

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
there probably isn't really an upper

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.279 
there probably isn't really an upper
threshold<00:04:40.419> as<00:04:40.509> long<00:04:40.659> as<00:04:40.780> you<00:04:40.840> can<00:04:40.960> create<00:04:41.169> a

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
threshold as long as you can create a

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.960 
threshold as long as you can create a
calorie<00:04:41.650> deficit<00:04:42.129> but<00:04:42.310> just<00:04:42.460> keep<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.729> mind

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
calorie deficit but just keep in mind

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:44.460 
calorie deficit but just keep in mind
that<00:04:43.060> at<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> certain<00:04:43.419> threshold<00:04:44.080> everything

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
that at a certain threshold everything

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.659 
that at a certain threshold everything
from<00:04:44.620> your<00:04:44.710> Health's<00:04:44.949> going<00:04:45.159> to<00:04:45.220> suffer<00:04:45.520> your

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
from your Health's going to suffer your

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:46.860 
from your Health's going to suffer your
energy<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.090> going<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.330> suffer<00:04:46.599> you're<00:04:46.720> going

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
energy is going to suffer you're going

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.570 
energy is going to suffer you're going
to<00:04:46.930> lose<00:04:47.110> muscle<00:04:47.440> tissue<00:04:47.800> all<00:04:48.220> sorts<00:04:48.520> of

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
to lose muscle tissue all sorts of

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.670 
to lose muscle tissue all sorts of
problems<00:04:48.789> so<00:04:49.720> this<00:04:50.080> one<00:04:50.289> of<00:04:50.409> those<00:04:50.500> things

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
problems so this one of those things

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.899 
problems so this one of those things
that<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:50.889> just<00:04:51.009> have<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.250> experiment<00:04:51.550> with

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
that you just have to experiment with

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:53.550 
that you just have to experiment with
other<00:04:52.240> than<00:04:52.360> we<00:04:52.509> know<00:04:52.629> that<00:04:52.780> the<00:04:52.900> more<00:04:53.080> fat<00:04:53.379> you

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
other than we know that the more fat you

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.350 
other than we know that the more fat you
have<00:04:53.590> obviously<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.370> faster<00:04:54.849> you<00:04:54.969> can<00:04:55.000> lose

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
have obviously the faster you can lose

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.899 
have obviously the faster you can lose
it<00:04:55.889> without<00:04:56.889> having<00:04:57.190> a<00:04:57.250> lot<00:04:57.400> of<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.550> negative

00:04:57.899 --> 00:04:57.909 
it without having a lot of the negative
