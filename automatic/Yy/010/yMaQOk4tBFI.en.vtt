00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.040
 and now we're back with one more 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.380
 touch of performances welcome 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.180
 Today we are going to show you the goal. 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.230
 was a manual point 4 and its performance 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.750
 What 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.809
 and then already doing automatic too 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.900
 Why is dsg interesting? 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.080
 the comparison between the two then let's 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:09.000
 numbers and tests starting with 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 10 to 50 to 100 than it was in the house of 9 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.119
 74 points is the same as the position 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.310
 four seconds was number one because in 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:23.100
 second 16 and was 550 26 seconds and 86 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 I thought it was going to be a little better but he 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.210
 it was because above 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.259
 The only problem with this is that it 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.119
 more than the automaker and the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.190
 specialized companies disclose her 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.979
 2 seconds ago 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.539
 has said that it does in eight and 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.369
 kind of not 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:46.800
 Our number was 9.7 so it's up to you 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.500
 to believe or not to us or in the press 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.929
 then the test is there 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.259
 wanting or not is the car when 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.300
 difference can make it very different 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:01.229
 than what I think would be fine 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.080
 more is easy for you to compare would be the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.170
 psg you have a lot of you to né 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.479
 now torn manual varies a lot then 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.110
 We'll take it out there but do not trust. 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.660
 and weaves dsg that we evaluate will not have 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.280
 crying nor sailing 400 meters did on 16 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.910
 86 seconds 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.569
 the average is interesting because it was 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:32.250
 practically equal 10 4 916 exact then 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:34.500
 that is, it amounts to 661 16.75 né 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.080
 So you've even been the number that generates 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.080
 400 meters a god are identical the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.700
 cars then has no means 0.01 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.599
 It's not different for me. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.750
 one google thing 4080 made the mark of 4 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:52.530
 seconds and 104 number greater than total 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.610
 40 and 80 of those in 16 for example is already 80 to 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.290
 120 was smaller then I was 6.79 then there 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.190
 This way you already gave the change. 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.849
 In that case, his braking was in the 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.200
 house of 42 meters fenaj very good 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.940
 including his performance today 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.799
 soon we will have dsg to see the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.620
 comparison with who will be very 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:20.540
 It is interesting to get out and 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.540
 the next too spoke 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.770
 ae 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.560
 ae
