ok<00:00:06.730> let's<00:00:06.970> go<00:00:07.150> again<00:00:07.390> and<00:00:07.660> i<00:00:07.750> think<00:00:08.020> i'll<00:00:08.170> try

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
ok let's go again and i think i'll try

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.560 
ok let's go again and i think i'll try
and<00:00:09.130> increase<00:00:09.310> the<00:00:09.550> baldness<00:00:09.880> my<00:00:10.180> openings

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
and increase the baldness my openings

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.009 
and increase the baldness my openings
because<00:00:11.290> i'm<00:00:11.889> lost<00:00:12.850> a<00:00:13.030> lot<00:00:13.389> writing<00:00:13.750> points

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
because i'm lost a lot writing points

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.950 
because i'm lost a lot writing points
recently<00:00:14.620> so<00:00:14.860> i'm<00:00:14.980> hoping<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.580> increase<00:00:16.270> the

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
recently so i'm hoping to increase the

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.109 
recently so i'm hoping to increase the
level<00:00:17.260> of<00:00:17.320> surprise<00:00:17.710> value<00:00:18.099> an<00:00:18.220> outrage<00:00:18.760> value

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
level of surprise value an outrage value

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.290 
level of surprise value an outrage value
and<00:00:19.510> Loeb<00:00:20.020> thing<00:00:20.260> so<00:00:21.099> I<00:00:21.130> played<00:00:21.340> in<00:00:21.460> only<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:21.820> six

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
and Loeb thing so I played in only a six

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.090 
and Loeb thing so I played in only a six
and<00:00:22.480> already<00:00:22.869> I<00:00:23.199> don't<00:00:23.380> think<00:00:23.619> the<00:00:23.710> opponent

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
and already I don't think the opponent

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.740 
and already I don't think the opponent
strategies<00:00:24.490> that<00:00:24.640> brilliant<00:00:25.180> if<00:00:25.270> unless<00:00:25.630> he

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:25.750 
strategies that brilliant if unless he

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.279 
strategies that brilliant if unless he
knows<00:00:25.869> what<00:00:26.080> he's<00:00:26.170> doing<00:00:26.380> in<00:00:26.500> this<00:00:26.560> line<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:28.000> um

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
knows what he's doing in this line so um

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.540 
knows what he's doing in this line so um
which<00:00:29.289> probably<00:00:29.500> does<00:00:29.740> actually<00:00:29.920> switch

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
which probably does actually switch

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.970 
which probably does actually switch
transposed<00:00:31.080> but<00:00:32.080> I<00:00:32.110> found<00:00:32.500> use<00:00:32.710> for<00:00:32.890> that

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
transposed but I found use for that

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.960 
transposed but I found use for that
asics<00:00:33.430> anyway<00:00:33.760> so<00:00:34.120> quick<00:00:34.449> queenside<00:00:35.970> space

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
asics anyway so quick queenside space

asics anyway so quick queenside space
expansion<00:00:39.870> alright<00:00:40.870> it's<00:00:40.989> thinking<00:00:41.290> now<00:00:41.470> so

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
expansion alright it's thinking now so

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.440 
expansion alright it's thinking now so

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
so is a five move here my a5 rook a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.740 
so is a five move here my a5 rook a
eight<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:13.010> think<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:13.970> might<00:03:14.210> be<00:03:14.270> interesting

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
eight I think that might be interesting

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.820 
eight I think that might be interesting
moved<00:03:14.930> to<00:03:15.020> try<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:15.260> pursue<00:03:15.470> this<00:03:15.590> minority

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
moved to try and pursue this minority

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.500 
moved to try and pursue this minority
attack<00:03:16.430> so<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.670> minority<00:03:17.090> of<00:03:17.120> porns

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
attack so the minority of porns

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.480

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.020 
yep okay that was interesting so unusual
opening<00:05:38.680> but<00:05:38.770> just<00:05:38.980> transposing<00:05:39.610> then<00:05:39.760> into

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
opening but just transposing then into

French<00:05:40.570> the<00:05:40.660> fans<00:05:42.060> hopefully<00:05:43.060> you<00:05:43.330> know<00:05:43.450> mate

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
French the fans hopefully you know mate

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.160 
French the fans hopefully you know mate
maybe<00:05:43.990> he<00:05:44.170> wasn't<00:05:44.320> in<00:05:44.530> his<00:05:44.560> most<00:05:45.070> comfortable

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.170 
maybe he wasn't in his most comfortable

variation<00:05:47.170> on<00:05:47.260> the<00:05:47.320> French<00:05:47.530> defence<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.100> I

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
variation on the French defence and I

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.540 
variation on the French defence and I
seem<00:05:49.720> to<00:05:49.780> have<00:05:49.840> a<00:05:49.930> good<00:05:50.110> game<00:05:50.290> I<00:05:50.650> think<00:05:51.220> maybe

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
seem to have a good game I think maybe

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.460 
seem to have a good game I think maybe
you<00:05:51.610> should<00:05:51.640> have<00:05:51.880> considered<00:05:52.150> before<00:05:52.300> hear

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.040 

that<00:05:56.470> maybe<00:05:56.620> d4<00:05:57.220> then<00:05:57.400> is<00:05:57.670> tricky<00:05:59.280> okay<00:06:00.280> so

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
that maybe d4 then is tricky okay so

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.550 
that maybe d4 then is tricky okay so
then<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.200> sort<00:06:02.470> of<00:06:02.530> thumb<00:06:04.080> sure<00:06:05.080> it<00:06:05.200> wasn't<00:06:05.530> that

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560 
then I sort of thumb sure it wasn't that

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.190 
then I sort of thumb sure it wasn't that
bad<00:06:05.700> it's<00:06:06.700> actually<00:06:06.790> play<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:07.450> decisive<00:06:08.050> role

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
bad it's actually play the decisive role

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.170 
bad it's actually play the decisive role
in<00:06:08.260> the<00:06:08.440> end<00:06:08.620> to<00:06:08.980> win<00:06:09.100> a<00:06:09.160> piece<00:06:09.370> hope<00:06:10.090> you
