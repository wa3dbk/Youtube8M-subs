00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:02:02.750 

making<00:01:26.810> sure

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:30.270 

section<00:02:05.550> twist<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.940> just<00:02:28.209> helps<00:02:28.360> me<00:02:29.280> get

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
section twist this just helps me get

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:49.680 
section twist this just helps me get
each<00:02:30.820> section<00:02:31.300> well<00:02:31.480> condition<00:02:48.300> sometimes<00:02:49.300> it

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
each section well condition sometimes it

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.540 
each section well condition sometimes it
takes<00:02:49.930> eight<00:02:50.290> section<00:02:50.770> sometimes<00:02:50.920> takes<00:02:51.340> ten

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
takes eight section sometimes takes ten

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.280 
takes eight section sometimes takes ten
it<00:02:51.640> just<00:02:51.790> really<00:02:51.970> depends<00:02:52.270> on<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:53.110> thickness

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
it just really depends on the thickness

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.840 
it just really depends on the thickness
of<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.650> hair<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:54.160> let<00:02:54.310> them<00:02:54.489> hear<00:02:54.640> all<00:02:54.730> that

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
of the hair to let them hear all that

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
of the hair to let them hear all that
stuff<00:02:55.380> she's<00:02:56.380> getting<00:02:57.130> it<00:02:57.280> really<00:02:57.430> well

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.320 

like<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.590> twist<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:10.010> down

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.020 

section<00:03:18.750> Mustaine<00:03:19.750> treatments<00:03:20.260> are<00:03:20.410> great

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
section Mustaine treatments are great

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.520 
section Mustaine treatments are great
especially<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.450> Naturals<00:03:23.050> because<00:03:23.379> it

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
especially for Naturals because it

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.020 
especially for Naturals because it
refuses<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.920> conditioner<00:03:27.489> and<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.730> moisture

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
refuses the conditioner and the moisture

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.080 
refuses the conditioner and the moisture
into<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.360> hair<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:29.099> it<00:03:30.099> helps<00:03:30.519> with<00:03:30.730> that

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
into the hair and it helps with that

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.839 
into the hair and it helps with that
reversion<00:03:31.930> problem<00:03:32.349> that<00:03:32.530> Naturals<00:03:33.430> have<00:03:33.610> -

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
reversion problem that Naturals have -

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:36.360 
reversion problem that Naturals have -
or<00:03:34.209> straight<00:03:34.480> naps<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:34.840> whatever<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:36.250> know

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
or straight naps and whatever you know

or straight naps and whatever you know
straight<00:03:36.640> line<00:03:36.790> regular<00:03:37.120> basis<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:38.050> you<00:03:38.560> do

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
straight line regular basis and you do

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:44.039 
straight line regular basis and you do
the<00:03:38.830> hydration<00:03:39.370> our<00:03:39.610> skin<00:03:39.640> treatments<00:03:43.049> your

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
the hydration our skin treatments your

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.930 
the hydration our skin treatments your
hair<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.290> less<00:03:44.440> likely<00:03:44.830> to<00:03:44.860> revert<00:03:45.430> as<00:03:45.549> quickly

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
hair is less likely to revert as quickly

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.820 
hair is less likely to revert as quickly
just<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:46.750> about<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:47.080> as<00:03:47.170> if<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.500> sponge

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
just think about it as if it's a sponge

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.309 
just think about it as if it's a sponge
so<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.910> dress<00:03:49.150> -<00:03:49.360> n<00:03:49.630> if<00:03:49.720> you<00:03:49.780> look<00:03:49.989> it's<00:03:50.230> kind

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
so the dress - n if you look it's kind

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.449 
so the dress - n if you look it's kind
of<00:03:50.410> soak<00:03:50.620> up<00:03:50.830> water<00:03:51.549> quickly<00:03:52.680> so<00:03:53.680> your<00:03:54.069> hair<00:03:54.250> is

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
of soak up water quickly so your hair is

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.960 
of soak up water quickly so your hair is
completely<00:03:54.640> moisture<00:03:55.329> harvest<00:03:56.970> then

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
completely moisture harvest then

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.120 
completely moisture harvest then
whatever<00:03:58.450> emotions<00:03:58.959> invader<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.680> not<00:03:59.920> going

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
whatever emotions invader is not going

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.440 
whatever emotions invader is not going
to<00:04:00.190> be<00:04:00.280> able<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.459> be<00:04:00.549> soaked<00:04:00.790> up<00:04:00.910> by<00:04:00.970> your<00:04:01.269> paper

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
to be able to be soaked up by your paper

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.789 
to be able to be soaked up by your paper
because<00:04:01.750> you're<00:04:01.870> here<00:04:02.019> already<00:04:02.200> has<00:04:02.410> enough

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:02.799 
because you're here already has enough

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.710 
because you're here already has enough
moisture<00:04:02.950> in<00:04:03.190> it<00:04:03.310> and<00:04:04.030> so<00:04:04.209> your<00:04:04.360> hair<00:04:04.540> will

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720

moisture in it and so your hair will
remain<00:04:05.019> straight<00:04:14.400> you<00:04:15.400> know<00:04:15.570> it's<00:04:16.570> at<00:04:17.139> least<00:04:17.169> a

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
remain straight you know it's at least a

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.070 
remain straight you know it's at least a
couple<00:04:17.590> weeks<00:04:18.419> or<00:04:19.419> two<00:04:19.630> weekend<00:04:21.960> but<00:04:22.960> if

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
couple weeks or two weekend but if

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.740 
couple weeks or two weekend but if
you're<00:04:23.229> if<00:04:23.919> you're<00:04:23.950> new<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.460> funding<00:04:25.240> and<00:04:25.630> your

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
you're if you're new to funding and your

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.650 
you're if you're new to funding and your
hair<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.139> is<00:04:26.229> not<00:04:26.260> used<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.620> being<00:04:26.830> straight

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
hair that is not used to being straight

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.909 
hair that is not used to being straight
take<00:04:28.660> a<00:04:28.690> couple<00:04:28.960> of<00:04:29.050> times<00:04:29.260> your<00:04:29.470> pill<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.800> get

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
take a couple of times your pill to get

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.890 
take a couple of times your pill to get
used<00:04:30.070> to<00:04:30.250> being<00:04:30.820> in<00:04:30.970> straight<00:04:31.240> state<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.750> so

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
used to being in straight state and so

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.300 
used to being in straight state and so
it<00:04:31.960> might<00:04:32.080> work<00:04:32.350> quickly<00:04:32.620> but<00:04:32.830> as<00:04:32.950> soon<00:04:33.100> as

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
it might work quickly but as soon as

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.940 
it might work quickly but as soon as
you're<00:04:33.460> here<00:04:33.610> he's<00:04:33.760> used<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.090> being<00:04:34.710> flat<00:04:35.710> iron

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
you're here he's used to being flat iron

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.719 
you're here he's used to being flat iron
it<00:04:36.610> will<00:04:36.729> start<00:04:36.940> staying<00:04:37.180> straight<00:04:37.810> or<00:04:37.990> longer

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
it will start staying straight or longer

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.830 
it will start staying straight or longer
and<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:39.820> I'll<00:04:39.940> go<00:04:40.060> through<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> entire<00:04:40.570> head

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840
