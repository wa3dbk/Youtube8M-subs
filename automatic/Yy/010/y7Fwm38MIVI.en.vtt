00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
that they asked for and recipes that

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.709 
that they asked for and recipes that
I've<00:01:24.869> inherited<00:01:25.670> through<00:01:26.670> my<00:01:26.880> grandmother<00:01:27.509> or

I've inherited through my grandmother or
my<00:01:27.869> mother<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.219> I<00:01:29.430> cook<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:29.759> my

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
my mother and also that I cook with my

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.209 
my mother and also that I cook with my
sisters<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> very

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
sisters and all of this is very

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.240 
sisters and all of this is very
important<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:34.170> way<00:01:34.200> how<00:01:34.740> we<00:01:34.799> cook

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
important because in a way how we cook

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.120 
important because in a way how we cook
is<00:01:35.490> how<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:35.759> are<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.420> how<00:01:36.539> we<00:01:36.570> live<00:01:36.899> and<00:01:37.170> what's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
is how we are and how we live and what's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.099 
is how we are and how we live and what's
really<00:01:38.520> central<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.180> that<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.079> that

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
really central to that I think is that

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:42.950 
really central to that I think is that
real<00:01:40.770> cooking<00:01:41.250> at<00:01:41.399> home<00:01:41.609> life<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.539> kitchen

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
real cooking at home life in the kitchen

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.840 
real cooking at home life in the kitchen
is<00:01:43.109> about<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.469> leftover<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.579> wherever

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
is about the leftover so wherever

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.569 
is about the leftover so wherever
appropriate<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:46.109> have<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.219> note<00:01:47.430> at

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
appropriate I have got a little note at

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
appropriate I have got a little note at
the<00:01:47.700> end<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.939> recipe<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.899> called

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the end of a recipe and it's called

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.830 
the end of a recipe and it's called
making<00:01:50.009> leftovers<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.609> and<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.539> love<00:01:51.810> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
making leftovers right and I love that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.830 
making leftovers right and I love that
