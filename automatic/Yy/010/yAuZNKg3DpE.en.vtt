00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
backyard I got the gas assisted cube

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.470 
backyard I got the gas assisted cube
today<00:00:05.250> we're<00:00:05.400> going<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.549> answer<00:00:05.609> does<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> gas

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
pocket and then we're going to get the

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.470 
pocket and then we're going to get the
water<00:00:11.340> over<00:00:11.490> there<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.910> fill<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.210> little

water over there and fill this little
bit<00:00:12.630> up

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.950 

okay<00:00:29.130> getting<00:00:29.520> out<00:00:29.610> all<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.880> nasty<00:00:30.330> stuff<00:00:30.360> now

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
okay getting out all the nasty stuff now

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:43.510 
okay getting out all the nasty stuff now
we're<00:00:31.230> good<00:00:31.350> to<00:00:31.470> go

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:54.580 

ok<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.990> drop<00:00:46.230> test

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.280 

you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.840 

so<00:01:03.010> you<00:01:03.610> can<00:01:03.730> see<00:01:03.910> still<00:01:04.449> floating<00:01:05.850> sister

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
so you can see still floating sister

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.870 
so you can see still floating sister
even<00:01:07.270> if<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.390> dunk<00:01:07.630> it<00:01:08.580> rises<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.730> the<00:01:09.760> top

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
even if you dunk it rises to the top

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.120 
even if you dunk it rises to the top
because<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.780> air<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:10.960> on<00:01:11.440> the<00:01:11.470> inside<00:01:11.740> of<00:01:11.980> the

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
because the air is on the inside of the

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.650 
because the air is on the inside of the
pieces<00:01:12.340> since<00:01:12.670> its<00:01:13.140> gas<00:01:14.140> injected<00:01:14.850> molding<00:01:15.850> so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
pieces since its gas injected molding so

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.840 
pieces since its gas injected molding so
if<00:01:16.990> I<00:01:17.110> take<00:01:17.260> this<00:01:17.410> piece<00:01:17.650> out<00:01:17.800> here<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.730> whole

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
if I take this piece out here the whole

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.460 
if I take this piece out here the whole
pieces<00:01:19.120> of<00:01:19.390> solid<00:01:19.750> there's<00:01:19.900> no<00:01:20.020> air<00:01:20.230> hole

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
pieces of solid there's no air hole

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.560 
pieces of solid there's no air hole
there's<00:01:20.800> nothing<00:01:20.920> no<00:01:21.550> water<00:01:21.850> to<00:01:22.090> get<00:01:22.210> in<00:01:22.360> even

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
there's nothing no water to get in even

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.660 
there's nothing no water to get in even
in<00:01:22.960> there<00:01:23.140> is<00:01:23.320> a<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.970> plugged<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.860> since<00:01:27.460> no

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
in there is a is plugged so since no

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.810 
in there is a is plugged so since no
water<00:01:28.060> can<00:01:28.330> get<00:01:28.479> in<00:01:28.690> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:30.280> water<00:01:30.460> gets<00:01:30.700> into

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
water can get in I mean water gets into

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.010 
water can get in I mean water gets into
the<00:01:30.910> core<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.210> stuff<00:01:31.510> like<00:01:31.630> that<00:01:31.690> probably

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
the core and stuff like that probably

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.080 
the core and stuff like that probably
but<00:01:32.530> since<00:01:33.040> there's<00:01:33.190> no<00:01:33.310> way<00:01:33.340> water's<00:01:34.000> going

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
but since there's no way water's going

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.350 
but since there's no way water's going
to<00:01:34.210> get<00:01:34.300> into<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.570> air-filled<00:01:34.930> pieces<00:01:36.360> like

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
to get into the air-filled pieces like

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.520 
to get into the air-filled pieces like
the<00:01:37.479> camera<00:01:37.869> the<00:01:38.290> single<00:01:38.619> float<00:01:38.860> for<00:01:39.130> ever

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the camera the single float for ever

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.290 
the camera the single float for ever
actually<00:01:41.530> has<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.800> test<00:01:42.130> I<00:01:42.460> should<00:01:43.060> just<00:01:43.210> let

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
actually has a test I should just let

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.160 
actually has a test I should just let
this<00:01:43.360> uh<00:01:44.550> flow<00:01:45.550> out<00:01:45.729> here<00:01:45.940> for<00:01:46.270> maybe<00:01:46.869> an<00:01:47.050> hour

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
this uh flow out here for maybe an hour

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.749 
this uh flow out here for maybe an hour
I<00:01:47.500> know<00:01:48.070> is<00:01:48.160> that<00:01:48.190> long<00:01:48.430> enough<00:01:48.460> we'll<00:01:49.090> see

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:03.810 

cube<00:01:54.759> for<00:01:55.090> you<00:02:02.160> so<00:02:03.160> I<00:02:03.190> forgot<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.580> film<00:02:03.729> the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
cube for you so I forgot to film the

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:14.940 
cube for you so I forgot to film the
time<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:06.040> is

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.880 

657<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> at<00:02:18.440> seven<00:02:18.770> or<00:02:18.890> eight<00:02:19.340> we'll<00:02:20.060> come<00:02:20.240> back

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
657 so at seven or eight we'll come back

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.690 
657 so at seven or eight we'll come back
let<00:02:21.890> this<00:02:22.040> go<00:02:23.860> duck<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:24.980> more<00:02:25.130> time<00:02:25.340> just<00:02:25.520> in

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
let this go duck it more time just in

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.210 
let this go duck it more time just in
case<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:27.190> press<00:02:28.190> to<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.490> top<00:02:28.730> all<00:02:28.940> right<00:02:30.220> so

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
case that press to the top all right so

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.920 
case that press to the top all right so
it<00:02:31.520> is<00:02:32.200> come<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.319> focus<00:02:34.209> I'm<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.330> manual<00:02:35.660> focus

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
it is come on focus I'm on manual focus

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:46.870 
it is come on focus I'm on manual focus
from<00:02:36.050> earlier<00:02:36.350> whoops<00:02:41.380> 759<00:02:45.640> crickets<00:02:46.640> are<00:02:46.760> out

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
from earlier whoops 759 crickets are out

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.630 
from earlier whoops 759 crickets are out
even<00:02:47.120> though<00:02:47.180> it's<00:02:47.269> not<00:02:47.360> even<00:02:47.510> dark<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:49.010> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
still looks so yes they do float I am

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.690 
still looks so yes they do float I am
going<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.769> go<00:02:54.860> set<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.100> on<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.280> paper<00:02:55.459> towel
