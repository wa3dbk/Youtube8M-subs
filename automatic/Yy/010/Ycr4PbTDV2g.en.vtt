where you wouldn't know how to look at
it<00:01:08.130> when<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.760> see<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.940> in<00:01:09.060> action

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it when you see it in action

which holds the bottle of whiskey and
where<00:01:27.329> we<00:01:27.450> go

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.560 

and<00:01:47.930> is<00:01:48.020> it<00:01:48.140> by<00:01:48.320> magic<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.270> text<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.360> I<00:01:50.420> want

and is it by magic the text that I want

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.660 
and is it by magic the text that I want
starts<00:01:50.990> to<00:01:51.170> appear<00:01:51.470> in<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.710> wood<00:01:51.860> it's<00:01:52.460> quite

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
starts to appear in the wood it's quite

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.770 
starts to appear in the wood it's quite
light<00:01:52.850> at<00:01:53.000> first<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.979> light<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.520> wood<00:01:55.780> in

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
light at first the light of the wood in

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.870 
light at first the light of the wood in
color<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.920> darker<00:01:58.070> that<00:01:58.310> one<00:01:58.580> tends<00:01:58.790> to

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
color the darker that one tends to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.490 
color the darker that one tends to
appear<00:01:59.180> so<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.479> better<00:01:59.659> it<00:01:59.840> works<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.320> if<00:02:00.409> you

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
appear so the better it works so if you

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.310 
appear so the better it works so if you
were<00:02:00.619> using<00:02:00.830> a<00:02:00.979> dark<00:02:01.250> wood<00:02:01.840> such<00:02:02.840> as<00:02:03.020> mahogany

were using a dark wood such as mahogany

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.710 
were using a dark wood such as mahogany
or<00:02:03.820> something<00:02:04.820> like<00:02:04.909> that<00:02:04.970> obviously<00:02:05.479> the

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
or something like that obviously the

or something like that obviously the
effect<00:02:05.840> isn't<00:02:06.200> going<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.530> be<00:02:06.619> as<00:02:06.740> pronounced

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.680 
effect isn't going to be as pronounced
but<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:07.700> life<00:02:07.880> pine<00:02:08.149> it<00:02:08.330> works<00:02:08.509> quite

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
but in this life pine it works quite

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.010 
but in this life pine it works quite
well<00:02:09.009> this<00:02:10.009> is<00:02:10.250> just<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.729> first<00:02:10.970> pass<00:02:11.239> after

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
well this is just a first pass after

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.140 
well this is just a first pass after
this<00:02:12.170> we'll<00:02:12.470> do<00:02:12.680> at<00:02:13.370> least<00:02:13.550> another<00:02:13.819> one<00:02:14.030> if

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
this we'll do at least another one if

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.440 
this we'll do at least another one if
not<00:02:14.269> three<00:02:14.540> passes<00:02:14.989> and<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.860> will<00:02:16.239> burn<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
not three passes and that will burn the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
not three passes and that will burn the
leather<00:02:17.599> and<00:02:17.780> into<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.989> wood

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
leather and into the wood

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.250 
leather and into the wood
deeper<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:18.950> deeper<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:20.750> will<00:02:20.840> get<00:02:20.959> more<00:02:21.110> the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
deeper and deeper it will get more the

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.559 
deeper and deeper it will get more the
3d<00:02:21.680> effect

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
3d effect

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.860 
3d effect
so<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:24.260> second<00:02:24.590> parcel<00:02:24.800> stop<00:02:25.280> reassuring

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.509 

and<00:02:30.379> you<00:02:30.470> can<00:02:30.590> see<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.010> laser<00:02:31.160> moves

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
and you can see as the laser moves

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.790 
and you can see as the laser moves
across<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.360> right<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> which<00:02:33.349> I<00:02:33.470> told<00:02:33.650> you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
across the right and which I told you

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.979 
across the right and which I told you
from<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:33.980> first<00:02:34.340> pass<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.970> can<00:02:35.360> see<00:02:35.690> getting

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
from the first pass you can see getting

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.500 
from the first pass you can see getting
there<00:02:36.290> gradually<00:02:36.709> daughter<00:02:37.120> pretty<00:02:38.120> quick<00:02:38.360> as

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
there gradually daughter pretty quick as

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.170 
there gradually daughter pretty quick as
well<00:02:39.280> doesn't<00:02:40.280> make<00:02:40.370> a<00:02:40.400> lot<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.610> noise<00:02:40.849> there's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
well doesn't make a lot of noise there's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.640 
well doesn't make a lot of noise there's
a<00:02:41.239> little<00:02:41.450> bit<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.690> smoke<00:02:41.959> but<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.379> smell<00:02:42.620> a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
a little bit of smoke but to smell a

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.759 
a little bit of smoke but to smell a
little<00:02:42.769> bit<00:02:42.920> of<00:02:43.129> burning<00:02:43.310> but<00:02:44.769> really

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
little bit of burning but really

00:02:45.769 --> 00:03:13.979 
little bit of burning but really
fascinating<00:02:46.340> stuff

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.630 

and<00:03:14.989> this<00:03:15.230> is<00:03:15.379> it<00:03:15.500> basically<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.040> finished

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
and this is it basically the finished

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.809 
and this is it basically the finished
article<00:03:16.909> up<00:03:17.420> close<00:03:17.709> so<00:03:18.709> you<00:03:19.040> can<00:03:19.370> see<00:03:19.519> it's

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
article up close so you can see it's

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.880 
article up close so you can see it's
done<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.120> really<00:03:20.540> really<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.109> good<00:03:21.560> job<00:03:21.829> of

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
done a really really really good job of

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.440 
done a really really really good job of
imprinting<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.159> text<00:03:25.579> into<00:03:25.879> the<00:03:26.000> wood

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
imprinting the text into the wood

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.619 
imprinting the text into the wood
straightaway<00:03:27.290> it's<00:03:27.739> all<00:03:27.890> symmetrical<00:03:28.430> it<00:03:29.420> has

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
straightaway it's all symmetrical it has

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:30.970 
straightaway it's all symmetrical it has
got<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:29.810> little<00:03:30.079> depth<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.470> it<00:03:30.500> it's<00:03:30.739> hard<00:03:30.920> to

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
got a little depth to it it's hard to

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.160 
got a little depth to it it's hard to
see<00:03:31.099> in<00:03:31.280> this<00:03:31.370> area<00:03:31.519> on<00:03:31.819> this<00:03:32.120> end<00:03:32.480> on<00:03:33.019> the

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
see in this area on this end on the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.440 
see in this area on this end on the
video<00:03:33.379> but<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.400> can<00:03:34.579> actually<00:03:34.760> figure<00:03:35.180> it<00:03:35.329> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
video but you can actually figure it it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.170 
video but you can actually figure it it
is<00:03:35.599> recessed<00:03:36.590> into<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.890> wood<00:03:37.099> Mike<00:03:37.849> actually

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
is recessed into the wood Mike actually

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.399 
is recessed into the wood Mike actually
went<00:03:38.359> over<00:03:38.569> this<00:03:38.659> three<00:03:38.930> times<00:03:39.170> with<00:03:39.349> the

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:39.409 
went over this three times with the

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:40.780 
went over this three times with the
laser<00:03:39.560> machine<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.099> give<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.340> more<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.639> more

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
laser machine to give it more and more

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.509 
laser machine to give it more and more
depth<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.629> more<00:03:41.780> times<00:03:42.049> you<00:03:42.230> go<00:03:42.260> over<00:03:42.590> us<00:03:42.680> the

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
depth the more times you go over us the

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.580 
depth the more times you go over us the
deeper<00:03:43.879> the<00:03:44.000> text<00:03:44.569> is<00:03:44.689> and<00:03:44.989> the<00:03:45.170> darker<00:03:45.470> it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
deeper the text is and the darker it

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.030 
deeper the text is and the darker it
goes<00:03:45.799> but<00:03:46.670> I<00:03:47.209> think<00:03:47.840> you'll<00:03:47.930> agree<00:03:48.040> that

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
goes but I think you'll agree that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.629 
goes but I think you'll agree that
