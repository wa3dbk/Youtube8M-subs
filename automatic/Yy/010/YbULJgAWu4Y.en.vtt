00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.029
 or the time 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.480
 in this video we are going to organize a trick 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 that allows us to finish this game the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:17.060
 Legend of Zelda Breath of Base 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.070
 in approximately 4 minutes 34 minutes 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.009
 well I will create a name here is going to 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.230
 put matías to the character I here is a 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:27.789
 Subscriber who said he wanted to play 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.829
 this game and I hope you want 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:34.160
 impressed with this trick if you do not 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:35.690
 knows so there we actually 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.320
 name gives the same can put you 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.320
 any name 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.960
 What is this trick? 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.930
 if you go to more than anything in 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.260
 I do not know if you have noticed that good 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:55.989
 you have noticed in this game if you 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.449
 They can go up and down some stairs and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.590
 likewise you can jump like a 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.629
 second floor a first 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.070
 the idea this trick is just serious 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.800
 record the game by pressing select 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.659
 when we press, it opens 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.280
 a small menu that says continue the 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.979
 game 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.720
 or save and exit then what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.659
 we are going to do let's save and 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.719
 leave when we are in the air 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.390
 that's going to do that if we 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:30.180
 then we continue the game 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.940
 and an enemy hits us when we are very 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.440
 stuck a wall of some strange reason 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.250
 link is going to transfer 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.930
 and there is a very precise place here where 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.910
 we can advance even 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.390
 to the room that comes after 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:50.070
 gallon gallon being the last boss this 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:53.070
 game when we are going to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.360
 when we carry like the past and we have 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:59.340
 that defeating him is a very similar idea 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.870
 Another thing that is important once 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.020
 you already recorded 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.310
 and actually now I'm going to do it 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.860
 when you re -enter the game if 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.860
 I just hurt myself to have to do everything 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.030
 do not be guided as if by the first one 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.530
 that the temple damage that have the 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.500
 probability of trespassing the variety 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.690
 which is like 100 percent then with 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.380
 when link is as fair with a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.510
 little fish there 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.540
 we must save the game can be a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.909
 little lower but not so low 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.549
 as here it is accurate or even a 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 little lower then I will save 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.909
 and go out 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.569
 and now we're going to continue the game that 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.790
 I did and matienzo 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.799
 and now is where I do not owe without any 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 damage until you get to the precise part that 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:51.460
 I want to arrive 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.760
 they followed me a tap comes 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.250
 so let's see how 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:00.860
 to see if these modes here come out a 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.690
 little too much so I'm going to kill him 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.490
 it can be done without killing that monkey 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.770
 doing it not 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.920
 only 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.030
 with the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.590
 to prevent good then here I go to 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.640
 make a sword roll so that 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.640
 character come to hit 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.689
 there it is but how much to the link that another 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:28.469
 Once I elaborate and now and now I go here 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:33.620
 over here and if more or much on this side 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:37.290
 the link will jump and will come back here 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:39.150
 then let's move on 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.769
 actually when I saw this trick and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.870
 he gave a lot 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.120
 as a link 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.069
 and now then I'm going to double 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.150
 here and continue up until 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.150
 finish the direct game 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.459
 I'm just giving the key to 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:58.720
 up and we're going through rooms that do not 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.910
 they were finished in the game that I did 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.520
 they were thought for another for others 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.380
 bosses 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.380
 but apparently they were not finished 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.260
 then it is here found one that is 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.220
 even half finished and I only 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.370
 I'm moving up 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.510
 in fact but here we are going to see won 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.190
 but I 'm not sure if I win I'm going to 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.200
 get there so they will only see it and 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.200
 I'm going to move forward please look 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.860
 they installed 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.440
 and now the game is over then this 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.220
 it's like the fastest way to end 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.220
 this great game soon 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.520
 it is very very simple very very simple 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.810
 you just have to be careful with the 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.840
 power engraving 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.760
 How nice they are to hit 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.949
 in fact they can analyze the video because 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.070
 it is very very simple very very easy to 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.070
 perform 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.639
 I do not know to see let's see the end of the game 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.909
 best 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.909
 two 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.590
 this is where the link will take trifuerza 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.720
 reality the first is that I saw this trick 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.199
 that as between laughter I do not know if as rage 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 because it 's like one of the best games 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:33.280
 from nintendo 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.960
 but it was interesting that they know 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:50.180
 but it also has some other errors 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:51.889
 that in some castles I do not know 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.919
 If some but no one followed 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:58.339
 special where if you take a 

00:05:54.919 --> 00:06:01.129
 key and they do as an average maneuver 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.559
 rare but does not mean that paraguay 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:06.499
 in the game but they open another door 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:07.969
 that are not logically of a person 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:09.830
 I really would not open it if you 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.200
 open if there is going to be a key in a 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.340
 specific door 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.440
 they shit because the game 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.970
 it was not programmed for that has like 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.250
 that little mistake and they 're going to have to 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:23.410
 start all over again step once 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:27.330
 when was it when it was well well small 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:30.900
 and I played this game the first time 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:34.009
 It was like taking all hearts 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.009
 and that happened 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.720
 it was a shame so I had to start 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.720
 all over again 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.810
 well I do not think it's necessary 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.840
 but I do not think they want to see all the 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:00.160
 final if more than anything is to obey in 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.810
 account that the trick could be performed 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.810
 a very well simple way 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.129
 so I'm going to cut this video now and 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.849
 As always any good query 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:19.479
 make a private wall on youtube or 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:19.479
 just commenting 

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:25.160
 and now I'm going to continue with the clichés of 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.370
 ocarina of time and I would also like 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:30.210
 arrive later to 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.120
 more improvements 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.860
 and who knows after other games 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:38.160
 but for now I'm clearly focused 

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.440
 in ocarina of time since the amount of 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.550
 tricks you do not imagine that you 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:46.190
 imagine how many tricks there are 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:50.360
 well that would be all in today's video 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:52.210
 Tuesday, April 16, so see you 

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.910
 in 

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.910
 a next edition of the idey
