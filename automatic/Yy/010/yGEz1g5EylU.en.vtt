00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
okay so this is the build I used to get

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.079 
okay so this is the build I used to get
the<00:00:03.360> risk<00:00:03.570> achievement<00:00:04.140> in<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.400> passive<00:00:05.819> slot

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
the risk achievement in the passive slot

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.470 
the risk achievement in the passive slot
I<00:00:06.270> got<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.750> crash<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:08.069> slot<00:00:08.429> number<00:00:08.580> one<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.179> use

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
I got a crash in slot number one I use

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.120 
I got a crash in slot number one I use
void<00:00:09.870> with<00:00:10.469> purge<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.370> crash<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.830> you<00:00:13.830> lower

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
void with purge and crash so you lower

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300 
void with purge and crash so you lower
the<00:00:14.370> enemy's<00:00:15.030> armor<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.900> you<00:00:16.529> also<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.890> damage

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the enemy's armor and you also to damage

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.720 
the enemy's armor and you also to damage
over<00:00:17.609> time<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.180> stun<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.840> which<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.619> really<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
over time and stun it which is really a

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.730 
over time and stun it which is really a
good<00:00:20.939> thing<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:21.840> could<00:00:22.050> three<00:00:22.289> effects

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
good thing so you could three effects

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.429 
good thing so you could three effects
one<00:00:23.039> enemy<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.850> slot<00:00:24.269> number<00:00:24.420> two<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> use<00:00:25.080> cowl

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
one enemy and slot number two I use cowl

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.250 
one enemy and slot number two I use cowl
and<00:00:25.800> spark<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.300> mainly<00:00:27.510> for<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> damage

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
and spark this is mainly for the damage

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.939 
and spark this is mainly for the damage
output<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:29.400> slot<00:00:30.029> number<00:00:30.210> three<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.840> use<00:00:31.410> masks

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
output in slot number three I use masks

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.750 
output in slot number three I use masks
and<00:00:32.369> will<00:00:32.880> also<00:00:33.180> upgrade<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.660> with<00:00:33.690> ping<00:00:34.760> this

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
and will also upgrade it with ping this

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.959 
and will also upgrade it with ping this
is<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.719> panic<00:00:37.079> button<00:00:37.370> when<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.520> want<00:00:38.550> you

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
is the panic button when you want you

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
is the panic button when you want you
return<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.570> recharge<00:00:40.020> but<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:40.980> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
return to recharge but you really in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
return to recharge but you really in
trouble<00:00:41.280> followed<00:00:42.000> by<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> lot<00:00:42.390> of<00:00:42.510> enemies<00:00:42.870> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
trouble followed by a lot of enemies and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.680 
trouble followed by a lot of enemies and
you<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.559> press<00:00:43.800> 3<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:45.270> invisible<00:00:47.690> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
you just press 3 and get invisible and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.790 
you just press 3 and get invisible and
slot<00:00:49.200> number<00:00:49.320> 4<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.309> ping<00:00:50.760> with<00:00:51.180> taunt<00:00:51.800> this

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
slot number 4 I use ping with taunt this

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.639 
slot number 4 I use ping with taunt this
is<00:00:52.949> what<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> will<00:00:53.430> use<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.050> destroy<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
is what you will use to destroy the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.840 
is what you will use to destroy the
spawn<00:00:55.980> cells<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.760> feel<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> can<00:00:59.670> use

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
spawn cells that I feel that you can use

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.720 
spawn cells that I feel that you can use
it<00:01:00.059> while<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.570> turn<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:01.050> regenerating<00:01:01.829> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
it while you turn is regenerating so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.899 
it while you turn is regenerating so
yeah<00:01:04.460> but<00:01:05.460> let's<00:01:05.670> first<00:01:07.189> activate<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.760> our

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
yeah but let's first activate all of our

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
yeah but let's first activate all of our
limiters<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.570> then<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.439> show<00:01:10.650> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
limiters and then I'm going to show you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.399 
limiters and then I'm going to show you
how<00:01:11.250> this<00:01:11.430> works<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.939> in<00:01:12.240> action<00:01:14.780> ok<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.380> I

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
how this works out in action ok so now I

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
how this works out in action ok so now I
will<00:01:16.680> demonstrate<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.880> how<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.479> use<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
will demonstrate you on how to use this

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.469 
will demonstrate you on how to use this
build<00:01:19.369> first<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:20.670> three<00:01:21.030> times<00:01:21.240> voice

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
build first you use three times voice

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.920 
build first you use three times voice
then<00:01:22.380> get<00:01:22.830> behind<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.369> enemy<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.780> use

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then get behind the enemy and just use

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.600 
then get behind the enemy and just use
Cal<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.869> destroy<00:01:27.869> almost<00:01:28.770> every<00:01:29.460> enemy

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
Cal this will destroy almost every enemy

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.030 
Cal this will destroy almost every enemy
before<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> shot<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.259> switch<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.799> ping

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
before the shot and you switch to ping

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.899 
before the shot and you switch to ping
and<00:01:32.509> go<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> good<00:01:34.079> cells<00:01:34.729> destroy<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
and go for the good cells destroy the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.080 
and go for the good cells destroy the
shield<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.299> pick<00:01:36.479> them<00:01:36.630> up<00:01:37.009> since<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.700> got

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
shield and pick them up since we got

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
shield and pick them up since we got
another<00:01:39.390> young<00:01:39.900> lady<00:01:40.049> here<00:01:40.759> we<00:01:41.759> will<00:01:41.909> take

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
another young lady here we will take

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.749 
another young lady here we will take
care<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.720> her<00:01:42.899> first<00:01:43.170> before<00:01:43.530> we<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:44.040> over<00:01:44.520> to

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
care of her first before we go over to

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.830 
care of her first before we go over to
the<00:01:44.939> cells<00:01:46.579> so<00:01:47.579> just<00:01:48.060> do<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.600> same<00:01:48.780> thing

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the cells so just do the same thing

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.700 
the cells so just do the same thing
again<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:51.140> kill<00:01:52.140> her<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.270> this<00:01:54.270> time<00:01:54.710> we're

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
again and kill her and this time we're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.030 
again and kill her and this time we're
not<00:01:56.189> going<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.390> ping<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.079> instead<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.590> we<00:01:58.799> go

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
not going for ping but instead of we go

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
not going for ping but instead of we go
for<00:01:59.250> mask<00:01:59.460> since<00:01:59.729> there's<00:01:59.969> going<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> be<00:02:00.390> a

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
for mask since there's going to be a

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.580 
for mask since there's going to be a
shitload<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.200> cells<00:02:01.590> here<00:02:01.799> now<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:03.380> we<00:02:04.380> can

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
shitload of cells here now and we can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.709 
shitload of cells here now and we can
take<00:02:04.950> care<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> them<00:02:05.460> pretty<00:02:05.790> easily<00:02:05.850> actually

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
take care of them pretty easily actually

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.270 
take care of them pretty easily actually
since<00:02:07.469> our<00:02:07.680> void<00:02:08.039> also<00:02:08.700> does<00:02:08.910> an<00:02:09.239> AoE<00:02:09.569> damage

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
since our void also does an AoE damage

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.910 
since our void also does an AoE damage
so<00:02:11.280> let's<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.270> use<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.690> wait

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
so let's just use a wait

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.199 
so let's just use a wait
to<00:02:14.160> kill<00:02:14.400> all<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.580> those<00:02:14.970> sales<00:02:16.640> well<00:02:17.640> almost

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
to kill all of those sales well almost

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:30.540 
to kill all of those sales well almost
all<00:02:18.840> cells

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.030 

so<00:02:31.550> there's<00:02:31.850> only<00:02:32.060> two<00:02:32.450> cells<00:02:33.170> left<00:02:33.500> now<00:02:33.709> and

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
so there's only two cells left now and

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.190 
so there's only two cells left now and
one<00:02:34.430> guy<00:02:35.980> first<00:02:36.980> we<00:02:37.190> take<00:02:37.370> care<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.880> guy

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:52.110 

yeah<00:02:44.800> he<00:02:45.800> he<00:02:46.430> still<00:02:46.790> got<00:02:49.510> effects<00:02:50.510> on<00:02:50.660> him<00:02:50.950> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
yeah he he still got effects on him so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:03:00.729 
yeah he he still got effects on him so
one<00:02:53.120> void<00:02:53.739> will<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.770> enough<00:02:59.590> just<00:03:00.590> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
one void will be enough just the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.420 
one void will be enough just the
placement<00:03:01.220> just<00:03:02.709> have<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.830> think<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.190> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
placement just have to think of the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.160 
placement just have to think of the
right<00:03:04.700> placement<00:03:07.390> because<00:03:08.390> there's<00:03:08.870> still

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
right placement because there's still

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.509 
right placement because there's still
this<00:03:09.560> explosive<00:03:10.010> thing<00:03:10.459> down<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:11.320> not<00:03:12.519> want

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
this explosive thing down there not want

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.690 
this explosive thing down there not want
to<00:03:13.700> go<00:03:13.850> too<00:03:14.150> close<00:03:14.390> to<00:03:14.600> that<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:15.410> we<00:03:15.739> still<00:03:16.010> can

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
to go too close to that and we still can

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.690 
to go too close to that and we still can
use<00:03:16.820> one<00:03:17.120> void<00:03:17.510> before<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:18.019> call<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.830> kill<00:03:19.100> one

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
use one void before the call to kill one

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.400 
use one void before the call to kill one
of<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.940> bad<00:03:20.090> cells<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:23.420> boom<00:03:23.780> there<00:03:24.080> he<00:03:24.200> goes

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
of the bad cells and boom there he goes

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:30.750 
of the bad cells and boom there he goes
switch<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:26.110> ping<00:03:27.110> go<00:03:27.950> for<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> cells<00:03:28.519> and

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
switch to ping go for the cells and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.840 
switch to ping go for the cells and
finish<00:03:32.500> last<00:03:33.500> one<00:03:34.340> off<00:03:34.519> oh<00:03:36.310> there<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.430> go<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
finish last one off oh there you go and

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:46.300 
finish last one off oh there you go and
that's<00:03:38.360> how<00:03:38.570> we<00:03:38.690> do<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:38.930> I<00:03:44.049> also<00:03:45.049> reached<00:03:45.560> level

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
that's how we do it I also reached level

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.560 
that's how we do it I also reached level
24<00:03:46.760> now<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:52.130> will<00:03:52.310> probably<00:03:52.910> struggle<00:03:53.120> a<00:03:53.420> bit

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
24 now you will probably struggle a bit

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.390 
24 now you will probably struggle a bit
and<00:03:54.160> have<00:03:55.160> to<00:03:55.670> get<00:03:55.850> used<00:03:56.060> to<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.350> but<00:03:57.350> if<00:03:58.190> you

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
and have to get used to it but if you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.340 
and have to get used to it but if you
use<00:03:58.579> it<00:03:58.610> in<00:03:58.910> earlier<00:03:59.360> stages<00:03:59.840> of<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.320> game

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
use it in earlier stages of the game

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:03.220 
use it in earlier stages of the game
it's<00:04:00.799> a<00:04:00.890> lot<00:04:01.010> easier<00:04:01.430> then<00:04:02.239> later<00:04:02.540> stages<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
it's a lot easier then later stages of

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.610 
it's a lot easier then later stages of
the<00:04:03.500> game<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:05.170> yeah<00:04:06.400> good<00:04:07.400> luck
