00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello friends with you lera and 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.109
 flooding of the beginning of the beekeeping season 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.320
 starting with the beekeepers 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.860
 woke up order me a hive 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.710
 including 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.100
 grandmother's phil but I have no time traps 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.770
 do and so I will tell you how 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.680
 make yourself this one will 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.019
 you universal tool 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.720
 Here is such a box is made this box 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.810
 in general, the best option 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.239
 do on 7 frames from sheet dvp not knowing 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.550
 approximately 5 may probably obtained 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.100
 more who there thought it was possible 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.559
 count means should be right here 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.050
 distance 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.600
 commensurate with the seven frames 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.629
 on hangers 37 and they should here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 persist and slightly indent to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.520
 better understand them here such a box that is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.489
 its height should be about the frame 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.660
 I lay on these hangers from the floor 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:08.369
 she should have this two centimeters not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.710
 more can be slightly and let us mean what else 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.450
 how to do it is done just taken 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.500
 Here is such a bar can take 2030 but 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.290
 it doesn't matter 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.549
 wins the frame and dvp is stuffed on it 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:29.369
 dvp and these two absolutely identical 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.189
 elements are then made two more 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.390
 identical elements given this one 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.570
 the leg is cut two identical 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.869
 hiv element is broken like this 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.729
 way on dvp 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.850
 rather dvp stuffed into bars with one 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.880
 the sides can be bent if they are 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.729
 long and there the hardboard is also stuffed here on 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:02:00.170
 these bars and then two of these are taken 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.430
 the side element is placed them vertically 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.740
 bottom is nailed to them 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.110
 here here four eyes through 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.569
 they go just get there bars and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.530
 everything here is tight and still makes its way 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.440
 by the chiefs 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:17.940
 here it is then that these elements are 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.580
 just sheets of hardboard 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.940
 carved square nailed from here 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.069
 in the butts an important element here is this 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.040
 is the thing it should be in advance 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.770
 packed and clearly sized 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.850
 here so that they come here in 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:39.420
 it's between the two of these planes is 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.390
 there is advance making their way from here by the leaders 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 you can even through 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.600
 the plank is folded the only way 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.790
 calculate the frame here 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.739
 stay 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.680
 free so now should pass and 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.170
 sit there that is the distance should 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.660
 even be a little less than I was about 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.000
 Novata freely went then another 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.390
 important element here in this is done 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.580
 surely cuts it for what if you 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.959
 buy offsets you need to transport 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.630
 his trap you will serve as a box 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.690
 transportation of layering and here it is 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.410
 propyl ie this propyl is obtained 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.150
 under this bar here it is 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.420
 vent if you don't 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.320
 do in your paradise or layering 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.440
 bring dead i brought these 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.739
 here are traps with such cuts 8 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.170
 lay in my 250 kilometers 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:45.060
 carried alive healthy everything is fine 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:47.959
 then another cover is made like this 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.070
 the american version is just taken dvp 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.850
 nailed on both sides here are such 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:56.299
 kris plans are bent straight through 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.420
 the trap closes it so you're on 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.700
 fastens 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.950
 that is, it turns out exactly 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.609
 wrapped herself here with screws 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:10.079
 mounted three places or tails and 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:12.390
 you can still from the sides in there screw 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.450
 here this box is transportable 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.239
 the bees in it will not die and the frame and 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:22.470
 if you do not fix if you taps framework 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.090
 take the plank less with you 4 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.520
 frames and here's the slat 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.710
 screwed screws so that they 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.770
 moved and the whole system that is 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.479
 can hold 4 or 5 frames if 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.850
 put in the forest 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:40.229
 this trap well in general then cover it 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.150
 you need here you can not film 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.360
 cover if you're standing on the Christmas tree on 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.910
 good it practically it does not get wet 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:52.440
 mentally birch there can we experience well 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:56.160
 another important element here is whether such notches 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.440
 points done here and more than 8 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.660
 I drank a few millimeters here 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.960
 a little more so there are not hornets 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.510
 Chela slaughtered with the uterus and done 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.389
 here is such a rotary thing in this 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.250
 position on hangs on a tree when 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.590
 bees be shot like this 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.660
 put there a little bit there 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.300
 nail or screws boat i mean you 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.690
 closed completely mystical can be removed 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.139
 hang thats the whole trap that is 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.150
 traps 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:29.639
 buy sheet hardboard can be stamped already 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.150
 Now we need to do them and then we 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.010
 spring 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.000
 there will be no need to set traps 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.450
 buy people that is, make the initial 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.430
 install your bee water business to new 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.940
 meetings and go to the site homemade power 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:46.590
 here is the point ru 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:53.300
 subscribe to the channel will go out 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:53.300
