00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.550 
go right to the second episode it was
and<00:03:09.269> maybe<00:03:09.420> I'm<00:03:09.599> wrong<00:03:09.810> about<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.230> but<00:03:10.290> it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
and maybe I'm wrong about this but it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.809 
and maybe I'm wrong about this but it
was<00:03:10.680> weird<00:03:10.859> because<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.310> I<00:03:11.430> went<00:03:11.609> through<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
was weird because as I went through the

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.000 
was weird because as I went through the
episodes<00:03:12.239> you<00:03:13.049> could<00:03:13.230> see<00:03:13.409> like<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.709> was<00:03:13.829> first

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
episodes you could see like it was first

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.830 
episodes you could see like it was first
two<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.370> half<00:03:14.549> stars<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.209> then<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.599> dropped

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
two and a half stars and then it dropped

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.569 
two and a half stars and then it dropped
down<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.349> around<00:03:16.530> two<00:03:16.889> stars<00:03:17.190> per<00:03:17.430> episode

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
down to around two stars per episode

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.430 
down to around two stars per episode
then<00:03:18.209> it<00:03:18.299> went<00:03:18.389> up<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.629> like<00:03:18.780> three<00:03:19.019> stars<00:03:19.260> per

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
then it went up to like three stars per

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.479 
then it went up to like three stars per
episode<00:03:19.560> near<00:03:19.889> the<00:03:19.980> end<00:03:20.129> it<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.459> though

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
episode near the end it was as though

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.789 
episode near the end it was as though
there<00:03:21.150> was<00:03:21.269> this<00:03:21.419> arc<00:03:21.720> that<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.260> as<00:03:22.500> people

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
there was this arc that that as people

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.229 
there was this arc that that as people
were<00:03:23.040> getting<00:03:23.280> more<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.579> backstory<00:03:24.030> and

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
were getting more of the backstory and

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.900 
were getting more of the backstory and
seeing<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.079> this<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.910> transformative

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
seeing that this is a transformative

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.530 
seeing that this is a transformative
story<00:03:27.329> because<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.900> see<00:03:28.169> betrayal<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:29.099> see

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
story because you see betrayal you see

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.270 
story because you see betrayal you see
