and I thought well I would try it
because<00:03:09.790> all<00:03:09.969> those<00:03:10.180> shampoos<00:03:10.840> that<00:03:10.870> have

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
because all those shampoos that have

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.780 
because all those shampoos that have
that<00:03:11.530> in<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.799> are<00:03:11.919> so<00:03:12.129> expensive<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.579> got

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that in it are so expensive and I got

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.990 
that in it are so expensive and I got
also<00:03:16.090> got<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.900> set<00:03:17.379> with<00:03:17.650> keratin<00:03:18.190> in<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:18.970> I

also got a set with keratin in it so I

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.629
