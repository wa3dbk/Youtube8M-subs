00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.699
 Hey, people. Good galley. Firmness. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.580
 today is another day of production but I think 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.230
 that before stepping on the meal aims to 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.599
 You think it is better on a full stomach in 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.449
 beauty of the guard who enjoys back to 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.449
 Valer is a good fame show. 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.590
 the van was at hand 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.520
 ae 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:01:05.740
 the police arrived in the bay to solve 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:10.539
 I'm not going to have anyone for you. 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.539
 will have to make a surprise 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.100
 not going to do not just make people go 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.830
 fine 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 Here, then, let's do the 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.799
 parts will be able to debate gogÃ³ 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.569
 so guys because you have 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.240
 Left, I'm your car on then. 

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:35.090
 flashlight connected to people used too much 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.330
 the battery charge she was already pretty 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.330
 So we need to renew that burden. 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.929
 and one of the ways we do it 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:48.049
 is to suck some of the electricity from 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.850
 a car that has a strong battery from there 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.920
 the name and pacifier 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.479
 Ok, that's what we're going to do with 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.820
 these entrepreneurs through our 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.100
 joking here my car would be with 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.570
 the good charge his battery put in the mouth 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.820
 and anderson's car fleet with 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.670
 weakest discharged battery 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.530
 so this car here is going to feed the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.109
 that car there if we 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.840
 play a battery in parallel with another 

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:14.120
 battery pack the harder the paper 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.850
 effectively from a battery and the battery 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.730
 weaker is playing the role of a receiver 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.829
 then this guy stops being a battery 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.780
 to supply power and starts to receive 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.640
 energy to be loaded with a 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.410
 rechargeable battery you have been making 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.140
 Why did you go on taking her? 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.209
 recharge here has all been taken is 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.980
 the battery of this car and who does the paper 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.260
 of the recharged daughter is the battery of this 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.150
 good car for us to do the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.609
 parallel connection that I have to 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.160
 to do is to connect the positive one 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:45.680
 unites the positive is important that the two 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.639
 cars at first 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.739
 off 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:52.870
 Come on, it 's very easy to identify the point 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.870
 positive I have not too much 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.560
 I put it in a battery 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.400
 I put it in the other one 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.970
 now I'll call in the negative apolo 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.420
 Do not give me - I put a 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.420
 drums 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.380
 I put it on the street now, what's next? 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.150
 step 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.180
 I'm going to the car that has a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.000
 strong battery it party car 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.270
 I'll step on the accelerator. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.060
 car that has low battery power and 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.840
 Tell me the key with what goes 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.050
 to happen 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.720
 the weak battery it will suck energy 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.209
 of the strong battery and this amount of 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.030
 load it stores up to me 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.800
 reach an electrician in my 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.990
 presidency of my confidence and 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.560
 solve as the problem 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.590
 But you have some plans that 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.090
 You must obey a thing that is you. 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.830
 you have to be careful with a version 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.380
 they say which car you call first 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.390
 with the famous afterwards we can not 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.620
 experience can not now 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.930
 have a joke 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.709
 the two cars are past maximum 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.180
 on the battery 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.370
 however nobody will carry anyone 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.620
 cool we can not call the calls 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.630
 Now one thing we can do is 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.820
 only take great care to do is not 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:16.370
 let the cars down cid scala 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.560
 have especially if it is leaning 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.570
 If you are guilty you can close a 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.460
 circuit and some kind of 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.690
 short circuit and damage the car 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.370
 accelerates how it is 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.320
 then the pacifier process is 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:29.480
 interesting because a battery 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.760
 stronger to behave effectively 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.169
 as a generator and the weakest battery 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.240
 behave like a receiver 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.010
 cool, the last thing you wanted to do 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.870
 It is to take a battery shopping season 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.950
 that has not stopped beating but I think it gave 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.080
 okay right 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.169
 legally in the next little video 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.169
