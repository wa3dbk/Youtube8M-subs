00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 finally a wolf in the Vosges according to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.120
 analyzes done is confirmed 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.550
 there would not only be a wolf in 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.630
 the massif but also a female 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.790
 potentially a pack could so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.540
 soon be formed of course what a 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.949
 worry breeders all reading title 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.029
 on the Vosges massif the breeders of 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.070
 sheep have not finished worrying 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.750
 according to analyzes carried out by a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 Grenoble laboratory there would be no 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
 only a wolf in the vosges 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.970
 knew but also a wolf that what 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.529
 means that we have therefore 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.510
 potentially a couple in the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.980
 vosges and maybe so a pack of jeans 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 small cola stone and thierry gallet of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.460
 recent sample analyzes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.870
 of urine proves that one of the two wolves 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.850
 who attack the flocks of sheep 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.309
 for over a year in the eastern Vosges 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.660
 a female wolf 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.250
 today genetics has sliced ​​this 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.230
 well a female who joined our evil 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.480
 so why from wolves to be 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.500
 together in January-February February 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 it is the reproduction period 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 so maybe if these two wolves 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.210
 was sexually mature well they 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.800
 are found to be able and well 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.800
 put together and form a couple 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 anthony kohler is an animator at the park 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.220
 Holy Cross 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.380
 he studies the big predators the lynx 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.450
 and the wolf the presence of a pack of 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.430
 big canid in the massive must according to 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 enable it to be put in place in 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 of an area of ​​permanent presence 

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:22.680
 and therefore well settled on massy of 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.810
 Vosges and today 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.450
 well we will set up there exists 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.640
 already a departmental monitoring committee in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.750
 done on the wolf but the logic 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.430
 would also like to commit years because we 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.360
 call the wolf network the wolf network 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.180
 what is a network of volunteers 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.680
 who will be there to assist and well 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.420
 the National Office for Hunting and 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 wildlife in the daily monitoring of 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.950
 the species that will be able to determine if 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 a sheep was killed and well by 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.340
 a taste if ever the deer we have 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.689
 found such a place and was killed well 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.909
 by a wolf these are people who will be 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.430
 trained and good at identifying clues 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.409
 presence of the animal the question that 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.509
 is asked today is whether 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.009
 this couple has reproduced and if in 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.390
 a few months we can see in the 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.390
 massive cubs
