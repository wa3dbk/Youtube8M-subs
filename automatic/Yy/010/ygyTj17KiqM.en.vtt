and<00:00:51.870> panoramic<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.070> don't<00:00:53.789> think<00:00:54.030> writers<00:00:54.239> are

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and panoramic I don't think writers are

smarter<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:54.960> other<00:00:55.140> people<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.829> think<00:00:56.100> they

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
smarter than other people I think they

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.439 
smarter than other people I think they
may<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.520> more<00:00:56.760> compelling<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.420> their

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
may be more compelling in their
