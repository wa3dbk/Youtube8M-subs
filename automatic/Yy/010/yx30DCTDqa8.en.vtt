wide<00:02:14.610> tooth<00:02:14.640> comb<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.630> sometimes<00:02:16.290> I'll<00:02:16.560> use

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
wide tooth comb and sometimes I'll use

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.340 
wide tooth comb and sometimes I'll use
my<00:02:17.190> Denman<00:02:17.640> brush<00:02:17.670> just<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.660> smooth<00:02:19.110> it

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
my Denman brush just to really smooth it

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:35.020

out<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.800> get<00:02:20.040> most<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.670> tangles<00:02:21.150> out

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.180 

then<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.209> twist<00:02:36.270> up<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.870> section<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.620> move<00:02:37.860> on

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
then I twist up the section and move on

00:02:38.190 --> 00:03:18.770 
then I twist up the section and move on
to<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.550> next<00:03:16.820> even<00:03:17.820> though<00:03:17.970> I'm<00:03:18.269> lightly

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.560 
to the next even though I'm lightly
finger<00:03:19.170> detangling<00:03:19.739> sometimes<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:20.850> come

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
finger detangling sometimes I do come

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.470 
finger detangling sometimes I do come
across<00:03:21.959> like<00:03:22.290> some<00:03:22.620> super<00:03:23.130> knots<00:03:23.370> like<00:03:24.120> this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
across like some super knots like this

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.590 
across like some super knots like this
one<00:03:24.810> that<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.550> really<00:03:26.970> take<00:03:27.239> my<00:03:27.390> time

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
one that I have to really take my time

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.040 
one that I have to really take my time
to<00:03:27.930> get<00:03:28.140> out<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:29.519> as<00:03:29.730> you<00:03:29.940> see<00:03:30.180> here<00:03:30.209> I'm<00:03:30.690> adding

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
to get out so as you see here I'm adding

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.130 
to get out so as you see here I'm adding
more<00:03:31.470> coconut<00:03:32.070> oil<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.580> that<00:03:32.760> specific<00:03:33.510> tangle

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
more coconut oil to that specific tangle

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.500 
more coconut oil to that specific tangle
so<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:34.709> could<00:03:35.040> give<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.370> some<00:03:35.610> slip<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.329> make

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
so I could give it some slip to make

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.860 
so I could give it some slip to make
sure<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.780> get<00:03:37.170> it<00:03:37.200> out<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:38.120> gently<00:03:39.120> tugging<00:03:39.510> on
