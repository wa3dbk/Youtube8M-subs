bracing going but the difficult part is
I<00:02:28.940> think<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.269> lot<00:02:29.299> of<00:02:29.420> them<00:02:29.569> don't<00:02:29.660> understand

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
I think a lot of them don't understand

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.319 
I think a lot of them don't understand
the<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.400> things<00:02:31.609> that<00:02:31.730> happen<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.150> racing

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
the the things that happen in the racing

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.180 
the the things that happen in the racing
game<00:02:32.540> as<00:02:32.720> far<00:02:32.930> as<00:02:33.049> the<00:02:33.200> ups<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.709> downs<00:02:33.799> so<00:02:34.069> it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
game as far as the ups and downs so it's

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.650 
game as far as the ups and downs so it's
difficult<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.700> deal<00:02:34.880> when<00:02:35.390> you're<00:02:35.480> training

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
difficult to deal when you're training

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.410 
difficult to deal when you're training
for<00:02:35.780> these<00:02:36.079> big<00:02:36.290> partnership<00:02:36.769> groups<00:02:37.420> of

got great and loyal owners I've had some
success<00:03:21.320> in<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.560> game<00:03:21.740> but<00:03:22.730> it's<00:03:22.910> the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
success in the game but it's the

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.490 
success in the game but it's the
uncertainty<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.600> what's<00:03:23.840> going<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.080> happen<00:03:24.410> in

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
uncertainty of what's going to happen in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.370 
uncertainty of what's going to happen in
racing<00:03:25.030> when<00:03:26.030> are<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.570> VLTs<00:03:26.930> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.200> come<00:03:27.350> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
racing when are the VLTs going to come a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.690 
racing when are the VLTs going to come a
type<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.770> up<00:03:27.830> and<00:03:28.720> when<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.680> OTV<00:03:30.980> situation

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
type it up and when is the OTV situation

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.310 
type it up and when is the OTV situation
and<00:03:31.880> you're<00:03:32.090> going<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.360> get<00:03:32.510> clarified<00:03:33.050> and

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
and you're going to get clarified and

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.980 
and you're going to get clarified and
also<00:03:33.980> there's<00:03:34.160> the<00:03:34.310> national<00:03:34.730> economy<00:03:35.000> racing

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
also there's the national economy racing

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.720 
also there's the national economy racing
is<00:03:36.080> down<00:03:36.260> all<00:03:36.440> over<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.070> handle<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.550> down

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
is down all over the handle is down

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.290 
is down all over the handle is down
nationally<00:03:38.390> so<00:03:39.080> there<00:03:39.230> is<00:03:39.350> some<00:03:39.560> certainty

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 
nationally so there is some certainty

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.150 
nationally so there is some certainty
I'm<00:03:41.300> very<00:03:41.360> optimistic<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.530> things<00:03:42.590> will<00:03:43.010> get

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
I'm very optimistic that things will get

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.370 
I'm very optimistic that things will get
corrected<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.330> i<00:03:44.390> think<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:45.140> know<00:03:45.200> I've<00:03:45.350> got

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
corrected but i think you know I've got

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.110 
corrected but i think you know I've got
20<00:03:45.890> more<00:03:45.980> years<00:03:46.040> ago<00:03:46.430> in<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.610> game<00:03:46.820> hopefully

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
20 more years ago in the game hopefully

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.720 
20 more years ago in the game hopefully
and<00:03:47.570> I've<00:03:48.350> got<00:03:48.530> a<00:03:48.560> couple<00:03:48.800> of<00:03:48.950> kids<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.520> I
