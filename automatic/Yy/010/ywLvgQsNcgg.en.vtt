I<00:00:00.089> will<00:00:01.020> now<00:00:01.140> demonstrate<00:00:01.170> this<00:00:01.829> steering<00:00:02.220> as

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
I will now demonstrate this steering as

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.970 
I will now demonstrate this steering as
you<00:00:03.060> can<00:00:03.210> tell<00:00:03.449> I've<00:00:03.689> got<00:00:03.929> the<00:00:04.140> the<00:00:04.500> bot<00:00:04.710> on

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
you can tell I've got the the bot on

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.760 
you can tell I've got the the bot on
stilts<00:00:06.109> that<00:00:07.109> way<00:00:07.230> you're<00:00:07.410> going<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.560> be<00:00:07.680> able

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
stilts that way you're going to be able

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.120 
stilts that way you're going to be able
to<00:00:07.919> feel<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.220> see<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> wheels<00:00:08.940> turn<00:00:09.330> because

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
to feel to see the wheels turn because

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.470 
to feel to see the wheels turn because
as<00:00:11.130> you'll<00:00:11.340> tell<00:00:11.490> them<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.880> few<00:00:12.090> moments

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
as you'll tell them just a few moments

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.810 
as you'll tell them just a few moments
it<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.290> bit<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.650> a<00:00:13.710> different<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.340> unique

these two air shocks and now you'll get
to<00:00:35.670> see<00:00:35.850> its<00:00:36.000> fear<00:00:36.649> again<00:00:37.649> fear<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.520> very<00:00:38.730> very

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to see its fear again fear is very very

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080 
to see its fear again fear is very very
slowly<00:00:39.420> because<00:00:39.809> I've<00:00:40.110> got<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> gear<00:00:41.640> reduction

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
slowly because I've got a gear reduction

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.920 
slowly because I've got a gear reduction
of<00:00:42.180> about<00:00:43.430> seventy<00:00:44.430> eight<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.059> give<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
of about seventy eight to one give it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.540 
of about seventy eight to one give it
safe<00:00:46.140> haven't<00:00:46.590> done<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.770> calculations<00:00:47.399> but

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
safe haven't done the calculations but

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.490 
safe haven't done the calculations but
as<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.940> tell<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:51.480> wheels<00:00:51.690> are<00:00:52.020> pivoting

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
as you can tell the wheels are pivoting

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.819 
as you can tell the wheels are pivoting
in<00:00:52.739> towards<00:00:53.399> each<00:00:53.489> other<00:00:54.320> I'm<00:00:55.320> going<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> pause

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
in towards each other I'm going to pause

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
in towards each other I'm going to pause
it<00:00:57.260> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.590> done<00:00:58.890> by<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.780> turntable

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
it that is all done by this turntable

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.960 
it that is all done by this turntable
piece<00:01:01.670> right<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.809> allows<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> motor

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
piece right here allows the the motor

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.190 
piece right here allows the the motor

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
drive train the main drive train to go

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.260 
drive train the main drive train to go
straight<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.880> part<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
straight through it this is part of the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
straight through it this is part of the
main<00:01:09.390> drive<00:01:09.600> train<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.840> also<00:01:10.229> spins<00:01:10.590> around

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
main drive train and also spins around

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.440 
main drive train and also spins around
this<00:01:11.369> gear<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> we're<00:01:14.880> moving<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> other

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
this gear so we're moving in the other

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.160 
this gear so we're moving in the other
direction<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.570> popped<00:01:18.930> one

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
direction and I think I just popped one

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.050 
direction and I think I just popped one
of<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.320> gears

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.020 

there<00:01:25.689> we<00:01:25.810> go<00:01:26.880> opening<00:01:27.880> up<00:01:29.520> until<00:01:30.520> I've<00:01:30.670> got<00:01:30.909> it

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
there we go opening up until I've got it

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.310 
there we go opening up until I've got it
on<00:01:31.119> stilts<00:01:31.570> actually<00:01:32.020> don't<00:01:32.200> have

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
on stilts actually don't have

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.080 
on stilts actually don't have
differentials<00:01:33.040> built<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.460> there<00:01:33.670> quite<00:01:34.060> yet

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
differentials built in there quite yet

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.389 
differentials built in there quite yet
and<00:01:34.960> that<00:01:35.289> would<00:01:35.439> make<00:01:35.619> it<00:01:35.649> very<00:01:35.860> difficult<00:01:36.070> to

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
and that would make it very difficult to

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:38.279 
and that would make it very difficult to
steer<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:37.000> way<00:01:37.240> because<00:01:37.509> as<00:01:37.780> you<00:01:37.899> can<00:01:37.990> tell

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
steer this way because as you can tell

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:41.100 
steer this way because as you can tell
one<00:01:39.159> wheel<00:01:39.520> is<00:01:39.700> going<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:39.909> be<00:01:40.000> moving<00:01:40.149> one

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
one wheel is going to be moving one

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.480 
one wheel is going to be moving one
direction<00:01:41.530> one<00:01:41.710> Mills<00:01:41.950> going<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.159> be<00:01:42.220> moving

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
direction one Mills going to be moving

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.210 
direction one Mills going to be moving
the<00:01:42.610> other<00:01:42.729> direction<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.420> if<00:01:44.229> you<00:01:45.039> don't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
the other direction and if you don't

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.179 
the other direction and if you don't
have<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.399> differential<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.380> twist<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.679> axle<00:01:48.070> to

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
have a differential is twist the axle to

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.210 
have a differential is twist the axle to
a<00:01:48.220> point<00:01:48.460> where<00:01:48.490> it<00:01:48.640> breaks<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.799> gives<00:01:51.070> the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
a point where it breaks this gives the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.270 
a point where it breaks this gives the
bot<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.549> ability<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.030> steer<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:53.740> precisely

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
bot the ability to steer very precisely

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.029 
bot the ability to steer very precisely
again<00:01:54.759> it<00:01:54.880> moves<00:01:55.060> very<00:01:55.119> very<00:01:55.450> slowly<00:01:55.750> because

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
again it moves very very slowly because

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.710 
again it moves very very slowly because
both<00:01:57.039> see<00:01:57.340> this<00:01:57.789> earrings<00:01:58.179> are<00:01:58.330> linked<00:01:58.630> with

around<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.790> central<00:02:34.360> axis<00:02:34.960> the<00:02:35.140> central

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
around the central axis the central

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.090 
around the central axis the central
drivetrain<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:37.180> gives<00:02:37.680> zero<00:02:38.680> added

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
drivetrain that gives zero added

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.890 
drivetrain that gives zero added
friction<00:02:39.610> when<00:02:39.820> steering<00:02:40.330> which<00:02:40.420> is<00:02:40.570> a<00:02:40.600> big

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
friction when steering which is a big

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.830 
friction when steering which is a big
bonus<00:02:41.170> especially<00:02:41.860> when<00:02:42.040> climbing<00:02:42.630> also<00:02:43.630> this

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
bonus especially when climbing also this

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.570 
bonus especially when climbing also this
type<00:02:44.080> of<00:02:44.110> steering<00:02:44.620> gives<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.010> ability<00:02:45.100> to

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
type of steering gives the ability to

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.330 
type of steering gives the ability to
climb<00:02:45.970> by<00:02:46.810> steering<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.500> can<00:02:47.680> actually<00:02:48.040> push

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
climb by steering you can actually push

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.380 
climb by steering you can actually push
an<00:02:48.580> entire<00:02:48.880> wheel<00:02:49.260> over<00:02:50.260> an<00:02:50.710> obstacle<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:52.270> I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
an entire wheel over an obstacle and I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.990 
an entire wheel over an obstacle and I
can<00:02:52.570> demonstrate<00:02:52.690> climbing<00:02:53.410> just

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
can demonstrate climbing just

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000 
can demonstrate climbing just
momentarily
