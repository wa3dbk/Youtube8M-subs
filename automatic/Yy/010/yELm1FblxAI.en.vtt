00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
bind the slow motion to a key and that's

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.920 
bind the slow motion to a key and that's
like<00:00:54.670> basically<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.850> coolest<00:00:56.059> slow-mo<00:00:56.660> you

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.070 
the Tacoma um you know i'll explain that
in<00:02:31.989> a<00:02:32.110> minute<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.269> fight<00:02:34.930> like

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
in a minute so you you like fight like

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.539 
in a minute so you you like fight like
this<00:02:35.230> it's<00:02:35.590> cool<00:02:36.130> he's<00:02:36.819> cool<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.959> it<00:02:38.739> runs<00:02:39.340> out

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
this it's cool he's cool and it runs out

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.160 
this it's cool he's cool and it runs out
and<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.850> reloads<00:02:40.150> back<00:02:40.360> up<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.690> starts<00:02:40.810> out

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
and that reloads back up it starts out

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.880 
and that reloads back up it starts out
full<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.160> then<00:02:42.840> then<00:02:43.840> once<00:02:44.110> you've<00:02:44.380> used<00:02:44.739> it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
full but then then once you've used it

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.110 
full but then then once you've used it
up<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.280> bit<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.610> takes<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.880> while<00:02:45.970> to

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
up a little bit it takes a while to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.150 
up a little bit it takes a while to
recharge<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:46.840> then<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.380> goes<00:02:47.530> back<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.829> about

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
recharge and then it goes back to about

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.490 
recharge and then it goes back to about
halfway<00:02:48.430> there's<00:02:49.269> like<00:02:49.510> forty<00:02:49.870> percent<00:02:50.200> away

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
halfway there's like forty percent away

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.140 
halfway there's like forty percent away
something<00:02:50.739> like<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.250> but<00:02:51.609> you<00:02:51.790> can<00:02:51.940> change

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
something like that but you can change

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.699 
something like that but you can change
that<00:02:52.390> with<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.660> power<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.959> commands<00:02:53.290> i<00:02:53.530> will

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
that with the power of commands i will

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.130 
that with the power of commands i will

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
anyways so that's that now let's check

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.429 
anyways so that's that now let's check
out<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.060> commands<00:03:38.420> these<00:03:38.719> will<00:03:38.870> not<00:03:38.900> lag<00:03:39.260> as

00:03:39.429 --> 00:03:39.439 
out the commands these will not lag as

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.330 
out the commands these will not lag as
much<00:03:39.760> thankfully<00:03:40.989> alright<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.139> BTW<00:03:42.769> if<00:03:43.010> you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
much thankfully alright so BTW if you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.309 
much thankfully alright so BTW if you
write<00:03:43.519> BTW<00:03:43.969> that's<00:03:44.389> basically<00:03:44.780> the<00:03:44.900> bolt<00:03:45.109> time

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
write BTW that's basically the bolt time

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.619 
write BTW that's basically the bolt time
menu<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:46.129> can<00:03:46.159> change<00:03:46.579> the<00:03:46.730> drain<00:03:46.969> speed<00:03:47.359> to

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
menu you can change the drain speed to

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.460 
menu you can change the drain speed to
be<00:03:47.750> like<00:03:47.989> slower<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:48.950> let's<00:03:49.099> make<00:03:49.219> it<00:03:49.370> point<00:03:49.609> 1

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
be like slower so let's make it point 1

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.030 
be like slower so let's make it point 1
so<00:03:52.269> now<00:03:53.269> when<00:03:53.419> i<00:03:53.450> do<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.689> it<00:03:54.169> goes<00:03:54.379> down<00:03:54.620> much

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
so now when i do it it goes down much

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.080 
so now when i do it it goes down much
slower<00:03:55.340> if<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:55.970> couldn't<00:03:56.239> notice<00:03:57.909> will<00:03:58.909> make

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
slower if you couldn't notice will make

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:07.240 
slower if you couldn't notice will make
the<00:03:59.299> limit<00:03:59.859> bt<00:04:02.319> bt<00:04:04.180> max<00:04:05.180> for<00:04:05.450> store<00:04:06.069> will<00:04:07.069> make

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
the limit bt bt max for store will make

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.289 
the limit bt bt max for store will make
that<00:04:07.629> 100<00:04:09.069> so<00:04:10.069> now<00:04:10.219> it's<00:04:10.400> gonna<00:04:10.519> go<00:04:10.790> kind<00:04:11.269> of

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
that 100 so now it's gonna go kind of

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:14.440 
that 100 so now it's gonna go kind of
like<00:04:11.480> change<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:11.959> speed<00:04:12.169> it<00:04:12.319> goes<00:04:12.439> up<00:04:13.450> oops

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
like change the speed it goes up oops

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.740 
like change the speed it goes up oops
that's<00:04:14.780> cheats<00:04:15.169> I<00:04:15.379> didn't<00:04:15.680> okay<00:04:16.750> g5<00:04:17.750> BTW

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
that's cheats I didn't okay g5 BTW

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.620 
that's cheats I didn't okay g5 BTW
