00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.089 
with this crease that you made earlier
already<00:03:54.739> have<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:57.200> want<00:03:57.349> to<00:03:57.440> line<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.590> up<00:03:57.830> and

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:58.099 
already have you want to line it up and

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.729 
already have you want to line it up and
then<00:03:58.340> you<00:03:58.370> want<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.610> fold<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.120> like<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.739> so

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
then you want to fold it like that so

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.289 
then you want to fold it like that so
that<00:04:00.920> you<00:04:00.980> have<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.130> two<00:04:01.430> slots<00:04:01.790> for<00:04:02.480> hair

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
that you have the two slots for hair

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.460 
that you have the two slots for hair
okay<00:04:06.099> now<00:04:07.099> you're<00:04:07.340> going<00:04:07.519> to<00:04:07.580> make<00:04:08.290> 16<00:04:09.290> of

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
okay now you're going to make 16 of

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.789 
okay now you're going to make 16 of
these<00:04:09.590> total<00:04:10.630> and<00:04:14.260> all<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.440> doesn't<00:04:15.590> really

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
these total and all it doesn't really

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.030 
these total and all it doesn't really
matter<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.310> could<00:04:16.400> be<00:04:16.549> 14<00:04:17.090> 15<00:04:17.600> or<00:04:17.750> 16<00:04:18.079> but

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
matter it could be 14 15 or 16 but

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.150 
matter it could be 14 15 or 16 but
personally<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.549> think<00:04:19.870> 16<00:04:20.870> makes<00:04:21.320> it<00:04:21.500> look<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
personally I think 16 makes it look the

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.560 
personally I think 16 makes it look the
best<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.610> fit<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:23.600> best<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:24.110> tight<00:04:24.410> it's<00:04:25.570> of

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
best and fit the best is tight it's of

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.710 
best and fit the best is tight it's of
it<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.490> we'll<00:04:28.639> just<00:04:28.669> 16<00:04:29.389> these<00:04:31.419> what<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.570> want
