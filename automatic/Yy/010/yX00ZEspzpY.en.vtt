00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149 

all<00:00:00.420> right<00:00:00.659> this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.079> circuit<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:01.829> made

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
all right this is a circuit that I made

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.670 
all right this is a circuit that I made
using<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.360> few<00:00:04.140> icy<00:00:04.560> chips<00:00:05.930> one<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.109> pulsar

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
using a few icy chips one of the pulsar

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.180 
using a few icy chips one of the pulsar
and<00:00:08.040> then<00:00:08.519> one<00:00:08.849> is<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.090> binary<00:00:09.389> counter<00:00:10.130> and<00:00:11.130> you

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and then one is a binary counter and you

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.099 
and then one is a binary counter and you
can<00:00:11.309> see<00:00:11.490> right<00:00:11.670> now<00:00:11.849> that<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.330> LEDs<00:00:12.809> are

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:15.109 
can see right now that the LEDs are

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.849 
can see right now that the LEDs are
counting<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.289> succession<00:00:18.380> they're<00:00:19.380> counting

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
counting in succession they're counting

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.790 
counting in succession they're counting
you<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.789> LEDs<00:00:24.210> are

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
you can see now that the LEDs are

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.439 
you can see now that the LEDs are
counting<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:26.010> binary<00:00:27.170> linear<00:00:28.170> form<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
counting in a binary linear form and the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
counting in a binary linear form and the
meter<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.279> showing<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.610> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
meter is just kind of showing you the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.959 
meter is just kind of showing you the
pulses<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.809> they're<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.110> sync<00:00:34.410> with<00:00:34.530> each

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:34.969 
pulses and how they're in sync with each

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.119 
pulses and how they're in sync with each
LED<00:00:35.969> flash<00:00:39.020> basically<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.590> do<00:00:40.950> with

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
LED flash basically what you can do with

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.560 
LED flash basically what you can do with
this<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:43.760> hook<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.879> up<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.149> something<00:00:45.180> that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this is hook it up to something that

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.240 
this is hook it up to something that
uses<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> DI<00:00:46.379> piece<00:00:46.770> which<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.860> 12<00:00:49.860> on

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
uses a DI piece which this is a 12 on

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.420 
uses a DI piece which this is a 12 on
and<00:00:50.850> off<00:00:51.079> 12<00:00:52.079> bit<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.620> guess<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.039> would<00:00:53.160> say<00:00:53.399> and

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
and off 12 bit I guess you would say and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.670 
and off 12 bit I guess you would say and
what<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.789> do<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.690> hook<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.530> up

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
what you can do with this is hook it up

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.039 
what you can do with this is hook it up
to<00:00:58.890> those<00:00:59.070> di<00:00:59.430> P<00:00:59.550> sockets<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> know<00:01:03.660> it's

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
to those di P sockets and you know it's

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.520 
to those di P sockets and you know it's
actually<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.830> going<00:01:05.040> through<00:01:05.189> every<00:01:05.760> code

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
actually just going through every code

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually just going through every code
possible<00:01:07.530> with<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.549> 12<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.600> di<00:01:09.869> piece<00:01:10.140> which

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
possible with a 12 bit di piece which

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.929 
possible with a 12 bit di piece which
and<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:10.890> see<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.310> can<00:01:11.490> turn<00:01:11.729> up<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
and you can see that you can turn up the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.719 
and you can see that you can turn up the
rate<00:01:13.159> a<00:01:15.409> good<00:01:16.409> application<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.340> can<00:01:17.549> think

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
rate a good application that I can think

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
rate a good application that I can think
of<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.659> uh<00:01:19.400> old<00:01:20.400> garage<00:01:21.390> door

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
of for this is uh old garage door

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.100 
of for this is uh old garage door
openers<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.920> use<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.759> IP<00:01:23.970> switches<00:01:24.600> in

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
openers they use the IP switches in

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.420 
openers they use the IP switches in
order<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.830> establish<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.970> kind<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> code<00:01:28.430> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
order to establish a kind of a code the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.359 
order to establish a kind of a code the
newer<00:01:29.670> ones<00:01:29.909> they<00:01:30.119> use<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> roll<00:01:30.689> through<00:01:31.369> code

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
newer ones they use a roll through code

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.010 
newer ones they use a roll through code
where<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> trillion<00:01:33.630> different

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
where there's like a trillion different

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.740 
where there's like a trillion different
codes<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:37.009> if<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.430> get<00:01:38.520> my<00:01:38.670> hands<00:01:39.090> on<00:01:39.299> an

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
codes but if I can get my hands on an

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.859 
codes but if I can get my hands on an
old<00:01:40.229> remote<00:01:40.710> I<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.909> an<00:01:42.119> old<00:01:42.299> one<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:42.720> it's

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
old remote I do have an old one but it's

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.510 
old remote I do have an old one but it's
only<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> nine<00:01:43.409> pin<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> it's<00:01:44.100> actually<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
only a nine pin and it's actually a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.109 
only a nine pin and it's actually a

single pole triple throw which I'm not

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.370 
single pole triple throw which I'm not
really<00:01:48.180> wanting<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.899> mess<00:01:49.110> around<00:01:49.229> with<00:01:49.880> but

it's<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.819> fairly<00:02:22.060> simple<00:02:22.360> circuit<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.230> can

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
it's a fairly simple circuit you can

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.410 
it's a fairly simple circuit you can
find<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.830> schematic<00:02:24.040> online<00:02:24.810> pretty<00:02:25.810> easily

I'm<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:28.750> in<00:02:28.930> need<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.680> a<00:02:31.230> remote<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.250> if

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
I'm just in need for a remote so if

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.130 
I'm just in need for a remote so if
anyone<00:02:33.640> watching<00:02:34.060> this<00:02:34.240> has<00:02:34.600> one<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.020> those

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
anyone watching this has one of those

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.380 
anyone watching this has one of those
remotes<00:02:35.620> that's<00:02:36.220> either<00:02:36.430> broken<00:02:36.880> or<00:02:37.270> they

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
remotes that's either broken or they

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.150 
remotes that's either broken or they
don't<00:02:37.600> use<00:02:37.990> or<00:02:38.470> they<00:02:38.590> know<00:02:38.709> where<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:38.950> get<00:02:39.190> one

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
don't use or they know where to get one

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.380 
don't use or they know where to get one
because<00:02:42.160> they're<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:42.550> thirty<00:02:42.820> bucks<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.330> I

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
because they're like thirty bucks and I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.790 
because they're like thirty bucks and I
don't<00:02:43.570> really<00:02:43.780> feel<00:02:44.050> like<00:02:44.110> spending<00:02:44.590> any

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
don't really feel like spending any

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.580 
don't really feel like spending any
money<00:02:44.980> on<00:02:45.130> this<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.810> if<00:02:46.930> anyone<00:02:47.260> wants<00:02:47.440> to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
money on this but if anyone wants to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.970 
money on this but if anyone wants to
send<00:02:48.310> me<00:02:48.459> one<00:02:48.670> I'll<00:02:48.850> pay<00:02:49.030> for<00:02:49.090> shipping

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
send me one I'll pay for shipping
