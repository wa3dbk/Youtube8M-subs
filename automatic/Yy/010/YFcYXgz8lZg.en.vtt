00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
actually face the right target and it'll

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.890 
actually face the right target and it'll
also<00:02:48.459> route<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:48.970> target<00:02:49.269> for<00:02:49.390> two<00:02:49.510> seconds

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
also route the target for two seconds

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.800 
also route the target for two seconds
and<00:02:50.110> if<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:50.799> further<00:02:51.099> back<00:02:51.489> it<00:02:52.390> will<00:02:52.629> do

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
and if you're further back it will do

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.720 
and if you're further back it will do
more<00:02:52.989> damage<00:02:53.049> so<00:02:53.860> if<00:02:54.099> it<00:02:54.220> travels<00:02:54.579> further

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
it only has two charges of that what it

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.340 
it only has two charges of that what it
also<00:04:25.460> does<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:25.850> when<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:26.450> use<00:04:26.600> Chi<00:04:26.930> abilities

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
also does is when you use Chi abilities

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.250 
also does is when you use Chi abilities
like<00:04:27.710> Tiger<00:04:28.100> palm<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:29.300> has<00:04:29.480> a<00:04:29.510> chance<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:30.050> spawn

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
like Tiger palm it has a chance to spawn

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.670 
like Tiger palm it has a chance to spawn
a<00:04:30.320> tiger<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:31.040> spectral<00:04:31.520> tiger<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:33.350> will<00:04:33.500> come

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
a tiger a spectral tiger that will come

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.490 
a tiger a spectral tiger that will come
out<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.950> attack<00:04:34.840> your<00:04:35.840> current<00:04:36.170> target

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
out and attack your current target

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.630 
out and attack your current target
there's<00:04:36.980> one<00:04:37.190> I<00:04:37.400> think<00:04:38.150> they're<00:04:38.330> bugged<00:04:38.630> with

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
there's one I think they're bugged with

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.620 
there's one I think they're bugged with
the<00:04:40.640> target<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.090> means<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.390> they<00:04:41.480> don't

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
the target that means that they don't

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.190 
the target that means that they don't
actually<00:04:41.750> hit<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.350> target<00:04:42.380> dummies<00:04:44.200> so

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
actually hit the target dummies so

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.420 
actually hit the target dummies so
they're<00:04:45.440> just<00:04:45.560> gonna<00:04:45.680> keep<00:04:45.860> running<00:04:46.100> there

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
they're just gonna keep running there

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.110 
they're just gonna keep running there
but<00:04:47.360> how<00:04:47.930> they<00:04:48.080> work<00:04:48.320> is<00:04:48.940> they'll<00:04:49.940> hit<00:04:50.090> the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
but how they work is they'll hit the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.760 
but how they work is they'll hit the
target<00:04:50.510> dummy<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:50.870> if<00:04:51.020> you<00:04:51.110> put<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.380> statue<00:04:51.620> a

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
target dummy and if you put the statue a

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.300 
target dummy and if you put the statue a
little<00:04:51.980> further<00:04:53.380> they'll<00:04:54.380> do<00:04:54.530> more<00:04:54.710> damage<00:04:54.920> if

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
little further they'll do more damage if

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.070 
little further they'll do more damage if
they<00:04:55.790> run<00:04:56.030> if<00:04:56.270> they're<00:04:56.450> walking<00:04:56.600> for<00:04:56.960> more

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
they run if they're walking for more

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.740 
they run if they're walking for more
than<00:04:57.200> five<00:04:57.410> yards<00:04:57.880> they'll<00:04:58.880> get<00:04:59.030> lusted<00:04:59.480> into

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
than five yards they'll get lusted into

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.140 
than five yards they'll get lusted into
a<00:04:59.990> hundred<00:05:00.350> percent<00:05:00.410> more<00:05:00.740> damage<00:05:00.770> which<00:05:01.760> I've

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
a hundred percent more damage which I've

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.640 
a hundred percent more damage which I've
only<00:05:02.330> seen<00:05:02.630> them<00:05:02.780> do<00:05:02.900> about<00:05:03.170> a<00:05:03.200> thousand

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
only seen them do about a thousand

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.020 
only seen them do about a thousand
damage<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.040> I<00:05:04.070> don't<00:05:04.250> think<00:05:04.460> their<00:05:04.610> damage<00:05:04.910> is

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
damage so I don't think their damage is

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.720 
damage so I don't think their damage is
working<00:05:05.510> properly

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:06.730 
working properly

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.680 
working properly
and<00:05:08.050> for<00:05:09.050> the<00:05:09.170> last<00:05:09.470> thing<00:05:09.830> I'm<00:05:10.610> gonna<00:05:10.730> just

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
and for the last thing I'm gonna just

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.050 
and for the last thing I'm gonna just
talk<00:05:11.900> about<00:05:12.110> the<00:05:12.230> mastery<00:05:12.910> what<00:05:13.910> their

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:14.060 
talk about the mastery what their

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.690 
talk about the mastery what their
mastery<00:05:14.480> does<00:05:14.690> is<00:05:14.900> it's<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.440> chance<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:16.190> proc

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
mastery does is it's a chance to proc

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.720 
mastery does is it's a chance to proc
free<00:05:17.690> tiger<00:05:18.050> palm<00:05:18.230> or<00:05:18.470> blackout<00:05:19.100> kick<00:05:19.340> when
