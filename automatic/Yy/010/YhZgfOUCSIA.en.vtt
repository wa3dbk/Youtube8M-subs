stuff I don't hold the harmonica the
right<00:03:38.220> way<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.790> didn't<00:03:39.120> learn<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
right way because I didn't learn the

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.470 
right way because I didn't learn the
right<00:03:39.600> way<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:40.019> I<00:03:40.440> hold<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.160> harmonica<00:03:41.760> kind<00:03:42.390> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
right way I I hold the harmonica kind of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.690 
right way I I hold the harmonica kind of
with<00:03:42.600> my<00:03:42.750> right<00:03:42.959> hand<00:03:43.200> like<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.830> I<00:03:44.580> do

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
with my right hand like this and I do

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.009 
with my right hand like this and I do
this<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.780> cup<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.230> this<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.840> that's

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
this and I cup like this and that's

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.360 
this and I cup like this and that's
because<00:03:49.320> nobody<00:03:49.650> ever<00:03:49.799> taught<00:03:50.070> me<00:03:50.100> how<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
because nobody ever taught me how to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.250 
because nobody ever taught me how to
play<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.060> correct<00:03:51.360> way<00:03:51.510> which<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.080> would

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
play but the correct way which I would

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.830 
play but the correct way which I would
just<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.489> technique<00:03:54.180> is<00:03:54.360> a<00:03:54.390> good<00:03:54.600> thing

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
just I think technique is a good thing

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.840 
just I think technique is a good thing
so<00:03:55.080> if<00:03:55.170> I<00:03:55.290> was<00:03:55.470> starting<00:03:55.739> over<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.190> would<00:03:56.640> just

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
so if I was starting over I would just

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.270 
so if I was starting over I would just
learn<00:03:57.060> how<00:03:57.750> to<00:03:57.780> play<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.230> correct<00:03:58.470> way<00:03:58.739> which

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
learn how to play the correct way which

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
learn how to play the correct way which
is<00:03:59.430> you<00:03:59.459> take<00:03:59.610> your<00:03:59.880> left<00:04:00.150> hand<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.200> hold

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
is you take your left hand and you hold

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.920 
is you take your left hand and you hold
it<00:04:01.560> like<00:04:02.010> this<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:03.120> you're<00:04:03.390> gonna<00:04:03.570> make<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
letter C and you just push it in there

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.370
