but<00:02:11.530> I<00:02:11.560> ended<00:02:11.709> up<00:02:12.450> having<00:02:13.450> a<00:02:13.510> pretty<00:02:13.540> good

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
but I ended up having a pretty good

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
but I ended up having a pretty good
first<00:02:14.019> half<00:02:14.200> so<00:02:14.379> i<00:02:14.470> thought<00:02:14.650> either<00:02:15.430> sweat<00:02:16.390> out

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
first half so i thought either sweat out

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.289 
first half so i thought either sweat out
for<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.810> rest<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:18.000> most<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> games

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
for the rest of it most of the games

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.720 
for the rest of it most of the games
could<00:02:19.480> i<00:02:19.780> get<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.989> little<00:02:20.079> bit<00:02:20.290> shaky<00:02:20.730> towards

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
could i get a little bit shaky towards

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.280 
could i get a little bit shaky towards
the<00:02:21.819> end<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:22.090> be<00:02:22.150> honest<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:22.720> fun<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.019> a<00:02:23.110> few

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the end to be honest and fun with a few

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.460 
the end to be honest and fun with a few
shots<00:02:23.620> but<00:02:24.269> yes<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.950> can't<00:02:27.189> expect<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:27.579> Lee

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
shots but yes you can't expect to Lee

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.220
