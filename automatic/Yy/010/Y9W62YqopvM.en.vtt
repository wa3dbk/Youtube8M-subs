00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the dancing on top not as much for the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
power or the steps so what I was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.300 
power or the steps so what I was

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
thinking was how do you judge in a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
thinking was how do you judge in a
competition<00:01:09.110> style<00:01:10.610> or<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:12.600> down<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.320> how

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
competition style or that's down and how

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
competition style or that's down and how
would<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.520> judge<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:16.050> it's<00:01:16.200> almost

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
would you judge this well it's almost

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
would you judge this well it's almost
like<00:01:16.800> sometimes<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:17.970> point<00:01:18.440> it<00:01:19.440> could<00:01:19.619> be

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
like sometimes at this point it could be

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.480 
like sometimes at this point it could be
like<00:01:19.920> apples<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.430> oranges<00:01:22.040> some<00:01:23.040> people<00:01:23.340> have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
like apples and oranges some people have

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.990 
like apples and oranges some people have
a<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:24.680> great<00:01:25.680> idea<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:26.100> footwork<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
style and basics and then some other

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.590 
style and basics and then some other
people<00:01:29.700> have<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.830> great<00:01:31.910> background<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.390> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
people have a great background and just

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
people have a great background and just
understanding<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:35.520> know<00:01:35.640> more<00:01:36.060> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
understanding you know more the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.210 
understanding you know more the
difficult<00:01:36.660> music<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.229> power<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.770> problem

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
difficult music or power and the problem

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.029 
difficult music or power and the problem
is<00:01:41.399> is<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.210> battles<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.140> conversation

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
is is that in battles the conversation

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.880 
is is that in battles the conversation
is<00:01:44.190> lost<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.840> for<00:01:46.080> a<00:01:46.110> judge<00:01:46.410> it<00:01:46.590> makes<00:01:46.770> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
is lost so for a judge it makes it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.859 
is lost so for a judge it makes it
extremely<00:01:47.070> hard<00:01:47.580> because<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.660> people

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
extremely hard because you have people

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.700 
extremely hard because you have people
who<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:50.210> really<00:01:51.210> well<00:01:51.420> versed<00:01:51.690> in<00:01:51.840> one<00:01:52.170> aspect

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
most of the time and because that's been

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.570 
most of the time and because that's been
their<00:01:55.590> strong<00:01:55.830> point<00:01:56.100> they're<00:01:56.220> gonna<00:01:56.280> push

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580
