hi my name is Daniel I'm design at BMW I

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.339 
hi my name is Daniel I'm design at BMW I
and<00:00:24.590> today<00:00:25.430> I'm<00:00:25.550> looking<00:00:25.849> forward<00:00:26.090> to<00:00:26.349> meet

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.720 

our<00:00:33.680> accounts<00:00:34.160> have<00:00:34.280> deals<00:00:34.490> with<00:00:34.640> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
our accounts have deals with the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.400 
our accounts have deals with the
integration<00:00:35.240> of<00:00:35.300> immobility<00:00:35.810> into<00:00:36.290> the

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
integration of immobility into the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.530 
integration of immobility into the
ecosystem<00:00:36.650> of<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:37.160> city<00:00:37.370> at<00:00:37.970> the<00:00:38.000> same<00:00:38.300> time

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
ecosystem of the city at the same time

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.970 
ecosystem of the city at the same time
the<00:00:38.750> car<00:00:38.960> could<00:00:39.110> be<00:00:39.170> use<00:00:39.380> a<00:00:39.410> storage<00:00:39.950> device

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
the car could be use a storage device

the car could be use a storage device
for<00:00:40.520> electricity<00:00:40.850> we<00:00:41.690> think<00:00:41.990> that<00:00:42.200> the<00:00:42.530> next

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
for electricity we think that the next

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.070 
for electricity we think that the next
generation<00:00:42.890> of<00:00:43.550> human<00:00:43.940> mobility<00:00:44.090> will<00:00:44.960> be

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
generation of human mobility will be

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.770 
generation of human mobility will be
providing<00:00:45.560> a<00:00:45.650> service<00:00:45.920> instead<00:00:46.700> of<00:00:47.150> just

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
providing a service instead of just

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.440 
providing a service instead of just
selling<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:48.260> car<00:00:48.530> as<00:00:48.680> an<00:00:48.800> object<00:00:48.980> I<00:00:49.580> think<00:00:50.330> the

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
selling a car as an object I think the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.870 
selling a car as an object I think the
design<00:00:50.600> should<00:00:51.050> reflect<00:00:51.410> that<00:00:51.680> idea<00:00:52.070> because

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
design should reflect that idea because

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.610 
design should reflect that idea because
of<00:00:52.910> its<00:00:53.120> small<00:00:53.210> footprint<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.230> object<00:00:54.559> that

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
of its small footprint the object that

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.620 
of its small footprint the object that
we<00:00:54.770> created<00:00:55.160> could<00:00:55.400> fit<00:00:55.610> into<00:00:55.820> nearly<00:00:56.300> any

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 
we created could fit into nearly any

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.170 
we created could fit into nearly any
kind<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.140> urban<00:00:57.380> environment<00:00:57.920> what<00:00:58.880> we<00:00:59.030> like

about the under your eyes approach with

he<00:04:36.960> showed<00:04:37.200> me<00:04:37.230> different<00:04:37.490> aspects<00:04:38.490> and

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
he showed me different aspects and

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.690 
he showed me different aspects and
angles<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.570> perspectives<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.370> touch

angles and perspectives to the touch
wheel<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.240> got<00:04:42.900> me<00:04:43.050> a<00:04:43.080> bit<00:04:43.230> away<00:04:43.560> from<00:04:43.590> the

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
wheel and got me a bit away from the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.880 
wheel and got me a bit away from the
form<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.300> touch<00:04:45.510> wheel<00:04:45.840> into<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:46.530> cars

form of the touch wheel into the cars

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.140 
form of the touch wheel into the cars
and<00:04:47.280> hearing<00:04:51.800> our<00:04:52.800> desire<00:04:53.220> motivation<00:04:54.030> was

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
and hearing our desire motivation was

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.950 
and hearing our desire motivation was
very<00:04:54.420> simple<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.950> think<00:04:56.310> of<00:04:56.780> parking<00:04:57.780> car

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
very simple we think of parking car

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.340 
very simple we think of parking car
without<00:04:58.230> function<00:04:58.950> is<00:04:59.100> wasted<00:04:59.640> so<00:05:00.420> we<00:05:00.870> got<00:05:01.170> an

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
without function is wasted so we got an

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.430 
without function is wasted so we got an
idea<00:05:01.680> maybe<00:05:01.920> we<00:05:02.190> can<00:05:02.430> put<00:05:02.730> our<00:05:02.940> LED<00:05:03.600> display<00:05:04.170> on

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
idea maybe we can put our LED display on

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.010 
idea maybe we can put our LED display on
this<00:05:04.710> car<00:05:05.040> receiving<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.090> most<00:05:06.330> important

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020

are a lot of designers artists impelling
so<00:05:41.699> the<00:05:42.150> city<00:05:42.360> is<00:05:42.479> very<00:05:42.870> exciting<00:05:43.620> very<00:05:43.650> sexy

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639

and<00:05:44.880> very<00:05:45.530> colorful<00:05:46.530> so<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.850> think<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.449> car<00:05:48.720> in

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
and very colorful so I think the car in

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.710 
and very colorful so I think the car in
putting<00:05:49.169> should<00:05:49.350> be<00:05:49.500> colorful<00:05:50.040> so<00:05:50.760> I<00:05:51.120> tried<00:05:51.479> to

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
putting should be colorful so I tried to

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.379 
putting should be colorful so I tried to
create<00:05:52.080> a<00:05:52.470> car<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.070> small<00:05:53.400> car<00:05:53.610> for<00:05:53.850> two<00:05:54.030> people

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
create a car a small car for two people

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.070 
create a car a small car for two people
which<00:05:55.110> is<00:05:55.139> very<00:05:55.650> practical<00:05:55.949> in<00:05:56.340> Berlin<00:05:56.639> and

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
which is very practical in Berlin and

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.840 
which is very practical in Berlin and
use<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.320> lighter<00:05:58.560> with<00:05:58.800> structure<00:05:59.580> and<00:05:59.820> the

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
use the lighter with structure and the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.230 
use the lighter with structure and the
fabrics<00:06:00.750> things<00:06:01.050> going<00:06:01.979> to<00:06:02.190> try<00:06:02.760> some<00:06:03.000> new

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
fabrics things going to try some new

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.980 
fabrics things going to try some new
material<00:06:03.449> for<00:06:03.870> car<00:06:04.290> so<00:06:05.100> I<00:06:05.520> think<00:06:05.669> fabric<00:06:06.630> which

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
material for car so I think fabric which

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.980 
material for car so I think fabric which
is<00:06:07.020> very<00:06:07.680> flexible<00:06:07.979> soft<00:06:08.990> exchangeable

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
is very flexible soft exchangeable

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:12.710 
is very flexible soft exchangeable
washbowl<00:06:10.590> and<00:06:10.830> they're<00:06:11.520> very<00:06:11.669> friendly<00:06:12.360> to

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720
