00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:01.919
 Hello. 

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.359
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:04.359 --> 00:00:09.160
 This time, in the advanced edition of bass slap, 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.349
 I would like to introduce you to everyone. 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.390
 It is a common sense to a thumb-up for a Balinese slapper, 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.970
 I will try to introduce you for those who don't know, so please do it together. 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.630
 Although it says the way of thumping down, 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.220
 Isn't it usually an operation like a thumping? 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.830
 I'll put this thumb up like a pick. 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.800
 I feel down and up. 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.620
 16 minutes when I do this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.470
 Also the action that ... 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.500
 It feels like, I can play like a pick. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.320
 I have to get a bit nervous, 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.360
 I would like you to remember this again if you have time to spare. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.910
 Make sure you don't bend your thumb. 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.429
 I feel like I can not but go. 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:10.979
 Though there is individual difference, thumb is ... 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.990
 When you put your thumb up, if you use your index finger, there may be people who turn to the side with a great gunya. 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.749
 I may not notice it because I usually do not look at such places, 

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:23.699
 Is there anyone who turns your thumb when doing this? 

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:29.389
 I don't bend at all, but I think that those with a bent thumb are a good deal. 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:33.240
 It is easy to catch the thumb when you thumb up. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.220
 But when I talk about it like that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.959
 Everyone says, "That's not related to such a bow." 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:44.329
 But those people who don't care are usually the ones who are warped. 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:51.079
 I do not know the facts around that, but I personally feel better if the thumb is warped. 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.540
 So, those who have warped thumbs are facing you. I'm lucky. Yay. 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.990
 So let's do one phrase. 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.840
 A phrase that combines thumping down and up. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.789
 I used to introduce some videos before, but I will try for a moment. 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.750
 First, with this octave 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.319
 Let's say that the phrase "Don, Pin, Don, Pin, Don, Pin, Don, Pin". 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.250
 This simply mixes up with the thumping down. 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.950
 Then it becomes a triplet. 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.169
 "Don, Tak, Dong, Tak, Dong, Tak, Tung, Cum, Tak", 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.689
 "Don, Tak, Dong, Tak, Dong, Tak, Tung, Cum, Tak", 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.950
 "Don, Tak, Dong, Tak, Dong, Tak, Tung, Cum, Tak", 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.269
 "Don, Tak, Dong, Tak, Dong, Tak, Tung. 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.140
 It feels like. 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.750
 This kind of phrase has a bassist "Victor Wooten", though, 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.400
 I have no sense of brilliantness. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.879
 It is transcendent. It looks like an idiot. 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:55.849
 However, I do my best to practice because I love it, but 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.849
 It is the present condition that does not go well well. 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.490
 It feels like 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.290
 "Up, Up, Up, ..., Add". 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.879
 Please put up your mind and thumb up. 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.390
 I just want to introduce one more phrase if it is only this, but I would like to introduce one more phrase, 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.060
 The first is a phrase that involves the left hand hammering. 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.540
 Let's do it with one string. 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.280
 As it is good by opening 1 string normally, it is thumb down. 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.930
 And, hammering on the 4th fret. 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.680
 And, 4 frets (thumping) up. 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.359
 This one to three. One two three. 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.469
 One two three. With one two three. 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:45.040
 One two three. 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.040
 You repeat this quickly. 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.849
 So, change the strings more and more. 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.689
 The whole procedure is the same though. 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.139
 Hammer up from open and up. The procedure of opening, hammering and raising is the same. 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:10.139
 But just change the position you are holding ... 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.600
 If you do well, you will become addicted. 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.070
 No, I can only do it. 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.780
 It's like this, it's a thumb-up action. 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.880
 Please keep in mind a little bit and practice. 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.780
 One time, ・ ・ ・ When the need comes, it may be very effective. 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.540
 However, when you need a thumb-up, it usually doesn't come, so you don't have to practice. 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.400
 If you like, please practice. 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.860
 I practice because I like it. 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.750
 "Ayer, Ayer ...". 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.850
 It's like that. 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.440
 Besides, as a transcendent technique, it feels like a double pull 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:09.850
 There is a middle finger pull though. 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.630
 "Sum down, up, pull, pull" and "Sum down, up, pull, pull". 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.140
 I would like to explain if there is an opportunity for such behavior. 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.900
 I did not want to talk so much because I can not do it myself, 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.900
 I heard that kind of voice Chirahora, I tried a little bit. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.370
 If dissatisfaction comes out, it will be erased immediately. 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.620
 So, thumb up. Please try practice. 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.460
 goodbye.
