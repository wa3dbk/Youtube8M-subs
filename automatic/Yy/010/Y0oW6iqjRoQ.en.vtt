wires<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.170> out<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.470> back<00:00:31.679> here<00:00:33.200> now<00:00:34.200> what

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
wires come out of the back here now what

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.049 
wires come out of the back here now what
we've<00:00:35.130> done<00:00:35.660> is<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.870> put<00:00:36.899> an<00:00:37.860> inline<00:00:38.250> fuse<00:00:38.610> here

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
we've done is we put an inline fuse here

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.000 
we've done is we put an inline fuse here
that's<00:00:39.780> very<00:00:39.870> important<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> should<00:00:40.829> go

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
that's very important that should go

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.290 
that's very important that should go
between<00:00:41.190> your<00:00:41.550> battery<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> live

between your battery and the live
connection<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> flow<00:00:45.840> controller<00:00:48.350> I'm

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
connection to the flow controller I'm

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.630 
connection to the flow controller I'm
not<00:00:49.530> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> tell<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.039> about<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
not going to tell you about all the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
not going to tell you about all the
wires<00:00:50.850> here<00:00:51.210> because<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:52.079> might<00:00:52.289> vary<00:00:52.649> a

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
wires here because they might vary a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.380 
wires here because they might vary a
little<00:00:53.039> bit<00:00:53.219> flow<00:00:53.850> controllers<00:00:54.480> but

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
little bit flow controllers but

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.340 
little bit flow controllers but
instructions<00:00:57.390> you'll<00:00:57.629> get<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.079> them<00:00:58.199> are

instructions you'll get with them are
very<00:00:58.590> very<00:00:58.920> clear<00:00:59.629> no<00:01:00.629> doubt<00:01:00.870> about<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.260> if

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
very very clear no doubt about it if

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
very very clear no doubt about it if
you've<00:01:01.770> got<00:01:01.920> any<00:01:02.160> doubts<00:01:02.370> whatsoever<00:01:02.690> don't

now we've got it back it's already ass
up<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.610> running<00:01:15.590> there's<00:01:16.590> instructions

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
up and running there's instructions

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.179 
up and running there's instructions
they're<00:01:18.030> very<00:01:18.299> very<00:01:18.450> clear<00:01:18.890> now<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.070> we're

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
they're very very clear now what we're

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.160 
they're very very clear now what we're
going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.640> Mount<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.210> board<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
going to do is Mount this board the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.340 
going to do is Mount this board the
control<00:01:22.530> board<00:01:22.799> back<00:01:23.549> onto<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.180> tank<00:01:24.479> where

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
control board back onto the tank where

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.380 
control board back onto the tank where
it<00:01:25.439> was<00:01:25.619> before<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.030> we're<00:01:27.180> going<00:01:27.299> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it was before and then we're going to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.380 
it was before and then we're going to
calibrate<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.950> don't<00:01:29.909> be<00:01:30.000> scared<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
calibrate it it's don't be scared of

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.690 
calibrate it it's don't be scared of
that<00:01:30.450> there's<00:01:30.750> nothing<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.259> it<00:01:31.409> really<00:01:31.700> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
that there's nothing to it really I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
that there's nothing to it really I
think<00:01:33.090> my<00:01:33.329> son<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.659> do<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.020> though<00:01:34.200> because

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
think my son will do that though because

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.840 
think my son will do that though because
he's<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.829> buttons<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.369> we'll

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
he's good with buttons and we'll

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.170 
he's good with buttons and we'll
calibrate<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.450> our<00:01:37.170> system<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:38.180> the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
calibrate it to our system and the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.080 
calibrate it to our system and the
switch<00:01:39.420> you<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.810> here<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.670> required

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
switch you see here that was required

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.350 
switch you see here that was required
when<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.140> didn't<00:01:43.380> have<00:01:43.560> flow<00:01:44.340> controller<00:01:44.820> to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
when we didn't have flow controller to

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
when we didn't have flow controller to
switch<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> pump<00:01:45.930> on<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> off<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.159> course

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
switch the pump on and off but of course

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.249 
switch the pump on and off but of course
it<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.700> full<00:01:47.939> belt<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.899> his<00:01:49.049> flow

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it was going full belt now his flow

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.639 
it was going full belt now his flow
controller<00:01:49.710> should<00:01:50.130> act<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.540> switch<00:01:52.200> and

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
controller should act as a switch and

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
controller should act as a switch and
switch<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.579> pump<00:01:53.790> in<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.090> out<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:55.140> we

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
switch the pump in and out when we

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
switch the pump in and out when we
either<00:01:56.790> kink<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> pipe<00:01:57.799> at<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> end<00:01:59.509> of<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
either kink the pipe at the end of the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.840 
either kink the pipe at the end of the
brush<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:03.020> tap<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.170> course<00:02:04.850> that

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
brush or we have a tap of course that

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.600 
brush or we have a tap of course that
should<00:02:06.329> hopefully<00:02:06.979> switch<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.129> water<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
should hopefully switch the water on and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.249 
should hopefully switch the water on and
off<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.149> take<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.479> strain<00:02:09.720> off<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.020> pump

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
but now with the flow controller we'll

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.199 
but now with the flow controller we'll
have<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.400> lot<00:03:26.669> more<00:03:26.699> control<00:03:27.319> soon<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:29.209> we'll
