know<00:03:02.200> as<00:03:02.470> each<00:03:03.010> pipe<00:03:03.310> progresses<00:03:04.209> and<00:03:04.390> that's

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
know as each pipe progresses and that's

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.380 
know as each pipe progresses and that's
what<00:03:05.650> I'm<00:03:05.739> hoping<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.070> do<00:03:06.280> and<00:03:06.520> I'm<00:03:07.180> going<00:03:07.330> to

take everything through consideration

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.190 
take everything through consideration
and<00:03:09.040> work<00:03:09.370> hard<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:09.850> next<00:03:10.030> one<00:03:10.150> this<00:03:10.989> is
