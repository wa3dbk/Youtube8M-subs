00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.340 

I<00:00:47.690> can't<00:00:48.690> believe<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.170> little

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I can't believe this little

son-of-a-bitch

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.610 
son-of-a-bitch
now<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.970> is<00:00:51.150> about<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.600> hundred<00:00:52.020> thousandth

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
now this is about the hundred thousandth

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.400 
now this is about the hundred thousandth
time<00:00:52.830> that<00:00:53.580> I<00:00:53.610> have<00:00:54.000> revised<00:00:54.420> this<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
time that I have revised this thing and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.530 
time that I have revised this thing and
all<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> sudden<00:00:56.040> I<00:00:56.460> stumbled<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.060> to<00:00:57.240> some

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
all of a sudden I stumbled on to some

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.660 
all of a sudden I stumbled on to some
kind<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> fire<00:00:58.170> breather<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.770> time<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.190> have

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
kind of a fire breather this time I have

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
kind of a fire breather this time I have
been<00:01:00.000> playing<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:00.720> thing<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.050> totally

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
been playing with this thing I totally

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.830 
been playing with this thing I totally
revised<00:01:01.800> this<00:01:02.070> plexi<00:01:02.640> thing<00:01:02.880> one<00:01:03.540> more<00:01:03.780> time

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
revised this plexi thing one more time

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.820 
revised this plexi thing one more time
and<00:01:05.600> went<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> little<00:01:07.500> more<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.740> the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and went with a little more of the

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.000 
and went with a little more of the
Soldado<00:01:08.340> type<00:01:08.790> vibe<00:01:09.410> definitely<00:01:10.410> the<00:01:10.620> acid

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
Soldado type vibe definitely the acid

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.230 
Soldado type vibe definitely the acid
Donnell<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.750> mesa/boogie<00:01:14.240> rectifier

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
Donnell you know mesa/boogie rectifier

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.359 
Donnell you know mesa/boogie rectifier
they<00:01:15.420> all<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.869> same<00:01:15.900> three<00:01:16.500> gang<00:01:16.950> type

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
they all have the same three gang type

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
they all have the same three gang type
stages<00:01:17.940> so<00:01:18.390> I'm<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> didn't<00:01:19.229> come<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.410> with

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
stages so I'm not I didn't come up with

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.920 
stages so I'm not I didn't come up with
anything<00:01:19.830> new<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:22.530> just<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.690> last

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
anything new there but I just the last

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.410 
anything new there but I just the last
thing<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.200> did<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.470> put<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> resonance<00:01:26.420> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
thing I did is put a resonance the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.249 
thing I did is put a resonance the
resonance<00:01:29.509> control<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.690> there<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.080> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
resonance control in there and that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.680 
resonance control in there and that
resonance<00:01:31.860> thing<00:01:32.100> I'm<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> metal<00:01:33.479> player

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
resonance thing I'm not a metal player

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.810 
resonance thing I'm not a metal player
but<00:01:33.900> I'll<00:01:33.990> sometimes<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.310> fun<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> really

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
but I'll sometimes it's fun to really

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
but I'll sometimes it's fun to really
have<00:01:35.940> that<00:01:36.090> bottom<00:01:36.630> man<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.990> just<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
have that bottom man that just like

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.040 
have that bottom man that just like
shakes<00:01:38.070> you<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.580> just<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:38.910> crushing<00:01:39.600> bottom

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
shakes you and just as crushing bottom

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.010 
shakes you and just as crushing bottom
in<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.410> I<00:01:41.250> try<00:01:41.700> this<00:01:41.759> thing<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.509> upside<00:01:42.990> down

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
in and I try this thing it's upside down

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600 
in and I try this thing it's upside down
with<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.530> top<00:01:43.740> over<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> in

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
with the top over I just put it in

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.020 
with the top over I just put it in
because<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.570> resonance<00:01:45.960> control<00:01:47.030> really

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
because that resonance control really

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.419 
because that resonance control really
tailors<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:49.050> cabinet<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.679> mean<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.979> makes<00:01:50.190> a

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:50.429 
tailors to the cabinet I mean it makes a

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.669 
tailors to the cabinet I mean it makes a
big<00:01:50.670> difference<00:01:51.179> it's<00:01:52.020> really<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.410> depth

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
big difference it's really the depth

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.639 
big difference it's really the depth
control<00:01:53.160> versus<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.700> resonance<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.690> 5150<00:01:55.530> has

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
control versus of resonance the 5150 has

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.919 
control versus of resonance the 5150 has
a<00:01:55.679> resonance<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.460> an<00:01:56.580> active<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
a resonance it's an active this is a

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:01.279 
a resonance it's an active this is a
depth<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.679> it<00:01:58.920> is<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.729> active<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.990> really

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:01.289 
depth and it is not active but it really

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.700 
depth and it is not active but it really
I<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:02.399> testing<00:02:02.940> and<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.149> tested<00:02:03.539> on<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.660> 112<00:02:04.380> cab

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I was testing and I tested on a 112 cab

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859 
I was testing and I tested on a 112 cab
and<00:02:05.069> I<00:02:05.640> have<00:02:05.789> to<00:02:05.910> have<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> resonance<00:02:06.420> all<00:02:06.720> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and I have to have the resonance all the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.090 
and I have to have the resonance all the
way<00:02:06.990> down<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.380> when<00:02:07.470> you<00:02:07.530> turn<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
way down and when you turn it up a

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.420 
way down and when you turn it up a
little<00:02:08.280> more<00:02:09.500> then<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> really<00:02:11.009> sounds<00:02:11.400> like

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
little more then it really sounds like

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.160 
little more then it really sounds like
crap<00:02:11.790> there's<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.209> cab<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.600> brought<00:02:12.930> it<00:02:13.050> out

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
crap there's that cab I brought it out

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.770 
crap there's that cab I brought it out
here<00:02:13.200> through<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.650> 212<00:02:14.220> cab<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:15.330> doesn't

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
here through this 212 cab and it doesn't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.480 
here through this 212 cab and it doesn't
have<00:02:15.900> any<00:02:16.020> balls<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.680> way<00:02:16.890> down<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.340> you

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
have any balls all the way down but you

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.670 
have any balls all the way down but you
tuned<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.030> up<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.780> where<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.990> sounds<00:02:19.230> like<00:02:19.380> crap

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
tuned it up to where it sounds like crap

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.130 
tuned it up to where it sounds like crap
in<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> 112<00:02:20.550> cab<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.569> really<00:02:21.840> just

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
in that 112 cab and it really just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.600 
in that 112 cab and it really just
crushes<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:23.130> as<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> crusher<00:02:24.500> so<00:02:25.610> this

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
crushes it just as a crusher so this

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.370 
crushes it just as a crusher so this
thing<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.209> another<00:02:27.510> amazing<00:02:27.780> thing<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.230> I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
thing and another amazing thing and I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.260 
thing and another amazing thing and I
haven't<00:02:28.709> put<00:02:28.860> an<00:02:28.950> effects<00:02:29.280> loop<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.730> but

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
haven't put an effects loop in it but

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.050 
haven't put an effects loop in it but
even<00:02:30.900> with<00:02:31.050> no<00:02:31.260> effects<00:02:31.620> loop<00:02:31.880> which<00:02:32.880> I

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
even with no effects loop which I

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.160 
even with no effects loop which I
usually<00:02:33.450> hate<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.990> play<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.230> delay<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:36.170> some

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
usually hate to play a delay in some

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.260 
usually hate to play a delay in some
reason<00:02:37.680> it's<00:02:37.920> not<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.459> bad<00:02:38.700> I'm<00:02:39.060> actually

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
reason it's not so bad I'm actually

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.809 
reason it's not so bad I'm actually
playing<00:02:39.630> these<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.410> delay<00:02:40.920> pedal<00:02:41.160> right<00:02:41.520> into

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
playing these a delay pedal right into

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.210 
playing these a delay pedal right into
the<00:02:41.940> front<00:02:42.150> end<00:02:42.420> of<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:42.959> usually<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.920> just

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
the front end of it and usually I just

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.610 
the front end of it and usually I just
can't<00:02:44.459> stand<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.180> sound<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:46.170> over<00:02:46.980> driven

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
can't stand that sound of a over driven

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:59.280 
can't stand that sound of a over driven
delay<00:02:49.620> but<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.430> one's<00:02:50.670> not<00:02:50.730> so<00:02:51.030> bad

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.210 

and<00:03:00.290> then<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.560> really<00:03:00.770> makes<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.190> difference

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and then it really makes a difference

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.870 
and then it really makes a difference
you<00:03:01.640> can<00:03:01.850> tailor<00:03:02.420> it<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.570> the<00:03:03.340> that<00:03:04.340> residents

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
you can tailor it to the that residents

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.780 
you can tailor it to the that residents
kind<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.390> really<00:03:05.810> stepped<00:03:06.470> up<00:03:06.680> my<00:03:06.890> EQ<00:03:07.640> to

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
kind of a really stepped up my EQ to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.130 
kind of a really stepped up my EQ to
where<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:07.970> can<00:03:08.240> get<00:03:08.390> a<00:03:08.420> ton<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.870> different

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
where I can get a ton of different

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.650 
where I can get a ton of different
sounds<00:03:09.710> through<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.920> EQ<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:10.910> is<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.180> more<00:03:11.600> of

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
sounds through the EQ this is a more of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.510 
sounds through the EQ this is a more of
a<00:03:11.720> little<00:03:11.990> uh<00:03:12.110> Van<00:03:12.620> Halen<00:03:13.010> sound<00:03:13.280> with<00:03:13.490> a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
a little uh Van Halen sound with a

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.820 
a little uh Van Halen sound with a
little<00:03:13.910> bit<00:03:14.060> more<00:03:14.810> mids<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.410> there<00:03:15.590> but<00:03:15.740> you

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
little bit more mids in there but you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:28.400 
little bit more mids in there but you
can<00:03:15.860> suck<00:03:16.250> the<00:03:16.430> MS

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.400 

Thanks<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.580> makes<00:03:29.790> Pink's<00:03:30.270> harmonix<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.200> I

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
Thanks it makes Pink's harmonix just I

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.410 
Thanks it makes Pink's harmonix just I
mean<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.100> get<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> lot<00:03:32.520> of<00:03:32.550> high<00:03:32.790> gain<00:03:33.060> amps

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
mean you can get a lot of high gain amps

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.270 
mean you can get a lot of high gain amps
and<00:03:33.570> pinch<00:03:33.780> harmonics<00:03:34.260> are<00:03:34.410> easy<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.010> do<00:03:35.100> but

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
and pinch harmonics are easy to do but

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:56.320 
and pinch harmonics are easy to do but
there's<00:03:35.490> some<00:03:35.670> about<00:03:35.970> this<00:03:36.240> it's<00:03:36.480> really<00:03:36.870> fun

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.620 

I'll<00:03:57.330> suck<00:03:57.630> the<00:03:57.780> mids<00:03:58.050> a<00:03:58.260> little
