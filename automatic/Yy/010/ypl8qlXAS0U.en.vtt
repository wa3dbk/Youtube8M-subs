00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.580
 Silence in action the soldiers of the naval aviation squadron 3 from northern wood 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.580
 at the operation party land 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.640
 at six in the morning at the frigate schleswig-holstein 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.090
 In laborious manual work that is long since for his first 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.960
 Exploration flight prepared in the Gulf of Aden 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.949
 in an hour 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.380
 he is beating 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.150
 everyone is fighting for their job because in an emergency, things have to be done quickly 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.630
 safety from the air 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.700
 for shipping off the coast of Somalia 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.780
 Thousands of freighters pass the main road every year 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.220
 for the pirates 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.220
 it's a lucrative business 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.290
 it is about a lot of money and the hunger of the Somali people 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.870
 First and foremost, the atalanta mission is to ensure NN 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.890
 that the aid deliveries of the World Food Program for Somalia 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890
 safely arrive at their destination 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.960
 Data one man 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.010
 was recorded in the past few years shows that the pirate attacks ob 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.590
 had taken place in the early morning hours 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.870
 that is, the pirates are running out there every night during the night 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.590
 a of their home ports in northern Somalia mainly 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.380
 and then they can quasi in which the main trading partners 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.230
 Carbone surprisingly Andy they kept the morning when you least 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.230
 Brooks if you least expect it 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 No 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300
 Blogger 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.300
 the passage of the 700th 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.420
 who forced the on 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.729
 the next two hours the helicopter becomes the frigate's environment 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.650
 Search for suspects 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.270
 The pirates are mostly with small sketches or made of fiberglass 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.250
 on the road and therefore can not be seen on a radar screen 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.609
 but also from the air is difficult to recognize 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:07.650
 if it is pirates 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.650
 or just simple fishermen 

00:02:13.179 --> 00:02:16.469
 but no one has ever seen it in a boat and then immediately realized that it was 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:18.379
 plentiful 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.799
 are as we only notice 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.889
 Parrot on the shoulder or 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.379
 they are surprised 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.610
 the pooth here in the occasionally easy to pirate maybe some 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.289
 Smog could be connected 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:35.429
 Still, she's doing every morning in the air now in the monsoon season 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:38.130
 The pirates seem to take a break 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.130
 you can not rely on it 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.650
 but the weekly show has earned its break just so slowly 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.179
 even the comrades of the non-flying crews on their feet 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.429
 Breakfasted together 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.370
 Now it's time for the rest of the day 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.529
 because even if no further education needs land 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:07.979
 nevertheless, a helicopter had to spend the next twelve hours for one 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.049
 Use ready to be held 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.509
 if an emergency call comes it must go fast 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.609
 are the pirates is a man aboard a ship is no help anymore 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.609
 possible without endangering human lives 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.209
 we want to comply with that and Holcim in standby 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.349
 and the pilots the Finn crew as well and the mind all day long 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.699
 to the sunset 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.949
 Lord are in a readiness to be able to return at any time 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.949
 to be fast in the air and then possible pirate attacks 

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.479
 to be believed would be able or to provide help 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.989
 currently remains that they are already firmly lashed on the flight deck and the 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.709
 Team remains in motion 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.099
 In an emergency, the supply chain must be in the air within ten minutes 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.969
 his 

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:53.849
 Russia would be dubious we are at the moment 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.349
 pretty far to the east, which was heavily loaded in terms of content 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.609
 Tomorrow the day after tomorrow we will pit in the box to the west 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.169
 we continue with the Auern usually it is quieter in the reeds 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.579
 although just what insiders poor country 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.819
 but for the possibility that we have a bit more radioactivity 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.229
 comes to bear 

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:13.729
 to it too has 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.449
 That's why I believe 4 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.519
 This is given in a bathrobe, but this time with success 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.599
 Lutz Kunze in the afternoon service information and a free technique 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.729
 can save lives here off the coast of Somalia 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.610
 so it happens that the sailor 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.440
 but especially the technology sometimes needs tutoring 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.590
 and then there is the second attempt 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.120
 I hope for 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.760
 in our home base in North Wood Cam Fowler that will take then up 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.219
 last fulfilled then we have the cell 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:47.219
 Usually the providers they really are very good for the App Store 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:49.509
 and in need 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:53.259
 we also have the second storm with us that's Stefan Maierhofer 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.719
 make two do one what we and we do 

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:56.930
 because the hall is raging 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.900
 "Without soul" we only like to give Schober by name that is for old 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.900
 his helicopter the town hall is the Ijsselmeer 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:07.419
 most famous role I had adapted here bit measure 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.870
 and durchzusladen FÃ¼ssener painted 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.040
 two helicopters work for this beautiful Saxony and 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.860
 Helicopter crew close together 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.400
 and swap information permanently 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.909
 as percent image www Fyffes 12 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.909
 the report leads west 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.019
 with the sunset is also the federal working chamber of the index with 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:35.039
 It is sold on wings 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.229
 Tomorrow morning at 6 70 percent were able to complete reconnaissance flight 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.059
 for hunting for pirates in the Gulf of Aden 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.119
 off the Somali coast
