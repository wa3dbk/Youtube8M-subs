I<00:02:20.599> didn't<00:02:21.319> know<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.129> my<00:02:22.790> eye<00:02:22.819> device<00:02:23.360> is

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
I didn't know this so my eye device is

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.309 
I didn't know this so my eye device is
white<00:02:24.079> so<00:02:24.650> now<00:02:25.269> what<00:02:26.269> shows<00:02:26.480> up<00:02:26.689> will<00:02:26.930> be<00:02:27.109> white

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
white so now what shows up will be white

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.530 
white so now what shows up will be white
and<00:02:27.560> as<00:02:28.099> you<00:02:28.219> can<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.640> says<00:02:28.849> there's<00:02:29.359> an

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and as you can see it says there's an

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.660 
and as you can see it says there's an
airplay<00:02:29.900> server<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.439> there<00:02:30.620> so<00:02:31.250> if<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.459> come

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
airplay server right there so if I come

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.949 
airplay server right there so if I come
into<00:02:31.849> my<00:02:32.030> iPad<00:02:32.510> and<00:02:32.689> I<00:02:33.590> put<00:02:33.859> in<00:02:34.040> my<00:02:34.069> password

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.270 
you can see right there that is my eye
device<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:59.409> when<00:03:00.409> we<00:03:00.500> try<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.709> switch<00:03:01.040> this

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
device and when we try to switch this

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.039 
device and when we try to switch this
into<00:03:02.019> iPad<00:03:03.019> white<00:03:03.290> there<00:03:04.010> we<00:03:04.189> go<00:03:04.370> um<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.900> can

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
into iPad white there we go um you can

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.949 
into iPad white there we go um you can
switch<00:03:06.260> these<00:03:06.650> between<00:03:07.189> all<00:03:08.060> these<00:03:08.900> different

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
switch these between all these different

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.250 
switch these between all these different
models<00:03:09.650> which<00:03:09.829> i<00:03:10.040> think<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.310> really<00:03:10.459> cool<00:03:10.819> um

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
models which i think is really cool um

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.330 
models which i think is really cool um
so<00:03:12.260> this<00:03:12.379> is<00:03:12.560> an<00:03:12.680> iPad<00:03:12.919> a<00:03:12.980> fourth-generation

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so this is an iPad a fourth-generation

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.789 
so this is an iPad a fourth-generation
of<00:03:14.090> course<00:03:14.389> but<00:03:14.659> it<00:03:14.810> does<00:03:14.989> show<00:03:15.019> as<00:03:15.349> an<00:03:15.470> iPad

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
of course but it does show as an iPad

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.849 
of course but it does show as an iPad
air<00:03:16.129> let's<00:03:16.819> just<00:03:16.970> put<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.239> as<00:03:17.419> what<00:03:17.750> -<00:03:18.260> I've<00:03:18.590> had

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
air let's just put it as what - I've had

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.190 
air let's just put it as what - I've had
white<00:03:19.870> so<00:03:21.939> it<00:03:22.939> is<00:03:23.269> it<00:03:23.540> does<00:03:23.780> look<00:03:23.989> really

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
white so it is it does look really

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.710 
white so it is it does look really
smooth<00:03:24.590> actually<00:03:25.220> even<00:03:25.849> though<00:03:25.940> this<00:03:26.150> is<00:03:26.329> iOS

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
smooth actually even though this is iOS

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.080 
beta 1 I believe um so it does run
pretty<00:03:36.229> smoothly<00:03:36.620> without<00:03:37.040> beta<00:03:37.459> it<00:03:37.760> does<00:03:37.909> run

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
pretty smoothly without beta it does run

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:39.849 
pretty smoothly without beta it does run
a<00:03:38.150> bit<00:03:38.419> smoother<00:03:38.840> and<00:03:39.079> if<00:03:39.169> I<00:03:39.260> put<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.530> landscape

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
a bit smoother and if I put it landscape
