photosynthesis<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.399> process<00:00:02.550> by<00:00:03.240> which

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
photosynthesis is the process by which

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.030 
photosynthesis is the process by which
plants<00:00:04.650> a<00:00:04.859> guy<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:06.230> some<00:00:07.230> bacteria<00:00:07.740> use

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
plants a guy and some bacteria use

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.660 
plants a guy and some bacteria use
sunlight<00:00:08.580> carbon<00:00:09.269> dioxide<00:00:10.849> and<00:00:11.849> water<00:00:13.670> to
