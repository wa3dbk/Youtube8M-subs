00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.789 

okay<00:00:02.550> this<00:00:02.939> is<00:00:03.090> my<00:00:03.300> completed<00:00:04.020> longsword

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay this is my completed longsword

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.470 
okay this is my completed longsword
truck<00:00:05.990> it's<00:00:06.990> just<00:00:07.350> two<00:00:08.280> pieces<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.730> board<00:00:09.030> with

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
truck it's just two pieces of board with

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.330 
truck it's just two pieces of board with
the<00:00:09.690> same<00:00:09.900> pattern<00:00:10.320> cut<00:00:10.530> in<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.800> but<00:00:11.070> they're

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the same pattern cut in it but they're

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.810 
the same pattern cut in it but they're
flipped<00:00:12.210> opposite<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.349> then<00:00:14.280> has<00:00:14.610> these

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
flipped opposite and then has these

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.900 
flipped opposite and then has these
bolts<00:00:15.210> through<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.809> took<00:00:16.470> rubber<00:00:17.340> stoppers

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
bolts through it I took rubber stoppers

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.769 
bolts through it I took rubber stoppers
and<00:00:18.270> made<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> jig<00:00:20.180> with<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:22.070> step<00:00:23.070> bit<00:00:23.480> so<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> had

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
and made a jig with a step bit so I had

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.140 
and made a jig with a step bit so I had
a<00:00:24.810> diagonal<00:00:25.680> hole<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.460> stuffed<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.970> rubber

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
a diagonal hole and I stuffed a rubber

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300 
a diagonal hole and I stuffed a rubber
stopper<00:00:27.630> in<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.830> could<00:00:29.010> drill<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
stopper in there then I could drill a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.640 
stopper in there then I could drill a
Center<00:00:29.699> through<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> has<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.960> quarter

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
Center through that so it has a quarter

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.590 
Center through that so it has a quarter
inch<00:00:31.679> hole<00:00:32.160> drilled<00:00:33.149> through<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> rubber

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
inch hole drilled through the rubber

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.660 
inch hole drilled through the rubber
stoppers<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.579> then<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.969> used<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:37.050> think<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.890> 5/16

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
stoppers and then I used I think a 5/16

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
stoppers and then I used I think a 5/16
washer<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.780> quarter<00:00:40.170> inch<00:00:40.320> bolt<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.680> sit

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
washer but a quarter inch bolt in sit

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.990 
washer but a quarter inch bolt in sit
through<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:41.399> I<00:00:41.460> drilled<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> hole<00:00:41.850> through

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
through that so I drilled a hole through

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.080 
through that so I drilled a hole through
each<00:00:42.239> washer<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> metal<00:00:44.610> tip<00:00:44.850> at

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
each washer so there's a metal tip at

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.500 
each washer so there's a metal tip at
the<00:00:45.120> end<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.539> each<00:00:45.860> stopper<00:00:47.180> then<00:00:48.180> along<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the end of each stopper then along the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.060 
the end of each stopper then along the
back<00:00:48.660> side<00:00:48.690> there's<00:00:49.230> wingnut<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:49.920> can

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
back side there's wingnut so you can

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.260 
back side there's wingnut so you can
tighten<00:00:50.219> these<00:00:50.399> down<00:00:50.460> once<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.000> into

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
tighten these down once you get into

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.600 
tighten these down once you get into
position<00:00:51.739> the<00:00:52.739> whole<00:00:52.890> point<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.340> thing

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
position the whole point of this thing

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.479 
position the whole point of this thing
is<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.300> when<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> two<00:00:55.530> disks<00:00:56.129> are<00:00:56.250> turned

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
is that when the two disks are turned

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.240 
is that when the two disks are turned
opposite<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.239> each<00:00:57.360> other<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
opposite of each other you get a

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.150 
opposite of each other you get a
tightening<00:00:59.730> pattern<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.719> middle<00:01:01.160> which

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
tightening pattern in the middle which

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.050 
tightening pattern in the middle which
is<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.570> pretty<00:01:03.570> cool<00:01:04.640> it's<00:01:05.640> very<00:01:06.420> smooth<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
is a pretty cool it's very smooth the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840 
is a pretty cool it's very smooth the
friction<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.510> mean<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:10.080> sanded<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> 320

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
friction is I mean I I sanded it to 320

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.050 
friction is I mean I I sanded it to 320
grit<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:12.990> put<00:01:13.200> wax<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.890> both<00:01:14.369> sides<00:01:14.670> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
grit and then put wax on both sides of

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.050 
grit and then put wax on both sides of
the<00:01:15.270> two<00:01:15.479> disks<00:01:16.049> but<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> need<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.369> probably<00:01:17.520> wax

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the two disks but I need to probably wax

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.990 
the two disks but I need to probably wax
each<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> channels<00:01:19.490> to<00:01:20.490> get<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> little<00:01:20.909> bit

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
each of the channels to get a little bit

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330 
each of the channels to get a little bit
less<00:01:21.150> friction<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:22.409> would<00:01:22.530> also<00:01:22.650> help<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.250> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
less friction it would also help if I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.320 
less friction it would also help if I
had<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.840> washer<00:01:24.840> behind<00:01:25.200> each<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.860> these<00:01:26.330> rubber

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
had a washer behind each of these rubber

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.149 
had a washer behind each of these rubber
stoppers<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:28.560> tend<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> grab<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
stoppers because they tend to grab a

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
stoppers because they tend to grab a
little<00:01:29.400> bit<00:01:29.570> but<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.320> then<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
little bit but if I do that then the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.330 
little bit but if I do that then the
bowls<00:01:32.009> won't<00:01:32.460> sit<00:01:32.850> flat<00:01:33.150> against<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:34.159> at<00:01:35.159> any

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
bowls won't sit flat against it at any

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.280 
bowls won't sit flat against it at any
rate<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:36.560> actually<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:38.009> not<00:01:38.250> measured<00:01:38.820> this

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
rate I actually have not measured this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.340 
rate I actually have not measured this
but<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.380> looks<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:41.090> totally<00:01:42.090> open<00:01:45.110> I'll<00:01:46.110> be

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
but it looks like totally open I'll be

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.539 
but it looks like totally open I'll be
able<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:47.149> seven<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.299> three-quarter<00:01:48.810> inch

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
able to get seven and three-quarter inch

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.940 
able to get seven and three-quarter inch
diameter<00:01:51.140> really<00:01:52.140> pushing<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> in<00:01:52.649> there<00:01:52.770> more

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
diameter really pushing it in there more

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
diameter really pushing it in there more
like<00:01:53.070> seven<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> half<00:01:53.899> seven<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> half

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
like seven and a half seven and a half

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.380 
like seven and a half seven and a half
four<00:01:56.509> hundred<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:58.579> 195<00:01:59.579> centimeters<00:01:59.939> or

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
four hundred in 195 centimeters or

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.240 
four hundred in 195 centimeters or
millimeters<00:02:02.780> 195<00:02:03.780> millimeters<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:05.430> then

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
millimeters 195 millimeters and then

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.100 
millimeters 195 millimeters and then
the<00:02:06.820> tightest<00:02:09.600> at<00:02:10.600> least<00:02:10.840> in<00:02:10.990> this

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
the tightest at least in this

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.070 
the tightest at least in this
configuration<00:02:11.590> is<00:02:15.510> taking<00:02:16.510> about<00:02:16.630> four<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.050> a

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
configuration is taking about four and a

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.380 
configuration is taking about four and a
quarter<00:02:17.260> inches<00:02:17.850> however<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:19.150> notice<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
quarter inches however you notice that

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.740 
quarter inches however you notice that
these<00:02:22.390> every<00:02:23.230> opposite<00:02:24.180> channel<00:02:25.180> doesn't<00:02:25.480> go

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
these every opposite channel doesn't go

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.590 
these every opposite channel doesn't go
as<00:02:25.930> deep<00:02:26.200> as<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.710> ones<00:02:26.920> behind<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.390> so<00:02:28.510> if

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
as deep as the ones behind it and so if

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.480 
as deep as the ones behind it and so if
we<00:02:28.690> want<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:28.990> even<00:02:29.200> tighter<00:02:29.620> diameter<00:02:30.280> I

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
we want to get even tighter diameter I

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.840 
we want to get even tighter diameter I
can<00:02:31.150> just<00:02:31.330> take<00:02:31.570> out<00:02:31.780> every<00:02:32.440> opposite<00:02:32.950> one<00:02:33.160> and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
can just take out every opposite one and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.220 
can just take out every opposite one and
four<00:02:34.000> small<00:02:34.210> turnings<00:02:34.630> apparently<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.110> don't

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
four small turnings apparently you don't

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.680 
four small turnings apparently you don't
need<00:02:35.350> that<00:02:35.440> much<00:02:35.590> gripping<00:02:35.980> force<00:02:36.160> anyhow<00:02:36.690> so

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
need that much gripping force anyhow so

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.920 
need that much gripping force anyhow so
I<00:02:38.110> haven't<00:02:38.500> measured<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.040> one<00:02:39.220> either<00:02:39.930> which

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
I haven't measured that one either which

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.360 
I haven't measured that one either which
should<00:02:41.200> be<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.560> distance<00:02:42.010> between<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
should be this distance between the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.620 
should be this distance between the
grooves<00:02:42.580> which<00:02:42.820> looks<00:02:42.970> like<00:02:43.090> about<00:02:43.330> three<00:02:43.570> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
grooves which looks like about three and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.630 
grooves which looks like about three and
a<00:02:43.690> half<00:02:43.720> punches<00:02:44.280> actually<00:02:45.280> will<00:02:45.370> be<00:02:45.400> a<00:02:45.460> little

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
a half punches actually will be a little

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.570 
a half punches actually will be a little
bit<00:02:45.730> shy<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.330> because<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.260> rubber<00:02:47.550> has<00:02:48.550> a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
bit shy of that because the rubber has a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.760 
bit shy of that because the rubber has a
dimension<00:02:48.880> on<00:02:49.120> its<00:02:49.270> own<00:02:49.450> so<00:02:49.750> I<00:02:50.020> think<00:02:50.350> I'll<00:02:50.650> be

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
dimension on its own so I think I'll be

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.940 
dimension on its own so I think I'll be
able<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.950> get<00:02:51.100> about<00:02:51.400> three<00:02:52.180> inch<00:02:52.390> diameter<00:02:52.950> at

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
able to get about three inch diameter at

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.790 
able to get about three inch diameter at
the<00:02:54.100> smallest<00:02:54.990> then<00:02:55.990> finally<00:02:56.410> the<00:02:56.530> way<00:02:56.650> this

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
the smallest then finally the way this

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.200 
the smallest then finally the way this
thing<00:02:57.010> works<00:02:57.190> if<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.580> take<00:02:57.790> my<00:02:57.970> first<00:02:58.780> bolt<00:02:59.410> here

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
thing works if I take my first bolt here

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:08.610 
thing works if I take my first bolt here
and<00:03:01.210> put<00:03:01.480> it<00:03:01.570> in<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.940> like<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.590> so<00:03:08.590> I

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
and put it in here just like that so I

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.360 
and put it in here just like that so I
can<00:03:09.060> turn<00:03:10.060> this<00:03:10.239> tight<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.870> then<00:03:11.709> tighten<00:03:12.310> up

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
can turn this tight and then tighten up

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.520 
can turn this tight and then tighten up
the<00:03:12.520> wing<00:03:12.670> nuts<00:03:12.880> behind<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.630> it<00:03:14.110> will<00:03:14.230> hold<00:03:14.380> it

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
the wing nuts behind and it will hold it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.640 
the wing nuts behind and it will hold it
in<00:03:14.590> place<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.180> can<00:03:16.360> go<00:03:16.510> in<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.110> turn

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
in place and I can go in here and turn

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.270 
in place and I can go in here and turn
off<00:03:17.920> the<00:03:18.489> back<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:20.380> that's<00:03:20.680> how<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:20.980> thing

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
off the back so that's how the thing

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.430 
off the back so that's how the thing
works
