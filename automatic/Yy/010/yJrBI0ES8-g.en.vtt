either way that is quite a bit of
processing<00:02:37.170> power<00:02:37.580> now<00:02:38.580> there<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.849> a<00:02:38.880> small

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
processing power now there is a small

trade off the oh my 4460 has a more

trade off the oh my 4460 has a more

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
proper GPU then the qualcomm crate does

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.979 
proper GPU then the qualcomm crate does
but<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.129> create<00:02:44.459> as<00:02:44.610> more<00:02:44.819> smaller<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
but they create as more smaller and is

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.360 
but they create as more smaller and is
overall<00:02:46.319> a<00:02:46.349> lot<00:02:46.500> more<00:02:46.650> efficient<00:02:47.190> than<00:02:47.310> the
