full<00:00:34.050> length<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.590> truck<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.350> what<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
full length of the truck but the what I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.869 
full length of the truck but the what I
can<00:00:38.219> tell<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:39.230> these<00:00:40.230> valve<00:00:40.530> covers<00:00:40.879> right

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
can tell is these valve covers right

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.190 
can tell is these valve covers right
back<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:43.500> leaking<00:00:44.960> pretty<00:00:45.960> much

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
back in there are leaking pretty much

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.700 
back in there are leaking pretty much
all<00:00:46.410> over<00:00:46.440> got<00:00:47.340> some<00:00:47.489> good<00:00:47.670> drips<00:00:47.910> coming<00:00:48.239> down

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
all over got some good drips coming down

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.770 
all over got some good drips coming down
deal<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:49.920> driver<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.930> no<00:00:51.930> smoking<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
deal it with driver but no smoking so I

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
deal it with driver but no smoking so I
guess<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.989> just<00:00:55.170> finding<00:00:55.410> its<00:00:55.649> way<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.070> on

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
guess it's just finding its way right on

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.459 
guess it's just finding its way right on
down<00:00:59.059> to<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> end<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.170> ground

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
down to the end to the to the ground

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.050 
down to the end to the to the ground
without<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:02.600> really<00:01:03.600> smoking<00:01:05.030> so<00:01:06.030> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
without really really smoking so I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.560 
without really really smoking so I
thought<00:01:06.360> I'd<00:01:06.479> take<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.939> try<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> attempt

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
thought I'd take it and try to attempt

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.010 
thought I'd take it and try to attempt
to<00:01:09.750> take<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.790> plenum<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.390> change<00:01:12.780> out

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to take off the plenum and change out

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.789 
to take off the plenum and change out
the<00:01:13.350> valve<00:01:13.590> covers<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:15.140> felt<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.290> guy<00:01:16.439> on<00:01:16.590> line

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the valve covers I felt one guy on line

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.410 
the valve covers I felt one guy on line
on<00:01:17.070> I'll<00:01:17.640> link<00:01:17.939> his<00:01:18.240> video<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.299> he<00:01:21.299> was

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
on I'll link his video to this he was

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.330 
on I'll link his video to this he was
able<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.990> take<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.439> take<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> side

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
able to get to take this take this side

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.539 
able to get to take this take this side
off<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:24.540> kind<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.840> fold<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.430> so<00:01:26.430> we'll

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
off just kind of fold it over so we'll

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.880 
off just kind of fold it over so we'll
see<00:01:26.729> how<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.909> goes<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.409> video<00:01:28.619> up

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
see how that goes I have this video up

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.620 
see how that goes I have this video up
that<00:01:29.070> I'll<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.250> looking<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.729> referencing

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.190 

there's<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.810> little<00:01:34.079> spots<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> oil<00:01:35.659> one<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
there's a little spots of oil one and

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.969 
there's a little spots of oil one and
two<00:01:40.579> will<00:01:41.579> drip<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.930> little<00:01:43.350> drip<00:01:43.619> there

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
two will drip there a little drip there

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.960 
two will drip there a little drip there
I<00:01:45.560> think<00:01:46.560> that's<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.950> previous<00:01:47.460> drip<00:01:47.700> from<00:01:47.850> when

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
I think that's a previous drip from when

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.690 
I think that's a previous drip from when
I<00:01:48.000> used<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.420> before<00:01:49.009> there<00:01:50.009> might<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.310> some

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I used it before there might be some

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:58.789 
I used it before there might be some
problems<00:01:51.240> with<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:56.460> power<00:01:56.850> steering<00:01:57.799> cleaned

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
problems with the power steering cleaned

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.399 
problems with the power steering cleaned
it<00:01:58.890> up<00:01:58.979> pretty<00:01:59.250> well<00:01:59.340> can't<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.030> see

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
it up pretty well can't really see

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.780 
it up pretty well can't really see
there's<00:02:01.409> anything<00:02:01.649> leaking<00:02:02.100> from<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.700> but

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
there's anything leaking from it but

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.160 
there's anything leaking from it but
we'll<00:02:02.969> see<00:02:03.180> they<00:02:03.540> put<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.840> some<00:02:03.960> power

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
we'll see they put in some power

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.840 
we'll see they put in some power
steering<00:02:04.619> stops<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.310> seals<00:02:05.610> mono

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
spread so stay tuned I'll be splicing
