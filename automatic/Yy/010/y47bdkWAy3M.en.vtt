00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.250
 i 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:07.160
 very good raccoons how are you 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.780
 we are in a new video of this game 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.330
 this game we have to say we good 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.840
 and many of you will know which others are not 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.800
 game is 7 to 5 but I'm interested 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.529
 this you 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.240
 a version of that video illuminati 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.699
 I for English pages on the internet 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.099
 ok let's see what we have to go 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.500
 here to the cable car this is here and 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.230
 I'm already here, I have franklin 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.379
 my favorite character and as you see here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.839
 we have this I'm going to take the phone and 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.640
 let's go to let's put the photo the 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.559
 camera and as you can see we have 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.530
 here this mount the mount 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.290
 william and we have a few styles of 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.630
 drawings and here as a kind of labyrinth 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.170
 and this could be the symbol of 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.620
 illuminati or in any case a UFO or a 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.450
 agree eye then here we see here 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.239
 this is clearly seen from what we are 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.690
 seeing is a UFO here we see it is a 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.800
 egg 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.200
 broken and here we see it is 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.230
 of man with jetpack that surely 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.130
 refer to cj and gta subject 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.320
 san andreas here we have an egg 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.920
 that what can be but can say is 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.189
 what can be a stress or what is going to 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.890
 hatch the mountain the mountain or that 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.890
 it's an interest I think it's the first 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.050
 so here we have a spatial this 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.220
 is what it can mean to be the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.230
 logo that we find with no me 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.240
 agreement which character those missions 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:49.360
 secondary asks us to get 50 pieces 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.670
 to get a good car a car is 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.850
 a kind yes with the pieces to make a 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.820
 car and maybe there's that you have to 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 do it and come to this mountain here 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.229
 up for your fence and what's up 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.540
 and we do not see see rays here this 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.729
 it means that maybe it should be in 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.970
 storm when we have to come and see 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.720
 now you see why 6-3 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.720
 here 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:21.130
 and we are going to go up here as you see 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.550
 here we have a lookout that tells us 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.290
 we read listening he speaks to us it would be a little 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.959
 stupid to speak to us a lookout 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.560
 and as we see here we have a message 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.480
 written 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.300
 this can come to see any time 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.400
 of the day does not expose comeback when your 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.440
 story is complete and here we have the 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.630
 UFO or eye symbol that we have 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.599
 seen below and means this phrase 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.390
 what does it mean come back when 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.069
 your story is completed I play already 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.080
 I would've passed it bought the game 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.620
 Monday and I was all week 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.540
 state institute when in the afternoon 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.940
 then I have the story already completed 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.989
 and here it nothing has happened so 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.390
 it means that what we have to 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.160
 complicate and complete is the game at 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.370
 one hundred percent is not missions 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.049
 secondary and all this is good and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.209
 another interest that since we are here you 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.080
 I'm going to teach you say that if we look at 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:20.580
 sky you can see some triangles of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.580
 Illuminati but I do not know 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.810
 I do not know it's a rumor I do not know if it's true 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.650
 there are the saints 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.069
 Nothing, I do not see anything special, I know it's 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.930
 Truth is true because I've seen it 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.870
 photos but not never but I do not know how 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.510
 find it good in case you do not know the 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:56.270
 monte chin day is here so you already 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.310
 taught at the beginning of the video side 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.680
 that you are a cable car in a helicopter 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.989
 that you can easily find one 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.730
 at the airport of the saints although it is 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.319
 perceive the police nothing happens I've 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.930
 come by plane and now he 's in 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.120
 parachute and then we can also come 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.829
 to this town and come by to catch that 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.420
 cable car and climb the cable car up 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:20.630
 the mountain is so simple 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.540
 I hope at some point to discover what it is 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:27.010
 what happens there have been theories that say 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.970
 that the ground opens and a UFO appears 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:34.240
 and you can take it from me and you know in a 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.930
 jet paq with a million dollars I do not know 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.930
 Yes it's correct 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.010
 also finely collected 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:46.050
 friend that this is what what I have 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.569
 said of the fragment of the spacecraft 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.800
 it is this 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:54.599
 there is no measured cable car 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.599
 quiet guys , nothing happens 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.939
 quiet guys do not pass na because 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:05.620
 let's parachute to 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.620
 finalize this gta video 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.470
 good 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.750
 a cable car I do not prefer parachutes 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.640
 well then nothing more to say this 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:20.460
 has been the stress of today if you want a 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:25.410
 interest plus some other interest then I 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.590
 I leave you I have one more that I know is 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:32.430
 about a zombie we can find 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:34.849
 the saints and quite simple and well if 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.770
 I see that you 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.679
 you like do not like me to make stereos 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:43.099
 of jeta 5 although you want the quality 

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:44.419
 it's a little bit bad because nothing is 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.429
 because I have a very hour reading 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.669
 bad but at least this great 

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:51.689
 game is what I have precision 3 in case 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.919
 I wanted to know 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.919
 to know jicayÃ¡n picador 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:06.630

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.630

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.100
 there we are and this as the many 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:18.240
 graphics 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:18.240
 and then it disappears 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:27.500
 a Saturday 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:30.750
