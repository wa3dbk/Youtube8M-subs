00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.140
 hello everybody, everything good 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.260
 in this video I would like to be addressing 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.320
 with you the question of the keys of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:26.199
 adjustment on the x- series saxophone 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.150
 it is an innovation that you rarely 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.160
 I found the saxophone particularly 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.470
 never seen or any other saxophone and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 that makes a lot of difference that you can add 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.720
 much to you who called me the most 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.000
 attention is so I saw the saxophone was the 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.600
 issue of regulating the Marias 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.590
 saxophone it contains two screws in the 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.870
 key defendant and far key 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.570
 This makes it much easier for us to 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.329
 who has the small hand or who was 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.270
 very large and sometimes have difficulty 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.880
 in speed here you can adjust 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:08.880
 according to the size of your own hand 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:20.240
 this is the regulation of the frontal fatah is the 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.760
 bolt cavity to the right attention and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.440
 also what eventually results in the 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.440
 practicality and comfort 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.480
 following the same logic we have the 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.420
 screwdriver bolt more 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:43.190
 an innovation of the saxophonist x are the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:47.180
 micro-adjustments to 'show duel if there 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.430
 sun under farm and is good with this 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.619
 adjustment of these keys 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.619
 they got easier quick and economical 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.810
 up with that with only one key 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.640
 crevice and sometimes without knowledge 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.390
 with the specific one of 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.300
 to swallow we can adjust the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.300
 our instrument is removing leaks 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.580
 and kakÃ¡ also providing comfort and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.350
 more economy of course some models 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.959
 axor most modern fans after 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.720
 fixed platforms where the columns of 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.459
 are placed before being 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.590
 fixed to the main top 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.810
 this fixed platform strengthens the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.660
 general structure of sites giving firmness 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.450
 and stability to the columns once again 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.690
 series has come out ahead and innovating is 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.480
 create a hole in the fixed platform where 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:41.900
 the columns are inserted and after being 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.430
 resistance is much greater and the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.860
 platform the columns becomes 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.380
 practically a single personal good piece 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.030
 this is the saxophone video number two 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.230
 series x hope you have helped 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.230
 you a hug
