00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.910 
see the comparison here there's just
glaring<00:01:51.450> difference<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.110> kind<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> wonder<00:01:52.770> why

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
glaring difference I kind of wonder why

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.670 
glaring difference I kind of wonder why
they<00:01:53.100> did<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.689> it<00:01:54.689> actually<00:01:54.869> looks<00:01:55.229> kind<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
they did that it actually looks kind of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.859 
they did that it actually looks kind of
worse<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.159> me<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.759> nonetheless<00:01:57.270> it's<00:01:57.689> still<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
worse to me but nonetheless it's still a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.069 
worse to me but nonetheless it's still a
gen<00:01:58.140> 1<00:01:58.320> prime<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:58.979> cool<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.299> won't<00:02:00.689> won't

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
gen 1 prime it's cool so you won't won't

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.940 
gen 1 prime it's cool so you won't won't
knock<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> too<00:02:01.680> hard<00:02:03.680> roller<00:02:04.680> is

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
knock it too hard roller is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.660 
knock it too hard roller is
spring-loaded<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:06.780> does<00:02:07.049> feature<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.670> long

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
spring-loaded it does feature the long

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.600 
spring-loaded it does feature the long
missiles<00:02:09.470> if<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.830> compare<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> long

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
missiles if you can compare the long

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.290 
missiles if you can compare the long
missiles<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.480> original

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
missiles with the original

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.630 
missiles with the original
short<00:02:14.170> missiles<00:02:14.560> these<00:02:14.800> are<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.310> missiles

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
short missiles these are the missiles

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.910 
short missiles these are the missiles
from<00:02:15.850> my<00:02:16.060> battle<00:02:16.450> convoy<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.320> can<00:02:17.440> see<00:02:17.680> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
from my battle convoy as you can see a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.950 
from my battle convoy as you can see a
major<00:02:18.460> difference<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:19.150> looks<00:02:19.420> kind<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.720> dumb

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
major difference it looks kind of dumb

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.290 
major difference it looks kind of dumb
if<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:20.980> actually<00:02:21.130> put<00:02:21.520> the<00:02:21.640> original<00:02:21.730> missile

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
if you actually put the original missile

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.330 
if you actually put the original missile
on<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.480> holder<00:02:22.900> if<00:02:23.320> it<00:02:23.440> even<00:02:23.530> fits<00:02:23.890> now<00:02:24.220> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
on the holder if it even fits now it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.060 
on the holder if it even fits now it
doesn't<00:02:24.580> even<00:02:24.640> fit<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:26.500> looks<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.800> lot<00:02:26.890> better

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
doesn't even fit it looks a lot better

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.840 
doesn't even fit it looks a lot better
with<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.340> shorter<00:02:27.670> missile<00:02:28.030> another<00:02:28.900> thing<00:02:29.170> is

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
with a shorter missile another thing is

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.420 
with a shorter missile another thing is
prime<00:02:30.850> himself<00:02:31.590> has<00:02:33.240> the<00:02:34.560> pegged<00:02:35.560> fist<00:02:35.950> and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
prime himself has the pegged fist and

prime himself has the pegged fist and
the<00:02:37.240> short<00:02:37.660> smokestacks<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:39.520> leg<00:02:39.760> plastic

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
the short smokestacks the leg plastic

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.960 
the short smokestacks the leg plastic
bothered<00:02:41.380> me<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> little<00:02:41.710> bit<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.790> as<00:02:42.880> I

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
bothered me a little bit but as I

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.030 
bothered me a little bit but as I
transform<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.600> toy<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.500> really<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.860> nice

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
transform the toy it is really a nice

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.880 
transform the toy it is really a nice
toy<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:46.690> definitely<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> nice<00:02:47.320> piece<00:02:47.560> as<00:02:47.770> you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
toy it's definitely a nice piece as you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.180 
toy it's definitely a nice piece as you
can<00:02:48.040> see<00:02:48.220> here<00:02:48.520> he<00:02:49.180> has<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.420> later<00:02:50.230> model<00:02:50.950> gun

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
can see here he has the later model gun

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
can see here he has the later model gun
versus<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.210> bloated<00:02:52.780> rifle<00:02:53.880> earlier<00:02:54.880> which

versus the bloated rifle earlier which

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.510 
versus the bloated rifle earlier which
would<00:02:55.360> be<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.510> early<00:02:56.080> pre<00:02:56.380> rub<00:02:56.590> or<00:02:56.890> diaclone

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
would be a early pre rub or diaclone

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.630 
would be a early pre rub or diaclone
rifle<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.870> see<00:02:59.050> a<00:02:59.080> lot<00:02:59.260> of<00:02:59.290> difference<00:02:59.740> in<00:02:59.920> the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
rifle you see a lot of difference in the

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.880 
rifle you see a lot of difference in the
tip<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.480> actual<00:03:01.810> size<00:03:01.990> the<00:03:02.200> rifle<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.560> lot<00:03:02.740> of

tip the actual size the rifle a lot of

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.370 
tip the actual size the rifle a lot of
detail<00:03:03.250> has<00:03:03.550> been<00:03:03.580> lost<00:03:03.970> as<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.900> compare<00:03:05.260> the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
detail has been lost as I compare the

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.620 
detail has been lost as I compare the
two<00:03:05.530> over<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> years<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.910> don't<00:03:07.120> know<00:03:07.360> why<00:03:07.570> the

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
two over the years I don't know why the

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.270 
two over the years I don't know why the
fuel<00:03:08.080> pumps<00:03:08.470> have<00:03:08.890> differences<00:03:09.460> in<00:03:09.670> them<00:03:11.280> but

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
fuel pumps have differences in them but

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.240 
fuel pumps have differences in them but
I<00:03:12.340> guess<00:03:12.580> what<00:03:12.790> time<00:03:13.030> I<00:03:13.060> don't<00:03:13.930> know<00:03:13.990> how<00:03:14.140> many

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
I guess what time I don't know how many

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.320 
I guess what time I don't know how many
times<00:03:15.250> I've<00:03:15.460> we're<00:03:15.550> going<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.730> use<00:03:15.880> as<00:03:16.060> mold

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
times I've we're going to use as mold

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.180 
times I've we're going to use as mold
but<00:03:16.780> it's<00:03:16.900> it's<00:03:17.170> really<00:03:17.500> cool<00:03:17.650> that<00:03:17.709> they<00:03:18.010> have

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
but it's it's really cool that they have

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.360 
but it's it's really cool that they have
decided<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.910> issue<00:03:19.540> them<00:03:19.870> out<00:03:19.959> again<00:03:20.160> it<00:03:21.160> does
