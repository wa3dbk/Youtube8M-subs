00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.809
 year 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.580
 spent the week outside if we had 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.070
 preferred that diners never occur 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.070

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.340
 you want explained 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.040
 how do you repeat your address so that 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.040
 keep promoting 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:05.820

 girl likes luis cow 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:30.080
 me too because 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.730
 I just did not want scandal or not 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.700
 I wanted one way or another that she 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:38.870
 talk about things that can 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.700
 skills and abilities but 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.700
 logically these girls talk 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.300
 7 with 41 and I was there 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.300

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:16.890
 to me still to support him doing what 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.100
 what do you like most? 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.340
 will follow the criticism of Richard Dulanto 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:26.660
 what has it been about you that you created 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.660
 if you have a face of sofia 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.360

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.360
 relationship goes wind happy 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:51.730
 but the mature ones 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.390
 to 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.819
 at 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.460
 after the memory of fear the espanyol 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.090
 he had gone to a prison 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.090
 good 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.070
 one 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.270
 listen I would like that since we 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.690
 woke up breakfast lunch meal 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:27.650

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.650
 the day recorded 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:40.760
 it's true I'm afraid of you fear yes 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:50.219
 then how scary is a word 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:04:00.290
 wrong gives me modesty is the word of 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:04:00.290
 the morning dragging every day 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:25.419
 we are going to move live and 34,000 5 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:29.820
 that is from 34 thousand to 39 thousand and launch a 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.820
 glass as you can throw a knife 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.580
 will be that I recorded what he says no but what 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.580
 true is that green is 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.770
 good 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.060
