really<00:01:57.780> good<00:01:58.049> for<00:01:58.229> me<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.560> nice<00:01:58.710> little<00:01:58.860> down

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
really good for me in a nice little down

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
really good for me in a nice little down
a<00:01:59.100> little<00:01:59.340> bit<00:01:59.490> what's<00:01:59.729> i<00:01:59.820> added<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> coal<00:02:00.719> truck

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
a little bit what's i added a coal truck

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.300 
a little bit what's i added a coal truck
to<00:02:01.079> my<00:02:01.200> team<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.409> i<00:02:01.680> put<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> rush<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.159> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to my team and i put a rush on the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.760 
to my team and i put a rush on the
second<00:02:02.610> line<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:03.659> try<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.409> more<00:02:04.530> goals

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
second line to try to get more goals

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.760 
second line to try to get more goals
with<00:02:04.890> Kovalchuk<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.119> that's<00:02:06.719> why<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:06.899> i<00:02:07.320> think

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
with Kovalchuk so that's why is i think

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.960 
with Kovalchuk so that's why is i think
is<00:02:07.940> scoring<00:02:08.940> did<00:02:09.750> slow<00:02:10.020> down<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.709> uh<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:11.849> know

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
is scoring did slow down so uh you know

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
is scoring did slow down so uh you know
it's<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.239> because<00:02:12.510> he<00:02:12.660> started<00:02:13.020> playing<00:02:13.110> or

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it's not because he started playing or

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
it's not because he started playing or
just<00:02:13.590> because<00:02:13.770> he<00:02:13.860> got<00:02:13.890> less<00:02:14.160> minutes<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:15.150> i

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
just because he got less minutes and i

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.970 
just because he got less minutes and i
