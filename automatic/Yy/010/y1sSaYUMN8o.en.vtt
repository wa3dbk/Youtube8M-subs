with<00:02:20.329> my<00:02:21.459> determination<00:02:22.459> to<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.269> almost

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
with my determination to do almost

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.280 
with my determination to do almost
exactly<00:02:24.500> but<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:26.269> design<00:02:26.660> is<00:02:28.420> so<00:02:29.420> sometimes

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
exactly but the design is so sometimes

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.120 
exactly but the design is so sometimes
there<00:02:30.650> was<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.859> little<00:02:31.329> battle<00:02:32.329> going<00:02:32.359> on<00:02:33.130> very

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
silent between the glassblower and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.120 
silent between the glassblower and
myself<00:02:38.109> but<00:02:39.109> there's<00:02:39.319> always<00:02:39.530> very<00:02:39.859> much

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
myself but there's always very much

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:46.050 
myself but there's always very much
respect

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.510 

the<00:02:47.060> glass<00:02:47.300> boils<00:02:47.810> sometimes<00:02:48.710> try<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.160> put

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
the glass boils sometimes try to put

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:58.500 
the glass boils sometimes try to put
their<00:02:49.700> own<00:02:49.730> signature<00:02:50.660> also<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:52.720> my<00:02:53.720> ideas<00:02:54.260> and

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.420 

if<00:02:59.510> this<00:02:59.900> the<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.920> ideas<00:03:01.400> that<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.610> have<00:03:02.350> is

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
if this the the ideas that I have is

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.060 
if this the the ideas that I have is
feasible<00:03:04.430> if<00:03:04.730> I<00:03:04.940> can<00:03:05.150> use<00:03:05.420> it<00:03:05.660> admit<00:03:06.170> to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.070 
feasible if I can use it admit to

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.680 
feasible if I can use it admit to
enhance<00:03:07.520> my<00:03:07.820> design<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.570> will<00:03:08.630> use<00:03:08.930> it

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:24.010 

I<00:03:20.110> started<00:03:21.110> out<00:03:21.260> with<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.620> bean<00:03:21.950> foam<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:23.810> was

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
I started out with a bean foam that was

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.150 
I started out with a bean foam that was
blown<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.320> it<00:03:27.320> looked<00:03:27.620> rather<00:03:27.770> boring

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
blown and then it looked rather boring

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.840 
blown and then it looked rather boring
just<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.910> green<00:03:29.180> bean<00:03:29.890> so<00:03:30.890> decided<00:03:31.520> to<00:03:31.610> cut

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
just the green bean so decided to cut

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.250 
just the green bean so decided to cut
off<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.570> top

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.250 

but<00:03:36.260> I<00:03:36.440> love<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.830> top<00:03:37.130> we<00:03:37.850> can<00:03:38.060> see<00:03:38.450> part<00:03:39.050> of

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:39.260 
but I love the top we can see part of

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.730 
but I love the top we can see part of
the<00:03:39.440> beam<00:03:39.880> which<00:03:40.880> is<00:03:40.910> not<00:03:41.410> enough<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.710> I

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:42.740 
the beam which is not enough so I

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.120 
the beam which is not enough so I
decided<00:03:43.100> to<00:03:43.640> cut<00:03:43.940> off<00:03:44.210> another<00:03:44.720> part<00:03:45.080> of<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.320> on

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
decided to cut off another part of it on

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.920 
decided to cut off another part of it on
the<00:03:46.430> side<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.990> then<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.830> could<00:03:49.040> see<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.490> beam

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the side and then we could see the beam

00:03:49.930 --> 00:04:27.529 
the side and then we could see the beam
almost<00:03:51.370> in<00:03:53.080> in<00:03:54.080> capsule

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.619 

and<00:04:29.129> to<00:04:30.129> make<00:04:30.759> it<00:04:30.909> a<00:04:31.000> little<00:04:31.210> bit<00:04:31.389> more
