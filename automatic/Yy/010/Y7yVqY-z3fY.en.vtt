00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
minutes before we crack it open and it

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.250 
minutes before we crack it open and it
ought<00:00:57.340> to<00:00:57.489> survive<00:00:57.910> the<00:00:58.180> inferno<00:00:58.660> because

ought to survive the inferno because

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.259 
ought to survive the inferno because
it's<00:00:59.410> coated<00:00:59.770> with<00:01:00.160> a<00:01:00.340> remarkable<00:01:01.030> new

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
hasn't broken up at all and you can see

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.870

on the front here it's glowing red hot
but<00:01:13.750> just<00:01:13.780> watch<00:01:14.050> this<00:01:14.290> if<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.560> turn<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.890> flame

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
but just watch this if I turn the flame

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.440 
but just watch this if I turn the flame
off<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.310> remember<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:15.970> was<00:01:16.030> producing

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
off and remember that it was producing

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.810 
off and remember that it was producing
1,200<00:01:17.080> degrees<00:01:17.170> Celsius<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.400> take<00:01:18.640> that

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
1,200 degrees Celsius and I take that

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.030 
1,200 degrees Celsius and I take that
charred<00:01:19.150> bit<00:01:19.360> and<00:01:19.570> I<00:01:19.780> put<00:01:19.990> it<00:01:20.080> flat<00:01:20.530> in<00:01:20.860> the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
charred bit and I put it flat in the

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.670 
charred bit and I put it flat in the
palm<00:01:21.220> of<00:01:21.250> my<00:01:21.520> hand<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:22.600> only<00:01:22.720> just<00:01:22.930> feels<00:01:23.170> warm

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
palm of my hand it only just feels warm

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.880 
palm of my hand it only just feels warm
and<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:25.420> I<00:01:25.720> then<00:01:25.900> crack<00:01:26.409> it<00:01:26.560> open

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and if I then crack it open

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.500 
and if I then crack it open
