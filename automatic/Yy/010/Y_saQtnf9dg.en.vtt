00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.660
 long music 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.299
 many eyes and obviously the larva 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.920
 how dehydrated it does not feel like 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.569
 when I tasted it alive 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:00.190
 the clothes that are very typical of camps that 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.190
 have worms let's try it 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.160

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.540
 good 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.540
 but when I like it a lot 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.070

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.370
 as they say here the raw cockroach and 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.370
