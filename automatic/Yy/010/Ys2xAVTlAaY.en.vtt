hello everyone wait for my tech Legion

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.999 
hello everyone wait for my tech Legion
here<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.330> this<00:00:03.840> is<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.319> be<00:00:04.410> an<00:00:04.529> overview

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
here and this is going to be an overview

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.160 
here and this is going to be an overview
and<00:00:05.370> some<00:00:05.640> benchmarks<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.870> Asus<00:00:07.790> RT<00:00:08.790> and

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
and some benchmarks on the Asus RT and

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.789 
and some benchmarks on the Asus RT and
66u<00:00:10.219> dual<00:00:11.219> band<00:00:11.550> wireless<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.330> router<00:00:12.799> this

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
66u dual band wireless and router this

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.369 
66u dual band wireless and router this
is<00:00:14.009> an<00:00:14.130> N<00:00:14.280> 900<00:00:14.790> router<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.509> what<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.870> means<00:00:16.139> is

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is an N 900 router so what that means is

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.609 
is an N 900 router so what that means is
it<00:00:16.949> can<00:00:17.100> provide<00:00:17.539> 450<00:00:18.539> megabits<00:00:18.990> per<00:00:19.080> second

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
it can provide 450 megabits per second

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.759 
it can provide 450 megabits per second
on<00:00:19.740> each<00:00:20.340> band<00:00:20.699> concurrently<00:00:21.630> 2.4<00:00:22.590> gigahertz

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
on each band concurrently 2.4 gigahertz

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.089 
on each band concurrently 2.4 gigahertz
and<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> 5<00:00:23.550> gigahertz<00:00:23.820> frequency<00:00:24.949> let's<00:00:25.949> take

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
and the 5 gigahertz frequency let's take

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:41.180 
and the 5 gigahertz frequency let's take
a<00:00:26.130> look<00:00:26.340> at<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> actual<00:00:26.820> product<00:00:39.860> so<00:00:40.860> here<00:00:41.040> we

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
a look at the actual product so here we

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
a look at the actual product so here we
have<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:42.090> RT<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.399> 66u<00:00:44.399> router<00:00:45.180> itself<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
have the RT and 66u router itself you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
have the RT and 66u router itself you
can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.770> asus<00:00:47.340> has<00:00:47.579> put<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.059> diamond

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
can see that asus has put a diamond

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.110

antennas are external there are three of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.540 
antennas are external there are three of
them<00:02:41.430> they<00:02:42.420> are<00:02:42.450> adjustable<00:02:43.580> completely<00:02:44.580> and

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
them they are adjustable completely and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.940 
them they are adjustable completely and
removable<00:02:47.550> as<00:02:47.880> well<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:48.600> if<00:02:48.840> you<00:02:48.990> desire<00:02:49.740> to

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
removable as well so if you desire to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.460 
removable as well so if you desire to
put<00:02:50.160> higher<00:02:50.520> gain<00:02:50.820> antennas<00:02:51.420> on<00:02:51.570> here<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.260> can

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
put higher gain antennas on here you can

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.250 
put higher gain antennas on here you can
do<00:02:52.650> that<00:02:52.830> though<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.880> atenas<00:02:54.360> aces<00:02:54.780> choses

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
do that though the atenas aces choses

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.600 
do that though the atenas aces choses
are<00:02:56.150> pretty<00:02:57.150> pretty<00:02:57.720> good<00:02:58.080> choice<00:02:58.380> to<00:02:59.070> get<00:02:59.490> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
are pretty pretty good choice to get the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.070 
are pretty pretty good choice to get the
optimal<00:03:00.150> range<00:03:00.390> out<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:01.320> this<00:03:01.530> router<00:03:01.800> without

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
optimal range out of this router without

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.740 
optimal range out of this router without
losing<00:03:04.080> signal<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.010> middle<00:03:05.220> there<00:03:05.370> so

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
losing signal in the middle there so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.810 
losing signal in the middle there so
these<00:03:06.750> just<00:03:06.990> screw<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.740> off<00:03:07.830> when<00:03:08.790> they

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
these just screw on and off when they

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.650 
these just screw on and off when they
package<00:03:11.820> when<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.150> pull<00:03:12.300> them<00:03:12.390> out<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
package when you pull them out of the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.870

package<00:03:12.990> they<00:03:13.500> are<00:03:13.650> off<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.400> you<00:03:14.460> do<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.670> to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
package they are off so you do have to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:21.320 
package they are off so you do have to
attach<00:03:15.300> them<00:03:16.880> yeah<00:03:18.440> your<00:03:19.440> AC<00:03:19.650> adapter<00:03:20.330> with
