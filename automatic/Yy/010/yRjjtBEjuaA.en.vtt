00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.440
 I people it's x 1080 hd I hope that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.639
 you're well questioned about short center 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.320
 a new rush on the chain the 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.030
 review of andré pierre gignac version one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 form the scorer of the Olympic 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:21.150
 marseille who is currently in full 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.849
 fluff it's simple I think it's 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.109
 the second best scorer in Europe 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.029
 currently you see that I stall them 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.980
 in a league team 1 all he 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.539
 is more normal for this start of tallow 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.289
 even if there are some very good 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.000
 players in this team 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 you have the schengen space of gignac 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.670
 who are in the process of scrolling I you 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.620
 therefore invite to pause or to 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.180
 challenge to paul Observer gignac 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.370
 boost that is available in the bins 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.050
 from yesterday until next week 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.820
 as usual for the teams of the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.350
 week it lasts for a week 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.520
 so the gignac inform what is it 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.350
 can tell from him I started in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.330
 speaking of the price so at the price level 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.460
 it's much more expensive than the mario 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.870
 gomez that I could introduce yesterday but that 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.030
 really remains very affordable in terms 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.770
 of price for a boost the order and stone 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.410
 gignac that you can find in purchase 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.730
 immediate between 10000 and 13000 credit 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.320
 while it's not even a day 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.880
 is in simple pacsés me mine 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.860
 I bought it exactly 10000 credit 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 so I bought them late last night 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.480
 but there in the day he turns between 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 10000 and 13000 credit in immediate purchase 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.440
 at auctions I guess you can 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 the chopper a lot cheaper so all 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.080
 by bus it's really affordable for 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.360
 those who want to take a little 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 more this entry do not hesitate with the 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.780
 gignac inform on will now go to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.310
 negative point of andré pierre gignac 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.510
 inform then you will find quite a lot 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.130
 of these you will find a lot of 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.200
 similarities with mario gomez 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.030
 at the negative points 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.260
 already the 3 stars technical gestures 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 technically it is very interesting 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.620
 in the game and a stat not disgusting 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.020
 in-game he 's 77 years old drip I've 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.180
 Moreover put in the positive points 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 but here is yielding limiting as many 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.580
 technical gestures gignac is a player 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.229
 which certainly I do not 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.610
 scripts in every sense but of time 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.840
 in time, he brings out small gestures 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.159
 4 stars technical gesture 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.080
 it's really a shame that he has 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.390
 three-star technical gesture the three 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.610
 star wrong foot his left foot is 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.960
 rather average certainly I had I had 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.220
 put some goals with me 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.020
 remember even more if I put goals 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.760
 left foot with him it is still 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.930
 relatively average so that's why 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.170
 that I liked him in the negative points 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.970
 and then bal agility and balance 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.940
 same for mario gomez even if the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.850
 stats are a lot 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.810
 hot he's in his agility and it's 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.310
 feels anyway for a player who 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.630
 does a meter 86 must you can see 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.640
 than at the level of its size in the game 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.840
 he's still beefy at the level 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.970
 of agility the way he stands 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.000
 returns and so on really happened 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.620
 really robootic a little and bash 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.750
 unstable equilibrium equilibrium which is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.430
 also a little weak 1.68 in 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 balance even if it's true they are 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.330
 80 years strong what we think anyway 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.740
 I decided to clarify it because of 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.390
 from time to time at the shoulder you go 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.400
 see that the gignac is moved when 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.660
 even quite easily in the game 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.400
 then at the points level 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.920
 positively for the gignac bon bah already 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.690
 the finish 1.85 in finish in game that 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.340
 it's very interesting in front of the cages 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.060
 it is very good the foot dish the 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.110
 strikes in force 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.090
 the little stakes I tried 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.050
 a few it was rather average but 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.820
 it's true that usually it's the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.860
 strikes in force that I have near that I have 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.420
 used most often with him because that 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.530
 share really very very well because he 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.640
 has a very big power of the strikes 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.670
 a hitting power that I have 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.110
 by the way put in the pros positive 87 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.610
 in hitting power I also put the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.420
 little 79 years have no limit in 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.070
 the positive points 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.570
 you'll see on last clip this is 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.640
 a balloon if a long shot is 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.930
 no longer a long shot but on the 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.580
 far strikes he is very very 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.280
 interesting the ball goes very very 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.500
 well and that's really it's really 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.790
 cool to have a big puncher then his 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.350
 pass quality that's where I was 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.910
 surprised even though it's true that the year 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.260
 last I had tested gignac good 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.280
 it's such a tax but I love myself 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.630
 found that in the pivot game it 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640
 was really very interesting and there 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.750
 it's always the same thing 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.120
 that is to say that well I put it a 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.410
 single-handed attacker as you could 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.570
 see in a 4 3 3 he's all alone in 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.820
 tip with the two wingers that his 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:41.830
 look as and lavezzi his pass quality 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.209
 really allowed me to find them 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.400
 find it easily and that it stays very 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.600
 interesting so his vision of the game and his 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.890
 pass quality then there is no no 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.730
 more quality goes crazy but I 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.260
 decided to put him in the footsteps 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.730
 Positive in rats' vision 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.769
 73 years vision so that's very 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.970
 interesting for a scorer for a 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.890
 scorer at the level of positioning 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.660
 always well placed it really does 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.080
 always the right call it is very easy 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.590
 to find 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.850
 and that's it's super interesting for 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.310
 a scorer by the way there you have a 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.140
 little clip where you see the race down 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.340
 of gignac his race a band the 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.470
 defender is completely 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.390
 I put the volley times in pro 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.860
 positive and 1.80 to steal the balloons 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.810
 by rather well you could see there on 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.389
 the moment the psychiatrist control the recovery 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.430
 chained who makes goals and 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:23.379
 so I also put in the points 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.210
 positive all that is the aspect 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.280
 badon control be it 118 in 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 ball control frankly it's very 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.939
 very interesting to have a scorer 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.349
 able to do checks of this 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.749
 quality there as I say in the 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:36.249
 review of gomez at the controls 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:39.460
 it's really very important on this 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.169
 fifa and on that side really disappoints 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.999
 not so there was the last clip of 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.979
 the review this very beautiful shot that 

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.330
 come to see her and come back it was 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.939
 tim howard in the cages that moment 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.830
 surely the best keeper of the game I 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.090
 fell against him it was ad 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.379
 was not in the world what I'm telling 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.870
 it was not awards on this match I 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:58.180
 confused with another sorry match so 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.039
 at the level of the balance of gignac inform you 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
 have the balance sheet that appears before your 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.439
 eyes 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.879
 so at the positive points so 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:06.250
 I did not talk about it but it's true that it 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:08.349
 stats in jump is interesting even though 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.550
 good if he has one but they were closing 86 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:11.259
 so he will necessarily take balloons 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.610
 from the head his head game that gemini 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.830
 in the most flooded - because it stays 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.810
 means here know it's not too good 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.099
 it's not too bad but its means 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.659
 but that does not prevent us from taking 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.849
 head balloons that stats in force 80 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.500
 in force as I said it does not prevent 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.909
 to move defenders a player who 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.810
 does that at 80 finally generally who 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.189
 allows 86 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.680
 I do not know if it's the size that 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:32.710
 do it but physically it does not move 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.180
 evil of defenders game vision flap and 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.550
 finishes 85 years old girls are really 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.020
 very interesting for a scorer the 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.399
 pennacchi that I put down in the 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.169
 positives that found a penalty 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:43.210
 I had two or three penaltys I have them 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.830
 all put in the bottom dribbles technically 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.270
 interesting you could see at the level of 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.759
 hooks of the thighs that it 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.349
 goes out really well and 177 in dribbling 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.330
 and we do not feel any bad 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.129
 longhot the ball goes very well 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.270
 the reception in 79 but on the strikes 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.649
 far away his share very very well 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.939
 aggressiveness still in the process of 

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:59.379
 squeeze the ball carrier and the 

00:05:57.939 --> 00:06:01.509
 hinder in the relaunching positioning he 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:03.099
 is always well placed he always 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.289
 the right call so that's very very 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:07.139
 interesting for a scorer his quality of 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.729
 pass that 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.830
 ba which is very useful which is very useful 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.389
 in his pivotal game his power of 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.159
 strike 87 in power of the strikes this 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:16.189
 really a big puncher and so at 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.300
 level of agility negative points 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:19.289
 balance three stars bad foot 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.729
 three stars technical gestures 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:22.830
 the equilibrium I held good to clarify it 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:24.029
 even though it feels a lot 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.979
 a lot less because mario gomez 

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:27.900
 he still has a lot more stats 

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:29.669
 high so you see the balance sheet with seven 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.349
 matches 14 goals and three assists 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:34.439
 decisive a very very good balance sheet which him 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:36.539
 worth a score of 16 and a half out of 20 he 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.669
 is close to the mario gomez anyway 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:39.779
 game even if it is a little above so 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.400
 I decided to put a note 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.229
 superior I thought it was not worth 17 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.909
 it's worth between sixteen and seventeen so 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.759
 to go his enemies for the blow we did 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.840
 a little a little note with a 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.520
 decimal point 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.840
 so here it was fade 24 hours in hd 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.259
