obviously your shoe sizes but they're

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.689 
obviously your shoe sizes but they're
adorable<00:01:02.469> because<00:01:02.920> they<00:01:03.010> come<00:01:03.190> in<00:01:03.219> a<00:01:03.370> little

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
adorable because they come in a little

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.010
