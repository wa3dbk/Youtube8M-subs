00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
hi I'm Tim premier sabji I and I am NOT

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.810 
hi I'm Tim premier sabji I and I am NOT
this<00:00:12.809> short<00:00:13.139> reason<00:00:14.129> why<00:00:14.250> I'm<00:00:14.339> walking<00:00:14.669> on<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
this short reason why I'm walking on the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.550 
this short reason why I'm walking on the
ground<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.209> because<00:00:16.080> we're<00:00:16.230> testing<00:00:16.500> out

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
ground it's because we're testing out

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.440 
ground it's because we're testing out
knee<00:00:16.740> pads<00:00:16.980> today<00:00:17.190> these<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.030> the<00:00:18.120> hatchet

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
knee pads today these are the hatchet

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.599 
knee pads today these are the hatchet
knee<00:00:18.510> pads<00:00:18.780> we've<00:00:19.350> also<00:00:19.530> got<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> OE<00:00:20.039> tech<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
knee pads we've also got the OE tech and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:44.060 
knee pads we've also got the OE tech and
the<00:00:20.670> HSS<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.080> let's<00:00:22.199> get<00:00:22.349> started

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.250 

okay<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:45.760> let's<00:00:46.210> look<00:00:46.359> at<00:00:46.539> these<00:00:46.629> knee<00:00:46.809> pads<00:00:47.079> in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
okay so let's look at these knee pads in

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.979 
okay so let's look at these knee pads in
a<00:00:47.320> little<00:00:47.589> bit<00:00:47.680> more<00:00:47.859> depth<00:00:48.129> I<00:00:48.370> have<00:00:48.640> the<00:00:48.989> HSS

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
a little bit more depth I have the HSS

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:52.319 
a little bit more depth I have the HSS
knee<00:00:50.170> pad<00:00:50.379> right<00:00:50.589> here<00:00:50.620> on<00:00:50.859> my<00:00:50.980> knee<00:00:51.010> and<00:00:51.460> I've

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
knee pad right here on my knee and I've

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.490 
knee pad right here on my knee and I've
left<00:00:52.479> this<00:00:52.600> one<00:00:52.780> on<00:00:52.870> because<00:00:53.019> it's<00:00:53.260> the<00:00:53.350> most

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
left this one on because it's the most

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.579 
left this one on because it's the most
comfortable<00:00:53.890> I<00:00:54.129> like<00:00:54.640> this<00:00:54.760> one<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:55.000> lot<00:00:55.589> it's

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:56.589 
comfortable I like this one a lot it's

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.020 
comfortable I like this one a lot it's
got<00:00:56.739> a<00:00:56.769> couple<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.190> pros<00:00:57.370> and<00:00:57.550> cons<00:00:57.729> with<00:00:57.909> it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
got a couple of pros and cons with it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.729 
got a couple of pros and cons with it
though<00:00:58.180> one<00:00:58.629> of<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.809> cool<00:00:58.960> things<00:00:58.989> about<00:00:59.320> it

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
though one of the cool things about it

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.639 
though one of the cool things about it
is<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.449> biggest<00:01:01.780> one<00:01:01.930> and<00:01:02.170> so<00:01:02.440> it

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
is that it's the biggest one and so it

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.410 
is that it's the biggest one and so it
actually<00:01:02.860> provides<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.579> most<00:01:03.760> protection

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
actually provides the most protection

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.450 
actually provides the most protection
it's<00:01:05.080> also<00:01:05.199> very<00:01:05.409> very<00:01:05.530> comfortable<00:01:06.159> I'm<00:01:06.369> just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
it's also very very comfortable I'm just

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.950 
it's also very very comfortable I'm just
going<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.670> compare<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:07.090> sizes<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:07.659> you<00:01:07.750> here

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
going to compare the sizes for you here

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.380 
going to compare the sizes for you here
this<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.680> the<00:01:08.799> HSS<00:01:09.399> and<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.149> hatch

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
this is the HSS and this is the hatch

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.840 
this is the HSS and this is the hatch
one<00:01:10.750> in<00:01:10.780> my<00:01:11.170> left<00:01:11.409> hand<00:01:11.740> the<00:01:11.950> hatch<00:01:12.430> and<00:01:12.670> the<00:01:12.700> OE

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
one in my left hand the hatch and the OE

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.370 
one in my left hand the hatch and the OE
tech<00:01:13.119> ones<00:01:13.330> are<00:01:13.479> about<00:01:13.630> the<00:01:13.720> same<00:01:13.869> size<00:01:13.930> but

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
tech ones are about the same size but

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.359 
tech ones are about the same size but
this<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.860> huge<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.830> almost<00:01:18.009> fits<00:01:18.190> around

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
this one is huge it almost fits around

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.790 
this one is huge it almost fits around
my<00:01:18.550> face<00:01:18.880> but<00:01:19.780> anyway<00:01:20.080> I'm<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.679> of<00:01:20.740> the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
my face but anyway I'm one of the

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.649 
my face but anyway I'm one of the
downfalls<00:01:20.979> with<00:01:21.429> the<00:01:21.580> HSS<00:01:22.119> that's<00:01:22.420> kind<00:01:22.630> of

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
downfalls with the HSS that's kind of

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.109 
downfalls with the HSS that's kind of
complicated<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:23.619> figure<00:01:23.890> out<00:01:24.069> it<00:01:24.640> has<00:01:24.819> an

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
complicated to figure out it has an

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.690 
complicated to figure out it has an
elastic<00:01:25.929> strap<00:01:26.619> which<00:01:27.039> is<00:01:27.190> supposed<00:01:27.429> to<00:01:27.520> go<00:01:27.670> on

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
elastic strap which is supposed to go on

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.520 
elastic strap which is supposed to go on
the<00:01:27.940> top<00:01:28.149> you<00:01:28.450> know<00:01:28.479> this<00:01:28.690> one<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.990> adjustable

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
the top you know this one is adjustable

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.190 
the top you know this one is adjustable
and<00:01:29.649> it's<00:01:29.799> also<00:01:29.920> elastic<00:01:30.850> e<00:01:31.179> velcro<00:01:31.929> strap

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and it's also elastic e velcro strap

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.990 
and it's also elastic e velcro strap
that<00:01:32.319> you<00:01:32.440> loop<00:01:32.619> around<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:33.190> plastic<00:01:33.640> buckle

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
that you loop around this plastic buckle

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.870 
that you loop around this plastic buckle
but<00:01:34.990> before<00:01:35.259> you<00:01:35.350> do<00:01:35.470> that<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:36.340> have<00:01:36.369> to<00:01:36.610> put

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
but before you do that you have to put

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.080 
but before you do that you have to put
these<00:01:37.209> velcro<00:01:37.720> flaps<00:01:38.229> together<00:01:38.649> which<00:01:39.610> in

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
these velcro flaps together which in

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.520 
these velcro flaps together which in
some<00:01:40.450> cases<00:01:40.509> may<00:01:40.990> or<00:01:41.049> may<00:01:41.110> not<00:01:41.140> fit<00:01:41.440> around

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
some cases may or may not fit around

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.930 
some cases may or may not fit around
your<00:01:41.679> knee<00:01:41.860> depending<00:01:42.280> on<00:01:42.369> how<00:01:42.459> big<00:01:42.640> your<00:01:42.729> leg

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
your knee depending on how big your leg

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.899 
your knee depending on how big your leg
is<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:44.709> this<00:01:45.009> gets<00:01:45.159> kind<00:01:45.459> of<00:01:45.580> cover

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
is and so this gets kind of cover

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.309 
is and so this gets kind of cover
something<00:01:46.209> complex<00:01:46.660> could<00:01:46.929> take<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.080> while<00:01:47.229> to

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
something complex could take a while to

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.510 
something complex could take a while to
put<00:01:47.440> your<00:01:47.590> kneepads<00:01:47.709> on<00:01:48.039> but<00:01:48.160> once<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:48.399> get

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
put your kneepads on but once you get

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.400 
put your kneepads on but once you get
them<00:01:48.640> on<00:01:48.849> and<00:01:49.539> very<00:01:49.750> comfortable<00:01:49.959> because

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
them on and very comfortable because

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.839 
them on and very comfortable because
they<00:01:50.649> are<00:01:50.770> very<00:01:50.950> big<00:01:51.190> and<00:01:51.220> they<00:01:51.399> do<00:01:51.459> have<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.700> lot

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:51.849 
they are very big and they do have a lot

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:53.880 
they are very big and they do have a lot
of<00:01:51.879> padding<00:01:52.119> one<00:01:53.020> other<00:01:53.140> thing<00:01:53.229> i<00:01:53.440> found<00:01:53.679> that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
of padding one other thing i found that

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.219 
of padding one other thing i found that
was<00:01:54.069> very<00:01:54.220> confusing<00:01:54.610> about<00:01:54.789> this<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:55.690> HSS

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
was very confusing about this is the HSS

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.930 
was very confusing about this is the HSS
logo<00:01:56.679> right<00:01:56.890> here<00:01:56.920> that's<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.369> the<00:01:57.459> bottom

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
logo right here that's on the bottom

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.779 
logo right here that's on the bottom
velcro<00:01:58.690> flap<00:01:59.019> this<00:01:59.769> is<00:02:00.009> actually<00:02:00.369> supposed<00:02:00.489> to

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
velcro flap this is actually supposed to

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:03.119 
velcro flap this is actually supposed to
be<00:02:00.879> upside<00:02:01.360> down<00:02:01.690> okay<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.530> thought<00:02:02.739> this<00:02:02.920> was

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.129 
be upside down okay I thought this was

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:04.440 
be upside down okay I thought this was
supposed<00:02:03.220> to<00:02:03.399> be<00:02:03.459> on<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.670> top<00:02:03.879> the<00:02:04.030> first<00:02:04.239> time

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
supposed to be on the top the first time
