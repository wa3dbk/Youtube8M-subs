in<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.409> UK<00:00:23.890> although<00:00:24.609> I<00:00:24.820> think<00:00:24.970> we<00:00:25.150> might<00:00:25.359> have

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
in the UK although I think we might have

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.269 
in the UK although I think we might have
already<00:00:25.779> had<00:00:26.019> our<00:00:26.050> summer<00:00:26.380> we<00:00:26.560> had<00:00:26.710> like<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.919> few

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
already had our summer we had like a few

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.819 
already had our summer we had like a few
days<00:00:27.489> of<00:00:27.909> warmth<00:00:28.329> and<00:00:28.689> now<00:00:28.929> it's<00:00:29.140> back<00:00:29.319> to<00:00:29.529> rain

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
days of warmth and now it's back to rain

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.889 
days of warmth and now it's back to rain
every<00:00:29.859> day<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.640> pieces<00:00:31.149> kind<00:00:31.419> of<00:00:31.659> follow

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:31.899 
every day the pieces kind of follow

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:34.110 
every day the pieces kind of follow
three<00:00:32.380> main<00:00:32.680> patterns<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.610> that's<00:00:33.790> one

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
three main patterns and that's one

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.830 
three main patterns and that's one
pieces<00:00:34.690> white<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:36.359> prints<00:00:37.359> I've<00:00:37.480> got<00:00:37.629> a<00:00:37.660> lot

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
pieces white and prints I've got a lot

of<00:00:37.870> prints<00:00:38.260> so<00:00:38.949> I<00:00:39.519> think<00:00:39.640> those<00:00:39.910> are<00:00:40.059> all

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
of prints so I think those are all

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.479 
of prints so I think those are all
pretty<00:00:40.510> good<00:00:40.750> trends<00:00:41.140> for<00:00:41.350> summer<00:00:41.559> as<00:00:41.800> well<00:00:41.949> so
