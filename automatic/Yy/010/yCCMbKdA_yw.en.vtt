guys<00:01:08.220> being<00:01:08.490> shape<00:01:08.820> maybe<00:01:09.000> injuries<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:10.140> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
guys being shape maybe injuries well I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750 
guys being shape maybe injuries well I
think<00:01:10.290> I'm<00:01:10.619> that's<00:01:10.979> always<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> concern<00:01:11.400> when

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
think I'm that's always a concern when

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.490 
think I'm that's always a concern when
you<00:01:12.000> don't<00:01:12.180> have<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> full<00:01:12.689> pre-season<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
you don't have a full pre-season and a

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
you don't have a full pre-season and a
full<00:01:13.710> training<00:01:13.979> camp<00:01:14.280> i<00:01:14.400> think<00:01:14.610> if<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.729> look

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
full training camp i think if you look

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.630 
full training camp i think if you look
at<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> NFL<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:16.619> can<00:01:16.770> kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.040> see<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> but

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
at the NFL you can kind of see that but
