years of research studies here so if you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.340 
years of research studies here so if you
don't<00:00:31.439> enjoy<00:00:31.710> detailed<00:00:32.780> video<00:00:33.780> then<00:00:34.170> you'd

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
don't enjoy detailed video then you'd

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.900 
don't enjoy detailed video then you'd
want<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.739> just<00:00:34.890> turn<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.219> off<00:00:35.430> right<00:00:35.610> now

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
want to just turn this off right now

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.840 
want to just turn this off right now
I'll<00:00:36.750> share<00:00:37.140> some<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.739> great<00:00:38.010> outcomes<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
I'll share some of the great outcomes of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.180 
I'll share some of the great outcomes of
the<00:00:38.940> research<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.570> me<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.870> persia<00:00:40.110> in<00:00:40.379> 2001

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
the research on me of persia in 2001

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.670 
the research on me of persia in 2001
they<00:00:42.149> did<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> study<00:00:42.739> to<00:00:43.739> show<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.280> fat<00:00:44.640> loving

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
they did a study to show the fat loving

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.350 
they did a study to show the fat loving
properties<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:47.039> neo<00:00:47.250> puncha<00:00:47.789> which<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:48.329> of

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
properties of neo puncha which is one of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.020 
properties of neo puncha which is one of
the<00:00:48.480> three<00:00:48.690> fibers<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.860> what<00:00:50.820> that

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the three fibers on this and what that

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
the three fibers on this and what that
means<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.140> Neo<00:00:52.320> puncha<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.920> going<00:00:53.129> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
means is that the Neo puncha is going to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
means is that the Neo puncha is going to
grab<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.059> fat<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> top<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.500> your

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
grab the fat from the top of your

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.590 
grab the fat from the top of your
stomach<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.250> eat<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> meal<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.000> just

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
stomach when you eat a meal and just

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900 
stomach when you eat a meal and just
pull<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.050> out<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.530> gelatin-like<00:00:59.100> substance

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
pull it out in a gelatin-like substance

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.770 
pull it out in a gelatin-like substance
of<00:01:00.090> fiber<00:01:00.390> right<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.370> until<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.489> eliminate

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
of fiber right out until you eliminate

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.030 
of fiber right out until you eliminate
well<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.049> studied<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.860> two

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
well when they studied that in a two

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.580 
well when they studied that in a two
thousand<00:01:05.489> one<00:01:05.610> study<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.810> found<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
thousand one study they found it has the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
thousand one study they found it has the
capacity<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.220> absorb<00:01:09.350> 28.3<00:01:10.350> percent<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.310> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
capacity to absorb 28.3 percent of the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
capacity to absorb 28.3 percent of the
fatty<00:01:12.299> acids<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.530> that's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:13.979> thousand<00:01:14.460> one

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
fatty acids so that's a two thousand one

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.469 
fatty acids so that's a two thousand one
study<00:01:15.060> where<00:01:16.250> 28.3<00:01:17.250> percent<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> fat<00:01:18.180> was

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
study where 28.3 percent of the fat was

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.539 
study where 28.3 percent of the fat was
absorbed<00:01:18.960> after<00:01:19.290> meals<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.430> our

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
absorbed after meals it was a for our

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.240 
absorbed after meals it was a for our
experiment<00:01:21.380> then<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:23.060> 2003<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.479> did<00:01:24.720> a

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
experiment then in 2003 they did a

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.609 
experiment then in 2003 they did a
double-blind<00:01:26.390> clinical<00:01:27.390> study<00:01:27.990> with<00:01:28.320> 10

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
double-blind clinical study with 10

healthy<00:01:28.950> volunteers<00:01:29.570> showing<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
healthy volunteers showing that the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
healthy volunteers showing that the
quantity<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.320> fat<00:01:31.650> excreted<00:01:32.310> compared<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
quantity of fat excreted compared to the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
quantity of fat excreted compared to the
fat<00:01:33.270> ingested<00:01:34.790> increased<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.060> average<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.689> 27

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
fat ingested increased on average by 27

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.080 
fat ingested increased on average by 27
4.4%<00:01:39.470> that's<00:01:40.470> twenty<00:01:41.009> seven<00:01:41.369> point<00:01:41.400> four

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
4.4% that's twenty seven point four

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.410 
4.4% that's twenty seven point four
percent<00:01:42.630> more<00:01:42.750> fat<00:01:43.320> was<00:01:44.130> excreted<00:01:44.670> compared

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
percent more fat was excreted compared

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.380 
percent more fat was excreted compared
to<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.600> placebo<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> NIA<00:01:46.860> punch<00:01:47.220> F<00:01:47.430> then

in 2003 the research they did

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.679 
in 2003 the research they did
demonstrated<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.890> vitamins<00:01:53.579> A<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.600> vitamin

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
demonstrated that vitamins A and vitamin

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.340 
demonstrated that vitamins A and vitamin
E<00:01:55.439> were<00:01:55.829> not<00:01:56.040> inhibited<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:56.909> other<00:01:57.240> words<00:01:57.479> it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
E were not inhibited in other words it's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.649 
E were not inhibited in other words it's
not<00:01:58.590> going<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.890> mess<00:01:59.130> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.939> vitamins<00:02:00.540> you

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
not going to mess with the vitamins you

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.910 
not going to mess with the vitamins you
want<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.990> your<00:02:01.049> body<00:02:01.320> those<00:02:01.590> antioxidants

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
want on your body those antioxidants

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.250 
want on your body those antioxidants
vitamin<00:02:02.850> A<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
vitamin A and

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.910 
vitamin A and
nice<00:02:03.620> oh<00:02:03.800> that's<00:02:03.980> great<00:02:04.280> then<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.560> 2004<00:02:06.560> a
