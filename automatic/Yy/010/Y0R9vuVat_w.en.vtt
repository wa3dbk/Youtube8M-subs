 hello friends how are you doing good this is my 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:08.480
 first video analysis of a video game 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.309
 I hope you like it let's analyze 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.949
 one of my favorite video games 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.930
 playstation3 which is the dragon ball 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.930
 raging blast 2 enjoy it 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.539
 Y 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.759
 d 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.989
 I do not know what 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.400
 Well first let's start with a bit of 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.470
 information about the game itself is a 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.290
 videogame based on manga and anime 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.060
 dragon ball is distributed by spike and 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.450
 published by namco bandai for 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.880
 Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.420
 all of North America was launched in 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.370
 November 2010 the game is a combat 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.470
 in 3-d that allows players to play 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.780
 as characters inside the dragon ball 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.700
 universe either against the game u 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.479
 another player in one of the different 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.000
 game modes both online and option 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.710
 first let's talk about the gameplay 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.570
 I have to mention that this game is 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.810
 resembles the good okay tenkaichi at 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.550
 perform the attacks and the type of fights 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.619
 in the buttons we have different 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.960
 actions for the characters with the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.700
 down arrow we load key with the 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.920
 left stick we move and with the 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.869
 right we can perform the different 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 special attacks of each of the 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.190
 characters the four directions 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.250
 simple plus another by pressing the stick to 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.229
 perform the most powerful attack one of 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.960
 the most important improvements in this 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.950
 game is the furious soul mode which is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.409
 active by pressing 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.110
 quickly upon reaching the high mode 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.329
 tension when we activate the soul mode 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.610
 curious begins to sound the bright 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.409
 main theme of the video game but 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.420
 let's talk about what soul mode 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.189
 curious in itself because in this way the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.619
 Melee attacks are more 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.660
 powerful and lower more energy as much as 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.729
 to break the defense of your opponent 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.310
 more easily also your speed 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.230
 increases the bad in this way is that not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.030
 you can make special attacks but 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.519
 it's worth activating it when you're in 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.120
 good trouble that 's the most important thing 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.739
 what do I have to say about the gameplay 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.610
 Cooler will be in charge of talking about the 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.620
 graphics of the game 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.380
 first what stands out most in the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.300
 graphics is that one of 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.490
 the great problems of the first dragon 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.090
 ball raging blast that is none other than 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.190
 camera system this time the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.920
 characters are better designed and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.660
 modeled though more than innovation what 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.970
 what the developers have done 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.670
 been simply add some shading 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.410
 all the characters catalog 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.510
 result is very good and the 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.850
 Graphic behavior is very remarkable 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.370
 in the fastest sequences though 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.640
 as always dragon ball raging blast or 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.040
 you still do not take care of the scenarios 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.470
 many of these that can be destroyed 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.900
 the problem is that the design of the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.550
 scenarios has little detail and when 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 we get close to one of the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.080
 elements of the scenario we verify that 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.270
 their work is very poor 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.760
 Well now I will talk about the modes 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.410
 of game what perhaps more popularity to 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.420
 this game and it is one of the most 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.580
 negative is that it does not exist in mode 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.920
 story which was replaced by a 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.350
 galaxy mode in which you have to play 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.780
 with all 90 characters that exist 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.090
 in the game which is a bit annoying 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.010
 that is, each character has in his 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.990
 alternative history which sometimes 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.150
 coincide with the manga story 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.520
 also at levels that are very difficult 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.710
 to overcome especially when you have to 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.960
 beat an enemy while being hit 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.820
 of losing your whole life but there are ways 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.830
 to remedy this by using objects 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.770
 specials which are available 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.410
 in the game for the characters too 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.840
 there is the tournament mode in which there is the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.240
 martial arts tournament tournament 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.010
 of the sel or a special tournament every time 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.200
 that we won a tournament of these we can 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.200
 unlock some characters or win 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.820
 new images for our gallery 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.190
 about multiplayer there's not much 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.470
 what to say about it are just fights 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.470
 with split screen when you play with 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:20.989
 someone 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.180
 and finally in power zone mode in 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.130
 where you can increase the defense force 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.140
 and the speed of the character you want 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.810
 doing fighting and equipping it with 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.810
 special objects 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.910
 Well I'll talk about the characters the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:38.690
 game has new characters the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:42.320
 which are Android 13 android 14 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:45.230
 android 15 junior jewels labura by 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.169
 jacques chirac ya nimba bike hand mecca 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:52.130
 freezers metal cooler neil gaiman goian 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.169
 of the future to give salsa to give them italy 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.690
 added characters that stand out 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.910
 they would be veganta and brolin super saiyan 3 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.889
 the interesting thing about using these 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:03.020
 characters is that by not having 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.330
 original anime attacks since 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.460
 there were never the developers of the 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.740
 game created new attacks for these 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.150
 characters which are very good 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.150
 facts only measure 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.330
 I 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.210
 but not 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.129
 now let's talk about the sound what you notice is 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.379
 that the voices in English are not very 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:28.389
 well done since in some scenes 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.340
 They lack emotion or sometimes they are very 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.620
 overreacted that's why I have them in 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.780
 Japanese in regards to the 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.580
 subtitles in Spanish well they are fine 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.710
 achieved except that there are 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.750
 expressions that are only used in Spain ' 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:43.360
 which makes it a bit weird for 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.400
 Latinos that we play this game but to the 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.860
 end does not affect much and what matters 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.229
 is the game itself on the soundtrack 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.940
 I found it very interesting since they are 

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.250
 remakes of the anime soundtrack 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.500
 original including also the song 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.090
 Main game in normal mode or 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.830
 instrumental 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.530
 finally let's talk about the extras that 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.690
 has the game a very important extra 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.000
 that he has is a remake of the movie of 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.860
 jacques chirac you can also use the 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.960
 dragon spheres of the earth and the 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:13.210
 jellyfish and which are not very difficult 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.129
 of getting but they only serve to 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.469
 unlock things that do not have much 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:20.800
 relevance as costumes scenarios 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:23.169
 objects and so on is the gallery 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.090
 of images in which are images 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.930
 of more epic scenes from the anime 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.330
 dragon ball 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:31.509
 as goku versus freezer goian against 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:33.729
 cell vegeta versus myint and so on 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.740
 now to finish let's talk about some 

00:06:33.729 --> 00:06:38.530
 negative points that I did not mention 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.479
 previously a negative point is that 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.580
 did not include the dragon characters 

00:06:40.479 --> 00:06:44.830
 ball gt and the dragon ball when goku 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.199
 I was a child, you can not transform 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.630
 in giant monkey which serves to 

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:51.729
 melee fights something that does not 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.770
 I mentioned in the gameplay is that when 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:55.479
 handle any character the 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.160
 you feel heavy and slow 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.770
 also the attackers of attacks 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.630
 specials do not last long that is not to say 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:04.479
 They pursue the enemy for a long distance 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.669
 the defense is a bit difficult to 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.470
 maneuver I mean in the attacks of 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.479
 melee since you have to use 

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.789
 r1 and x at the same time if you want 

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:15.099
 defend well good those are the only ones 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:18.810
 negative points that I think this game 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:21.630
 so let's conclude 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:24.570
 in conclusion this is a good game but 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:26.790
 not perfect has its pros and cons 

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.889
 but I think that if this game had 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:31.440
 had a story mode would have been 

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:34.290
 much better I hope the racing ballasts 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:35.220
 I have it to this game I give it a well deserved 

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.740
 8 out of 10 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.900
 well that was my analysis I hope that you 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.790
 have liked as I always ask you 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:43.200
 subscribe give thumb up and 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:46.520
 comment your opinions 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.520
