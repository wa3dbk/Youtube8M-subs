00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
multiple pellets have struck her abdomen

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:16.560 
multiple pellets have struck her abdomen
we've<00:00:15.409> seen<00:00:15.709> this<00:00:15.860> before

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
we've seen this before

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.509

the<00:00:17.570> shotgun<00:00:18.109> wound<00:00:18.380> looks<00:00:19.130> like<00:00:19.279> she<00:00:19.429> was

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
the shotgun wound looks like she was

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.089 
the shotgun wound looks like she was
shot<00:00:19.730> from<00:00:19.820> a<00:00:19.970> distance<00:00:20.330> though<00:00:20.859> none<00:00:21.859> of<00:00:21.890> the

shot from a distance though none of the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.279 
shot from a distance though none of the
pellets<00:00:22.490> went<00:00:22.699> all<00:00:22.849> the<00:00:22.880> way<00:00:23.089> through<00:00:23.390> so<00:00:24.169> they

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:24.289 
pellets went all the way through so they

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:26.859 
pellets went all the way through so they
must<00:00:24.499> be<00:00:24.619> embedded<00:00:25.160> inside<00:00:25.339> her<00:00:25.820> our<00:00:26.449> goal

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869

for humans we've got no choice just
lower<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.810> voltage<00:01:10.340> here<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.840> you<00:01:12.840> know

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
lower the voltage here you go you know

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
lower the voltage here you go you know
what<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:21.590> but<00:01:22.590> there's<00:01:22.770> hemorrhaging<00:01:23.250> you

or so bleed to death we'll need to take

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.410 
or so bleed to death we'll need to take
care<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.200> as<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.439> remove<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.950> pellets<00:01:29.420> keep
