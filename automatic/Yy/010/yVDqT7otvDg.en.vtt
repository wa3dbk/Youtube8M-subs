what's<00:00:09.820> up<00:00:09.969> guys<00:00:10.210> in<00:00:10.599> this<00:00:10.750> video<00:00:10.960> I'm<00:00:11.410> going

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
what's up guys in this video I'm going

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.230 
what's up guys in this video I'm going
to<00:00:11.710> be<00:00:11.769> showing<00:00:11.980> you<00:00:12.190> an<00:00:12.309> application<00:00:13.000> that

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
to be showing you an application that

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.720 
to be showing you an application that
supposedly<00:00:13.990> speeds<00:00:14.950> up<00:00:15.190> your<00:00:15.219> Mac's

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
supposedly speeds up your Mac's

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.480 
supposedly speeds up your Mac's
processor<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.650> I'm<00:00:17.769> just<00:00:17.920> going<00:00:18.070> to<00:00:18.130> pull<00:00:18.369> up

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
processor so I'm just going to pull up

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.210 
processor so I'm just going to pull up
this<00:00:18.730> website<00:00:19.240> here<00:00:19.539> and<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:20.560> application<00:00:21.099> is

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
this website here and the application is

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.599 
this website here and the application is
called<00:00:21.369> cpu<00:00:22.119> speed<00:00:22.390> accelerator<00:00:23.320> and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
called cpu speed accelerator and

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.070 
called cpu speed accelerator and
obviously<00:00:24.609> to<00:00:24.910> find<00:00:25.269> this<00:00:25.390> website<00:00:25.630> just<00:00:25.960> go

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
obviously to find this website just go

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.080 
obviously to find this website just go
to<00:00:26.260> the<00:00:26.529> link<00:00:26.740> in<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.010> description<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.880> it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
to the link in the description and it

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.599 
to the link in the description and it
will<00:00:28.179> take<00:00:28.300> you<00:00:28.359> here<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.859> just<00:00:30.189> some

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
will take you here so just some

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.000 
will take you here so just some
background<00:00:30.820> information<00:00:31.300> on<00:00:31.660> this<00:00:32.010> pretty

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
background information on this pretty

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.590 
background information on this pretty
much<00:00:33.220> when<00:00:33.850> you're<00:00:34.000> running<00:00:34.239> an<00:00:34.450> application

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
much when you're running an application

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.549 
much when you're running an application
on<00:00:35.140> your<00:00:35.170> Mac<00:00:36.000> sometimes<00:00:37.000> this<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:38.020> processor

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
on your Mac sometimes this the processor

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.459 
on your Mac sometimes this the processor
of<00:00:38.680> your<00:00:38.800> Mac<00:00:38.980> isn't<00:00:39.250> being<00:00:39.730> fully<00:00:40.149> used<00:00:40.780> for

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
of your Mac isn't being fully used for

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.619 
of your Mac isn't being fully used for
that<00:00:41.590> application<00:00:41.969> so<00:00:42.969> if<00:00:43.120> you're<00:00:43.239> working<00:00:43.420> on

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
that application so if you're working on

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.350 
that application so if you're working on
like<00:00:43.870> Photoshop<00:00:44.410> or<00:00:44.559> something<00:00:45.360> sometimes

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
like Photoshop or something sometimes

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.240 
like Photoshop or something sometimes
you<00:00:46.600> have<00:00:46.629> only<00:00:47.079> seventy-five<00:00:47.800> percent<00:00:48.010> of

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
you have only seventy-five percent of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.670 
you have only seventy-five percent of
your<00:00:48.309> out<00:00:48.460> a<00:00:48.489> year<00:00:48.850> processor<00:00:49.510> actually<00:00:49.989> like

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
your out a year processor actually like

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.549 
your out a year processor actually like
running<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:52.360> other<00:00:52.510> 30<00:00:52.870> art<00:00:53.140> other

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
running and the other 30 art other

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.360 
running and the other 30 art other
twenty-five<00:00:54.309> percent<00:00:54.550> is<00:00:54.940> being<00:00:55.750> wasted<00:00:56.370> now

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
twenty-five percent is being wasted now

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.639 
twenty-five percent is being wasted now
to<00:00:57.430> solve<00:00:57.850> this<00:00:58.030> problem<00:00:58.449> the<00:00:59.079> developers<00:00:59.620> of

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
to solve this problem the developers of

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.670 
to solve this problem the developers of
this<00:00:59.949> application<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:01.480> found<00:01:02.379> a<00:01:02.500> way<00:01:02.620> to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
this application have found a way to

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.120 
this application have found a way to
maximize<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.840> power<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.470> your<00:01:05.560> processor

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
maximize the power of your processor

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.730 
maximize the power of your processor
pretty<00:01:06.370> much<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.910> they<00:01:07.660> claim<00:01:07.900> that<00:01:07.930> they<00:01:08.260> can

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
pretty much and they claim that they can

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.560 
pretty much and they claim that they can
increase<00:01:09.070> your<00:01:09.100> processing<00:01:09.760> power<00:01:10.030> by<00:01:10.300> thirty

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
increase your processing power by thirty

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.780 
increase your processing power by thirty
percent<00:01:11.020> now<00:01:11.920> I<00:01:11.950> don't<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.400> if<00:01:12.520> thirty

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
percent now I don't know if thirty

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.930 
percent now I don't know if thirty
percent<00:01:13.180> is<00:01:13.420> true<00:01:13.740> because<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:15.130> haven't<00:01:15.670> seen

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
percent is true because I haven't seen

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.050 
percent is true because I haven't seen
that<00:01:16.000> much<00:01:16.480> of<00:01:16.750> a<00:01:17.110> difference<00:01:17.140> on<00:01:17.740> my<00:01:17.950> Mac<00:01:18.190> but

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
that much of a difference on my Mac but

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.420 
that much of a difference on my Mac but
I<00:01:19.090> know<00:01:19.570> it<00:01:19.960> does<00:01:20.140> increase<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.920> power<00:01:21.070> just

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
I know it does increase the power just

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.210 
I know it does increase the power just
by<00:01:21.640> a<00:01:21.670> bit<00:01:21.970> at<00:01:22.240> least<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.710> if<00:01:23.950> you're<00:01:24.100> not

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
by a bit at least so if you're not

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.800 
by a bit at least so if you're not
noticing<00:01:24.460> anything<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.360> might<00:01:25.600> be<00:01:25.780> just

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
noticing anything it might be just

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.850 
noticing anything it might be just
because<00:01:26.410> you<00:01:27.280> know<00:01:27.460> you<00:01:28.030> have<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.240> slow<00:01:28.510> process

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
because you know you have a slow process

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.750 
because you know you have a slow process
processor<00:01:29.860> in<00:01:29.980> the<00:01:30.070> first<00:01:30.310> place<00:01:30.460> or

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
processor in the first place or

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
processor in the first place or
something<00:01:30.910> like<00:01:31.120> that<00:01:31.180> um<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.400> anyways<00:01:33.940> so

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
something like that um but anyways so

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.320 
something like that um but anyways so
this<00:01:35.050> application<00:01:35.680> just<00:01:35.920> redirects<00:01:36.550> all<00:01:36.820> the

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
this application just redirects all the

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.000 
this application just redirects all the
processing<00:01:38.170> power<00:01:38.320> to<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.650> foreground

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
processing power to the foreground

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.830 
processing power to the foreground
application<00:01:39.790> which<00:01:40.180> means<00:01:40.420> the<00:01:40.570> one<00:01:40.720> that

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
application which means the one that

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.020 
application which means the one that
you're<00:01:40.960> running<00:01:41.110> currently<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.030> therefore

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
you're running currently and therefore

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.070 
you're running currently and therefore
the<00:01:43.450> for<00:01:43.870> grant<00:01:44.050> application<00:01:44.590> will<00:01:44.710> be<00:01:44.830> faster

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
the for grant application will be faster

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.840 
the for grant application will be faster
so<00:01:47.080> one<00:01:47.440> thing<00:01:47.620> about<00:01:47.800> this<00:01:47.980> application<00:01:48.730> is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
so one thing about this application is

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.270 
so one thing about this application is
that<00:01:49.150> it<00:01:49.420> does<00:01:49.600> cost<00:01:49.930> twenty<00:01:50.350> dollars<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.980> buy

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
that it does cost twenty dollars to buy

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.460 
that it does cost twenty dollars to buy
but<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.030> can<00:01:52.270> download<00:01:52.540> a<00:01:52.690> free<00:01:52.960> trial<00:01:53.230> so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
able to use it at least for a bit so

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.440 
able to use it at least for a bit so
once<00:01:59.500> you've<00:01:59.710> downloaded<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.430> you're<00:02:01.300> just

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
once you've downloaded it you're just

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.940 
once you've downloaded it you're just
going<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.660> want<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.900> open<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.230> up<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.620> it

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
then you should get this so first of all

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.990 
then you should get this so first of all
you're<00:02:12.220> going<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> want<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.610> enter<00:02:12.850> your

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
you're going to want to enter your

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.390 
you're going to want to enter your
password<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.870> where<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.500> says<00:02:14.560> password

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
password here where it says password

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.179 
password here where it says password
I've<00:02:15.610> already<00:02:15.819> entered<00:02:16.180> mine<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.860> reason

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:18.189 
I've already entered mine and the reason

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.119 
I've already entered mine and the reason
you<00:02:18.340> need<00:02:18.459> to<00:02:18.549> do<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.909> is<00:02:19.120> just<00:02:19.180> so<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.950> give

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
you need to do that is just so you give

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.360 
you need to do that is just so you give
admin<00:02:21.760> rights<00:02:21.939> to<00:02:22.299> the<00:02:22.500> application<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.709> I

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
admin rights to the application and I

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:25.949 
admin rights to the application and I
don't<00:02:24.610> want<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.819> get<00:02:24.939> into<00:02:25.090> that<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:25.569> it<00:02:25.870> just

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
don't want to get into that but it just

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't want to get into that but it just
means<00:02:26.650> well<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.159> just<00:02:27.310> put<00:02:27.519> in<00:02:27.549> your<00:02:27.610> password

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
means well you just put in your password

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.259 
means well you just put in your password
okay<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:29.439> up<00:02:30.340> here<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.790> have<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.120> X

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
okay so up here you have the X

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.869 
okay so up here you have the X
acceleration<00:02:31.870> bar<00:02:32.530> which<00:02:33.129> goes<00:02:33.340> from<00:02:33.370> zero<00:02:33.819> to

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
acceleration bar which goes from zero to

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.569 
acceleration bar which goes from zero to
one<00:02:34.060> hundred<00:02:34.090> percent<00:02:34.299> and<00:02:35.189> this<00:02:36.189> is<00:02:36.370> pretty

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
one hundred percent and this is pretty

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.729 
one hundred percent and this is pretty
much<00:02:36.790> going<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.420> tell<00:02:37.659> the<00:02:37.780> application<00:02:38.319> to

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
much going to tell the application to

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.369 
much going to tell the application to
how<00:02:39.159> much<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:40.150> acceleration<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.049> you<00:02:41.200> want

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
how much like acceleration that you want

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.830 
how much like acceleration that you want
to<00:02:41.439> put<00:02:41.590> on<00:02:41.709> the<00:02:41.829> processor<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:43.090> obviously<00:02:43.510> a

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
to put on the processor so obviously a

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.690 
to put on the processor so obviously a
hundred<00:02:44.500> percent<00:02:44.590> would<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.220> most<00:02:45.400> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
hundred percent would be the most and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.089 
hundred percent would be the most and
zero<00:02:46.329> would<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.750> least<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.799> I'm<00:02:47.920> just

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
zero would be the least so I'm just

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.410 
zero would be the least so I'm just
going<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> put<00:02:48.430> on<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> hundred<00:02:48.819> percent<00:02:49.000> for

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
going to put on a hundred percent for

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.059 
going to put on a hundred percent for
this<00:02:49.599> video<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:52.230> under<00:02:53.230> state<00:02:53.799> it's

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
this video and here under state it's

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.369 
this video and here under state it's
just<00:02:54.250> had<00:02:54.400> failed<00:02:54.700> or<00:02:55.000> like<00:02:55.450> stops<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.290> you

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
just had failed or like stops for you

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.770 
just had failed or like stops for you
guys<00:02:56.670> but<00:02:57.670> for<00:02:57.909> me<00:02:58.030> it's<00:02:58.150> as<00:02:58.239> active<00:02:58.629> because

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
guys but for me it's as active because

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.280 
guys but for me it's as active because
I've<00:02:58.959> already<00:02:59.139> started<00:02:59.470> it<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:01.079> if<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.260> ever

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
I've already started it and if you ever

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.589 
I've already started it and if you ever
change<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:03.250> acceleration<00:03:03.879> just<00:03:04.120> click<00:03:04.299> start

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 
change the acceleration just click start

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.619 
change the acceleration just click start
again<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:05.079> it<00:03:05.470> should<00:03:06.090> reboot<00:03:07.090> the

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
again and it should reboot the

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.740 
again and it should reboot the
acceleration<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.670> this<00:03:10.420> is<00:03:10.569> pretty

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
acceleration so this is pretty

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.569 
acceleration so this is pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:11.170> once<00:03:11.980> you<00:03:12.099> want<00:03:12.250> to<00:03:12.400> start

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
self-explanatory once you want to start

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.789 
self-explanatory once you want to start
just<00:03:12.790> click<00:03:12.970> start<00:03:13.329> and<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:14.109> will<00:03:14.200> say<00:03:14.349> active

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
just click start and it will say active

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.789 
just click start and it will say active
and<00:03:15.010> now<00:03:15.780> you<00:03:16.780> may<00:03:16.959> or<00:03:17.079> may<00:03:17.200> not<00:03:17.230> notice<00:03:17.560> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
and now you may or may not notice the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.409 
and now you may or may not notice the
difference<00:03:18.129> but<00:03:18.340> I'll<00:03:18.549> just<00:03:18.730> open<00:03:18.879> like<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
difference but I'll just open like the

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.750 
difference but I'll just open like the
app<00:03:19.569> store<00:03:19.599> here<00:03:20.079> as<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.859> can<00:03:20.919> see<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.430> opened

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
app store here as you can see it opened

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.819 
app store here as you can see it opened
really<00:03:22.060> quickly<00:03:22.449> and<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:23.139> already<00:03:23.290> loaded

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
really quickly and it already loaded

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.129 
really quickly and it already loaded
pretty<00:03:24.639> much<00:03:24.790> everything<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:27.209> yeah<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:28.449> I<00:03:29.109> said

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:29.139 
pretty much everything so yeah as I said

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.259 
pretty much everything so yeah as I said
you<00:03:29.590> might<00:03:29.769> not<00:03:29.949> notice<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.400> change<00:03:30.430> it<00:03:30.970> really

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
you might not notice a change it really

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.970 
you might not notice a change it really
depends<00:03:31.659> on<00:03:31.840> what<00:03:32.049> kind<00:03:32.079> of<00:03:32.319> computer<00:03:32.680> you

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
depends on what kind of computer you

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.530 
depends on what kind of computer you
have<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.400> stuff<00:03:34.379> but<00:03:35.609> maybe<00:03:36.609> it<00:03:36.940> will<00:03:37.120> have<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
have and stuff but maybe it will have a

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.399 
have and stuff but maybe it will have a
little<00:03:37.989> change<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.609> if<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.090> click<00:03:40.359> on<00:03:40.540> cod4

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
little change so if I just click on cod4

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.129 
little change so if I just click on cod4
here<00:03:42.099> as<00:03:42.879> you<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.090> see<00:03:43.239> everything<00:03:43.900> loaded

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
here as you can see everything loaded

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.670 
here as you can see everything loaded
really<00:03:44.530> fast<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.720> yeah<00:03:46.720> that's<00:03:47.319> pretty<00:03:47.470> much
