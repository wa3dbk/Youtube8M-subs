00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.580 

hey<00:00:05.070> guys<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.730> about<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.200> hinter<00:00:07.200> stops

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:07.590 
hey guys this is about the hinter stops

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.440 
hey guys this is about the hinter stops
mod<00:00:07.979> that<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.250> was<00:00:08.430> speaking<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.790> earlier

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
mod that I was speaking about earlier

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.100 
mod that I was speaking about earlier
so<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.440> triggers<00:00:10.769> on<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.790> for<00:00:12.120> COD<00:00:12.390> only

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
so the triggers on this for COD only

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.269 
so the triggers on this for COD only
need<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.410> go<00:00:13.560> in<00:00:14.510> like<00:00:15.510> about<00:00:15.840> that<00:00:16.080> much<00:00:16.320> it's

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
need to go in like about that much it's

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099 
need to go in like about that much it's
like<00:00:17.340> an<00:00:17.550> eighth<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.029> inch<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.660> little

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
like an eighth of an inch or a little

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.769 
like an eighth of an inch or a little
over<00:00:19.260> three<00:00:19.529> and<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.680> half<00:00:19.800> millimeters<00:00:20.779> so

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
over three and a half millimeters so

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.429 
over three and a half millimeters so
it's<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.019> really<00:00:22.320> simple<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.919> got<00:00:23.279> this

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
it's like really simple I got this

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:31.179 
it's like really simple I got this
square<00:00:25.439> aluminum<00:00:26.310> tube<00:00:26.839> from<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:30.019> local

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
square aluminum tube from a local

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:38.560 
square aluminum tube from a local
electronics<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.369> parts<00:00:32.640> store<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:37.400> in

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
electronics and parts store and in

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.050 
electronics and parts store and in
millimeters<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.810> measures<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:41.060> like

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:42.060 
millimeters it measures out to like

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.030 
millimeters it measures out to like
three<00:00:42.360> point<00:00:42.690> one<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:45.650> an<00:00:46.650> eighth<00:00:46.770> of<00:00:46.920> an

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:47.040 
three point one and so an eighth of an

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.710 
three point one and so an eighth of an
inch<00:00:47.130> comes<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.880> like<00:00:48.060> three<00:00:48.270> point<00:00:48.510> one

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
inch comes out to like three point one

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.890 
inch comes out to like three point one
seven<00:00:49.970> millimeters<00:00:50.970> so<00:00:51.180> that's<00:00:51.360> like<00:00:51.510> it's

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
seven millimeters so that's like it's

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.260 
seven millimeters so that's like it's
almost<00:00:52.140> perfect<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:53.070> basically<00:00:54.000> what<00:00:54.180> I'm

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
almost perfect and basically what I'm

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.520 
almost perfect and basically what I'm
going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.540> is<00:00:54.810> cut<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.830> to<00:00:56.040> size<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> it's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
going to do is cut this to size and it's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.920 
going to do is cut this to size and it's
gonna<00:00:58.680> sit<00:00:58.950> here<00:00:59.400> and<00:01:00.000> I'm<00:01:00.300> just<00:01:00.330> gonna<00:01:00.630> block

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
gonna sit here and I'm just gonna block

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.300 
gonna sit here and I'm just gonna block
the<00:01:01.110> trigger<00:01:01.350> from<00:01:01.560> going<00:01:01.800> back<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> whole

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
the trigger from going back the whole

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.060 
the trigger from going back the whole
way<00:01:02.630> now<00:01:03.630> if<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.949> the

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
way now if I really want to go like the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.300 
way now if I really want to go like the
extra<00:01:05.489> step<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.710> could<00:01:07.710> cover<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> some

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
extra step I could cover this in some

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.220 
extra step I could cover this in some
heat-shrink<00:01:08.659> but<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.690> don't<00:01:09.900> think<00:01:09.990> I'm<00:01:10.110> going

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.230 
heat-shrink but I don't think I'm going

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.310 
heat-shrink but I don't think I'm going
to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> for<00:01:10.980> my<00:01:11.909> test<00:01:12.210> one<00:01:12.480> simply

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
to do that for my test one simply

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
to do that for my test one simply
because<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.040> I've<00:01:14.190> never<00:01:14.220> done<00:01:14.550> it<00:01:14.670> before<00:01:14.790> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
because a I've never done it before and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.440 
because a I've never done it before and
I<00:01:15.780> might<00:01:15.960> need<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.110> take<00:01:16.230> it<00:01:16.440> back<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:16.770> be

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
I might need to take it back out and be

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.700 
I might need to take it back out and be
there's<00:01:18.450> gonna<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.870> thin<00:01:19.140> layer<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.560> like

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
there's gonna be a thin layer of like

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.430 
there's gonna be a thin layer of like
hot<00:01:19.920> glue<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.490> I'm<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.360> sure<00:01:21.659> how<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.080> how

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
hot glue and I'm not sure how that how

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.860 
hot glue and I'm not sure how that how
much<00:01:22.560> thickness<00:01:22.860> that's<00:01:23.220> gonna<00:01:23.400> add<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.870> so

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
much thickness that's gonna add to so

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.660 
much thickness that's gonna add to so
I'm<00:01:25.229> gonna<00:01:25.350> try<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.950> we'll<00:01:26.370> see<00:01:26.520> how<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
I'm gonna try it and we'll see how it

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.210 
I'm gonna try it and we'll see how it
goes<00:01:28.610> you<00:01:29.610> guys<00:01:29.880> so<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> metal<00:01:31.260> strips<00:01:31.590> here

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
goes you guys so the metal strips here

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.060 
goes you guys so the metal strips here
aren't<00:01:35.220> really<00:01:35.400> working<00:01:35.670> out<00:01:36.560> turns<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.770> that

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
aren't really working out turns out that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
aren't really working out turns out that
they<00:01:38.580> are<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:40.549> hot<00:01:41.549> gluing<00:01:42.510> as<00:01:42.659> well<00:01:42.840> as<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
they are not hot gluing as well as I

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.539 
they are not hot gluing as well as I
would<00:01:43.200> expect<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> might<00:01:44.250> need<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.400> either

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
would expect so I might need to either

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.789 
would expect so I might need to either
punch<00:01:44.880> some<00:01:45.030> holes<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:46.440> scuff<00:01:46.710> them

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
punch some holes in them or scuff them

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
punch some holes in them or scuff them
up<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.220> bit<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.580> some<00:01:47.610> sandpaper<00:01:47.940> just

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
up a little bit with some sandpaper just

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
up a little bit with some sandpaper just
to<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.930> them<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.080> connect<00:01:49.460> something<00:01:50.460> else<00:01:50.850> I

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
to get them to connect something else I

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.340 
to get them to connect something else I
thought<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.690> have<00:01:51.900> plenty<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
thought of which I have plenty of is a

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.820 
thought of which I have plenty of is a
leather<00:01:57.049> from<00:01:58.049> when<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> used<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.470> make<00:01:58.650> gun

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
leather from when I used to make gun

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.070 
leather from when I used to make gun
holsters<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.960> added<00:02:01.290> benefit<00:02:01.650> of<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:03.080> it

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
holsters the added benefit of this is it

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.630 
holsters the added benefit of this is it
would<00:02:04.260> be<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.409> softer<00:02:04.950> sound<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.400> would<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
would be a softer sound so it would be a

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
would be a softer sound so it would be a
harsh<00:02:05.850> click<00:02:06.180> when<00:02:06.330> I<00:02:06.360> redo<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.810> so<00:02:07.080> I<00:02:07.439> think

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
harsh click when I redo that so I think

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.729 
harsh click when I redo that so I think
it's<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> same<00:02:08.879> thickness<00:02:09.479> that<00:02:10.409> we<00:02:10.470> needed

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it's the same thickness that we needed

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.300 
it's the same thickness that we needed
before

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
before

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.200 
before
or<00:02:12.760> actually<00:02:13.660> after<00:02:14.460> it's<00:02:15.460> actually<00:02:15.820> almost

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
or actually after it's actually almost

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.940 
or actually after it's actually almost
identical<00:02:18.600> yeah<00:02:19.600> it's<00:02:19.810> it's<00:02:20.080> clocking<00:02:20.740> in<00:02:20.830> it

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
identical yeah it's it's clocking in it

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.680 
identical yeah it's it's clocking in it
like<00:02:21.240> 3.0<00:02:24.810> 3.0<00:02:26.430> 507<00:02:27.430> somewhere<00:02:28.240> in<00:02:28.330> there<00:02:28.450> so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
like 3.0 3.0 507 somewhere in there so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.110 
like 3.0 3.0 507 somewhere in there so
that's<00:02:29.020> actually<00:02:29.320> perfect

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
that's actually perfect

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.530 
that's actually perfect
and<00:02:31.860> that'll<00:02:32.860> readily<00:02:33.610> accept<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.450> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and that'll readily accept that and I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.300 
and that'll readily accept that and I
can<00:02:34.690> actually<00:02:34.810> just<00:02:35.650> go<00:02:35.770> with<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> real<00:02:36.070> small

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
can actually just go with a real small

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.010 
can actually just go with a real small
square<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.540> should<00:02:37.810> do<00:02:37.990> the

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
square of it and that should do the

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.430 
square of it and that should do the
trick

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
trick

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.890 
trick
so<00:02:39.340> we're<00:02:39.460> gonna<00:02:39.550> go<00:02:39.730> ahead<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.060> try<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
so we're gonna go ahead and try the

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.670 
so we're gonna go ahead and try the
leather<00:02:41.590> strips<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:43.180> see<00:02:43.600> how<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.810> goes<00:02:43.840> guys

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
leather strips and see how it goes guys

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.990 
leather strips and see how it goes guys
there<00:02:45.340> they<00:02:45.370> go

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
there they go

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.570 
there they go
at<00:02:46.450> least<00:02:46.690> try<00:02:47.530> number<00:02:47.710> one<00:02:47.830> I'm<00:02:48.220> gonna<00:02:48.310> try<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
at least try number one I'm gonna try to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.070 
at least try number one I'm gonna try to
get<00:02:48.820> in<00:02:48.940> there<00:02:49.030> with<00:02:49.150> an<00:02:49.240> exacto<00:02:49.690> knife<00:02:49.840> and

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
get in there with an exacto knife and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.220 
get in there with an exacto knife and
shape<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.740> down<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> little<00:02:51.280> bit<00:02:51.490> but<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:53.080> can

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
shape this down a little bit but you can

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.430 
shape this down a little bit but you can
see<00:02:53.530> maybe<00:02:54.280> from<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> trigger<00:02:54.940> movement<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
see maybe from the trigger movement that

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.420 
see maybe from the trigger movement that
they<00:02:56.650> are<00:02:56.920> only<00:02:57.730> ever<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.510> reduced<00:02:59.340> but<00:03:00.340> it

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
they are only ever so reduced but it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.340 
they are only ever so reduced but it
should<00:03:00.610> be<00:03:00.700> enough<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:00.940> cotton<00:03:01.630> titanfall<00:03:02.020> if

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
should be enough for cotton titanfall if

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.800 
should be enough for cotton titanfall if
my<00:03:02.530> measurements<00:03:03.010> are<00:03:03.130> correct<00:03:03.460> so<00:03:04.360> I'll

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
my measurements are correct so I'll

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.140 
my measurements are correct so I'll
probably<00:03:05.710> test<00:03:06.130> that<00:03:06.310> out<00:03:06.340> later<00:03:06.640> tonight<00:03:06.880> now

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
probably test that out later tonight now

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.410 
probably test that out later tonight now
if<00:03:07.210> I<00:03:07.360> get<00:03:07.480> the<00:03:07.570> kids<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.960> bed<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.670> let<00:03:10.240> me<00:03:10.300> know

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
if I get the kids to bed so let me know

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.480 
if I get the kids to bed so let me know
if<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.600> any<00:03:10.720> questions<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.440> YouTube<00:03:12.010> will

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
if you any questions and YouTube will

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.330 
if you any questions and YouTube will
see<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.760> pattern<00:03:13.030> later
