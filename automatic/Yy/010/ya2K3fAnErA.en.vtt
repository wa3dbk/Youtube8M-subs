00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.740
 hey people are here and today 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.480
 six new plans and the next 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.610
 matching title on the xbox marketplace 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.349
 I'll show you in the video 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 show everything exactly and I say how 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.710
 it will cost a lot before but eventually 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.990
 the comments asks when the whole 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.850
 because for the ps3 or the pc appears 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 but we do not know the exact date 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.539
 we always know it's about that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.859
 A month later, when we do that 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.480
 exact date bit I'll go on 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.650
 every case on my twitter and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.179
 post facebook page 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.740
 the links to it we are always in the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.719
 See the comments in the background 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.120
 just the first personalization package 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 called akua the wave so the title with 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.239
 I really like the wave and the wave 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.950
 The camouflage I find and the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.390
 other payments better I will 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.200
 which probably not so often or even 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.239
 do not use 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.550
 the second personalization package is called 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.899
 Decay and what you just so good 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.149
 like it is realistic 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.489
 not every album or dragon camouflage 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.050
 they are totally crazy and crazy 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.340
 I prefer this realistic one 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.870
 camouflage like the diagrams in 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.699
 background counts because there is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.710
 then another personalization 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.940
 package which means coyote I will 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.530
 now also in the background 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.780
 show that even his realistic 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.760
 planning is also so sandy I like it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.350
 could personally better, but at 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.150
 I'm just the visors cool 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.920
 but what I want to tell you now 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.900
 it just has not been for hours now 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.759
 the other three payments work 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.110
 So the other three personalization 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.880
 to download packages 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.530
 I've had to wait too long for myself 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.210
 could make this video because of it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.710
 just always gave the success 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.270
 but not only with me but with all 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.220
 People in europe, for example, too 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.689
 elli he tweeted it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.490
 was already afraid that it is only me 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.110
 but apparently all could 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.430
 just download this three package 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.869
 in the background they just see that 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.979
 small package that is in my opinion 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.600
 a little girlies 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.970
 but what I really like that 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 red dot visor that is an omg and that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.600
 really the middle so the point of 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.549
 roth.de here and now we come too 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 already for penultimate personalization 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.659
 package and that is by far my 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 favorite package the rock package that 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.630
 just like it well at the camouflage 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.009
 Looking good is a bit bleak as well 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.630
 I will probably use often 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.189
 I have to be honest in the title 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.479
 I think I do not use that at all 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.880
 I do not like it at all 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.530
 the decisive sinti visor 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.360
 both for archeology so far as well 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.829
 the red dot is here they are real 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.270
 great and you can really 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.430
 useful the left not to use 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.410
 and now comes the last package 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.270
 you've all been waiting for that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.190
 Peke punch package from the zombie mode 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.930
 but I have to say the camouflage 10 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.670
 not right out like those from the zombie 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.320
 However , I really like the mode 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.330
 but not as good as the rock package 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.100
 that's the title for this one 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.810
 a little better and I am that 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.560
 nuclear sign at roll points very much 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.270
 really cool 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.100
 So I think that too often 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.720
 use that was it but first for the 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.950
 video I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.390
 and if you are always up to date 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.890
 want to stay and mine 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.630
 videos then do not subscribe 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.070
 if I could help somehow 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.390
 with the video it would not be synonymous if 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.010
 you still surround my thumb 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.480
 I'll say songwriter for now 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.110
 and we are definitely far in the future 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.110
 next video
