00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.680
 hey what wave everyone talks to them mark 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.750
 mex and abroad the tricks and secrets 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.879
 in out link that as you know is the new 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.460
 package map of in guns and it's a 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.439
 remake of the sound map in the black ops 1 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.990
 and bÃ©ticos I will start with some places 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.090
 that maybe there are not those who have not 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.369
 played at black ops 1 do not know but 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.869
 well the mid sector know him well 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.000
 what good guys the first place is 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.050
 upload this container to the best have 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.429
 I saw people who are here and 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.430
 Well, we can just go up 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.610
 the rocks as we have just seen and some 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.710
 guys another place is just in a 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.720
 tower that as you can see we are here 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.080
 in the control room we went up 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.970
 these machines and we climb this kind 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.220
 of balustrade after we do not go up to the 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.220
 tower we jumped a little and ready 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.410
 we can also return to the same 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.890
 hall so a and guys now a 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.480
 let's say glitch or secret more than anything is 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.550
 at the end of the map as you can see us 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.290
 we can go on this railing that is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.030
 as lynched we can get on and 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.900
 remember until you come across a barrier 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.549
 invisible 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.260
 this can be extremely useful when 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.050
 let's say we want 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.180
 to the enemies that are going to respond 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.700
 here close to how winston will be close 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.310
 so to reappear soon and then it's 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.960
 very useful above all and good guys now 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.760
 near the flag of that as they can 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.460
 see here in these boxes there is a site 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.800
 behind them to hide and 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 let's say we can attack the compadres that 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.910
 come from your response and defend the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.320
 flag that we can only 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.420
 return for this same for this same 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.540
 side so some guys now we keep 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.220
 with a site that we say the campers do not 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.010
 there will be someone who will change here 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.780
 then and now guys from this site is not 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.610
 so that they change but so that they know that 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.860
 here you can also put people to 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.100
 to take care of the pump or not, what do I know? 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.260
 want to do in English etc and still 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.580
 guys now coming back to the tower another 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.770
 way to go up is how can I do 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.930
 the rock we jump to this part we see that 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.210
 there are some stairs here and now 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.010
 guys here comes another glitch that I do not know 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.860
 those that are going to show from a 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.720
 principle and it's basically instead of 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.880
 go running all the way down the hall 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.250
 we're just going here with a lot 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.989
 careful and we go through to say 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.680
 up to this point just because it 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.930
 we go through 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.909
 we fall guys as you can see then 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.950
 we have a pretty big visibility 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.810
 of the map and we even have visibility 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.340
 inside the control room of the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.590
 compadres that go down by the 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.969
 stairs there may even be a bit of 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.219
 the stairs in the background so now 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.930
 guys now another trick that is very 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.299
 well, it 's right to get on this part 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.250
 and we can just turn it around 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.810
 as they could see jumping and others and 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.790
 It is very very useful when we want 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.239
 surprise the enemies now guys 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.560
 the next place is just the no 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.609
 it's so useful but let's say it 's very 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.989
 good especially if someone comes to you 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:50.209
 chasing as you can see we can 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.370
 jump on the railing and I do not know how to do the 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.349
 envelop the enemies or something that 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.540
 I was very very well and good guys for 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:58.519
 finalize we have a place like they can 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.859
 see down here the stairs that 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.379
 well guys like it and let's say it's not 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:05.510
 super super useful but nevertheless I have 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.219
 seen people who start to 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.959
 who try to make ninjas because he 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.209
 let's say the bomb will be close to 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.400
 this part and then they can be changed 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.959
 it's so simple to get in but let's say 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.709
 It is very very useful once you are already 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.540
 is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.980
 stay as you are inside because 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.510
 let's say you can accommodate 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.610
 different ways this is 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.230
 a second that as you can see 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.209
 accommodate and you can kill the compadres 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.769
 that go out there without even you 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.079
 see so one of these guys are 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.079
 all the tricks and secrets in public or 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:34.310
 amets in whites 1 so I do not expect anything 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:36.110
 that you liked please vote the 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.930
