00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello everyone I bring a new one in which 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.680
 I'm going to talk about the great match 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.380
 we will see in the semifinals of the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.300
 champions which will be the bayern 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.000
 from Munich but before I want to talk about 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.770
 a subject that I liked a lot and is 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 the partner the possibility of the partner 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.570
 with rpm so good let's start with 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.970
 the video directly without cuts or anything 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.830
 I'm going to give the first of the partner that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.840
 it's a theme for the secondary theme this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.689
 video but I'll start talking about 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.210
 there is that I want first of all 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.829
 clarify some things about that and that is 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 I 'm not going to charge with this business partner 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 if I get it if they finally accept me 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.950
 I'm not going to charge with stefan the according 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.379
 I have been able to inform in the video of 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 presentation of this partner of this 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.309
 network that is in English therefore 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.309
 I can not understand at all but pretty 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.590
 understood and that is not is not based on 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 the collection of models that have that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.850
 panel but more knowledge give to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.460
 learn more about those channels that have the 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 partner is to say that it is a partner for 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.760
 beginners as I like to me because 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 I am a beginner in those youtube 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 I only have a hundred and one subs for both 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.729
 with that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 I have the option of some thumbnails 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.860
 some extra things on youtube and also 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.170
 will give me a little more to know so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.880
 It also makes youtube so good 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.360
 share very very good makes me pretty 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.030
 illusion and I want to talk a little about him 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.590
 I think a channel with just a thousand 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 visits a thousand video views 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.479
 total I can stop that partner 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.250
 that practically have it very many 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 youtubers and as I said is not a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.810
 ccoo partner to collect forgiveness but 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.670
 good is to let you know more about 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.549
 youtube so I do not recommend it for 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.740
 the biggest channels but yes for me 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.649
 channel and therefore and I good I have 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 thanking for this to mother 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.500
 and I think he's a great friend with a 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 great friend no but the companion of 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.080
 twitter in which he informed us all 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.360
 the monkeys their listeners their viewers 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.630
 on twitter do not report a bit about 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.570
 that was here well 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.209
 the option to subscribe or to enter 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.679
 that panel of rpm then I informed myself 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.019
 a little bit well the video of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.900
 presentation of this channel and I saw that it was 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:17.800
 pretty good and was almost was 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.209
 suitable for my channel so I decided 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.870
 continue not to go one step further 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.580
 will sign the contract all that look 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.830
 I was available for my channel I 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.959
 they said that if you sent them the application and 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.780
 now it's only missing that within a day or 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.120
 two send me now if I enter the 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.870
 partner or not what the problem is that 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.000
 which I may not have entered, I do not think 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.430
 that is going to happen that but it is that in my 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 first videos of the first of my 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.150
 videos from my channel those that are not yet 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.790
 deleted because I deleted a lot that 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.440
 they have serious copyright infringements but there are 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.110
 some that do not have any lack of 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.450
 copyright only a warning therefore not 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.450
 I know if with that notice with this notice 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.950
 sorry they are going to put me they are not going to tell me 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.630
 that not in the partner but I think that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.459
 they are going to say yes because it is not any 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.760
 lack is just a copyright notice 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.080
 because I had about 30 seconds of a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.420
 song that can not be 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.090
 it's not worth anything does not take away one or nothing 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.310
 so I think they'll be able to tell me 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.630
 that if you eat a partner because you already 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.120
 ask and what they do 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.430
 subscribers to the visits and all that is 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.580
 so good they agree with my channel 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.230
 and having me as a partner is worth so 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.290
 I'm almost sure they'll accept me 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:33.080
 confirmation is still missing, so 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.880
 I'm not going to say anything yet but it would be 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.650
 very very good that I had it and something else 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.810
 that also does a lot to the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.180
 progression of my channel is that between today 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.130
 and tomorrow a result opens a bit 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.560
 of the tournament there is forgiveness of the tournament of a 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.030
 draw that was made on the channel never of 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.790
 that patron that is the frank 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.670
 gameplays a capturer in which I 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.850
 About 200 people participated 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.860
 and that's why a little more expectations of 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.140
 to be able to win it is worth it because as it is little 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.390
 people who participated because there is more 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.280
 more options that you can win so 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.000
 I'm pretty good waiting for quite a bit 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.860
 to this result and well that would have gone 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.110
 with the capture evidently very much 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.250
 more than play 3 very many life happened to me 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.380
 pretty good in some games 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.750
 private lobería 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.340
 it's pretty good that of the captured if 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.530
 I get it and especially the partner 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.600
 it is the most important news 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.700
 said that has already clarified those issues 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.230
 let's talk about the great game that 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.320
 will live in the semifinals of the 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.830
 champions between barça and bayern de 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.360
 Munich was a pretty bad draw no 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.350
 in what it does to Barcelonism 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.510
 simply because he has touched the worst 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.480
 team that could touch you worse though 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.430
 the real madrid because I remember that 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.750
 bayern of Munich has won almost all 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.450
 the matches he has played and he has even 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.340
 won 2-0 in the two matches against 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.990
 the moments that it is already a lot to say 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.480
 because the events had not yet lost 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.700
 it seems to me at home or something like that 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.280
 it's a lot to say that so pretty 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.020
 I respect you at bayern so 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.810
 so much I hope it's a match of those 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:08.090
 that in mono is the expectation that will be 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.340
 a match some better semifinals than 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.820
 has been lived for now the champions and 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.910
 another thing that has to be said is that 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.880
 if the barça wins if it would be poetic 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.590
 If Barcelona wins, the 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.009
 final and probably against the real 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.409
 Madrid 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.020
 we would see a final barcelona / madrid that 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.849
 I think I'm not going to assure that but I think that 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.550
 It has never been seen rarely 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.559
 and let what is going to be doing that to 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.909
 final forgiveness what can become 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.339
 this final will be incredible 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:39.050
 barcelona-madrid but I already tell you I have 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:41.330
 quite respect for what the 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.249
 bayern for their numbers because for me the 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.619
 Bayern is now but the best team in the 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:47.990
 world tied with Barcelona a little 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:49.729
 less but it is the second or the first 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.830
 team of the world best team in the world 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.889
 so quite respect the truth has 

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:57.439
 plays and good makes me see what 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:59.210
 can bring us this game in addition to 

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:01.699
 that Barcelona has enough casualties 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:04.819
 as is the case with some defenses and 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:07.129
 also messi that you do not know yet very 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.589
 well if you are going to be able to be in that 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:12.020
 I find so let's put the 

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:15.110
 high expectations let's put a 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:19.159
 draw on the first day that as 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:22.009
 you know it will be in the bayern field and in the 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:24.020
 back we are going to put a victory of 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.059
 barcelona because obviously not the 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.620
 amateurs of madrid I do not know if they prefer 

00:06:26.059 --> 00:06:28.340
 that Barcelona wins because then it 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.430
 I would see a row 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:32.840
 madrid-barça almost certainly is not what 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.520
 I want to assure because Madrid has 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.590
 have to play against the bayern of the 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.750
 equipment that he could touch was this was 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.790
 the looser but you also have to 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.669
 say that the Madrid has not won the 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.919
 Bayern and pardon to Borussia in the phase 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.380
 of group so we do not know no but yes 

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.940
 if they play the final barça-madrid I think 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.760
 that the spectators of madrid also 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.530
 They not feel like that but hey let 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:57.080
 to see what this semi-final holds 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.580
 of champions that promises a lot and that 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.740
 I think it's going to be one of the most 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.229
 exciting of the last years of the 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.590
 selection is almost certain and go on 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:09.979
 barcelona and real madrid for russia is a 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:11.540
 party that also a little bit of good at 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.430
 madrid also has a bit of desire not 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.900
 have a bit of desire that you should 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.410
 show that it is better than Borussia 

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:21.320
 what can you win and well let's see 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.820
 what separates us this champions we are going to 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.400
 see who reaches the final 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.470
 let's see what the matches will be like if 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.690
 they are of the expectations that we have 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:32.060
 all or it will be a little worse or a bit 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.320
 better than it is already difficult and good until 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.129

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.989
