and encode the whole thing and upload

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.080

instead of taking around 20 minutes to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.510 
instead of taking around 20 minutes to
make<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.270> 15-minute<00:01:37.049> video<00:01:37.229> I'm<00:01:38.100> spending

make a 15-minute video I'm spending
hours<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.360> video<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.900> much<00:01:40.110> shorter<00:01:40.619> so

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
hours on a video that's much shorter so

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
hours on a video that's much shorter so
eventually<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.640> caught<00:01:41.880> up<00:01:42.060> with<00:01:42.210> me<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> I

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
eventually that caught up with me and I

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.569 
eventually that caught up with me and I

didn't want to spend hours working on a
video<00:01:45.259> also<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.290> got<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.649> lot<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> impatient

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
comments about when's the next episode

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.789 
comments about when's the next episode
like<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.119> said<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.750> appreciate<00:01:52.649> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
like I said I appreciate the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
like I said I appreciate the
anticipation<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.939> certain<00:01:54.720> people<00:01:54.750> took<00:01:55.200> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
anticipation but certain people took it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.850 
anticipation but certain people took it
from<00:01:55.530> being<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.070> fan<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.670> outright<00:01:57.119> rudeness

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
from being a fan to outright rudeness

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
from being a fan to outright rudeness
demanding<00:01:58.860> videos<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.549> think<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.390> goes<00:02:00.509> without

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
demanding videos I think it goes without

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.420 
demanding videos I think it goes without
saying<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.560> owe<00:02:01.860> anything<00:02:02.250> to

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
saying that I don't owe anything to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.030 
saying that I don't owe anything to
anybody<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.270> entertain<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.290> guys<00:02:04.439> for<00:02:04.770> free

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and you don't have to do anything for me

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.650 
and you don't have to do anything for me
so<00:02:07.170> when<00:02:07.979> people<00:02:08.129> make<00:02:08.429> demands<00:02:08.910> it<00:02:09.300> has<00:02:09.479> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
so when people make demands it has the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.760 
so when people make demands it has the
opposite<00:02:10.140> effect<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:10.770> intended

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
opposite effect that they intended

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.830 
opposite effect that they intended
it<00:02:11.920> makes<00:02:12.220> me<00:02:12.520> want<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:12.970> work<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.330> the<00:02:13.450> series

it makes me want to work on the series

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.310 
it makes me want to work on the series
even<00:02:14.080> less<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.820> third<00:02:16.060> reason<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:17.080> fact

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
even less the third reason is the fact

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.990 
even less the third reason is the fact
that<00:02:17.500> there<00:02:17.740> aren't<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.280> many<00:02:18.340> videogame

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
came up with the idea I had about 20

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.700 
came up with the idea I had about 20
episodes<00:02:48.910> planned<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.630> I<00:02:50.110> figured<00:02:50.410> I'd<00:02:50.500> come

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
episodes planned and I figured I'd come

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.470 
episodes planned and I figured I'd come
up<00:02:50.770> with<00:02:51.010> more<00:02:51.190> ideas<00:02:51.250> along<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.030> way<00:02:52.210> or

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
up with more ideas along the way or

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
up with more ideas along the way or
people<00:02:52.780> would<00:02:52.930> suggest<00:02:53.170> more<00:02:53.650> ideas<00:02:54.010> around

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
people would suggest more ideas around

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.450 
people would suggest more ideas around
the<00:02:54.460> way<00:02:54.610> my<00:02:55.480> list<00:02:55.720> expanded<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.530> about<00:02:56.770> 25<00:02:57.430> or

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 
the way my list expanded to about 25 or

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.150 
the way my list expanded to about 25 or
maybe<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.090> little<00:02:58.240> lower<00:02:58.540> episodes<00:02:59.200> but<00:02:59.920> there

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
maybe a little lower episodes but there

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.830 
maybe a little lower episodes but there
were<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.280> few<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.730> i<00:03:00.790> lumped<00:03:01.150> together<00:03:01.270> such

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
were a few that i lumped together such

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.720 
were a few that i lumped together such
as<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.110> borough<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.620> poison<00:03:03.130> legends<00:03:03.520> and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
as the borough and poison legends and

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.670 
as the borough and poison legends and
some<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.630> I<00:03:04.660> decided<00:03:05.050> weren't<00:03:05.530> worth

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
some that I decided weren't worth

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.180 
some that I decided weren't worth
talking<00:03:05.980> about<00:03:06.220> so<00:03:06.700> it<00:03:06.880> got<00:03:07.030> reduced<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.570> 22<00:03:08.200> so

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
the series now I'm not saying that I'll

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.340 
the series now I'm not saying that I'll
never<00:03:36.340> continued<00:03:37.000> it<00:03:37.150> but<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.750> series<00:03:38.140> is

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
essentially over any ideas that come up

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.690 
essentially over any ideas that come up
in<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.200> future<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.860> I<00:03:41.950> think<00:03:42.160> are<00:03:42.220> worth<00:03:42.459> it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
in the future that I think are worth it

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.600 
in the future that I think are worth it
will<00:03:42.940> be<00:03:43.120> done<00:03:43.360> but<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.290> don't<00:03:44.680> anticipate<00:03:45.040> it

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
will be done but I don't anticipate it

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.420 
will be done but I don't anticipate it
happening<00:03:46.060> too<00:03:46.300> often<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.680> that's<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.190> bad

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
happening too often so that's the bad

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.580 
happening too often so that's the bad

weekend<00:03:52.780> essentially<00:03:53.470> going<00:03:53.709> into<00:03:54.040> an

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
weekend essentially going into an

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.449 
weekend essentially going into an
indefinite<00:03:54.850> hiatus<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:56.320> there<00:03:56.950> is<00:03:57.130> a<00:03:57.160> good

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
indefinite hiatus but there is a good

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.540 
indefinite hiatus but there is a good

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
part to this despite the time-consuming

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.400 
part to this despite the time-consuming
nature<00:04:01.270> of<00:04:01.360> the<00:04:01.480> series<00:04:01.900> and<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.170> minor

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
nature of the series and the minor

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.370 
nature of the series and the minor
annoyances<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.250> came<00:04:03.550> up<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.970> enjoy<00:04:04.780> doing<00:04:05.080> it

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
annoyances that came up I enjoy doing it

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.770 
annoyances that came up I enjoy doing it
and<00:04:05.740> it's<00:04:06.670> clear<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> me<00:04:07.240> that<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.540> all

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and it's clear to me that you all

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.870 
and it's clear to me that you all
enjoyed<00:04:07.810> it<00:04:08.350> quite<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.620> lot<00:04:08.770> as<00:04:09.100> well<00:04:09.130> from<00:04:09.730> all

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
enjoyed it quite a lot as well from all

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.660 
enjoyed it quite a lot as well from all
the<00:04:10.060> comments<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:10.600> views<00:04:10.810> I<00:04:11.020> got<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.670> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
the comments and views I got and the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.180 
the comments and views I got and the
requests<00:04:13.150> for<00:04:13.300> new<00:04:13.390> episodes<00:04:13.510> of<00:04:13.989> course<00:04:14.320> the

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
requests for new episodes of course the

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.039 
requests for new episodes of course the
reason<00:04:15.370> it's<00:04:15.670> ending<00:04:16.060> is<00:04:16.239> because<00:04:16.600> the<00:04:16.720> scope

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
reason it's ending is because the scope

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.610 
reason it's ending is because the scope
of<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.380> series<00:04:17.799> was<00:04:17.980> always<00:04:18.370> quite<00:04:18.700> narrow<00:04:19.060> or

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
of the series was always quite narrow or

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.710 
of the series was always quite narrow or
so<00:04:20.620> i'll<00:04:21.370> be<00:04:21.640> replacing<00:04:21.940> it<00:04:22.419> with<00:04:22.450> a<00:04:22.630> new

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
so i'll be replacing it with a new

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.580 
so i'll be replacing it with a new
series<00:04:23.200> that

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
series that

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.010 
series that
as<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.710> similar<00:04:24.220> theme<00:04:24.580> but<00:04:25.270> a<00:04:25.330> much<00:04:25.660> broader

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
as a similar theme but a much broader

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.830 
as a similar theme but a much broader
scope<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:27.490> new<00:04:27.669> series<00:04:27.970> will<00:04:28.360> also<00:04:28.660> have<00:04:28.810> a

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
scope the new series will also have a

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.560 
scope the new series will also have a
schedule<00:04:29.410> it'll<00:04:30.130> be<00:04:30.220> updated<00:04:30.730> weekly<00:04:30.940> but<00:04:31.449> to

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
schedule it'll be updated weekly but to

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.270 
schedule it'll be updated weekly but to
prevent<00:04:31.900> me<00:04:31.960> from<00:04:32.050> getting<00:04:32.320> burned<00:04:32.710> out<00:04:33.040> on<00:04:33.070> it

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
prevent me from getting burned out on it

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.730 
prevent me from getting burned out on it
and<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:34.150> give<00:04:34.300> me<00:04:34.479> some<00:04:34.930> time<00:04:35.169> to<00:04:35.199> come<00:04:35.560> up<00:04:35.710> with

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
and to give me some time to come up with

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.580 
and to give me some time to come up with
more<00:04:36.010> ideas<00:04:36.070> it<00:04:37.030> will<00:04:37.300> adopt<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.960> season

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
more ideas it will adopt a season

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.980 
more ideas it will adopt a season

an example I plan on doing an episode
where<00:05:06.190> I<00:05:06.250> explain<00:05:06.639> exactly<00:05:07.330> what<00:05:07.570> bits<00:05:07.870> are<00:05:08.169> I

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
where I explain exactly what bits are I

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.000 
where I explain exactly what bits are I
get<00:05:09.250> that<00:05:09.370> question<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:10.419> lot<00:05:10.450> like<00:05:10.960> if<00:05:11.320> the<00:05:11.560> NES

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
get that question a lot like if the NES

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.700 
get that question a lot like if the NES
in<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.250> Atari<00:05:12.580> 2600<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.570> both<00:05:13.720> 8-bit<00:05:14.229> systems

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
in the Atari 2600 of both 8-bit systems

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.890 
in the Atari 2600 of both 8-bit systems
how<00:05:15.280> come<00:05:15.490> the<00:05:15.580> NES<00:05:15.970> games<00:05:16.300> look<00:05:16.510> so<00:05:16.750> much

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
how come the NES games look so much

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.440 
how come the NES games look so much
better<00:05:17.110> and<00:05:17.470> what<00:05:17.950> our<00:05:17.979> bits<00:05:18.340> anyway<00:05:18.760> well

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
better and what our bits anyway well

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.420 
better and what our bits anyway well
I'll<00:05:19.690> be<00:05:19.840> explaining<00:05:20.200> it<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:20.740> clear-cut<00:05:21.039> way

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
I'll be explaining it in a clear-cut way
