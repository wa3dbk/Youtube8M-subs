00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
gaming before because we'll do things

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.630 
gaming before because we'll do things
like<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.450> golf<00:01:40.840> game<00:01:41.109> where<00:01:42.039> if<00:01:42.399> it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
like that golf game where if it's

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.719 
like that golf game where if it's
sitting<00:01:43.060> in<00:01:43.270> sand<00:01:44.170> it's<00:01:45.039> going<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.369> feel

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
sitting in sand it's going to feel

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.870

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
feature on the Wii Remote Plus than if

feature on the Wii Remote Plus than if
it's<00:01:52.630> sitting<00:01:53.020> on<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.229> putting<00:01:53.920> surface<00:01:54.689> that's

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
it's sitting on a putting surface that's

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.779 
it's sitting on a putting surface that's
the<00:01:55.929> innovation<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.590> has<00:01:56.709> to<00:01:57.039> be<00:01:57.069> exciting

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
the innovation that has to be exciting

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:00.209 
the innovation that has to be exciting
and<00:01:57.939> that's<00:01:58.659> that's<00:01:58.989> what<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.590> think<00:02:00.039> we're

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
and that's that's what I think we're

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:09.279 
and that's that's what I think we're
bringing<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.229> gaming<00:02:02.560> industry

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.649 

Fermi<00:02:10.289> hope<00:02:10.439> for<00:02:10.709> you<00:02:10.829> for<00:02:11.400> me<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.790> think<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:12.659 
Fermi hope for you for me I think it is

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.630 
Fermi hope for you for me I think it is
the<00:02:12.840> most<00:02:12.959> innovative<00:02:13.290> and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.519> we've

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
the most innovative and I think we've

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.309 
the most innovative and I think we've
done<00:02:14.849> some<00:02:15.060> pretty<00:02:15.239> innovative<00:02:15.569> things<00:02:16.049> I

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
done some pretty innovative things I

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.800 
done some pretty innovative things I
think<00:02:17.099> this<00:02:17.310> takes<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.849> potential<00:02:18.599> for

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
think this takes the potential for

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.730 
think this takes the potential for
gaming<00:02:19.170> experiences<00:02:19.739> to<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> whole<00:02:20.099> new<00:02:20.220> place

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.500 

so<00:02:26.740> it's<00:02:26.980> been<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> number<00:02:27.490> of<00:02:27.520> years<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.270> we

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
so it's been a number of years and we

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.640 
so it's been a number of years and we
started<00:02:28.870> working<00:02:29.050> on<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.740> before<00:02:31.650> tablets

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
started working on this before tablets

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.470 
started working on this before tablets
were<00:02:33.430> launched<00:02:35.160> interestingly<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.760> way<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
were launched interestingly the way the

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.100 
were launched interestingly the way the
idea<00:02:37.900> came<00:02:38.350> about<00:02:38.490> was<00:02:39.490> when<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.900> key

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
idea came about was when the key

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.660 
idea came about was when the key
developers<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:42.070> people<00:02:42.520> working<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.560> mr.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

they<00:02:49.830> started<00:02:50.189> coming<00:02:50.280> up<00:02:50.519> with<00:02:50.580> ideas<00:02:50.790> that

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
they started coming up with ideas that

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.589 
they started coming up with ideas that

leverage do screams but but in a home
console<00:02:55.079> environment<00:02:55.650> not<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:55.920> in<00:02:56.310> a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
console environment not just in a

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.589 
console environment not just in a
handheld<00:02:56.730> admire<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:58.670> it<00:02:59.670> challenged<00:03:00.329> us<00:03:00.450> to

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
handheld admire and it challenged us to

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.929 
handheld admire and it challenged us to
say<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.930> know<00:03:01.370> that's<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:02.549> we<00:03:02.730> need<00:03:02.849> to

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
say you know that's what we need to

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.670 
say you know that's what we need to
create<00:03:03.180> but<00:03:03.629> we<00:03:03.720> need<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:03.959> create<00:03:04.260> it<00:03:04.439> when

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
create but we need to create it when

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.860 
create but we need to create it when
there's<00:03:04.829> no<00:03:05.040> latency<00:03:05.459> there's<00:03:06.030> no<00:03:06.269> delay<00:03:06.599> in

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
there's no latency there's no delay in

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.170 
there's no latency there's no delay in
what<00:03:07.500> I'm<00:03:07.620> seeing<00:03:07.920> on<00:03:08.040> this<00:03:08.430> screen<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.060> what

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
what I'm seeing on this screen and what

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.119 
what I'm seeing on this screen and what
I'm<00:03:09.299> saying<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.629> this<00:03:09.780> screen<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.799> was<00:03:11.099> a

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
I'm saying on this screen so that was a

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.920 
I'm saying on this screen so that was a
development<00:03:11.670> challenge<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.329> we<00:03:12.480> had<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.750> do

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
development challenge that we had to do

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.410 
development challenge that we had to do
we<00:03:13.230> had<00:03:13.379> to<00:03:13.500> create<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.310> technology<00:03:15.180> that

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
we had to create the technology that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.289 
we had to create the technology that
would<00:03:16.079> allow<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.620> happen<00:03:16.909> and<00:03:17.909> so<00:03:18.150> it's

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
would allow that to happen and so it's

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.720 
would allow that to happen and so it's
been<00:03:18.390> a<00:03:18.510> number<00:03:18.840> of<00:03:18.870> years<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.409> now<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.310> mean

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
been a number of years and now I mean

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.729 
been a number of years and now I mean
you've<00:03:20.849> played<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.269> there's<00:03:21.989> no<00:03:22.200> delay<00:03:22.500> at<00:03:22.620> all

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
you've played it there's no delay at all

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:29.720 
you've played it there's no delay at all
and<00:03:23.549> what's<00:03:23.760> going

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.810 

so<00:03:30.750> as<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.900> said<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.740> Wii<00:03:32.920> U<00:03:33.130> is<00:03:33.340> going<00:03:33.610> to<00:03:33.700> be

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
so as you said the Wii U is going to be

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.200 
so as you said the Wii U is going to be
fully<00:03:34.120> backward<00:03:34.660> compatible<00:03:35.290> with<00:03:35.740> we<00:03:36.210> not

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
fully backward compatible with we not

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.520 
fully backward compatible with we not
only<00:03:37.240> the<00:03:37.570> song<00:03:37.780> car<00:03:38.020> but<00:03:38.170> all<00:03:38.320> of<00:03:38.440> the

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
only the song car but all of the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.520 
only the song car but all of the
accessories<00:03:38.830> as<00:03:39.250> well<00:03:39.280> so<00:03:39.880> the<00:03:40.840> balance<00:03:41.260> board

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
accessories as well so the balance board

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.880 
accessories as well so the balance board
will<00:03:42.130> work<00:03:42.400> with<00:03:42.760> the<00:03:42.910> system<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.870> wii<00:03:44.470> remote

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
will work with the system the wii remote

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.180 
will work with the system the wii remote
plus<00:03:44.920> will<00:03:45.490> work<00:03:45.700> with<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.030> system<00:03:46.680> this<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.920> /

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
plus will work with the system this a /

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.460 
plus will work with the system this a /
you<00:03:48.880> know<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.120> terms<00:03:49.360> of<00:03:50.220> link<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.430> wii

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
you know in terms of link to a wii

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.110 
you know in terms of link to a wii
remote<00:03:53.470> or<00:03:53.650> wii<00:03:53.800> remote<00:03:54.070> plus<00:03:54.100> will<00:03:54.790> work<00:03:54.940> with

remote or wii remote plus will work with

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.560 
remote or wii remote plus will work with
the<00:03:55.150> system<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.760> games<00:03:58.030> will<00:03:58.240> not<00:03:58.420> be

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
the system the games will not be

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.960 
the system the games will not be
upscaled<00:03:58.900> right<00:03:59.650> because<00:03:59.980> that's<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.490> is

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
upscaled right because that's that is

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.970 
upscaled right because that's that is
inherent<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.720> software<00:04:02.110> not<00:04:02.620> in<00:04:02.860> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
inherent in the software not in the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.100 
inherent in the software not in the
hardware<00:04:03.220> but<00:04:04.090> all<00:04:04.330> of<00:04:04.480> you<00:04:04.660> know<00:04:04.750> so<00:04:04.960> if

creating a smash brothers that has

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.330 
creating a smash brothers that has
interaction<00:04:46.150> between<00:04:47.110> the<00:04:47.200> home<00:04:47.350> console<00:04:47.800> and

and what are those details he hasn't
finalized<00:04:53.449> the<00:04:53.570> direction<00:04:53.870> because<00:04:54.169> they're

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
finalized the direction because they're

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.100 
finalized the direction because they're
still<00:04:54.740> finishing<00:04:55.250> kid<00:04:55.490> icarus<00:04:55.630> but<00:04:56.630> we've

still finishing kid icarus but we've
committed<00:04:57.470> them<00:04:57.740> we're<00:04:57.889> going<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.100> do<00:04:58.220> that

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
committed them we're going to do that

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.680 
committed them we're going to do that
and<00:04:58.669> we're<00:04:58.790> going<00:04:58.940> to<00:04:59.000> have<00:04:59.150> it<00:04:59.270> interplay

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
and we're going to have it interplay

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.460 
and we're going to have it interplay
between<00:05:00.580> between<00:05:01.580> smash<00:05:02.300> brothers<00:05:02.600> on

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
between between smash brothers on

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:11.050 
between between smash brothers on
for<00:05:03.650> devices<00:05:04.310> 3ds<00:05:04.730> and<00:05:05.420> be

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.450 

so<00:05:12.060> at<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.960> start<00:05:13.020> when<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> consumer<00:05:13.950> buys

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
so at the start when the consumer buys

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.090 
so at the start when the consumer buys
hardware<00:05:15.030> they're<00:05:15.930> going<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.170> get<00:05:16.380> the

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
hardware they're going to get the

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.280 
hardware they're going to get the
console<00:05:17.580> they're<00:05:18.480> going<00:05:18.600> to<00:05:18.690> get<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:18.960> remote

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
console they're going to get the remote

console they're going to get the remote
they're<00:05:19.800> going<00:05:19.920> to<00:05:20.040> get<00:05:20.130> the<00:05:20.400> necessary

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
they're going to get the necessary

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.680 
they're going to get the necessary
accessories<00:05:22.020> power<00:05:22.590> cord<00:05:22.980> etc<00:05:23.160> etc<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:24.420> just

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
accessories power cord etc etc but just

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.350 
accessories power cord etc etc but just
one<00:05:25.160> wii<00:05:26.160> u<00:05:26.370> remote<00:05:26.840> and<00:05:28.670> there's<00:05:29.670> a<00:05:29.730> simple

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
one wii u remote and there's a simple

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.630 
one wii u remote and there's a simple
reason<00:05:30.630> for<00:05:30.780> them<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.170> is<00:05:31.560> that<00:05:31.890> this<00:05:32.400> is

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:32.640 
reason for them and that is that this is

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.820 
reason for them and that is that this is
going<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:32.970> be<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.180> quite<00:05:33.660> complicated<00:05:34.170> quite

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
going to be a quite complicated quite

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.140 
going to be a quite complicated quite
expensive<00:05:35.690> you<00:05:36.690> know<00:05:36.780> controller<00:05:37.320> and<00:05:37.970> we<00:05:38.970> are

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:39.150 
expensive you know controller and we are

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:41.270 
expensive you know controller and we are
concerned<00:05:39.960> that<00:05:40.230> we<00:05:40.350> want<00:05:40.530> to<00:05:40.620> make<00:05:40.800> sure<00:05:40.830> that

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
concerned that we want to make sure that

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.050 
concerned that we want to make sure that
the<00:05:41.520> system<00:05:42.060> is<00:05:42.300> as<00:05:42.720> affordable<00:05:43.350> as<00:05:43.440> possible

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
the system is as affordable as possible

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:46.670 
the system is as affordable as possible
so<00:05:45.060> initially<00:05:45.420> will<00:05:45.870> create<00:05:46.230> experiences

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
so initially will create experiences

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.920 
so initially will create experiences
that<00:05:47.100> leverage<00:05:47.460> only<00:05:47.820> one<00:05:48.180> wii<00:05:48.840> u<00:05:49.050> controller

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
that leverage only one wii u controller

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.810 
that leverage only one wii u controller
but<00:05:51.930> certainly<00:05:52.370> we've<00:05:53.370> heard<00:05:53.640> it<00:05:53.730> from

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
but certainly we've heard it from

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.460 
but certainly we've heard it from
developers<00:05:54.390> we<00:05:54.720> hear<00:05:54.990> it<00:05:55.110> from<00:05:55.290> these

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
developers we hear it from these

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.800 
developers we hear it from these
interviews<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:56.100> people<00:05:56.430> want<00:05:56.730> to<00:05:57.570> have<00:05:57.780> a

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
interviews that people want to have a

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.500 
interviews that people want to have a
social<00:05:58.380> side<00:05:59.100> by<00:05:59.340> side<00:05:59.640> experience<00:06:00.330> where

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:00.510 
social side by side experience where

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.420 
social side by side experience where
each<00:06:00.690> of<00:06:00.840> us<00:06:00.900> have<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.140> controller<00:06:01.590> and<00:06:02.250> so

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
each of us have a controller and so

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:04.010 
each of us have a controller and so
that's<00:06:02.640> something<00:06:02.880> that<00:06:03.060> we<00:06:03.390> hear<00:06:03.840> and<00:06:03.960> we

that's something that we hear and we
understand<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:07.520> see

00:06:09.239 --> 00:06:09.249

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.690 
we know how important it is to bring
these<00:06:24.250> systems<00:06:24.790> into<00:06:25.150> the<00:06:25.330> market<00:06:25.990> at<00:06:26.860> a<00:06:26.919> value

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
these systems into the market at a value

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.300 
these systems into the market at a value
price<00:06:27.970> unless<00:06:28.960> we<00:06:29.230> talked<00:06:29.500> about<00:06:29.770> with<00:06:29.950> Brazil

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.310

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:33.870 
that's what took us so long to be
formally<00:06:32.680> in<00:06:32.770> Brazil<00:06:33.130> this<00:06:33.310> we<00:06:33.550> wanted<00:06:33.850> to

proposition<00:06:36.250> and<00:06:36.430> so<00:06:37.530> for<00:06:38.530> Wii<00:06:38.980> U<00:06:39.010> it<00:06:39.610> will<00:06:39.940> be

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
proposition and so for Wii U it will be

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.600 
proposition and so for Wii U it will be
a<00:06:40.389> great<00:06:40.720> value<00:06:40.960> but<00:06:41.500> what<00:06:41.830> is<00:06:41.950> exactly<00:06:42.520> that
