like where is it unless you like look up
I<00:05:31.979> guess<00:05:32.340> this<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.639> like<00:05:32.669> a<00:05:32.849> Top<00:05:33.210> Shot<00:05:33.479> figure<00:05:33.930> I

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
I guess this is like a Top Shot figure I

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.309 
I guess this is like a Top Shot figure I
guess<00:05:36.629> this<00:05:36.840> is<00:05:36.990> high<00:05:38.659> really<00:05:39.659> good<00:05:39.900> though

00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 
guess this is high really good though

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:42.279 
guess this is high really good though
it's<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.620> good<00:05:40.770> representation<00:05:41.069> of<00:05:41.430> gone<00:05:41.669> I

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
it's a good representation of gone I

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.999 
it's a good representation of gone I
like<00:05:43.289> tequila<00:05:43.439> I<00:05:44.189> didn't<00:05:45.180> get<00:05:45.330> down<00:05:45.539> one<00:05:45.719> cuz

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
like tequila I didn't get down one cuz

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:53.529 
like tequila I didn't get down one cuz
no<00:05:50.539> it<00:05:51.539> would<00:05:51.719> be<00:05:51.750> good<00:05:52.050> if<00:05:52.139> they<00:05:52.289> remake<00:05:52.770> him<00:05:53.009> I

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:53.539 
no it would be good if they remake him I

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:56.119 
no it would be good if they remake him I
made<00:05:54.539> a<00:05:54.569> better<00:05:54.930> one<00:05:55.139> like<00:05:55.349> what<00:05:55.680> they<00:05:55.830> do<00:05:55.979> with

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129 
made a better one like what they do with

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:59.719 
made a better one like what they do with
the<00:05:56.219> PIO<00:05:56.400> piece<00:05:56.669> like<00:05:57.029> the<00:05:57.180> 1.5<00:05:58.020> volt<00:05:58.580> is<00:05:59.580> it<00:05:59.699> a

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
the PIO piece like the 1.5 volt is it a

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:03.129 
the PIO piece like the 1.5 volt is it a
very<00:06:00.000> good<00:06:00.240> better<00:06:00.509> version<00:06:00.990> of<00:06:01.110> the<00:06:01.349> figure

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
very good better version of the figure

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.179 
very good better version of the figure
then<00:06:04.139> I'd<00:06:04.319> probably<00:06:04.500> get<00:06:04.889> it<00:06:06.800> but<00:06:07.800> yeah<00:06:07.949> that's

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:08.189 
then I'd probably get it but yeah that's

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:12.279 
then I'd probably get it but yeah that's
it<00:06:08.430> for<00:06:08.639> gone<00:06:08.819> streaks<00:06:09.659> I'm<00:06:10.650> hunter<00:06:11.009> x<00:06:11.129> hunter
