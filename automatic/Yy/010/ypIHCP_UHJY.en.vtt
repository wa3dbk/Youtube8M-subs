00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:12.210
 hello friends today made a 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.820
 christmas tree in 3d ah yes like that 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.029
 there the control we want to have the video 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.380
 ok well well i'll take a little 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.380
 honey milk not waiting 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:36.320
 days to make a Christmas tree in 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.350
 3d like this one it's very simple it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.760
 you just have to have a pair of 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:47.809
 scissors a criterion a ruler and the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.170
 paper card the hymn of green color 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:55.010
 like these colors fir or the most 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:58.570
 close to this color the first 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:07.840
 thing to do is a big rectangle 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:07.840
 8 cm wide and 20 cm long 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:24.600
 once you have drawn your 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:29.520
 rectangle you can cut it a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 times cut out trace a vertical for 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 divide this space into two to four 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:44.720
 centimeters and a horizontal so at the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.720
 half also to 10 cm to 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:02.380
 after 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:07.990
 fold the cardboard in half at 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:11.550
 this level a is divided so this 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.550
 space in 5 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.500
 that is to say a very early and 2 cm 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:31.600
 now we will trace the trunk 1 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:34.110
 cm 2 or 1 cm 5 on each side of the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.110
 vertical 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.610
 the trunk must be at the base of the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:50.490
 carton that is not bound 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:55.950
 here is what I propose to you 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:58.160
 make a triangle between these three 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.160
 points 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.220
 here 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.599
 then points in the middle between the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.599
 center the end 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.670
 that will allow you to trace 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.670
 here the branches 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.810
 now coupons 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.810
 all that is too much 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.480
 at 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.380
 with a pair of scissors 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:46.610
 here is the cutting and realize you have 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:53.270
 so two fir trees so the first one you 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:55.990
 cut the center to the middle a 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.990
 so far 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:03.690
 and the second you cut the center 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:10.120
 also to the middle but in the 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.120
 reverse 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:22.430
 that's after you just have to 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:40.969
 assemble the two halves if they want 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:42.469
 Well here is your tree in 3d at 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:46.400
 from which you return your 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:50.949
 fir tree and you bend the tongues 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.949
 here one after the other 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.430
 here 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:33.500
 a christmas tree in 3d with apples and 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.440
 well thank you for your attention 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.700
 Christmas tree takes a beautiful 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.630
 dimension with you 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.690
 I am very proud of it goodbye and very 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.690
