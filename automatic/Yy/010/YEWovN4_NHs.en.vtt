00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 you tech fanatics 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.340
 Hello, welcome, I'm a factory. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.609
 Today we are going to talk for a little bit 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.830
 about playing in 4k on pc's without 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.529
 need a monitor or swallowed it 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.890
 well you both ask who it was 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.560
 asking for that lets me explain to anyone 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.019
 asked in fact but every time I 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.620
 tell someone how cool it is to play in 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.829
 4k always had the same old question 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.590
 our house has played away from home and 4k is the 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.370
 hottest thing in the world hotter than 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.680
 invented ratify your monitor baby 4k 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.620
 good face from there you can already 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.559
 deduct the remainder from explaining 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.289
 blowjob and the guy how it works play 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.629
 in 4k of the normal blessed monitor 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.620
 and to repeat this several and several 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.449
 times 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.219
 I decided to make a link to the guys yet 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.870
 who does not know this does not know how 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.670
 works well if you are 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 watching this video you must be 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.770
 Wondering why the hell I want to? 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.049
 put the game on 4k play on 4 each 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.150
 make the image look much sharper than 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.280
 that the normal addition is clear to increase the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.380
 Resolution of the game this is logical but may 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.689
 be also that the game has the filters there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.180
 those anti filters his side at the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.700
 lazio can be end even with filters 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 the game still remain very serrated 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.650
 and putting the game in 4k solves a lot 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 this problem but this is all logical that 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.400
 has a processing course 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.159
 do not go there thinking you're going to 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.930
 game 4 I'll be all your wonder 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.540
 pc will have to have a configuration of the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.939
 holding to keep up the stride and of course 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.100
 do not mess with the performance of the game there 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.060
 you will make another little question but 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.420
 How do I play? 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.460
 while a cassio on a monitor only supports 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 1920 per 1080 fipe for you to understand 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.930
 This first I need to talk about two 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.850
 technologies 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.480
 the first is for the board 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.970
 nvidia and is called bsr you prefer the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.720
 emi that super resolution the other to 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.030
 ags boards called vsr virtual 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.890
 super resolution without getting too much into 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.410
 basically details the two technologies 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.940
 do the same thing as getting a 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.190
 much larger picture 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 scales to a resolution that supports 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.520
 your monitor 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.310
 so you do not need a 4k monitor 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.140
 very big and a 4k tv to power 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.570
 rotate your games from this resolution 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.780
 that's your lcb screen and playing in a 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.330
 corner oled there 21 inches 22 is 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.160
 played on the streets because it will be able to use 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.060
 quietly by playing your games in 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.890
 4k 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.080
 in the case of nvidia cards that have 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.910
 support sr's technology 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.830
 just open the control panel should 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.500
 prevent clicking on manage the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.540
 settings and look for the option 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.060
 from sr factors 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.360
 there you will have to check all the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:59.750
 resolutions are there softness 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.049
 maintains the standard to 33% apply the 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.900
 changes and restarts the pc you have the 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.330
 amd user already knowing the technology 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.350
 give a thrashing there to know how to do 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.810
 this in your driver 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.070
 After all, since even the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.170
 Go and get your fish. 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.030
 I'll leave here in the field descriptions 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.010
 two links to you have met a 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.690
 little more about technologies 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.150
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.910
 video that has helped you discover 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.250
 how to play your games in 4k appear 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.170
 who later puts his games in 4k and 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.180
 tell us how we got performance 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.860
 Did you like the beauty tip I'm going? 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.030
 staying here but leave that big 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.630
 Hugs to you 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.630
 bye
