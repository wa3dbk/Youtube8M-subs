guide when the manuals are lost and not
being<00:02:06.240> used<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.560> very<00:02:07.920> important<00:02:08.610> because

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
being used is is very important because

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.140 
being used is is very important because
this<00:02:09.420> machine<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.310> complex<00:02:11.310> enough<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.000> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this machine is complex enough that you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.760 
this machine is complex enough that you
can't<00:02:12.420> possibly<00:02:13.080> remember<00:02:13.650> all<00:02:14.340> of<00:02:14.370> the

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
can't possibly remember all of the

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.740 
can't possibly remember all of the
ways<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:15.980> set<00:02:16.490> it<00:02:16.640> up<00:02:16.790> for<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.150> different<00:02:17.510> uses

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
ways to set it up for the different uses

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.470 
ways to set it up for the different uses
so<00:02:18.350> we<00:02:18.950> have<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.190> thread<00:02:19.610> guide<00:02:19.880> here<00:02:20.270> which

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
so we have a thread guide here which

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.590 
so we have a thread guide here which
shows<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:20.960> different<00:02:21.620> colors<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:23.330> is

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
shows the different colors and it is

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.830 
shows the different colors and it is
also<00:02:24.200> shows<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.710> little<00:02:25.100> diagram<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:26.240> picture

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
also shows a little diagram of a picture

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.590 
also shows a little diagram of a picture

were going to use a fourth red which is
this<00:02:39.170> setup<00:02:39.440> for<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.850> tells<00:02:41.180> you<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
this setup for now it tells you the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.630 
this setup for now it tells you the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
order in which to thread the machine

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.910 
order in which to thread the machine
we've<00:02:44.120> got<00:02:44.300> a<00:02:44.330> number<00:02:44.600> one<00:02:44.960> here<00:02:45.320> which<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.740> on

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
we've got a number one here which is on

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.400 
we've got a number one here which is on
the<00:02:45.950> third<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.580> along<00:02:46.910> a<00:02:47.210> number<00:02:47.810> two<00:02:48.080> on<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the third one along a number two on the

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.680 
the third one along a number two on the
fourth<00:02:48.770> one<00:02:49.010> along<00:02:49.340> a<00:02:49.640> number<00:02:50.150> four<00:02:50.420> on<00:02:50.660> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
fourth one along a number four on the

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.720 
first one and A three on the second one
now<00:02:53.930> those<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.740> reason<00:02:55.040> those<00:02:55.160> numbers<00:02:55.580> are

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
now those the reason those numbers are

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.150 
now those the reason those numbers are
out<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:56.090> order<00:02:56.300> is<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:57.290> that<00:02:57.470> is<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.800> order

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
out of order is that that is the order

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.990 
out of order is that that is the order
in<00:02:58.340> which<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.670> machine<00:02:59.030> should<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.390> threaded
