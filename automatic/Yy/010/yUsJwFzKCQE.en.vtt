00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello to yourself and diys today in the studio 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.350
 he will be a mod that opens 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.539
 car workshop san fierro 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.969
 well let's go see what u 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.530
 we have changed there so to speak 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.289
 the workshop is near this one 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.090
 fire department here please we see 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.599
 the fact that we can open all the gates 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.279
 inside ride about this workshop and 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.220
 just check out the interior very clearly 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.499
 everything is beautifully made with quality 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.560
 objects are tangible so to speak coliseum 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.380
 done great and it's certainly not 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.180
 may not be very happy 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.430
 no bugs work no flights too 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.350
 quite a few important aspects let us now 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.620
 go to the platform and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.110
 type we repair our car so we call 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:52.730
 neatly the main thing would not fail 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.280
 down like this we drove out 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.190
 cars with us still like this passenger well 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.600
 ok, let's leave it here and let's jump 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.089
 here and here we are 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.940
 here is this pit we can look up 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.550
 here we see it but the bottom of our 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.890
 car type we do something here 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.840
 springs see something else there my bad 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.970
 understands this business and we can of course 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.310
 else get out of here now there 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.980
 it seems impossible to get stuck here 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.159
 see wheels are worth some hex 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:28.340
 Well, yes, you, too, in principle, Messina minus 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:32.920
 such a fashion game is more accurate okay let's 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.330
 let's sit back and see once more 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.080
 the machine is called the knife who doesn't know it 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.440
 sultan 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.330
 from gta 4 green here please 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 we can go out and know something cool 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.970
 objects from the column stepladder and mikasa 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.050
 Exactly this fishhechka lacked 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.540
 here 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.790
 on here in this garage in this place because 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.610
 that the garage opens us workshop no 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.170
 then a little bit offensive so to speak 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.450
 the inferiority complex has already disappeared 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.510
 gone okay, such a modification 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.800
 interestingly the auto repair shop opens 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.520
 he stands there machine kakayato 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.619
 tuned sultan and sultan to stratum 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.040
 In my opinion 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.080
 rows and save in general archives fashion 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.200
 There are 3 versions of this modification 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.960
 that is, the first version of what opens 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.170
 one gate then the second version of the mod 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.350
 also the front gate opens clean and 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 the third version opens all gates 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.490
 No need to split the attacks seems to me then 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.810
 that it is better to have everyone open 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:38.090
 gates okay this is the business of the author so 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.130
 what's important for us to install the mod and 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.010
 you can play it, you should check it out 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.870
 him as he is in, well, thank you all 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.350
 and to everyone for now, then we give 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.020
 modification of course does not carry such 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.620
 semantic load but still cool 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.450
 the fact that 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.270
 open workshop we can call 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.510
 park the car and drive away 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.290
 so this is done charge again so 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.370
 that's the main thing is not to fail bolin husband 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:11.780
 failing so we leave the car 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:15.620
 for example here and get the fuck out of here 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.120
 please machine left everything to me 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.610
 nobody seems to drive and she will 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.940
 stand for a long time so things like everybody 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.340
 thanks good luck and miss good luck again 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.010
 because luck is an important aspect 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.520
 our life you want to philosophize just 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.520
 bye everyone
