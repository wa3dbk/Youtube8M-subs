00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
plugged into a VCR you know I had

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.610 
plugged into a VCR you know I had
everything<00:03:38.000> just<00:03:38.300> Hotwire<00:03:38.989> like<00:03:39.440> straight

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
everything just Hotwire like straight

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.610 
everything just Hotwire like straight
ghetto<00:03:39.860> style<00:03:40.160> even<00:03:40.880> back<00:03:41.209> in<00:03:41.239> those<00:03:41.390> days<00:03:41.620> I

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
ghetto style even back in those days I

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.320 
ghetto style even back in those days I
still<00:03:43.370> felt<00:03:43.519> like<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:43.760> was<00:03:43.880> putting<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.180> lot<00:03:44.300> of

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
still felt like I was putting a lot of

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.780 
still felt like I was putting a lot of
effort<00:03:44.630> into<00:03:44.750> my<00:03:44.900> videos<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:45.730> they<00:03:46.730> were

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
effort into my videos and they were

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.630 
effort into my videos and they were
entertaining<00:03:47.269> so<00:03:47.690> I<00:03:48.620> think<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.400> if<00:03:49.519> you're

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
entertaining so I think that if you're

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.460 
entertaining so I think that if you're
going<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.820> put<00:03:50.390> out<00:03:50.480> these<00:03:50.630> videos<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:51.170> still

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
going to put out these videos you still

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.340 
going to put out these videos you still
have<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:51.860> have<00:03:52.180> enough<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.600> drive<00:03:54.019> when<00:03:54.290> a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
have to have enough of a drive when a
