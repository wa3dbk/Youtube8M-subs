say<00:00:43.739> it's<00:00:43.980> um<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.910> know<00:00:45.030> 1080p<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.809> can

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
say it's um you know 1080p you can

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340 
say it's um you know 1080p you can
record<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> 1080p<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> um<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.660> don't<00:00:49.140> get

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
record it 1080p but um I just don't get

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
record it 1080p but um I just don't get
it<00:00:49.530> man<00:00:49.739> cuz<00:00:50.010> um<00:00:50.780> every<00:00:51.780> time<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.170> recorded

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
it man cuz um every time I recorded

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.420 
it man cuz um every time I recorded
1080p<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:54.180> know<00:00:54.270> all<00:00:54.539> it<00:00:54.930> seems<00:00:55.289> like<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.949> is

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
1080p you know all it seems like is is

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.310 
1080p you know all it seems like is is
why<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:56.789> recording<00:00:57.449> 720p<00:00:58.430> optimized<00:00:59.989> with<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
why I recording 720p optimized with the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.250 
why I recording 720p optimized with the
white<00:01:02.039> light<00:01:02.309> feature<00:01:02.640> clicked<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.390> don't<00:01:04.019> see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
white light feature clicked I don't see

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.479 
white light feature clicked I don't see
the<00:01:04.290> difference<00:01:04.559> it's<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.189> same<00:01:05.460> thing

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the difference it's the same thing

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.550 
the difference it's the same thing
because<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.750> take<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.290> 1080p<00:01:07.799> Oh<00:01:08.540> God

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
because when you take it to 1080p Oh God

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.060 
because when you take it to 1080p Oh God
you<00:01:10.560> know<00:01:10.650> riety<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.610> know<00:01:11.729> Oh<00:01:11.939> God<00:01:12.930> sorry<00:01:13.770> my

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
you know riety you know Oh God sorry my

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.940 
you know riety you know Oh God sorry my
my<00:01:14.430> back<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.930> sometimes<00:01:15.950> stretches<00:01:16.970> anyway

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
my back just sometimes stretches anyway

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.100 
my back just sometimes stretches anyway
it<00:01:19.950> seems<00:01:20.220> like<00:01:20.460> when<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.000> 1080p<00:01:21.570> all

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it seems like when you go to 1080p all

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.050 
it seems like when you go to 1080p all
it<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.640> 720p<00:01:24.479> optimized<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:26.060> version

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it is is the 720p optimized a version

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.330 
it is is the 720p optimized a version
with<00:01:27.960> right<00:01:28.799> light<00:01:29.130> checked<00:01:30.380> because<00:01:31.380> in

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
with right light checked because in

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
with right light checked because in
1080p<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.390> doesn't<00:01:33.750> allow<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.259> uncheck<00:01:34.710> or

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
1080p it doesn't allow you to uncheck or

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
1080p it doesn't allow you to uncheck or
check<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.310> white<00:01:35.520> light<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.659> seems

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
check the white light so it just seems

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.710 
check the white light so it just seems
like<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.860> know<00:01:37.979> they<00:01:38.400> say<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.820> 1080p<00:01:39.060> but

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like you know they say it's 1080p but

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.840 
like you know they say it's 1080p but
it's<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.020> same<00:01:40.229> thing<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.950> looks<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> same<00:01:41.579> as

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
it's the same thing it looks the same as

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.260 
it's the same thing it looks the same as
the<00:01:42.000> 720p<00:01:43.399> optimized<00:01:44.399> um<00:01:44.850> um<00:01:46.729> resolution<00:01:47.729> you

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the 720p optimized um um resolution you

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
the 720p optimized um um resolution you
know<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:49.200> example<00:01:49.290> when<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.280> hold<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> pull

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
know for example when you hold it pull

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.460 
know for example when you hold it pull
the<00:01:51.119> boots<00:01:51.570> gotta<00:01:51.750> put<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the boots gotta put down for the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.450 
the boots gotta put down for the
resolutions<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> it's<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.540> small

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
resolutions you know and it's got small

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.959 
resolutions you know and it's got small
360p<00:01:56.460> it's<00:01:57.030> got<00:01:57.270> medium<00:01:57.570> for<00:01:58.560> ATP<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
360p it's got medium for ATP and it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.499 
360p it's got medium for ATP and it's
got<00:02:00.180> 720p<00:02:01.009> optimized<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:02.880> got<00:02:03.060> 720p

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
got 720p optimized and it's got 720p

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.520 
got 720p optimized and it's got 720p
lodge<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.770> then<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:05.579> 1080p<00:02:06.299> max<00:02:06.600> okay

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
lodge and then it's got 1080p max okay

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.330 
lodge and then it's got 1080p max okay
so<00:02:08.099> what<00:02:08.910> I'm<00:02:09.030> saying<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.319> 1080p<00:02:10.890> max

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so what I'm saying is the 1080p max

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.880 
so what I'm saying is the 1080p max
looks<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.239> same<00:02:12.450> as<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.900> 720

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
looks the same as the 720

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.700 
looks the same as the 720
optimized<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.600> white<00:02:15.840> light<00:02:16.170> featured

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
optimized with the white light featured

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.000 
optimized with the white light featured
checked<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.959> think<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:19.560> what<00:02:19.800> they

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
checked and but I think that's what they

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.309 
checked and but I think that's what they
did<00:02:20.370> because<00:02:20.850> when<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.510> when<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:21.900> click<00:02:22.170> on

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
did because when you when you click on

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.610 
did because when you when you click on
