round<00:03:54.930> you<00:03:55.200> do<00:03:55.380> need<00:03:55.620> something<00:03:55.920> that's

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
round you do need something that's

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.900 
round you do need something that's
strong<00:03:56.520> enough<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.390> basically<00:03:57.740> blitz<00:03:58.910> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
strong enough to basically blitz the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.790 
strong enough to basically blitz the
really<00:04:00.240> you<00:04:00.360> know<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.660> hard<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.290> frozen

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
really you know the hard the frozen

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.250 
really you know the hard the frozen
fruit<00:04:02.360> right

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.580 

there<00:04:07.890> is<00:04:08.070> my<00:04:08.280> ice<00:04:08.490> cream<00:04:08.910> in<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.930> bottom<00:04:10.230> and

there is my ice cream in the bottom and

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.440 
there is my ice cream in the bottom and
obviously<00:04:11.280> because<00:04:11.640> it's<00:04:11.790> all<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:11.970> being

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
obviously because it's all just being

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.390 
obviously because it's all just being
blended<00:04:13.010> it<00:04:14.010> is<00:04:14.370> quite<00:04:14.940> soft<00:04:15.330> so<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:17.250> could

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
blended it is quite soft so you could

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.930 
blended it is quite soft so you could
either<00:04:17.520> pop<00:04:17.940> this<00:04:18.120> back<00:04:18.420> into<00:04:18.690> the<00:04:18.959> freezer<00:04:19.940> to

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:25.610 
leave it to harden roll in another 5 10
minutes<00:04:24.090> or<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.840> could<00:04:24.960> pop<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.260> back<00:04:25.290> in<00:04:25.530> the
