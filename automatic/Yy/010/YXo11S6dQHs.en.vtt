the<00:00:53.900> intake<00:00:54.900> of<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.440> skimmer<00:00:55.920> pump<00:00:56.309> so<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the intake of the skimmer pump so it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.649 
the intake of the skimmer pump so it
gets<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.629> water<00:00:57.900> ASAP<00:00:59.059> goes<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.360> skimmer

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
gets that water ASAP goes in the skimmer

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.680 
gets that water ASAP goes in the skimmer
pump<00:01:00.989> comes<00:01:01.290> up<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.040> and<00:01:05.540> pretty<00:01:06.540> much

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
pump comes up here and pretty much

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.270 
pump comes up here and pretty much
skimmed<00:01:07.140> oh<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.560> quick<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.150> about

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
skimmed oh pretty quick this is about

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.010 
skimmed oh pretty quick this is about
two<00:01:11.280> days<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.760> skin<00:01:12.060> mate<00:01:12.240> after<00:01:12.420> i<00:01:12.600> clean<00:01:12.870> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
two days of skin mate after i clean the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.359 
two days of skin mate after i clean the
cup<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.340> a<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.700> too<00:01:15.299> wet<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:15.600> my<00:01:15.900> liking

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
i'm going to dial it back a bit right

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
i'm going to dial it back a bit right
now<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.020> water<00:01:19.290> level<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:20.460> about<00:01:20.670> there

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
now the water level is right about there

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
now the water level is right about there
inside<00:01:21.390> i'm<00:01:21.660> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> bring<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:23.160> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
inside i'm going to bring it down to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.390 
inside i'm going to bring it down to
about<00:01:24.080> there<00:01:25.080> that's<00:01:25.590> usually<00:01:25.740> my<00:01:26.070> sweets

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
bottom in some any skimmer water level

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.450 
bottom in some any skimmer water level
but<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.330> skimmers<00:01:30.750> working<00:01:31.110> great<00:01:31.410> I<00:01:31.710> was

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
but the skimmers working great I was

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.080 
but the skimmers working great I was
away<00:01:32.790> for<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.690> week<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.380> half<00:01:34.410> and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.820> had

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
away for a week and a half and I had

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.370 
away for a week and a half and I had
this<00:01:36.780> discharging<00:01:37.530> into<00:01:37.620> a<00:01:37.800> bucket<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:39.380> it

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
this discharging into a bucket and it

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.920 
this discharging into a bucket and it
worked<00:01:40.650> great<00:01:41.000> no<00:01:42.000> problems<00:01:42.450> came<00:01:42.660> back

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
worked great no problems came back

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.860 
worked great no problems came back
everything<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.980> working<00:01:44.190> well<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:45.690> next

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
everything was working well the next

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.250 
everything was working well the next
part<00:01:46.620> of<00:01:46.710> my<00:01:47.180> sump<00:01:48.180> system<00:01:48.390> as<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> come<00:01:49.020> along

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
part of my sump system as you come along

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.530 
part of my sump system as you come along
here<00:01:49.650> now<00:01:50.370> there's<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:51.120> little<00:01:51.390> bucket

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
here now there's just a little bucket

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.230 
here now there's just a little bucket
with<00:01:51.780> frag<00:01:52.050> plugs<00:01:52.940> I've<00:01:53.940> got<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.960> Rio<00:01:55.970> 201<00:01:56.970> is

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with frag plugs I've got to Rio 201 is

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:04.920 
with frag plugs I've got to Rio 201 is
feeding<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:58.490> GAC<00:01:59.490> /<00:02:00.470> carbon<00:02:01.470> reactor

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.140 

I'll<00:02:05.590> probably<00:02:05.860> actually<00:02:06.130> up<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.730> flow<00:02:06.970> on

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
I'll probably actually up the flow on

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.650 
I'll probably actually up the flow on
that<00:02:07.360> just<00:02:07.830> noticing<00:02:08.830> it's<00:02:08.979> not<00:02:09.479> moving<00:02:10.479> as

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
that just noticing it's not moving as

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.290 
that just noticing it's not moving as
much<00:02:10.840> as<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.170> was<00:02:11.320> before<00:02:11.530> my<00:02:11.890> vacation<00:02:12.300> and

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
much as it was before my vacation and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.180 
much as it was before my vacation and
the<00:02:13.570> other<00:02:13.720> is<00:02:13.810> my<00:02:14.170> bio<00:02:14.410> pellet<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
the other is my bio pellet and that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.570 
the other is my bio pellet and that
takes<00:02:15.430> care<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.790> my<00:02:16.000> nitrates<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.570> phosphates

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
takes care of my nitrates and phosphates

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.990 
takes care of my nitrates and phosphates
see<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.610> solution<00:02:19.270> around<00:02:19.570> in<00:02:19.840> there<00:02:20.850> should<00:02:21.850> be

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
see a solution around in there should be

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000 
see a solution around in there should be
able<00:02:22.270> to

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.350 

if<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.220> see<00:02:27.400> there's<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.670> big<00:02:27.819> space<00:02:28.090> at<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
if you see there's a big space at the

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.630 
if you see there's a big space at the
top<00:02:28.690> that's<00:02:29.200> actually<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.069> amount<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.430> bio

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
top that's actually the amount of bio

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.970 
top that's actually the amount of bio
pellets<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.330> has<00:02:31.599> been<00:02:32.379> used<00:02:32.560> up<00:02:32.799> by

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
pellets that has been used up by

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.030 
pellets that has been used up by
bacteria<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.849> last<00:02:34.060> month<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.540> a<00:02:34.599> half<00:02:35.040> so

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
bacteria in the last month and a half so

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.280 
bacteria in the last month and a half so
that's<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.549> good<00:02:36.700> sign<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.110> stuff<00:02:38.110> is

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
that's a good sign that stuff is

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.390 
that's a good sign that stuff is
