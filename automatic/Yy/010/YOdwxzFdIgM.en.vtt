00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
last one which is crusty because it gets

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.350 
last one which is crusty because it gets
a<00:00:41.530> lot<00:00:41.770> better<00:00:42.070> and<00:00:42.430> it<00:00:42.640> ends<00:00:42.850> up<00:00:42.910> having<00:00:43.090> the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
a lot better and it ends up having the

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.970 
a lot better and it ends up having the
bird<00:00:43.570> do<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.899> behavior<00:00:44.320> instead<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.890> a

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980

behavior to be the bat I started out

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.470 
behavior to be the bat I started out
with<00:00:55.840> copying<00:00:56.320> Rick<00:00:56.530> Thomas's<00:00:57.250> act<00:00:57.489> he<00:00:57.969> is<00:00:58.359> a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
with copying Rick Thomas's act he is a

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.540

Moluccan cockatoo that do this on stage
and<00:01:02.859> I<00:01:02.949> thought<00:01:03.129> it<00:01:03.280> just<00:01:03.429> looked<00:01:03.699> really

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
and I thought it just looked really

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.060 
and I thought it just looked really
really<00:01:04.300> cool<00:01:04.570> so<00:01:05.230> what<00:01:05.530> he<00:01:05.680> did<00:01:05.800> was<00:01:05.860> he

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
really cool so what he did was he

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.410 
really cool so what he did was he
snapped<00:01:06.340> his<00:01:06.520> teen<00:01:06.700> years<00:01:06.730> when<00:01:07.030> he<00:01:07.120> had<00:01:07.150> his

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
snapped his teen years when he had his

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.510 
snapped his teen years when he had his
bird<00:01:07.630> do<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:07.990> back<00:01:08.170> so<00:01:08.770> that's<00:01:09.040> pretty<00:01:09.310> much

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
bird do the back so that's pretty much

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.179 
bird do the back so that's pretty much
exactly<00:01:09.850> what<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.210> taught<00:01:10.450> bond<00:01:10.689> that<00:01:11.070> except<00:01:12.070> I

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
exactly what I taught bond that except I

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.130 
exactly what I taught bond that except I
made<00:01:12.220> her<00:01:12.549> cute<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:13.030> touch<00:01:13.330> of<00:01:13.479> the<00:01:13.570> tail<00:01:13.810> and

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
made her cute a touch of the tail and

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.320 
made her cute a touch of the tail and
she<00:01:14.680> knew<00:01:14.830> she<00:01:14.860> was<00:01:15.070> going<00:01:15.340> over<00:01:15.460> so<00:01:16.210> that's

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
she knew she was going over so that's

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.789 
she knew she was going over so that's
her<00:01:16.540> bad<00:01:16.750> impression<00:01:17.290> she<00:01:17.409> doesn't<00:01:17.710> really

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
her bad impression she doesn't really

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.859 
her bad impression she doesn't really
really<00:01:18.130> good<00:01:18.340> but<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.060> thing<00:01:19.270> that<00:01:19.299> I<00:01:19.450> started

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
really good but the thing that I started

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.840 
really good but the thing that I started
not<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.170> like<00:01:20.350> was<00:01:20.590> that<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:20.950> was<00:01:21.280> kind<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.549> doing

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
not to like was that I was kind of doing

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.999 
not to like was that I was kind of doing
it<00:01:21.880> for<00:01:22.000> her<00:01:22.270> if<00:01:22.479> you<00:01:22.840> noticed<00:01:23.229> I<00:01:23.350> completely

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
it for her if you noticed I completely

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.530 
it for her if you noticed I completely
flip<00:01:24.220> her<00:01:24.340> upside<00:01:24.369> down<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.090> she<00:01:25.299> has<00:01:25.390> no

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
flip her upside down and she has no

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.399 
flip her upside down and she has no
problem<00:01:25.570> with<00:01:25.990> it

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
problem with it

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.039 
problem with it
but<00:01:27.100> I<00:01:27.400> started<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.759> think<00:01:27.820> maybe<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:28.810> bird

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
but I started to think maybe the bird

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.630 
but I started to think maybe the bird
should<00:01:29.320> start<00:01:29.560> helping<00:01:29.950> so<00:01:30.369> I'm<00:01:30.430> going<00:01:30.579> to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
should start helping so I'm going to

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.280 
should start helping so I'm going to
show<00:01:30.790> you<00:01:30.820> what<00:01:31.060> mine<00:01:31.210> acog<00:01:31.509> jinx<00:01:31.900> looks<00:01:32.110> like

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.040 
progressed with this trick because I
really<00:03:42.850> wanted<00:03:43.060> it<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.240> be<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.510> bird<00:03:43.690> instead

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
really wanted it to be the bird instead

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.170 
really wanted it to be the bird instead
of<00:03:44.260> looking<00:03:44.890> like<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.190> was<00:03:45.340> making<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.760> bird<00:03:45.940> do

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
of looking like I was making the bird do

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.390 
of looking like I was making the bird do
it<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.600> that's<00:03:47.200> kind<00:03:47.440> of<00:03:47.470> how<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.950> ended<00:03:48.340> up

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
it so that's kind of how it ended up

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.250 
it so that's kind of how it ended up
going<00:03:48.640> I'm<00:03:49.360> gonna<00:03:49.480> do<00:03:49.600> it<00:03:49.660> one<00:03:49.750> more<00:03:49.870> time<00:03:50.050> are

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
