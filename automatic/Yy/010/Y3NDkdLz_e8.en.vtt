does look really cool and one of the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.080 
does look really cool and one of the
things<00:00:51.570> about<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> camel<00:00:52.469> mask<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.910> get

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
things about this camel mask is you get

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.389 
things about this camel mask is you get
it<00:00:54.180> from<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> quest<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.930> requires<00:00:55.260> 43<00:00:56.100> prayer
