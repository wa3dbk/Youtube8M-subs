00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello today is about the benefits 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.549
 a tomato house we have now 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.290
 already mid october 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.410
 I already have my outdoor area 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.200
 but long ago rooted but the advantages of a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.670
 tomato houses are now coming out here 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.510
 Here I am just before the 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.600
 Romanian bottles tomato what is without 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 typical of san marzano today 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.840
 call and next to it is yes again 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 a representative of the Russian 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.000
 meat tomato is that in tomato 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.030
 in the open air either very late 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.300
 would ripen or as well as that would 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.920
 shut up totally that tomato house 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.510
 has just in terms of old 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.969
 types of tomatoes or rare 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 the advantage of the tomato varieties that it 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.890
 fruits from rain protects the fruits 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.070
 usually leave much less too 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.670
 as in the open air so burst 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 fruit 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 that's right here at the castan red 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.960
 bottle so what but in the wild will 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.760
 already fouled so now 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.700
 simply because the roof a lot of rain 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.040
 one stops now with the rain and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.200
 Moisture only now for a few days 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.880
 here comes also sometimes brown rot 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.420
 into the house but it is really on the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.409
 Humidity and we have stopped 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.869
 just a longer harvest a lot 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.090
 Greater harvests of healthy fruits and fruits 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.070
 what a great advantage is that the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.130
 aroma of the fruit is significantly better 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.710
 as in the greenhouse and the work itself 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.780
 so in the thing to make the room worth it 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.150
 yes, now comes a few more 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.729
 practical hints to such a tomato 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.579
 house so this splendor measures about 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.520
 two and a half times just four meters and 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.100
 can accommodate 20 to 30 tomato plants 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 what you should pay attention to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 is really stable enough so that is 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.600
 are now about eight inches long 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.009
 square and also that the roof one 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.479
 passion has got me 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.369
 Meanwhile, for the acrylic plates 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.110
 decided because the just stop in the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.250
 contrary to a gardener foil not 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 so hang through 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 and as I said a tilt of about 5 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.810
 that I also rainwater with it 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.910
 intercept 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.530
 In the ideal case, it works 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.360
 then down here in my tonner but 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.980
 the thing is already a bit decrepit 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.110
 yes and I have stop here next to the pulse 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.330
 just managed with angles completely 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.550
 So screw this one up 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.110
 sturdy black spax screws 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.150
 but I think those of you 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.730
 are still talented in craftsmanship 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.890
 many nice and practical solutions 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.250
 I can now put these, so to speak 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.019
 have survived in part already 78 years 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.890
 and already have some storms 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.510
 spring and autumn to endure and 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.890
 As I said this mill will be with one 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.890
 rich harvest rewarded
