ways<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.210> that's<00:02:44.450> where<00:02:44.720> i<00:02:44.750> picked<00:02:45.080> up<00:02:45.260> this

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
ways and that's where i picked up this

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.710

seem<00:02:52.010> very<00:02:52.430> unlikely<00:02:53.030> that<00:02:53.240> this<00:02:53.630> comes<00:02:53.930> out

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
seem very unlikely that this comes out

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.170 
seem very unlikely that this comes out
naturally<00:02:54.260> but<00:02:54.680> it<00:02:54.800> does<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.430> really<00:02:55.700> is<00:02:55.970> my

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180
