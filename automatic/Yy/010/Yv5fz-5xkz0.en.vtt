00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
all from the bottom this is basically

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.610

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
can see with my reflection but you can

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.010 
can see with my reflection but you can
see<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.940> they've<00:03:42.090> done<00:03:42.390> a<00:03:42.420> little<00:03:42.750> change

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
see that they've done a little change

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.760 
see that they've done a little change
here<00:03:44.060> basically<00:03:45.060> they<00:03:45.209> come<00:03:45.420> in<00:03:45.570> small<00:03:45.770> or

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
here basically they come in small or

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.880 
here basically they come in small or
they<00:03:46.890> come<00:03:47.040> in<00:03:47.190> large<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:49.290> pretty<00:03:49.800> much

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890

you're gonna have to do it sort of at an

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.529 
you're gonna have to do it sort of at an
angle<00:05:32.949> you<00:05:33.949> want<00:05:34.099> it<00:05:34.190> to<00:05:34.310> snap<00:05:34.550> in<00:05:34.819> like<00:05:35.539> this

and then stake it off snap off in an

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.930 
and then stake it off snap off in an
angle<00:05:41.889> that's<00:05:42.889> pretty<00:05:43.159> much<00:05:43.310> how<00:05:43.490> the<00:05:43.550> how<00:05:43.879> the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
angle that's pretty much how the how the

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.999 
angle that's pretty much how the how the
charger<00:05:44.389> works<00:05:44.569> and<00:05:45.020> it<00:05:45.469> pretty<00:05:45.650> much<00:05:45.800> keeps

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009 
charger works and it pretty much keeps

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.670 
charger works and it pretty much keeps
the<00:05:46.250> battery<00:05:46.479> keeps<00:05:47.479> it<00:05:47.659> pretty<00:05:47.870> well<00:05:48.050> I

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
the battery keeps it pretty well I

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.559 
the battery keeps it pretty well I
haven't<00:05:49.400> really<00:05:49.699> noticed<00:05:49.879> much<00:05:50.240> need<00:05:50.539> to

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:50.569 
haven't really noticed much need to

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:52.180 
haven't really noticed much need to
charge<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.139> I<00:05:51.229> use<00:05:51.409> it<00:05:51.440> overnight<00:05:51.919> for

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
charge it and I use it overnight for

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.570 
charge it and I use it overnight for
sleep<00:05:52.370> tracking<00:05:52.839> so<00:05:54.129> pretty<00:05:55.129> much<00:05:55.279> it's<00:05:55.490> a

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
sleep tracking so pretty much it's a

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.390 
sleep tracking so pretty much it's a
nice<00:05:55.729> device<00:05:56.589> fits<00:05:57.589> perfectly<00:05:58.009> for<00:05:58.129> your
