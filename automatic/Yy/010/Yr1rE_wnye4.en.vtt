00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
like the little smiley face thing it

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
I'm weird about I'm kind of speculating

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.300 
I'm weird about I'm kind of speculating
is<00:01:23.640> why<00:01:23.820> gives<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> percent<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.680> basically

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
is why gives you a percent and basically

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
is why gives you a percent and basically
when<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.700> was<00:01:26.880> done<00:01:27.119> just<00:01:27.150> updated<00:01:27.960> windows

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
when this was done just updated windows

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
when this was done just updated windows
it<00:01:28.890> seemed<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.150> know<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.450> it

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
it seemed like and I really know what it

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.679 
it seemed like and I really know what it
could<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.750> done<00:01:31.640> but<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.880> basically<00:01:33.270> if

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
could have done but I was basically if

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.359 
could have done but I was basically if
you<00:01:33.990> want<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.200> maybe<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.530> about<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> program

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
you want to maybe know about the program

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.999 
you want to maybe know about the program
I<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.610> running<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.420> um<00:01:38.030> motion<00:01:39.030> thing<00:01:39.420> it's

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009
