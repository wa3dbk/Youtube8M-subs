00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:03.500 

okay<00:00:02.639> in<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.850> video<00:00:02.970> I'm<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.330> take

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
okay in this video I'm going to take

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.450 
okay in this video I'm going to take
another<00:00:03.720> look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.110> to<00:00:04.290> create<00:00:04.500> machined

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
another look at how to create machined

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.880 
another look at how to create machined
type<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.150> bevels<00:00:06.480> inside<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.049> ZBrush<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:07.680> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
type of bevels inside of ZBrush for and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.650 
type of bevels inside of ZBrush for and
for<00:00:08.370> this<00:00:08.460> I'm<00:00:08.610> primarily<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.210> be<00:00:09.300> using

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
for this I'm primarily going to be using

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
for this I'm primarily going to be using
the<00:00:09.780> new<00:00:09.809> shadow<00:00:10.080> box<00:00:10.349> feature<00:00:10.700> I'm<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.849> to

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
the new shadow box feature I'm going to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.320 
the new shadow box feature I'm going to
begin<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.840> drawing<00:00:13.259> out<00:00:13.440> just<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.460> sort<00:00:15.269> of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
begin by just drawing out just a sort of

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.269 
begin by just drawing out just a sort of
weird<00:00:15.660> organic<00:00:16.230> shape<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.560> I'll<00:00:16.619> go<00:00:16.710> into<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
weird organic shape so I'll go into the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.340 
weird organic shape so I'll go into the
masking<00:00:17.880> brush<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.330> going<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.660> mask<00:00:18.900> pen

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
masking brush I'm going to use mask pen

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.380 
masking brush I'm going to use mask pen
at<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.130> point<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.760> I'm<00:00:20.880> just<00:00:21.000> going<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.180> draw

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
at this point and I'm just going to draw

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.420 
at this point and I'm just going to draw
out<00:00:21.510> some<00:00:21.720> sort<00:00:21.960> of<00:00:22.050> strange<00:00:22.350> organic<00:00:23.160> looking

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
out some sort of strange organic looking

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.550 
out some sort of strange organic looking
shape<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:24.000> something<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.330> might<00:00:24.510> be<00:00:24.689> I

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
shape just something that might be I

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.410 
shape just something that might be I
don't<00:00:26.189> know<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.430> sort<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.640> gear<00:00:26.939> machined

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
don't know some sort of gear machined

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.910 
don't know some sort of gear machined
part<00:00:27.750> I'll<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.500> ahead<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.710> turn<00:00:28.800> on

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
part I'll go ahead and turn on

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
part I'll go ahead and turn on
transparency<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:29.910> then<00:00:30.480> rotate<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
transparency and then rotate that a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.500 
transparency and then rotate that a
little<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.710> update<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.489> again<00:00:33.210> we'll

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
little bit to update it and again we'll

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.240 
little bit to update it and again we'll
pull<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.809> out<00:00:33.989> maybe<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.500> draw<00:00:34.860> some

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
pull this out maybe just draw some

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.790 
pull this out maybe just draw some
strange<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:36.000> limbs<00:00:36.210> or<00:00:36.480> arms<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> then

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
strange little limbs or arms and then

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.979 
strange little limbs or arms and then
maybe<00:00:38.070> into<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.550> sort<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.149> odd<00:00:39.390> organic

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
maybe into this sort of odd organic

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.990 
maybe into this sort of odd organic
shape<00:00:40.170> that<00:00:40.320> we've<00:00:40.440> got<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.920> here<00:00:41.000> we'll

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
shape that we've got going on here we'll

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.970 
shape that we've got going on here we'll
go<00:00:42.059> ahead<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.300> add<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> few<00:00:42.750> holes<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:43.680> hold

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
go ahead and add a few holes so hold

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
go ahead and add a few holes so hold
down<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.219> ctrl<00:00:44.670> +<00:00:44.850> alt<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.690> I'll<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.930> drag

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
down the ctrl + alt and I'll just drag

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
down the ctrl + alt and I'll just drag
out<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.350> hole<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.160> maybe<00:00:47.520> there's<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.850> hole

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
out a hole here and maybe there's a hole

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.220 
out a hole here and maybe there's a hole
over<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.850> maybe<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:51.090> over<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:51.480> okay

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
over here and maybe one over there okay

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.590 
over here and maybe one over there okay
and<00:00:52.440> maybe<00:00:52.680> one<00:00:52.920> also<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.550> alright<00:00:54.360> so

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and maybe one also up there alright so

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
and maybe one also up there alright so
we've<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.379> sort<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.710> interesting<00:00:56.250> shape

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
we've got this sort of interesting shape

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.760 
we've got this sort of interesting shape
going<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.059> we'll<00:00:57.600> go<00:00:57.690> ahead<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> exit<00:00:58.649> out<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
going on we'll go ahead and exit out of

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.529 
going on we'll go ahead and exit out of
shadow<00:00:59.070> box<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.670> that<00:01:00.000> gives<00:01:00.149> us<00:01:00.210> our<00:01:00.390> nice

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
shadow box and that gives us our nice

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.080 
shadow box and that gives us our nice
shape<00:01:00.980> now<00:01:01.980> you'll<00:01:02.190> notice<00:01:02.399> right<00:01:02.699> off<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
shape now you'll notice right off the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.939 
shape now you'll notice right off the
bat<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.809> already<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.680> bit<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
bat that we already have a little bit of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
bat that we already have a little bit of
a<00:01:05.010> bevel<00:01:05.280> going<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.640> here<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.090> actually

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
a bevel going on here but it's actually

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.280 
a bevel going on here but it's actually
a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.750> bit<00:01:06.930> soft<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:08.310> very<00:01:08.490> sharp<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.630> I'm

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
a little bit soft not very sharp so I'm

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750 
a little bit soft not very sharp so I'm
going<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.560> through<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.860> process<00:01:11.430> I'm

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
going to go through this process I'm

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.260 
going to go through this process I'm
going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> show<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.619> sort<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:14.240> way<00:01:15.240> that

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
going to show you sort of a way that

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.749 
going to show you sort of a way that
will<00:01:15.689> work<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.229> then<00:01:16.740> also<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> way<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.490> won't

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
will work and then also a way that won't

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.010 
will work and then also a way that won't
work<00:01:18.060> I'm<00:01:18.330> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> show<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
work I'm going to show you the way that

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.740 
work I'm going to show you the way that
won't<00:01:19.229> work<00:01:19.380> first<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
won't work first so that you can kind of

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.450 
won't work first so that you can kind of
understand<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> process<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:22.890> we're<00:01:23.430> going

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
understand the process that we're going

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.679 
understand the process that we're going
into<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
into a lot of this is going to have to

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
into a lot of this is going to have to
do<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:25.049> masking<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.159> inflate<00:01:26.520> which

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
do with masking and then inflate which

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
do with masking and then inflate which
is<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.240> technique<00:01:27.659> that's<00:01:27.810> been<00:01:27.930> around<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
is a technique that's been around for a

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
is a technique that's been around for a
little<00:01:28.500> bit<00:01:28.710> of<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.250> little<00:01:29.610> while<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.030> now

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
little bit of a little while but it now

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.810 
little bit of a little while but it now
becomes<00:01:30.680> easier<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> work<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.759> we

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
becomes easier to work with now that we

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.370 
becomes easier to work with now that we
have<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> clipping<00:01:33.299> brushes<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.020> bear<00:01:34.350> with

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
have the clipping brushes so bear with

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.359 
have the clipping brushes so bear with
me<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:35.159> right<00:01:35.310> now<00:01:36.590> I'm<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.710> rotate<00:01:38.040> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
me all right now I'm gonna rotate this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.940 
me all right now I'm gonna rotate this
to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.640> side<00:01:38.850> a<00:01:38.880> little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:40.500> I'm<00:01:40.740> simply

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
to the side a little bit and I'm simply

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.770 
to the side a little bit and I'm simply
gonna<00:01:41.159> choose<00:01:41.729> my<00:01:41.880> masking<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.570> said<00:01:42.689> at

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
gonna choose my masking and I said at

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.020 
gonna choose my masking and I said at
mask<00:01:42.930> pen<00:01:43.200> I'm<00:01:43.320> gonna<00:01:43.470> use<00:01:43.649> mask<00:01:44.030> rectangle

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
mask pen I'm gonna use mask rectangle

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120 
mask pen I'm gonna use mask rectangle
and<00:01:45.149> we're<00:01:45.390> gonna<00:01:45.479> drag<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> grab

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and we're gonna drag this up and grab

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.160 
and we're gonna drag this up and grab
the<00:01:47.159> front<00:01:47.640> half<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.890> plane<00:01:49.890> okay<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.960> I

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the front half of this plane okay now I

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.139 
the front half of this plane okay now I
want<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.500> check<00:01:52.860> here<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.159> any<00:01:53.310> errant<00:01:53.790> sort

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
want to check here for any errant sort

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760 
want to check here for any errant sort
of<00:01:54.240> masking<00:01:54.659> any<00:01:54.780> little<00:01:55.079> ticks<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.619> might

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of masking any little ticks that might

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.289 
of masking any little ticks that might
be<00:01:55.890> coming<00:01:56.040> off<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.909> might<00:01:57.060> not<00:01:57.090> be

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
be coming off of that that might not be

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.030 
be coming off of that that might not be
uniform<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.200> want<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.439> check<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.770> and

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
uniform so you want to check that and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.859 
uniform so you want to check that and
everything<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.969> looking<00:02:00.119> good<00:02:00.360> in<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> shape

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
everything is looking good in this shape

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.200 
everything is looking good in this shape
alright<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.829> ahead<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.399> rotate<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
alright go ahead and rotate to that to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.719 
alright go ahead and rotate to that to
the<00:02:03.329> front<00:02:03.630> will<00:02:04.320> invert<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> mask<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.549> now

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the front will invert the mask and now

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.979 
the front will invert the mask and now
what<00:02:06.000> we'll<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.450> we'll<00:02:06.570> take<00:02:06.810> the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
what we'll do is we'll take the

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.750 
what we'll do is we'll take the
deformation<00:02:09.989> inflate<00:02:10.800> tool

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
deformation inflate tool

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.070 
deformation inflate tool
and<00:02:11.879> as<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.450> begin<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:12.750> inflate<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:15.080> you'll

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
and as we begin to inflate this you'll

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.020 
and as we begin to inflate this you'll
notice<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.530> pulls<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:17.010> into<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.400> geometry

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
notice that pulls it into the geometry

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.970 
notice that pulls it into the geometry
and<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.540> get<00:02:18.690> this<00:02:18.810> nice<00:02:18.989> sort<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.319> clean<00:02:19.680> edge

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
and we get this nice sort of clean edge

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.470 
and we get this nice sort of clean edge
all<00:02:20.280> around<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.640> activate<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.330> move

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
all around now if I activate the move

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.540 
all around now if I activate the move
tool<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.050> pull<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.680> straight<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.400> then

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
tool and pull this straight out and then

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.920 
tool and pull this straight out and then
begin<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.819> move<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.269> out<00:02:27.480> you'll<00:02:27.690> notice

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
begin to move this out you'll notice

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.860 
begin to move this out you'll notice
that<00:02:28.019> we<00:02:28.110> get<00:02:28.230> this<00:02:28.349> nice<00:02:28.680> clean<00:02:29.250> bevel<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.030> by

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
that we get this nice clean bevel and by

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.100 
that we get this nice clean bevel and by
and<00:02:31.050> large<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:33.060> will<00:02:33.120> look<00:02:33.569> as<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:33.780> it's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
and large this will look as if it's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.059 
and large this will look as if it's
worked<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:35.120> let's<00:02:36.120> go<00:02:36.239> ahead<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.920> clear<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
worked so let's go ahead and clear the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.339 
worked so let's go ahead and clear the
mask<00:02:38.280> out<00:02:38.519> we<00:02:39.299> do<00:02:39.450> get<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.780> little<00:02:40.019> pillow

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
mask out we do get this little pillow

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.880 
mask out we do get this little pillow
effect<00:02:40.890> up<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:41.970> upper<00:02:42.269> front<00:02:42.599> area<00:02:43.049> okay

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
effect up on the upper front area okay

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.530 
effect up on the upper front area okay
but<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.160> have<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.370> beautiful<00:02:44.640> clean<00:02:45.120> bevel

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
but we have this beautiful clean bevel

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.089 
but we have this beautiful clean bevel
so<00:02:46.080> let's<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.349> ahead<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.709> use<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.980> new

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
so let's go ahead and use the new

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.819 
so let's go ahead and use the new
clipping<00:02:47.370> brushes<00:02:47.819> will<00:02:48.000> switch<00:02:48.180> over<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829 
clipping brushes will switch over to

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.410 
clipping brushes will switch over to
click<00:02:49.829> curve<00:02:50.069> that's<00:02:50.310> control<00:02:50.760> shift<00:02:51.120> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
click curve that's control shift and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.920 
click curve that's control shift and
then<00:02:52.349> we<00:02:52.470> choose<00:02:52.860> clip<00:02:53.130> curve<00:02:53.720> we'll<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:54.810> ahead

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
then we choose clip curve we'll go ahead

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.720 
then we choose clip curve we'll go ahead
and<00:02:55.019> pull<00:02:55.260> straight<00:02:55.650> down<00:02:55.680> holding<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> shift

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
and pull straight down holding the shift

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.479 
and pull straight down holding the shift
key<00:02:56.819> at<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.810> same<00:02:57.989> time<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:59.099> we'll<00:02:59.310> use

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
key at the same time and then we'll use

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.039 
key at the same time and then we'll use
the<00:02:59.640> spacebar<00:02:59.880> to<00:03:00.090> move<00:03:00.360> or<00:03:00.480> this<00:03:00.599> maneuver

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the spacebar to move or this maneuver

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.600 
the spacebar to move or this maneuver
this<00:03:01.170> right<00:03:01.380> into<00:03:01.530> position<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.340> we'll<00:03:02.519> let

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
this right into position and we'll let

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.020 
this right into position and we'll let
go

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
go

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270 
go
now<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.170> trimmed<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.620> off<00:03:04.769> but<00:03:04.980> one<00:03:05.099> of<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
now that trimmed it off but one of the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.650 
now that trimmed it off but one of the
things<00:03:05.459> you're<00:03:05.579> going<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.730> notice<00:03:05.940> is<00:03:06.329> we<00:03:06.480> now

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
things you're going to notice is we now

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.059 
things you're going to notice is we now
get<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.079> horrible<00:03:07.920> sort<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.430> blocky<00:03:10.010> sort<00:03:11.010> of

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
get this horrible sort of blocky sort of

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.770 
get this horrible sort of blocky sort of
cut<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.519> around<00:03:11.849> so<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.090> got<00:03:12.209> this<00:03:12.299> nice<00:03:12.480> clean

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
cut all around so we got this nice clean

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.600 
cut all around so we got this nice clean
bevel<00:03:13.140> on<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.349> outside<00:03:13.709> but<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.160> is<00:03:14.340> just

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
bevel on the outside but this is just

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.500 
bevel on the outside but this is just
not<00:03:14.790> acceptable<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.690> right<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:17.299> this<00:03:18.299> is

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
not acceptable all right so this is

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.390 
not acceptable all right so this is
where<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.139> technique<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.889> I'm<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.250> to

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
where the technique that I'm going to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.710 
where the technique that I'm going to
show<00:03:20.549> you<00:03:20.579> sort<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:21.000> comes<00:03:21.239> into<00:03:21.450> play<00:03:21.660> I'm

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
show you sort of comes into play I'm

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.020 
show you sort of comes into play I'm
going<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:21.930> show<00:03:22.019> you<00:03:22.049> how<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.290> overcome<00:03:23.030> this

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
going to show you how to overcome this

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.390 
going to show you how to overcome this
sort<00:03:24.630> of<00:03:24.720> effect<00:03:25.139> using<00:03:25.739> the<00:03:25.980> same<00:03:26.160> basic

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
sort of effect using the same basic

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.860 
sort of effect using the same basic
technique<00:03:26.940> all<00:03:27.540> right

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
technique all right

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.629 
technique all right
let's<00:03:28.380> go<00:03:28.500> ahead<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.680> undo<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:31.579> until<00:03:32.579> we

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
let's go ahead and undo this until we

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.099 
let's go ahead and undo this until we
get<00:03:32.730> back<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:33.000> this<00:03:33.120> basic<00:03:33.480> shape<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:34.109 
get back to this basic shape so this is

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:35.990 
get back to this basic shape so this is
what<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.350> got<00:03:34.530> right<00:03:34.799> from<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.549> shadow<00:03:35.730> box

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
what we got right from the shadow box

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.180 
what we got right from the shadow box
all<00:03:36.810> right<00:03:36.959> the<00:03:37.560> first<00:03:37.709> thing<00:03:37.859> I'm<00:03:38.010> going<00:03:38.040> to

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
all right the first thing I'm going to

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.500 
all right the first thing I'm going to
do<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.519> activate<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.970> move<00:03:39.090> tool<00:03:39.329> and<00:03:39.389> I'm

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
do is activate the move tool and I'm

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.879 
do is activate the move tool and I'm
going<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.660> stretch<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.200> open<00:03:40.590> just<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.859> little

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
going to stretch this open just a little

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.309 
going to stretch this open just a little
bit<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:41.370> have<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.519> little<00:03:41.670> more<00:03:41.989> width<00:03:42.989> or

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
bit so we have a little more width or

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.680 
bit so we have a little more width or
depth<00:03:43.650> in<00:03:43.799> here<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.100> work<00:03:44.280> with<00:03:44.310> I'll<00:03:45.180> go<00:03:45.600> ahead

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
depth in here to work with I'll go ahead

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.080 
depth in here to work with I'll go ahead
go<00:03:45.900> back<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.049> draw<00:03:46.380> mode<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:47.040> Q<00:03:47.430> control

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
go back to draw mode that's Q control

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
go back to draw mode that's Q control
shift<00:03:48.359> to<00:03:48.510> activate<00:03:48.840> my<00:03:48.989> clipping<00:03:49.859> brushes

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
shift to activate my clipping brushes

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.039 
shift to activate my clipping brushes
I'm<00:03:50.700> going<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.940> choose<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.450> clip<00:03:51.660> rectangle

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
I'm going to choose the clip rectangle

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.289 
I'm going to choose the clip rectangle
and<00:03:52.380> I'm<00:03:52.650> gonna<00:03:52.769> clip<00:03:53.160> out<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.790> little<00:03:54.030> bevel

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
and I'm gonna clip out the little bevel

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.670 
and I'm gonna clip out the little bevel
that's<00:03:54.480> already<00:03:54.780> here<00:03:55.109> now<00:03:55.230> I<00:03:55.260> could<00:03:55.440> do<00:03:55.560> this

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
that's already here now I could do this

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.920 
that's already here now I could do this
with<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:56.130> clip<00:03:56.489> curve<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.269> one<00:03:57.480> side<00:03:57.690> and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
with the clip curve and do one side and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.420 
with the clip curve and do one side and
then<00:03:58.019> another<00:03:58.200> but<00:03:58.500> if<00:03:58.590> I<00:03:58.680> choose<00:03:58.950> clip

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
then another but if I choose clip

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.050 
then another but if I choose clip
rectangle<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.329> just<00:04:00.769> clip<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.920> drag<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
rectangle and just clip and drag so I

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.509 
rectangle and just clip and drag so I
can<00:04:03.209> clip<00:04:03.359> everything<00:04:03.900> inside<00:04:04.470> and<00:04:04.829> do<00:04:05.310> it<00:04:05.430> all

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
can clip everything inside and do it all

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.569 
can clip everything inside and do it all
at<00:04:05.639> once<00:04:05.930> right<00:04:06.930> now<00:04:07.200> you'll<00:04:08.099> also<00:04:08.250> notice

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
at once right now you'll also notice

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.400 
at once right now you'll also notice
that<00:04:08.880> because<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.299> shadow<00:04:09.750> box<00:04:10.049> is<00:04:10.230> not

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
that because the shadow box is not

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
that because the shadow box is not
necessarily<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.579> most<00:04:11.760> precise<00:04:12.180> of<00:04:12.209> all

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
necessarily the most precise of all

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.800 
necessarily the most precise of all
tools<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:13.349> holes<00:04:14.130> that<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.459> carved<00:04:14.760> here<00:04:15.030> are

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
tools the holes that we carved here are

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.509 
tools the holes that we carved here are
not<00:04:15.989> perfectly<00:04:16.380> circular<00:04:16.590> so<00:04:17.160> what<00:04:17.310> we'll<00:04:17.400> do

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
not perfectly circular so what we'll do

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.849 
not perfectly circular so what we'll do
is<00:04:17.639> we'll<00:04:17.760> go<00:04:17.880> into<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.630> circular<00:04:19.530> clipping

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
is we'll go into the circular clipping

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.339 
is we'll go into the circular clipping
brush<00:04:20.070> ctrl<00:04:20.519> shift<00:04:20.810> will<00:04:21.810> click<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.169> choose

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
brush ctrl shift will click and choose

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.720 
brush ctrl shift will click and choose
clip<00:04:23.039> circle<00:04:23.970> Center

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:24.730 
clip circle Center

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.060 
clip circle Center
I'll<00:04:25.510> go<00:04:25.570> ahead<00:04:25.690> and<00:04:25.930> control<00:04:26.260> shift<00:04:26.650> click

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'll go ahead and control shift click

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.860 
I'll go ahead and control shift click
and<00:04:27.220> drag<00:04:27.430> to<00:04:27.910> bring<00:04:28.090> out<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.240> circle<00:04:28.600> we<00:04:28.720> can

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
and drag to bring out a circle we can

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.930 
and drag to bring out a circle we can
use<00:04:28.990> the<00:04:29.140> spacebar<00:04:29.410> to<00:04:29.770> reposition<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.670> and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
use the spacebar to reposition that and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.210 
use the spacebar to reposition that and
then<00:04:31.900> hold<00:04:32.110> down<00:04:32.230> the<00:04:32.350> Alt<00:04:32.530> key<00:04:32.650> that's<00:04:33.040> going

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
then hold down the Alt key that's going

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.580 
then hold down the Alt key that's going
to<00:04:33.280> clip<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.730> form<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.570> into<00:04:34.840> a<00:04:34.990> perfect

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
to clip and form that into a perfect

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.450 
to clip and form that into a perfect
circle<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:38.410> I'll<00:04:38.860> just<00:04:39.010> go<00:04:39.130> ahead<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.370> do

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
circle and I'll just go ahead and do

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:50.250 
circle and I'll just go ahead and do
that<00:04:39.490> for<00:04:39.850> all<00:04:39.970> of<00:04:40.000> these<00:04:48.210> all<00:04:49.210> right<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.810> now

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
that for all of these all right so now

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.620 
that for all of these all right so now
I've<00:04:50.350> got<00:04:50.500> this<00:04:50.620> sort<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.890> nice<00:04:51.240> weird<00:04:52.240> kind<00:04:52.570> of

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
I've got this sort of nice weird kind of

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.900 
I've got this sort of nice weird kind of
gear<00:04:53.020> thing<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:53.980> might<00:04:54.100> appear<00:04:54.460> in<00:04:54.490> some

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
gear thing that might appear in some

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.260 
gear thing that might appear in some
sort<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.390> don't<00:04:55.600> know<00:04:56.190> alien<00:04:57.190> spacecraft<00:04:57.760> or

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
sort of I don't know alien spacecraft or

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.630 
sort of I don't know alien spacecraft or
something<00:04:58.570> along<00:04:58.750> those<00:04:58.870> lines<00:04:59.580> now<00:05:00.580> I'm

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
something along those lines now I'm

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.680 
something along those lines now I'm
gonna<00:05:00.730> do<00:05:00.910> something<00:05:01.180> that<00:05:01.330> seems<00:05:01.450> completely

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
gonna do something that seems completely

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.020 
gonna do something that seems completely
counterintuitive<00:05:02.320> now<00:05:02.800> I<00:05:02.860> could<00:05:03.040> mask<00:05:03.700> off

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
counterintuitive now I could mask off

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.480 
counterintuitive now I could mask off
the<00:05:04.480> area<00:05:04.810> again<00:05:04.990> and<00:05:05.230> try<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.680> process<00:05:06.340> but

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
the area again and try the process but

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.530 
the area again and try the process but
you'll<00:05:06.640> have<00:05:06.730> to<00:05:06.820> trust<00:05:07.000> me<00:05:07.180> when<00:05:07.300> I<00:05:07.330> say<00:05:07.390> that

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
you'll have to trust me when I say that

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.080 
you'll have to trust me when I say that
that's<00:05:07.750> not<00:05:07.930> necessarily<00:05:08.260> gonna<00:05:08.830> work<00:05:09.070> out<00:05:09.280> so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
that's not necessarily gonna work out so

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.040 
that's not necessarily gonna work out so
we're<00:05:10.180> going<00:05:10.270> to<00:05:10.330> do<00:05:10.450> something<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:10.810> seems<00:05:10.840> a

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
we're going to do something that seems a

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.150 
we're going to do something that seems a
little<00:05:11.080> counterintuitive<00:05:11.530> we're<00:05:12.040> actually

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
little counterintuitive we're actually

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.640 
little counterintuitive we're actually
gonna<00:05:12.370> go<00:05:12.520> now<00:05:12.670> and<00:05:12.880> choose<00:05:13.420> the<00:05:13.600> relax<00:05:13.930> option

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
gonna go now and choose the relax option

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.990 
gonna go now and choose the relax option
in<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:14.830> deformation<00:05:15.310> panel<00:05:15.460> I'm<00:05:15.670> gonna<00:05:15.790> drag

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
in the deformation panel I'm gonna drag

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.210 
in the deformation panel I'm gonna drag
that<00:05:16.060> all<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.420> way<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.570> 100<00:05:16.990> and<00:05:17.080> let<00:05:17.440> go<00:05:17.590> it's

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:18.220 
that all the way to 100 and let go it's

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.600 
that all the way to 100 and let go it's
gonna<00:05:18.310> soften<00:05:18.610> everything<00:05:18.970> out<00:05:20.130> now<00:05:21.130> I'll<00:05:21.520> go

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
gonna soften everything out now I'll go

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.430 
gonna soften everything out now I'll go
ahead<00:05:21.640> and<00:05:22.090> go<00:05:22.150> to<00:05:22.180> the<00:05:22.360> side<00:05:22.540> again<00:05:22.720> into<00:05:23.380> the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
ahead and go to the side again into the

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.930 
ahead and go to the side again into the
masking<00:05:23.800> with<00:05:23.920> clip<00:05:24.130> rectangle<00:05:24.460> I'm<00:05:24.700> going<00:05:24.880> to

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
masking with clip rectangle I'm going to

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.390 
masking with clip rectangle I'm going to
clip<00:05:25.240> and<00:05:25.450> drag<00:05:25.870> all<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.800> way<00:05:26.830> up<00:05:27.070> and<00:05:27.220> again<00:05:27.370> I

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
clip and drag all the way up and again I

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.160 
clip and drag all the way up and again I
want<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.640> check<00:05:27.880> for<00:05:27.910> any<00:05:28.210> sort<00:05:28.450> of<00:05:28.570> ticks<00:05:28.960> or

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
want to check for any sort of ticks or

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.560 
want to check for any sort of ticks or
errant<00:05:29.580> masking<00:05:30.580> on<00:05:30.730> this<00:05:31.240> all<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.420> way

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
errant masking on this all the way

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.860 
errant masking on this all the way
around<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.080> can<00:05:32.230> be<00:05:32.320> problematic<00:05:33.870> all

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
around is that can be problematic all

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.930 
around is that can be problematic all
right<00:05:35.080> we'll<00:05:35.290> rotate<00:05:35.650> to<00:05:35.770> the<00:05:35.830> side<00:05:35.940> once

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
right we'll rotate to the side once

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.460 
right we'll rotate to the side once
again<00:05:37.030> I'll<00:05:37.330> invert<00:05:37.720> the<00:05:37.930> mask<00:05:38.110> that's

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
again I'll invert the mask that's

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.290 
again I'll invert the mask that's
control<00:05:39.720> click<00:05:41.460> will<00:05:42.460> go<00:05:42.550> into<00:05:42.700> inflate<00:05:43.150> and

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
control click will go into inflate and

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.880 
control click will go into inflate and
this<00:05:43.390> time<00:05:43.570> we'll<00:05:43.750> pull<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.200> again<00:05:44.410> we're

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
this time we'll pull it in again we're

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.290 
this time we'll pull it in again we're
gonna<00:05:44.980> get<00:05:45.130> that<00:05:45.250> nice<00:05:45.460> clean<00:05:45.760> bevel<00:05:46.980> and<00:05:48.300> in

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
gonna get that nice clean bevel and in

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.600 
gonna get that nice clean bevel and in
this<00:05:49.420> case<00:05:49.660> I'll<00:05:50.380> go<00:05:50.590> ahead<00:05:50.800> and<00:05:50.950> go<00:05:51.070> to<00:05:51.130> the

part of this into the move tool we can

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.760 
part of this into the move tool we can
offset<00:06:28.360> this<00:06:28.840> now<00:06:29.110> to<00:06:29.170> create<00:06:29.470> a<00:06:29.560> nice

you'll<00:06:58.260> notice<00:06:58.410> this<00:06:58.650> is<00:06:58.710> oriented<00:06:59.460> down<00:07:00.270> the

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:00.420 
you'll notice this is oriented down the

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:03.290 
you'll notice this is oriented down the
z-axis<00:07:00.770> will<00:07:01.770> go<00:07:01.860> in<00:07:01.980> to<00:07:02.190> move<00:07:02.670> mode<00:07:02.910> and<00:07:03.180> I'll

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 
z-axis will go in to move mode and I'll

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.140 
z-axis will go in to move mode and I'll
begin<00:07:03.450> to<00:07:03.630> pull<00:07:03.840> this<00:07:03.990> back<00:07:04.050> just<00:07:04.790> across<00:07:05.790> the

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
begin to pull this back just across the

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.680 
begin to pull this back just across the
z-axis<00:07:06.360> lately<00:07:08.120> you'll<00:07:09.120> notice<00:07:09.420> the<00:07:09.540> blue

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
z-axis lately you'll notice the blue

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.540 
z-axis lately you'll notice the blue
line<00:07:09.930> it's<00:07:10.260> now<00:07:10.470> crossing<00:07:11.010> just<00:07:11.190> slightly

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:11.550 
line it's now crossing just slightly

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.490 
line it's now crossing just slightly
over<00:07:11.790> the<00:07:11.820> origin<00:07:12.150> we'll<00:07:12.900> go<00:07:12.990> back<00:07:13.170> into<00:07:13.380> the

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.500 
over the origin we'll go back into the

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:15.860 
over the origin we'll go back into the
geometry<00:07:13.680> menu<00:07:14.340> and<00:07:14.520> using<00:07:15.180> the<00:07:15.330> mirror<00:07:15.690> and

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870 
geometry menu and using the mirror and

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.870 
geometry menu and using the mirror and
weld<00:07:16.020> option<00:07:16.470> we'll<00:07:16.620> turn<00:07:16.740> off<00:07:16.980> X<00:07:17.250> and<00:07:17.550> turn<00:07:17.670> on

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
weld option we'll turn off X and turn on

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.150 
weld option we'll turn off X and turn on
Z<00:07:18.240> so<00:07:18.510> it<00:07:18.630> crosses<00:07:18.810> one<00:07:19.320> side<00:07:19.530> to<00:07:19.680> the<00:07:19.800> other

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
Z so it crosses one side to the other

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.570 
Z so it crosses one side to the other
we'll<00:07:20.580> choose<00:07:20.850> mirror<00:07:21.420> and<00:07:21.570> weld<00:07:22.370> this<00:07:23.370> gives

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 
we'll choose mirror and weld this gives

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.710 
we'll choose mirror and weld this gives
us<00:07:23.730> a<00:07:23.820> nice<00:07:24.030> beautiful<00:07:25.130> machined<00:07:26.130> looking

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
us a nice beautiful machined looking

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.510 
us a nice beautiful machined looking
hard<00:07:27.720> surface<00:07:28.170> bevels<00:07:28.530> on<00:07:28.740> our<00:07:29.100> object<00:07:29.460> and

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
hard surface bevels on our object and

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.770 
hard surface bevels on our object and
this<00:07:29.670> is<00:07:29.790> a<00:07:29.820> terrific<00:07:30.750> way<00:07:30.900> to<00:07:30.930> do<00:07:32.600> sort<00:07:33.600> of<00:07:33.690> a

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:33.780 
this is a terrific way to do sort of a

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.350 
this is a terrific way to do sort of a
global<00:07:34.320> bevel<00:07:34.740> all<00:07:34.920> at<00:07:35.070> once<00:07:35.250> for<00:07:36.060> the<00:07:36.120> parts

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:36.360 
global bevel all at once for the parts

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.820 
global bevel all at once for the parts
that<00:07:36.420> you<00:07:36.570> get<00:07:36.720> out<00:07:36.870> of<00:07:37.550> shadow<00:07:38.550> box
