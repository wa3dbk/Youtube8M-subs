00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 of all of the party images 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.690
 so it's a real party 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.849
 successful people gave him to lower the price 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.980
 of the inputs also and then what 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.540
 it had been generated around the game 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.370
 that the regal side of barcelona say 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.470
 it is clear jose francisco that live 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.029
 In addition to sending his squad they stayed 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.270
 several of the titular players here 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.310
 bardot in the assumption suit 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.060
 and integration and descomplicado of local 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.430
 with the players 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.910
 with the alignment that we were 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 we are quickly that the site was 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.290
 pretty but it 's high because they had 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.360
 up the battery 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.810
 the area players in the center 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.400
 so we had to be 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.710
 watch out for any ball they can 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.900
 go down to the other companions 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.620
 here was the reception that we said 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.340
 where you see people one says own the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.470
 costume 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.000
 own and also of that handful of 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.470
 our university sports technique 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.540
 that this one could need me bank 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.860
 efficiency so is the animal hug 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.320
 sought or partner in the selection 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.060
 companion in those world of 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.950
 korea-japan in the classic photo you said 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.040
 something very interesting around zárate and 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 Anangonó talked a lot about you 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.880
 everything after knowing how I was going to 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 align that almeida and on that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.200
 answer made things easier 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.910
 defensively to that barcelona has not 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.800
 I had a link handout for these 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.920
 three forwards that were somewhat remote 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.170
 of the flyers it may be good but it 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.330
 saw in the game or not never has not 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.729
 a preference can not be right in 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.149
 the moment but times complicate us 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.330
 long but already with an income of lara 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.040
 one in cannes 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.250
 come also 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.530
 they are a little more and that's where we had 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.660
 this minute of the second time that they 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 do not have a lot to object to better 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.850
 says that the goal precisely of Claudio 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.290
 also leader is the fourth of the Argentine 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.900
 in the personal account 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.720
 a move whenever you see you put it to 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.690
 the backs of Ivan stolen stays 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.370
 ceases and dealers appear very well in the 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.979
 opportune moment where they have to 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.680
 appear the scorer to put the 1 to 0 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.990
 it was a prize to a team that nothing is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.330
 of the results regarding a philosophy 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.400
 of game a game pattern is offensive 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.040
 in any reach you now we have 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 a political idea that we play against him 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.319
 And we play 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.090
 with respect we always go out to look for 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.900
 define ourselves well in operation 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.269
 being serious 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.379
 simple and forward we have players who 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.819
 it is wanted in advance that by what time 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.530
 You can mark somewhere defense 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.659
 something that I want that to happen 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.480
 I commented it gives the feeling that I was going 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.799
 adopted touches the ball and the processes 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.409
 that maybe it will go on the ball 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.569
 as he took his hands almost without giving 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:47.459
 account because obviously if your defense 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.709
 he was being handed a shot 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.939
 indirect free truth can happen 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.530
 is that one 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.629
 besides it's not even a second they are not 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.659
 sentences obviously sometimes when one 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:59.909
 doubt makes mistakes and good with this 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.340
 understanding that he did not know how to take advantage of us 

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:04.409
 he gave it for lost has the merit of 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.490
 see also what was 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.910
 Ivan was that skill the ball 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.040
 any forward can give problems 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:17.790
 ensures the ball to them never 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.010
 loses the faith and follows later on 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.140
 final and noted that it is in a moment 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.930
 fantastic and think that it is far away 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.960
 of your sector because francisco I mean 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.180
 a joffré guerrón is spoken or at least 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:33.330
 part of the tactic or part of the plan 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.400
 strategic of a match can rotate or 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.800
 at least rely largely on the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.630
 fantastic moment that is going through 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.400
 of rum that is say they can and you have 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.800
 Of course I also offer on 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.750
 they can do a lot for the one who can talk 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:50.580
 this from here in a previous a match 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.650
 joffré a different role I follow fast 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.570
 the unbalancing creator then 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.580
 we have to take advantage of him when 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.410
 between bolaños also by left the 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.080
 meek composing the passes goal 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.700
 is looking for the tino of these 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.780
 talented players like 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.210
 different then we can explode in 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.930
 different areas exploit the base of the 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.109
 team 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.030
 of the previous year that was one more advantage 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.370
 the players that he incorporated for this 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.769
 year and they have answered him as 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.930
 the technician was waiting for the second 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.570
 time he asked for bauza because there was a 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.820
 detail came out and the assistant to look at what 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.039
 change said to barcelona for new 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.810
 move the chips the bauza path that they 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.370
 he said for good we knew rotated the 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.669
 change we do not have to empty the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:37.530
 three blow but but lawful gave 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.169
 result we got us a bow 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.620
 we did not have the ball the product of it 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.139
 that the rival team does not give us anger and 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.449
 created several goal options then not 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.729
 we were leaving the court our having 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:52.349
 the ball here is again 12 the error 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.660
 It is not loading and it was very serious 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.220
 problems to master the truth is that 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 all the sides that mark the one 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.599
 learn they have no problems there are no 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.360
 particular things bolaños in glass and 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:06.180
 goes with a cross shot that came back from 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.100
 horizontal that said early things 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.900
 obviously I'm not that special 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.729
 come out a little more but you also have to 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.699
 see what is the merit of him had a 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:16.860
 small play space not to say 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.810
 always up to tell me it would be ideal that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:23.130
 nobody hits the arch but obviously 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:26.569
 you have to give the players credit 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:28.550
 otherwise they can look for their spaces 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:30.169
 and its virtues that is one of them in 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.909
 this earth and is the best moment 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.529
 then they must be the least they were the 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.629
 best moments exactly comes the 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:37.309
 best save of the match with an action 

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.860
 that for many it was claimed the 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:41.059
 position of the body of jose francisco 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.669
 shows that the arms never go towards 

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:45.709
 back at least or at least go in 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.559
 the same position of the body of the archer 

00:05:45.709 --> 00:05:49.689
 a tremendous slice the reflections continue 

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:53.370
 to intact 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:56.840
 for now go out to god things 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.750
 in that play we hope to go doing 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.380
 the support you want to choose 24 hours 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:06.000
 after the game of so much considered 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:09.840
 what are you doing I see if I'm not going to 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.370
 analyze for me it 's fine true then 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.449
 they catch up but 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.139
 the bar how much 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:22.560
 what to carry are the hands 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.300
 and the interfecta and the promise 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.449
 the contact to kill who is in 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.120
 the action 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:30.129
 I also do not know, you are the ones who work 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.719
 the exceptions and in everything was been 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.089
 He anticipated a little bit that obviously 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:38.169
 as I said it does not get ahead of time 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:41.949
 environment be with time also be that 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:43.960
 I was everything but as I said true 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.809
 I'm not going to look for a very tall one but he's going 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.819
 with everything 

00:06:45.809 --> 00:06:50.930
 in that action this was not fixed more in the 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:53.060
 ball that my bullets 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.430
 if I do not see it coming to the hoop for that 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.039
 I understand anticipate that, so I do not see it 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:01.060
 come and when the 200 of the goal does not 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:03.289
 is you are on the court says for 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:06.050
 josé francisco cevallos from there the 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:07.550
 push I see it that way 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.979
 ok palace do not try are 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.380
 different the criteria that 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:14.720
 they establish as global there are no criminal 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.550
 that the whistles by the hand do not believe 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:19.009
 convenient or by a hospital as the 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.740
 criminal that in the end we were not whistled but 

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:24.770
 good are things that criteria 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.870
 pressure when a deserved the goal that the 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.300
 team how did he answer why he says it 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.009
 it gets a bit tedious though 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.870
 Barcelona was not the same as it was 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:34.729
 but if they did not in front they lowered the 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.270
 rhythm we could control more the 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:36.449
 ball 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.460
 [Music] 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.439
 and it was a midfield match and 

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.539
 attacked dominated archived but also 

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:44.610
 we had balls other interests both 

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:46.469
 andrey's a bigger criminal and the 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.569
 stadium banco pichincha arrives very late 

00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:50.219
 they kill because he had a good game he 

00:07:48.569 --> 00:07:50.639
 sweep over yours the year over 

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.129
 final 

00:07:50.639 --> 00:07:55.969
 Alarcón had very far more than 50 meters 

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:55.969
 behind the action
