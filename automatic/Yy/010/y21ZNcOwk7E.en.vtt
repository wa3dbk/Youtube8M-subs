00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:09.000
 speak it guys youtube already in TCO and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 but we always insist on 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.340
 delivering a well-done service even 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.300
 the road I made her whole 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.279
 appeared in other videos there is like a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 bit of a whim of painting wheel of 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 new black delivered to the customer I 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.849
 I have a little black that he paints the tire 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:30.750
 has a bit of grime of earth and such 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.610
 car than our region here is the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.960
 region of the great lakes here of the state 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.700
 of São Paulo region that gets here from 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.309
 bathed by the rio grande paraná river 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.030
 So everyone here this weekend is 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 and occurs at night plays of putting the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.460
 code and pro river and such and have fun 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 then a car willy - nilly without 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.329
 faces strategies is that fitting 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 tire that end tire then we are 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.329
 A whim gets a little dark now 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.190
 the staff is very dark but not 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.220
 You can see that she is black too. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.670
 to help the black wheels the tire 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.490
 and such, and I 'm going to get a 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.790
 now the people like this will make it difficult 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.990
 which is but the video showing a little 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.990
 no time 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.240
 so the care that we have with the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.119
 clients of doing a service 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.420
 that pleases the client but the video is not 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.880
 about that the video about it here 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 this dog in the workshop with the key 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 this way the key encoded in the key 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:42.509
 broken and this piece here 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.920
 there I had nothing with it the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.149
 service was suspension 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.360
 only that business or I can do 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.220
 I will not leave it that way, I will not go here. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.040
 the top team carnaval here we'll do 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.290
 the best way to understand I 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.659
 so I understood here the workshop that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.610
 I already had to run but today is workshop 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:06.090
 of the mechanic only that mechanic he has to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.590
 be top top of brazil on the day that i am 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.709
 better I say I always want 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.210
 improve and betray and is among the best 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.070
 your best nobody will ever get 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.980
 people who think themselves better and youtube 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.160
 of better mechanics the better mechanic 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 the mechanic mechanic of brazil the mechanic 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.300
 and mechanical 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.700
 in this game that is what is best and such 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.430
 I do not know if I want to be between 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.480
 the good always improving if someone is a 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.510
 step forward I want to take a step 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:38.290
 here again, it is not a tool 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:44.320
 I said I did not buy this from here. 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:46.660
 here was a ring-lock pliers and 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:51.460
 he already had a very red tip 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 until new but the bridge is not was in the 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.910
 favela was broken or related and gave it 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.010
 a rough manner in 2000 as well. 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.460
 as well just to was more 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.460
 take out what was there in the crux 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.810
 kernels who has nothing inside 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.700
 when there are yellow side turn agreement 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.590
 the key is the end is a way 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:29.830
 I do not know if you'll see the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:35.050
 video of a way here looks like it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.560
 handle it enters the it enters through the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.560
 key 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:44.340
 on the other side the best 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:59.250
 oprah live who knows does live, right? 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:15.220
 if I come here that you do not hit the actor 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:18.790
 he picks up and looks for a person to do 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.170
 video is not easy we do with 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.180
 affection and bronze 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.480
 that's how it fits I was 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.920
 trying in another way as he grabs 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.450
 here he stands on my toe 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:39.010
 stick your needle in that slot in that 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.740
 end up a little bit here in that key slot 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:45.490
 If you take the key, you will repair it. 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.740
 and here on the other side also what 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.390
 It happens, I said in a way that he 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:55.990
 becomes the extension of the key 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:57.970
 so I managed to withdraw there is no time 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.710
 What a great face I had there. 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.890
 I already had another channel on youtube and until 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.350
 I took it off the air and now I'm back with 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.940
 other videos new videos that the name of 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.880
 king of cars and such 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.740
 not that I'm the king of the cars and it's not 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.900
 a fictitious name that we give 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:18.760
 always try to remember that 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:21.700
 happen another sometimes comes a one 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.590
 paid paula of another channel and wanting 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.300
 or not all channels left over 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.210
 automotive has to be everything brother everything 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.720
 together and watching the video my video 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.300
 china is doctor car and has several others 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:39.460
 Guys I will not quote everyone there 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.650
 if you play you always have because we 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.290
 A super humble guy talked to people. 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.180
 well then the others I do not have either 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.080
 I did not have contact so I also 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:53.500
 I can not speak or that happens has 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.230
 always another one in the video will speak weapons 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.180
 I know you did a gambia plier but 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:59.950
 if you take pliers he will not 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.570
 had no broken utility was there 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.430
 and made the tool that here it has a 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:07.040
 function to take 1 to 1 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.360
 a broken key inside the kernels without 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.540
 need to disassemble 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:13.670
 I took about ten ten 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:17.750
 minutes there or so to do the 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:20.360
 pliers and try a minute and two 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.670
 minutes the spain puts in ten minutes 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.580
 I can solve a problem that I 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.150
 would have to remove that key core 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:33.380
 this is not a tool that 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:35.300
 worth the time I spent for the type 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.120
 in ten minutes solved the problem 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.520
 I'll pick up or make this key tomorrow. 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.750
 here it is codified it made everything cute 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.670
 now the customer that was delivered to 

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:46.310
 client will not have any of that string 

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:49.100
 that will take the sim that left here for the 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:50.330
 from there nothing but it's a champion thing 

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.130
 cool 

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.040
 understood did not deliver a perfect car 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.690
 state said that on the 2007 road I 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.010
 I like these cars here I really like them 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:03.080
 to stay being what happens 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:05.690
 Sometimes you go there in the workshop, the guy. 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.010
 nor does it have that last tooling 

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:09.440
 technology 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.290
 only if he has creativity and 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.630
 willingness to work and tv on that 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.830
 sense of balance the sense of wanting 

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.050
 do things right 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.710
 A good service will come out, I will not say. 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.480
 so it's the same here we mess things up 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:28.480
 than in other workshops in my region 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:31.070
 have not echoed key decoding 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.890
 central to burn central part 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.670
 They made us part to that side there. 

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:37.310
 for what? 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:39.290
 to try is always ahead always 

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.510
 always ahead one step ahead 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.250
 if someone takes a step closer to 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.810
 me I have to give another forward if 

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.550
 He keep with me, he has to give some more. 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.960
 he passed me I have to achieve it 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.970
 I imagine it to be so. 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.030
 For me to reach this point I have to 

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:57.230
 do what is good service car arrives 

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:59.800
 here it comes out perfect to do everything the way 

00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.800
 more
