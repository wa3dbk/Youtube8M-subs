so any any German I'm all boss that's
made<00:06:48.270> of<00:06:48.419> wood<00:06:48.630> is<00:06:49.530> a<00:06:49.590> rare<00:06:49.949> survivor<00:06:50.430> now<00:06:50.669> it

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
made of wood is a rare survivor now it

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:52.640 
made of wood is a rare survivor now it
is<00:06:50.940> another<00:06:51.270> said<00:06:51.570> they<00:06:51.720> do<00:06:51.870> commander<00:06:52.380> really

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
is another said they do commander really

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.740 
is another said they do commander really
crazy<00:06:52.949> price<00:06:53.280> especially<00:06:54.060> for<00:06:54.509> ones<00:06:54.660> that

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:54.750 
crazy price especially for ones that

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:56.770 
crazy price especially for ones that
hold<00:06:54.930> tank<00:06:55.289> ammunition<00:06:55.500> like<00:06:55.830> this<00:06:56.009> one<00:06:56.190> does

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
hold tank ammunition like this one does

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.529 
hold tank ammunition like this one does
so<00:06:57.780> that's<00:06:57.930> how<00:06:58.199> a<00:06:58.590> panther<00:06:59.430> tank<00:06:59.729> wooden<00:07:00.240> ammo

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 
so that's how a panther tank wooden ammo

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.920 
so that's how a panther tank wooden ammo
box<00:07:00.810> for<00:07:01.710> two<00:07:01.919> rounds<00:07:02.340> of<00:07:02.430> ammunition<00:07:02.930> should

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
box for two rounds of ammunition should

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:11.629 
box for two rounds of ammunition should
be<00:07:04.080> stenciled<00:07:04.500> up<00:07:04.590> and<00:07:04.740> finished<00:07:10.460> so<00:07:11.460> that's

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
be stenciled up and finished so that's

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.420 
be stenciled up and finished so that's
yet<00:07:11.789> another<00:07:11.849> item<00:07:12.389> in<00:07:12.479> the<00:07:12.570> collection

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430
