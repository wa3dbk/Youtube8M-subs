 everything changed 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.199
 it was only for 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:50.199

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.469
 here are 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:37.689
 the grade just goes back and forth 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.689
 especially throw up 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.869

 No No, make the world down below, you can still do everything perfectly here 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:56.589
 to adjust 

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:58.579
 if you have something from the beginning 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:00.719
 can one with posts and so on 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.989
 I can not do that now because I have it once a day 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.519
 then he can adjust for himself how he should move that I leave now 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.249
 not so often because it is already well filled for me and other uses 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:14.749
 for example, with networks picture from Nepal and 10 the project donations 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.270
 My husband just has courage face 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.620
 is already a good the churches but also pointless for one 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.749
 certain time 

00:04:46.749 --> 00:04:49.749
 I have as for example 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.639
 then you can hire the drivers Lichtenwald 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.550
 mills 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.639
 speed 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.849
 and then repeat yes or no 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.050
 and it can be opened 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.050

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.400
