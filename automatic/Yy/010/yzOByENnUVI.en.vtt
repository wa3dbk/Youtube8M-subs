00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
stick together they have to put

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.810 
stick together they have to put
something<00:02:01.469> called<00:02:01.560> binders<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.490> product

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
something called binders in the product

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.930 
something called binders in the product
which<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:02.969> for<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.630> layman's<00:02:04.020> terms<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.350> glue

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
which is for in layman's terms it's glue

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.850 
which is for in layman's terms it's glue
to<00:02:05.330> keep<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:05.720> machinery<00:02:06.320> from<00:02:06.560> getting

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
to keep the machinery from getting

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.250 
to keep the machinery from getting
gummed<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.250> they<00:02:07.790> got<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.030> put<00:02:08.180> flow<00:02:08.570> agents<00:02:09.110> in

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
gummed up they got to put flow agents in

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.630 
gummed up they got to put flow agents in
there<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.560> keep<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:09.800> machine<00:02:09.920> running<00:02:10.160> and

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
there and keep the machine running and

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.760 
there and keep the machine running and
so<00:02:10.790> I<00:02:10.970> don't<00:02:11.240> know<00:02:11.300> what<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:11.540> RDA<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:11.960> for<00:02:12.410> four

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
so I don't know what the RDA is for four

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.160 
so I don't know what the RDA is for four
binders<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:13.580> flow<00:02:13.820> agents<00:02:14.210> but<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.780> shouldn't

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
binders and flow agents but it shouldn't

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.260 
binders and flow agents but it shouldn't
be<00:02:15.200> getting<00:02:15.500> into<00:02:15.620> your<00:02:15.830> body<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:16.180> when<00:02:17.180> you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
stop to think about the first

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.360 
stop to think about the first

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
1959 technologies so you know just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.360 
1959 technologies so you know just
because<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.380> says<00:02:27.530> what<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.070> says<00:02:28.100> on<00:02:28.340> the

doesn't mean it's getting absorbed into
your<00:02:31.700> body<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:32.090> that's<00:02:32.210> what<00:02:32.900> counts<00:02:33.140> so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
your body and that's what counts so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.010
