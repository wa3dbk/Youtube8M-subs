thing I really like about this my
favorite<00:02:24.600> feature<00:02:24.810> is<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:26.550> whisking<00:02:26.970> system

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
favorite feature is the whisking system

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.880 
favorite feature is the whisking system
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.630> blender<00:02:27.960> system<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.500> they<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.740> in

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
of the blender system that they have in

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.860 
of the blender system that they have in
the<00:02:28.980> bottle<00:02:29.340> I<00:02:29.520> feel<00:02:30.120> that<00:02:30.330> this<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> best

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
the bottle I feel that this is the best

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.110 
the bottle I feel that this is the best
you<00:02:31.110> cannot<00:02:31.440> beat<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:32.970> is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you cannot beat this and this is

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.940 
you cannot beat this and this is
basically<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.720> looks<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.170> looks<00:02:34.890> like

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
basically what it looks like looks like

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.550 
basically what it looks like looks like
a<00:02:35.040> spider<00:02:35.460> web<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.600> when<00:02:36.780> you<00:02:36.870> put<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.200> unit

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
a spider web now when you put this unit

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
a spider web now when you put this unit
in<00:02:37.710> not<00:02:38.010> only<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> really<00:02:38.670> easy<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.940> clean

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
in not only is it really easy to clean

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.690 
in not only is it really easy to clean
because<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.780> bottle<00:02:40.110> is<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:40.410> big<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:41.520> when

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
because the bottle is so big but when

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.830 
because the bottle is so big but when
you<00:02:41.790> put<00:02:42.000> this<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.330> here<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.800> shake<00:02:44.010> it

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
you put this in here and as you shake it

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.810 
you put this in here and as you shake it
it<00:02:45.840> basically<00:02:45.990> blends<00:02:46.830> in<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.370> unit

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
it basically blends in this unit

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.110 
it basically blends in this unit
continues<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:49.140> blend<00:02:49.440> really<00:02:50.010> deep<00:02:50.370> down<00:02:50.670> in

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
continues to blend really deep down in

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.820 
continues to blend really deep down in
all<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.480> powder<00:02:51.720> really<00:02:52.170> mixing<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:52.770> with

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
all the powder really mixing that with

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.740 
all the powder really mixing that with
the<00:02:53.160> liquid<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.760> blending<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.510> really

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
the liquid and blending it really

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.230 
the liquid and blending it really
quickly<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.170> really<00:02:55.410> efficiently<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:57.000> let's

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
quickly and really efficiently now let's

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.610 
quickly and really efficiently now let's
face<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.450> guys<00:02:57.780> some<00:02:57.990> of<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.140> powder<00:02:58.380> out

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
face it guys some of the powder out

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
face it guys some of the powder out
there<00:02:58.890> is<00:02:59.070> really<00:02:59.850> really<00:03:00.030> tough<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.540> actually

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
there is really really tough to actually

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.770 
there is really really tough to actually
blend<00:03:01.110> without<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.500> blender<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.580> you<00:03:03.450> know<00:03:03.570> it's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
blend without a blender so you know it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.720 
blend without a blender so you know it's
really<00:03:03.930> really<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.830> tough<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.400> find<00:03:05.430> out

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
really really really tough to find out

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.270 
really really really tough to find out
the<00:03:05.790> actual<00:03:06.030> bottle<00:03:06.660> that's<00:03:07.260> accessible<00:03:07.890> and

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
the actual bottle that's accessible and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.790 
the actual bottle that's accessible and
is<00:03:08.820> usable<00:03:09.390> for<00:03:09.600> blending<00:03:10.230> your<00:03:10.350> powders<00:03:10.770> that

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
is usable for blending your powders that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.240 
is usable for blending your powders that
could<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.400> really<00:03:11.760> bad<00:03:12.410> without<00:03:13.410> using<00:03:13.950> actual

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
could be really bad without using actual

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.240 
could be really bad without using actual
blender<00:03:14.670> itself<00:03:15.090> so<00:03:15.480> this<00:03:16.080> product<00:03:16.680> right

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
blender itself so this product right

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.060 
blender itself so this product right
here<00:03:17.570> regardless<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.870> kind<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.320> protein

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070
