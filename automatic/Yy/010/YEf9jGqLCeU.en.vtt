00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
you've got a camera head yep and so

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.420 
you've got a camera head yep and so
you've<00:01:54.140> got<00:01:54.170> a<00:01:54.290> magnetic<00:01:54.620> tool<00:01:54.920> that'll<00:01:55.250> pick

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
you've got a magnetic tool that'll pick

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.060 
you've got a magnetic tool that'll pick
up<00:01:55.550> your<00:01:55.790> nut<00:01:56.570> that<00:01:56.780> drop<00:01:57.080> down<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.560> your<00:01:57.710> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
up your nut that drop down and your and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.890 
up your nut that drop down and your and
your<00:01:58.280> engine<00:01:58.610> bay<00:02:00.010> yep<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.310> you've<00:02:01.460> got<00:02:01.640> the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
your engine bay yep and you've got the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.510 
your engine bay yep and you've got the
mirror<00:02:02.900> there<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.410> you<00:02:04.010> know<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.220> smaller

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
mirror there so you know the smaller

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.540 
mirror there so you know the smaller
shorter<00:02:05.060> camera<00:02:05.480> heads<00:02:05.630> here<00:02:05.900> will<00:02:06.110> bend<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:07.400> a

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
shorter camera heads here will bend in a

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.089 
shorter camera heads here will bend in a
more<00:02:07.730> tight<00:02:08.119> radius<00:02:08.899> than<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.440> longer<00:02:09.709> one<00:02:09.920> will

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
more tight radius than a longer one will

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.979 
more tight radius than a longer one will
it<00:02:10.429> allows<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.910> get<00:02:11.000> into<00:02:11.180> smaller<00:02:11.540> places

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
it allows you to get into smaller places

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.840 
it allows you to get into smaller places
but<00:02:12.110> even<00:02:12.650> that's<00:02:12.800> got<00:02:12.950> limitations<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.670> when

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
but even that's got limitations and when

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.490 
but even that's got limitations and when
that<00:02:14.060> limits<00:02:14.420> out<00:02:14.570> you<00:02:14.780> can't<00:02:15.020> get<00:02:15.200> around<00:02:15.290> a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
that limits out you can't get around a

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.080 
that limits out you can't get around a
corner

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
corner

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.850 
corner
it<00:02:16.269> won't<00:02:16.480> been<00:02:16.660> tight<00:02:16.930> enough<00:02:17.140> throw<00:02:17.709> that

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
it won't been tight enough throw that

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.110 
it won't been tight enough throw that
mirror<00:02:18.129> on<00:02:18.280> there<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.640> now<00:02:18.730> you<00:02:18.819> can<00:02:18.849> see<00:02:19.060> it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
mirror on there and now you can see it

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.729 
mirror on there and now you can see it
around<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.360> corner<00:02:19.660> right<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.290> Bosch<00:02:20.440> says

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
around the corner right and Bosch says

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.500 
around the corner right and Bosch says
this<00:02:21.220> is<00:02:21.370> currently<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.730> smallest<00:02:22.060> head<00:02:22.390> in

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
this is currently the smallest head in

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.970 
this is currently the smallest head in
the<00:02:22.599> industry<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.230> for<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.769> can<00:02:23.800> get

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the industry so for that you can get

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.500 
the industry so for that you can get
around<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.280> tightest<00:02:24.580> corner<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.360> also

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
around the tightest corner and it also

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.720 
around the tightest corner and it also
has<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.780> video<00:02:25.900> out<00:02:26.230> yeah<00:02:26.620> it<00:02:26.709> does<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.400> know

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
has a video out yeah it does so you know

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.479 
has a video out yeah it does so you know
if<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.150> wanted<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.750> throw<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.739> video<00:02:30.069> on<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
if you wanted to throw that video on a

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.479 
if you wanted to throw that video on a
larger<00:02:31.330> screen<00:02:31.540> or<00:02:31.959> you<00:02:32.140> wanted<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.590> record<00:02:33.340> it

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
larger screen or you wanted to record it

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.009 
larger screen or you wanted to record it
I<00:02:33.580> guess<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.910> could<00:02:34.060> run<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.269> to<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> video

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
I guess you could run that to a video

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.350 
I guess you could run that to a video
recording<00:02:35.530> unit<00:02:36.069> okay<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.849> this<00:02:36.970> one's<00:02:37.180> off

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
recording unit okay and this one's off

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.180 
recording unit okay and this one's off
the<00:02:37.540> Bosch<00:02:37.930> power<00:02:38.290> platform<00:02:38.830> which<00:02:38.980> in<00:02:39.099> this

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
the Bosch power platform which in this

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.550 
the Bosch power platform which in this
case<00:02:39.400> is<00:02:39.610> 12<00:02:39.910> volts<00:02:40.150> on<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.080> world<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
case is 12 volts on to the world of

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.479 
case is 12 volts on to the world of
rigid<00:02:42.599> okay<00:02:43.620> wait<00:02:44.620> this<00:02:44.769> guy<00:02:44.950> up<00:02:45.129> right<00:02:45.310> here

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
because they have a sleep mode sometimes

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.080 
because they have a sleep mode sometimes
right<00:02:47.349> now<00:02:47.470> and<00:02:47.920> so<00:02:48.220> going<00:02:48.430> up<00:02:48.670> in<00:02:48.849> price

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
right now and so going up in price

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.120 
right now and so going up in price
you're<00:02:49.569> getting<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.810> nicer<00:02:50.079> screen<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.769> you're

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
you're getting a nicer screen and you're

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.979 
you're getting a nicer screen and you're
getting<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.489> bit<00:02:51.579> a<00:02:51.970> little<00:02:52.450> bit<00:02:52.540> nicer

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
getting a little bit a little bit nicer

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.289 
getting a little bit a little bit nicer
camera<00:02:53.170> I<00:02:53.410> think<00:02:53.680> you've<00:02:53.799> got<00:02:54.010> four<00:02:54.700> LEDs<00:02:55.120> on

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
camera I think you've got four LEDs on

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.880 
camera I think you've got four LEDs on
this<00:02:55.480> one<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:55.870> you're<00:02:56.380> getting<00:02:56.560> a<00:02:56.590> little<00:02:56.709> more

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
this one so you're getting a little more

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.670 
this one so you're getting a little more
balanced<00:02:57.400> lighting<00:02:58.390> in<00:02:59.110> the<00:02:59.230> camera

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
balanced lighting in the camera

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.410 
balanced lighting in the camera
yeah<00:02:59.860> because<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.549> monocular<00:03:01.120> light

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
yeah because with the monocular light

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.680 
yeah because with the monocular light
there<00:03:01.720> is<00:03:01.750> a<00:03:01.870> bit<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.260> shadow<00:03:03.010> yeah<00:03:03.549> yep<00:03:04.120> okay

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
there is a bit of a shadow yeah yep okay

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.410 
there is a bit of a shadow yeah yep okay
now<00:03:05.110> this<00:03:05.260> has<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.799> ability<00:03:06.099> to<00:03:06.310> to<00:03:06.549> put

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
now this has the ability to to put

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.940 
now this has the ability to to put
electronics<00:03:07.989> out<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.319> can<00:03:08.440> put<00:03:08.560> it<00:03:08.650> back<00:03:08.739> into

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
electronics out you can put it back into

and then the general this one has a
wireless<00:04:54.270> capabilities<00:04:54.870> yeah<00:04:55.020> once<00:04:55.289> we<00:04:55.379> get

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
wireless capabilities yeah once we get

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.770 
wireless capabilities yeah once we get
up<00:04:55.680> into<00:04:55.830> the<00:04:55.979> general<00:04:56.330> you're<00:04:57.330> looking<00:04:57.629> at

smaller<00:04:59.789> diameter<00:05:00.229> cable<00:05:01.229> on<00:05:01.289> this<00:05:01.469> one<00:05:01.620> they

00:05:02.209 --> 00:05:02.219 
smaller diameter cable on this one they

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:03.709 
smaller diameter cable on this one they
make<00:05:02.400> different<00:05:02.550> size<00:05:02.909> cables<00:05:03.389> for<00:05:03.539> all<00:05:03.599> these

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:03.719 
make different size cables for all these

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:04.969 
make different size cables for all these
things<00:05:03.960> this<00:05:04.139> one<00:05:04.319> happens<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> be<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
things this one happens to be the

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.159 
things this one happens to be the
smaller<00:05:05.250> diameter<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:06.539> nicer<00:05:06.840> thing<00:05:06.990> about

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
smaller diameter the nicer thing about

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.320 
smaller diameter the nicer thing about
the<00:05:07.289> smaller<00:05:07.500> diameter<00:05:07.680> cable<00:05:08.219> is<00:05:08.400> that<00:05:09.120> it

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
the smaller diameter cable is that it

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.290 
the smaller diameter cable is that it
can<00:05:09.509> get<00:05:09.599> into<00:05:09.780> smaller<00:05:10.050> spots<00:05:10.349> so<00:05:11.030> small<00:05:12.030> hold

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
can get into smaller spots so small hold

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.520 
can get into smaller spots so small hold
up<00:05:12.419> a<00:05:12.509> nice<00:05:13.169> day

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
to hold it someplace and the wireless

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.529 
to hold it someplace and the wireless
capability<00:05:49.440> doesn't<00:05:49.770> stop<00:05:49.949> there<00:05:50.310> so<00:05:51.000> if

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
capability doesn't stop there so if

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.779 
capability doesn't stop there so if
they're<00:05:51.810> sending<00:05:52.169> a<00:05:52.229> signal<00:05:52.409> wirelessly<00:05:52.759> to<00:05:53.759> a

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:53.789 
they're sending a signal wirelessly to a

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:55.519 
they're sending a signal wirelessly to a
camera<00:05:54.300> they<00:05:54.479> thought<00:05:54.690> why<00:05:54.990> not<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.440> know

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
camera they thought why not you know

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:56.869 
camera they thought why not you know
we're<00:05:55.680> already<00:05:55.830> doing<00:05:56.219> the<00:05:56.279> wireless<00:05:56.669> thing

00:05:56.869 --> 00:05:56.879 
we're already doing the wireless thing

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.969 
we're already doing the wireless thing
what<00:05:57.690> else<00:05:57.839> could<00:05:58.020> we<00:05:58.050> do<00:05:58.229> with<00:05:58.409> it<00:05:58.500> and<00:05:58.710> then

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
what else could we do with it and then

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:00.589 
what else could we do with it and then
they<00:05:59.129> they<00:05:59.490> sent<00:05:59.759> up<00:05:59.849> this<00:06:00.060> kit<00:06:00.330> right<00:06:00.539> here

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:00.599 
they they sent up this kit right here
