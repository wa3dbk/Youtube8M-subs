glass I do all of these antique

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.180 
glass I do all of these antique
appraisal<00:00:09.780> events<00:00:10.200> all<00:00:10.349> over<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.769> world<00:00:10.950> and

appraisal events all over the world and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.950 
appraisal events all over the world and
the<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.550> thing<00:00:11.820> that<00:00:12.000> people<00:00:12.120> can't<00:00:12.690> wrap

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
the one thing that people can't wrap

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.829 
the one thing that people can't wrap
their<00:00:13.200> mind<00:00:13.410> around<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.980> glass<00:00:14.420> glass<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> very

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
their mind around is glass glass is very

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.840 
their mind around is glass glass is very
inexpensive<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.560> make<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.770> that's<00:00:17.670> why

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
inexpensive to make and that's why

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.189 
inexpensive to make and that's why
there's<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.090> lot<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> glass<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:18.750> there<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
there's a lot of glass out there and

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.840 
there's a lot of glass out there and
that's<00:00:19.380> why<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:19.710> becomes<00:00:20.220> difficult<00:00:20.490> for

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
that's why it becomes difficult for

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
that's why it becomes difficult for
people<00:00:21.300> to<00:00:21.480> understand<00:00:22.289> what's<00:00:22.560> valuable<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
people to understand what's valuable and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
people to understand what's valuable and
what's<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> difference

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
what's not this is the difference

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.040 
what's not this is the difference
between<00:00:24.779> pressed<00:00:25.439> glass<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> cut<00:00:26.760> glass<00:00:27.150> okay

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
between pressed glass and cut glass okay

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
between pressed glass and cut glass okay
