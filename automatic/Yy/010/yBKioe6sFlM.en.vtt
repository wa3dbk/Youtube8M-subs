tell so I had to pull one down
and<00:04:42.360> i<00:04:43.080> also<00:04:43.380> use<00:04:43.860> a<00:04:44.810> water<00:04:45.810> temperature<00:04:46.260> gauge

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
and i also use a water temperature gauge

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.030 
and i also use a water temperature gauge
because<00:04:48.330> i<00:04:48.630> could<00:04:48.810> not<00:04:48.840> tap<00:04:49.260> into<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.890> honey

which<00:04:50.340> i<00:04:50.460> probably<00:04:50.670> could<00:04:50.970> but<00:04:52.460> little<00:04:53.460> more

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
which i probably could but little more

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.070 
which i probably could but little more

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
worth than I really wanted to so I just

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.630 
worth than I really wanted to so I just
use<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.380> mechanical<00:04:55.800> gauge<00:04:55.950> which<00:04:56.280> works

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
use the mechanical gauge which works

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.380 
use the mechanical gauge which works
