the<00:00:30.130> fourth<00:00:30.399> simple<00:00:30.969> technique<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:31.540> scale<00:00:31.779> the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
the fourth simple technique to scale the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.400 
the fourth simple technique to scale the
fish<00:00:32.110> is<00:00:32.590> by<00:00:32.800> simply<00:00:32.860> using<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:34.120> scalar<00:00:34.450> you

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
fish is by simply using the scalar you

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.939 
fish is by simply using the scalar you
simply<00:00:35.800> take<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.039> fish<00:00:36.399> like<00:00:37.359> so<00:00:37.859> holding<00:00:38.859> it

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
simply take the fish like so holding it

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:40.770 
simply take the fish like so holding it
placing<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.850> head<00:00:40.030> under<00:00:40.329> your<00:00:40.449> finger

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
placing the head under your finger

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.770 
placing the head under your finger
turning<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.530> fish<00:00:41.890> slightly<00:00:42.730> tilt<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:43.600> fish

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
turning the fish slightly tilt the fish

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.810 
turning the fish slightly tilt the fish
towards<00:00:44.230> you<00:00:44.320> using<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.129> top<00:00:45.339> half<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.760> the

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
towards you using the top half of the

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.819 
towards you using the top half of the
scalar<00:00:46.239> it's<00:00:46.989> just<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.320> matter<00:00:47.499> of<00:00:47.589> bringing

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
scalar it's just a matter of bringing

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.310 
scalar it's just a matter of bringing
the<00:00:48.100> scalar<00:00:48.489> up<00:00:48.850> the<00:00:49.420> fish<00:00:49.629> like<00:00:49.870> that<00:00:49.899> under

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
the scalar up the fish like that under

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.369 
the scalar up the fish like that under
the<00:00:50.739> line<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:52.030> next<00:00:52.300> one<00:00:52.480> is<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.989> tilt<00:00:53.230> it

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
the line the next one is to tilt it

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.770 
the line the next one is to tilt it
again<00:00:53.710> till<00:00:54.280> it<00:00:54.429> that<00:00:54.579> way<00:00:54.760> bring<00:00:55.449> the<00:00:55.569> fish

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
again till it that way bring the fish

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.319 
again till it that way bring the fish
the<00:00:56.679> scalar<00:00:57.010> that<00:00:57.579> way<00:00:58.800> on<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.069> other<00:01:00.100> side

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
the scalar that way on the other side

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.270 
the scalar that way on the other side
it's<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.420> same<00:01:01.719> 90<00:01:02.469> degrees<00:01:02.800> to<00:01:02.829> the<00:01:03.069> bench

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
it's the same 90 degrees to the bench

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.310 
it's the same 90 degrees to the bench
using<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.850> back<00:01:04.059> half<00:01:04.269> of<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.570> knife<00:01:04.720> not<00:01:05.110> the

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
using the back half of the knife not the

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.380 
using the back half of the knife not the
point<00:01:05.470> the<00:01:06.070> back<00:01:06.280> half<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.760> knife<00:01:06.940> it's

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
point the back half of the knife it's

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.670 
point the back half of the knife it's
just<00:01:07.570> a<00:01:07.660> matter<00:01:07.810> of<00:01:07.900> pushing<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> there<00:01:08.500> and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
just a matter of pushing it there and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.050 
just a matter of pushing it there and
pushing<00:01:09.040> straight<00:01:09.340> out<00:01:09.550> see<00:01:09.820> how<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.000> all

that once again you've got your pin bone

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.790 
that once again you've got your pin bone
so<00:01:22.030> the<00:01:22.510> pin<00:01:22.750> bone<00:01:22.930> is<00:01:23.080> there<00:01:23.260> you<00:01:23.530> put<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
so the pin bone is there you put the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.290 
so the pin bone is there you put the
knife<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.310> back<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.670> night<00:01:24.790> there<00:01:25.090> and

fish do it this way so you're always

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.270 
fish do it this way so you're always
cutting<00:01:38.030> away<00:01:38.300> from<00:01:38.690> yourself<00:01:39.100> right<00:01:40.100> it's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
cutting away from yourself right it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.950 
cutting away from yourself right it's
