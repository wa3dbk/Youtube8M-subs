but a downfall for Minecraft Pocket

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.670 
but a downfall for Minecraft Pocket
Edition<00:00:43.520> is<00:00:44.030> that<00:00:44.390> you<00:00:45.050> know<00:00:45.140> you<00:00:45.230> can't

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
Edition is that you know you can't

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.000 
Edition is that you know you can't
really<00:00:46.489> use<00:00:46.789> any<00:00:47.059> other<00:00:47.420> type<00:00:47.870> of<00:00:47.899> skin<00:00:48.680> other

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
really use any other type of skin other

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.740 
really use any other type of skin other
than<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.670> slim<00:00:50.030> or<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:50.660> original<00:00:51.940> model<00:00:52.940> so

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
than the slim or the original model so

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.180 
than the slim or the original model so
basically<00:00:54.079> what<00:00:54.320> it's<00:00:54.469> trying<00:00:54.649> to<00:00:54.800> say<00:00:54.980> it's

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
basically what it's trying to say it's

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.610 
basically what it's trying to say it's
like<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:55.579> can't<00:00:55.820> use<00:00:56.199> entities<00:00:57.199> that<00:00:57.410> look

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
like you can't use entities that look

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.580 
like you can't use entities that look
like<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.309> look<00:00:58.550> other<00:00:58.760> than<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.300> Steve<00:01:00.230> skin

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
like that look other than the Steve skin

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.279 
like that look other than the Steve skin
so<00:01:00.949> you<00:01:00.980> can't<00:01:01.399> have<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:01.820> wither<00:01:02.120> or<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:02.989> gas

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
so you can't have the wither or the gas

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.130 
so you can't have the wither or the gas
you<00:01:03.590> can't<00:01:03.829> look<00:01:04.010> like<00:01:04.040> those<00:01:04.760> headless<00:01:05.330> those

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can't look like those headless those

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.219 
you can't look like those headless those
headless<00:01:06.530> skins<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:08.119> that<00:01:08.390> is<00:01:08.689> kind<00:01:09.020> of<00:01:09.140> a

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
headless skins so that is kind of a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.190 
headless skins so that is kind of a
downfall<00:01:09.680> but<00:01:10.340> hey<00:01:10.970> we<00:01:11.299> still<00:01:11.509> get<00:01:11.689> skin<00:01:11.960> packs

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.719 
game and we won't have to worry about
anything<00:01:38.750> but<00:01:39.200> that's<00:01:39.439> just<00:01:39.649> an<00:01:39.829> idea<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.189> what

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
anything but that's just an idea of what

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:42.249 
anything but that's just an idea of what
it<00:01:40.939> may<00:01:41.119> look<00:01:41.299> like<00:01:41.360> in<00:01:41.720> Minecraft<00:01:42.110> Pocket

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
it may look like in Minecraft Pocket

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.170 
it may look like in Minecraft Pocket
Edition<00:01:42.470> because<00:01:42.890> that's<00:01:43.640> how<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:43.939> looks<00:01:44.090> like

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
Edition because that's how it looks like

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.350 
Edition because that's how it looks like
in<00:01:44.420> Xbox<00:01:45.320> 360<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:46.640> aren't<00:01:46.820> a<00:01:46.939> hundred

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
in Xbox 360 so we aren't a hundred

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.539 
in Xbox 360 so we aren't a hundred
percent<00:01:47.450> confirmed<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.350> what<00:01:48.770> skin<00:01:49.369> packs

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
percent confirmed on what skin packs

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:50.859 
percent confirmed on what skin packs
actually<00:01:49.909> look<00:01:50.090> like<00:01:50.270> in<00:01:50.450> Pocket<00:01:50.810> Edition

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
actually look like in Pocket Edition

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.749 
actually look like in Pocket Edition
just<00:01:51.320> yet<00:01:51.500> but<00:01:51.740> this<00:01:51.890> gives<00:01:52.070> us<00:01:52.250> an<00:01:52.399> idea<00:01:52.700> of

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
just yet but this gives us an idea of

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.380 
just yet but this gives us an idea of
what<00:01:53.119> it<00:01:53.240> may<00:01:53.390> be<00:01:54.079> like<00:01:54.290> in<00:01:54.560> Pocket<00:01:55.219> Edition

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390
