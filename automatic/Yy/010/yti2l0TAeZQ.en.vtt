00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.690
 hi everyone i believe this video that 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.220
 maybe I should have created first and where 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.830
 I show you how it works 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 mini tour partition the second to mine 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.410
 notice one of the best programs for 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.480
 create partitions delete them and do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.830
 many operations on ours on ours 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.410
 discs 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 then we go to open it once 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.250
 open 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.450
 we will have our partitions for example 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.370
 of the breath and I say that I should have 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.840
 create this video first because if you do 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.170
 the transition from previous windows 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.090
 numbered, sorry if you do 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.210
 switching from windows to a windows 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.600
 previous to windows 8 pro there is case that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 the memory available on your disk 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.940
 in fact, the system will not be sufficient 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.660
 in the market he asked me to have at least 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 16 GB of free space on my hard disk ce 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.540
 I had to use the partition tools 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 to create a no to create in this 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.860
 case to expand my unit both in 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.960
 which few words are enough to do xtend e 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.909
 here set how much we want it to be 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.869
 big c is 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.900
 as you can see I now have to 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.420
 leaving me it will be enough to move this band 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.939
 now I sue because I am less 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.130
 waste makes them much partition and into 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.670
 this case is once we do that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.619
 will tell us to apply and precisely 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.659
 we will widen it will widen the disc c in 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.210
 based on the space you need to guide 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:52.530
 under pro we can obviously eliminate 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 one partition create another new e 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.979
 do lots of other operations 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.560
 really this is in my opinion one of the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.799
 best programs to manage ours 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 disks and our partitions just right for 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.649
 to tell you this program 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.050
 in case you need to do just one 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.060
 partition also for other reasons not 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.209
 only for switching from windows to a 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.090
 previous windows from below pro and nothing 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.599
 for the moment we all feel at the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.599
 next
