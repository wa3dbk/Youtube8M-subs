the<00:00:19.419> first<00:00:19.660> step<00:00:19.900> is<00:00:20.079> to<00:00:20.230> place<00:00:20.439> three<00:00:20.800> large

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
the first step is to place three large

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.639 
the first step is to place three large
egg<00:00:21.369> whites<00:00:21.609> into<00:00:21.970> a<00:00:22.150> mixing<00:00:22.539> bowl<00:00:22.720> be<00:00:23.320> very

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:23.649 
egg whites into a mixing bowl be very

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.650 
egg whites into a mixing bowl be very
sure<00:00:23.919> that<00:00:23.949> no<00:00:24.369> yolks<00:00:24.699> remain<00:00:25.149> in<00:00:25.359> the<00:00:25.480> whites

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
sure that no yolks remain in the whites

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.810 
sure that no yolks remain in the whites
the<00:00:26.349> fat<00:00:26.619> will<00:00:26.829> prevent<00:00:27.160> the<00:00:27.399> whites<00:00:27.609> from

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
the fat will prevent the whites from

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.299 
the fat will prevent the whites from
peaking<00:00:28.179> correctly<00:00:28.660> I've<00:00:29.410> already<00:00:29.949> placed

peaking correctly I've already placed

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.600 
peaking correctly I've already placed
two<00:00:30.910> egg<00:00:31.210> whites<00:00:31.680> into<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:32.769> bowl<00:00:32.949> and<00:00:33.219> I'm

two egg whites into the bowl and I'm
showing<00:00:33.850> here<00:00:34.269> how<00:00:34.570> I<00:00:34.809> prefer<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.620> get<00:00:35.769> the<00:00:35.890> egg

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040

and move the yolk back and forth into

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:43.680 
and move the yolk back and forth into
the<00:00:40.629> broken<00:00:40.989> shell<00:00:41.699> then<00:00:42.699> what<00:00:43.390> you're<00:00:43.570> going

the salt has been added you're then
going<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.829> want<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.159> continue<00:01:09.430> mixing<00:01:09.850> with

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 
going to want to continue mixing with

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:14.490 
going to want to continue mixing with
your<00:01:10.689> mixer<00:01:11.759> most<00:01:12.759> of<00:01:13.000> this<00:01:13.150> recipe<00:01:13.570> has<00:01:14.049> to<00:01:14.320> do

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
your mixer most of this recipe has to do

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.649 
your mixer most of this recipe has to do
with<00:01:14.829> a<00:01:14.890> lot<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.340> mixing<00:01:15.850> from<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.119> mixer<00:01:16.420> so<00:01:16.630> I

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
with a lot of mixing from the mixer so I

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.600 
with a lot of mixing from the mixer so I
wouldn't<00:01:17.079> really<00:01:17.290> recommend<00:01:17.409> doing<00:01:18.250> it<00:01:18.460> by

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
wouldn't really recommend doing it by

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.580 
wouldn't really recommend doing it by
hand<00:01:18.850> but<00:01:19.479> I<00:01:19.750> would<00:01:20.049> be<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.290> to<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.560> challenge

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
hand but I would be up to the challenge

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.200 
hand but I would be up to the challenge
at<00:01:21.070> some<00:01:21.250> point<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.579> see<00:01:21.729> if<00:01:21.820> I<00:01:21.880> can<00:01:22.030> actually

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
at some point to see if I can actually

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.510 
at some point to see if I can actually
do<00:01:22.510> it

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
do it

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.789 
do it
now<00:01:23.970> at<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.420> point<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.900> want<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.200> reach<00:01:25.409> soft

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
now at this point you want to reach soft

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
now at this point you want to reach soft
peaks<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.939> unfamiliar<00:01:27.479> what<00:01:27.689> that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
peaks if you're unfamiliar what that

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.679 
peaks if you're unfamiliar what that
means<00:01:28.079> all<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.700> beat<00:01:29.909> egg<00:01:30.210> whites<00:01:30.240> or

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
means all it is is to beat egg whites or

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
means all it is is to beat egg whites or
whipping<00:01:31.380> cream<00:01:31.530> until<00:01:31.920> peaks<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.670> formed

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
whipping cream until peaks are formed

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
whipping cream until peaks are formed
when<00:01:33.630> batters<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.380> lifted<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.280> tips<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
when batters are lifted the tips of the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.020 
when batters are lifted the tips of the
peeps<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.180> curl<00:01:36.450> over

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.810 

as<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.320> here<00:01:43.799> when<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.190> lift<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
as you can see here when I lift the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.390 
as you can see here when I lift the
beater<00:01:45.030> up<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.840> can<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.320> it<00:01:46.830> does<00:01:47.130> have

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
beater up you can see how it does have

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.210 
beater up you can see how it does have
Peaks<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:48.690> they<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.170> droop<00:01:49.619> down<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.070> that's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
Peaks but they do droop down and that's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.660 
Peaks but they do droop down and that's
exactly<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.000> stage<00:01:51.330> we<00:01:51.540> want<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> point

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
exactly the stage we want at this point

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050 
exactly the stage we want at this point
it's<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.330> nice<00:01:54.570> creamy<00:01:55.170> shiny<00:01:55.680> consistency<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
it's a nice creamy shiny consistency but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.610 
it's a nice creamy shiny consistency but
it's<00:01:57.240> not<00:01:57.420> close<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.780> being<00:01:57.990> done<00:01:58.320> yet<00:01:58.500> because

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
it's not close to being done yet because

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.260 
it's not close to being done yet because
we<00:01:58.830> still<00:01:59.040> have<00:01:59.220> a<00:01:59.250> few<00:01:59.520> more<00:01:59.640> ingredients<00:01:59.790> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
we still have a few more ingredients to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.530 
we still have a few more ingredients to
add<00:02:01.220> so<00:02:02.220> at<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.790> point<00:02:03.119> you're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
add so at this point you're going to

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080 
add so at this point you're going to
want<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.810> add<00:02:03.990> your<00:02:04.290> extract<00:02:04.800> you<00:02:05.550> can<00:02:05.580> add<00:02:05.790> any

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
want to add your extract you can add any

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.160 
want to add your extract you can add any
type<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.750> you'd<00:02:07.050> like<00:02:07.229> I'm<00:02:07.530> any<00:02:07.950> vanilla<00:02:09.170> I'm

just<00:02:10.530> eyeballing<00:02:10.709> it<00:02:11.160> here<00:02:11.220> but<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.510> recipe

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
just eyeballing it here but for a recipe

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670 
just eyeballing it here but for a recipe
like<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:13.560> would<00:02:13.860> use<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.490> teaspoon<00:02:15.420> -<00:02:16.320> max

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
like this I would use a teaspoon - max

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.650 
like this I would use a teaspoon - max
you<00:02:17.070> don't<00:02:17.250> want<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> overpower<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.180> -<00:02:18.420> too

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
you don't want to overpower it - too

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.610 
you don't want to overpower it - too
much<00:02:20.060> then<00:02:21.060> you're<00:02:21.870> going<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.050> continue<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
much then you're going to continue to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.270 
much then you're going to continue to
beat<00:02:23.069> it<00:02:23.220> with<00:02:23.370> your<00:02:23.520> mixer<00:02:23.930> at<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:26.010> point

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
beat it with your mixer at this point

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.500 
beat it with your mixer at this point
you're<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.550> want<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.820> increase<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you're going to want to increase the

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.590 
you're going to want to increase the
mixer<00:02:27.870> speed<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.350> high<00:02:29.060> continue<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.180> beat<00:02:30.360> for

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
mixer speed to high continue to beat for

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.500 
mixer speed to high continue to beat for
two<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.989> three<00:02:31.260> minutes<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.970> you're<00:02:33.360> going

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
two to three minutes then you're going

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.110 
two to three minutes then you're going
to<00:02:33.600> want<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.840> add<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.290> sugar<00:02:35.120> unfortunately

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
to want to add the sugar unfortunately

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.550 
to want to add the sugar unfortunately
didn't<00:02:36.480> record<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:37.019> part<00:02:37.230> because<00:02:37.440> my

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
didn't record this part because my

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.220 
didn't record this part because my
camera<00:02:37.920> shut<00:02:38.100> off<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.459> didn't<00:02:38.970> realize<00:02:39.450> but

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
camera shut off and I didn't realize but

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.400 
camera shut off and I didn't realize but
all<00:02:40.680> you're<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> want<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.489> do<00:02:41.700> is<00:02:42.410> pour

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
all you're going to want to do is pour

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.620 
all you're going to want to do is pour
the<00:02:43.590> sugar<00:02:43.860> at<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.100> steady<00:02:44.640> stream<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.450> the

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
the sugar at a steady stream on the

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.350 
the sugar at a steady stream on the
inside<00:02:46.140> edge<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> bowl<00:02:47.150> you're<00:02:48.150> then

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
inside edge of the bowl you're then

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.580 
inside edge of the bowl you're then
going<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> beat<00:02:48.989> until<00:02:49.230> you<00:02:50.010> get<00:02:50.220> firm<00:02:50.880> peaks

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
going to beat until you get firm peaks

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.520 
going to beat until you get firm peaks
firm<00:02:52.590> peaks<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.400> same<00:02:53.730> concept<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:55.380> we

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
firm peaks is the same concept that we

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.229 
firm peaks is the same concept that we
talked<00:02:55.830> about<00:02:56.010> with<00:02:56.519> soft<00:02:56.820> peaks

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
talked about with soft peaks

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.720 
talked about with soft peaks
instead<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.290> them<00:02:58.470> drooping<00:02:59.010> down<00:02:59.190> they're

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
instead of them drooping down they're

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.240 
instead of them drooping down they're
gonna<00:02:59.880> be<00:03:00.180> more<00:03:00.690> soft<00:03:01.079> you'll<00:03:01.680> be<00:03:01.920> able<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
gonna be more soft you'll be able to

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.370 
gonna be more soft you'll be able to
tell<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.850> difference<00:03:02.880> for<00:03:03.540> sure

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
tell the difference for sure

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.310 
tell the difference for sure
then<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.370> gonna<00:03:06.550> want<00:03:06.820> to<00:03:06.910> grab<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.510> large

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
then you're gonna want to grab a large

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.220 
then you're gonna want to grab a large
ziploc<00:03:08.920> bag<00:03:09.190> like<00:03:09.550> I'm<00:03:09.730> using<00:03:09.940> here<00:03:10.090> or<00:03:10.630> a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
ziploc bag like I'm using here or a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.780 
ziploc bag like I'm using here or a
piping<00:03:11.800> bag<00:03:11.830> to<00:03:13.380> make<00:03:14.380> it<00:03:14.590> easier<00:03:15.130> for<00:03:15.220> me<00:03:15.640> I

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
piping bag to make it easier for me I

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.720 
piping bag to make it easier for me I
place<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:16.810> piping<00:03:17.230> bag<00:03:17.260> or<00:03:17.680> is<00:03:18.070> a<00:03:18.100> buck<00:03:18.340> bag<00:03:18.550> in

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
place the piping bag or is a buck bag in

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.870 
place the piping bag or is a buck bag in
my<00:03:18.880> case<00:03:19.150> into<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.020> cup<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.530> then<00:03:21.010> pour<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.670> all

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
my case into a cup and then pour it all

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.620 
my case into a cup and then pour it all
my<00:03:22.420> mixture<00:03:22.780> into<00:03:23.320> the<00:03:23.800> bag<00:03:23.980> that<00:03:24.190> way

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.050 

at<00:03:28.110> this<00:03:28.470> step<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.950> would<00:03:29.010> take<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.460> time<00:03:29.640> to

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
at this step I would take the time to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.990 
at this step I would take the time to
turn<00:03:30.420> your<00:03:30.480> oven<00:03:30.870> on<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.350> 200<00:03:31.890> degrees<00:03:32.370> you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
turn your oven on to 200 degrees you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180 
turn your oven on to 200 degrees you
want<00:03:33.180> it<00:03:33.300> on<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.690> very<00:03:34.200> low<00:03:34.410> setting<00:03:35.040> because

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
want it on a very low setting because

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.060 
want it on a very low setting because
you're<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.790> really<00:03:36.410> baking<00:03:37.410> these<00:03:37.560> cookies

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
you're not really baking these cookies

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.160 
you're not really baking these cookies
you're<00:03:38.250> more<00:03:38.520> drying<00:03:39.270> them<00:03:39.540> out<00:03:39.660> so<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.990> can

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
you're more drying them out so you can

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.430 
you're more drying them out so you can
get<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.800> crispy<00:03:41.460> fluffy<00:03:42.150> Airy<00:03:42.630> cookie

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
get the crispy fluffy Airy cookie

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.410 
get the crispy fluffy Airy cookie
moraine<00:03:43.950> type

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.540 

once<00:03:47.020> all<00:03:47.260> the<00:03:47.380> Marines<00:03:47.710> in<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.160> bank<00:03:48.340> you're

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
once all the Marines in the bank you're

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.460 
once all the Marines in the bank you're
then<00:03:48.730> gonna<00:03:48.910> make<00:03:49.210> sure<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.720> push<00:03:49.960> everything

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
then gonna make sure you push everything

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.770 
then gonna make sure you push everything
down<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.430> bottom<00:03:51.910> where<00:03:52.030> your<00:03:52.180> opening<00:03:52.630> is

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
down to the bottom where your opening is

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.260 
down to the bottom where your opening is
going<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:53.080> be<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:54.340> can<00:03:54.520> use<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.700> tip<00:03:55.000> if<00:03:55.150> you

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
going to be you can use a tip if you

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.140 
going to be you can use a tip if you
prefer<00:03:55.600> but<00:03:55.840> I<00:03:55.959> just<00:03:56.590> liked<00:03:57.010> if<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.640> hole<00:03:57.880> in

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
prefer but I just liked if the hole in

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.870 
prefer but I just liked if the hole in
the<00:03:58.270> bottom<00:03:58.569> a<00:03:58.720> larger<00:03:59.620> hole<00:04:00.220> so<00:04:00.580> you<00:04:00.640> can

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
the bottom a larger hole so you can

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.870 
the bottom a larger hole so you can
create<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.480> ghosts<00:04:01.840> more<00:04:01.990> evenly<00:04:02.670> you<00:04:03.670> can

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
create the ghosts more evenly you can

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.570 
create the ghosts more evenly you can
make<00:04:04.090> these<00:04:04.300> big<00:04:04.810> small<00:04:05.410> different<00:04:06.310> shapes

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
make these big small different shapes

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.020 
make these big small different shapes
and<00:04:06.760> they<00:04:06.970> don't<00:04:07.209> even<00:04:07.300> have<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.720> be<00:04:07.810> ghosts

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
and they don't even have to be ghosts

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.699 
and they don't even have to be ghosts
now<00:04:10.030> if<00:04:10.270> you<00:04:10.420> want<00:04:10.720> to<00:04:10.840> create<00:04:11.020> ghosts<00:04:11.320> like<00:04:11.530> me

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
now if you want to create ghosts like me

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.070 
now if you want to create ghosts like me
you<00:04:12.310> kind<00:04:12.640> of<00:04:12.790> just<00:04:13.000> make<00:04:13.180> a<00:04:13.209> little<00:04:13.450> spiral

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
you kind of just make a little spiral

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.069 
you kind of just make a little spiral
shape<00:04:14.500> as<00:04:14.680> I'm<00:04:14.830> doing<00:04:15.010> here<00:04:15.459> I<00:04:15.750> did<00:04:16.750> about

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
shape as I'm doing here I did about
