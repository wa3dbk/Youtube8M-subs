has a 1.4 trillion dollar deficit and i
think<00:03:44.930> probably<00:03:45.139> the<00:03:45.379> most<00:03:45.590> cynical<00:03:45.949> gimmick

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
think probably the most cynical gimmick

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.129 
think probably the most cynical gimmick
in<00:03:46.519> this<00:03:46.699> bill<00:03:46.910> is<00:03:47.150> something<00:03:47.870> that<00:03:47.959> we<00:03:48.109> all

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
in this bill is something that we all

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.199 
in this bill is something that we all
probably<00:03:48.500> agree<00:03:48.980> on<00:03:49.160> we<00:03:49.699> don't<00:03:49.849> think<00:03:50.120> we

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
probably agree on we don't think we

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.580 
probably agree on we don't think we
should<00:03:50.239> cut<00:03:50.569> doctors<00:03:50.959> twenty<00:03:51.349> one<00:03:51.470> percent

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
should cut doctors twenty one percent

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.099 
should cut doctors twenty one percent
next<00:03:52.040> year<00:03:52.220> we've<00:03:52.819> stopped<00:03:53.449> those<00:03:53.690> cuts<00:03:53.989> from

dollars it was in the first iteration of
all<00:04:04.790> these<00:04:04.940> bills<00:04:05.209> but<00:04:06.019> because<00:04:06.319> it<00:04:06.590> was<00:04:06.709> a<00:04:06.739> big

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
all these bills but because it was a big

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.979 
all these bills but because it was a big
price<00:04:07.220> tag<00:04:07.459> and<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:08.060> made<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.329> score<00:04:08.569> look<00:04:08.780> bad

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
price tag and it made the score look bad

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.020 
price tag and it made the score look bad
made<00:04:09.319> it<00:04:09.440> look<00:04:09.470> like<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.709> deficit<00:04:10.190> that<00:04:10.760> bill

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
made it look like a deficit that bill

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.490 
made it look like a deficit that bill
was<00:04:11.060> that<00:04:11.389> provision<00:04:11.750> was<00:04:11.780> taken<00:04:12.169> out<00:04:12.290> and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
was that provision was taken out and

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.020 
was that provision was taken out and
it's<00:04:12.919> been<00:04:13.069> going<00:04:13.220> on<00:04:13.430> as<00:04:13.639> standalone

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
it's been going on as standalone

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.810 
it's been going on as standalone
legislation<00:04:14.989> but<00:04:15.739> ignoring<00:04:16.070> these<00:04:16.280> costs

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
legislation but ignoring these costs

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.670 
legislation but ignoring these costs
does<00:04:17.299> not<00:04:17.510> remove<00:04:17.810> them<00:04:18.019> from<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.320> backs<00:04:18.500> of

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
does not remove them from the backs of

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.729 
does not remove them from the backs of
taxpayers<00:04:19.239> hiding<00:04:20.239> spending<00:04:20.780> does<00:04:21.500> not

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
taxpayers hiding spending does not

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.219 
taxpayers hiding spending does not
reduce<00:04:21.950> spending<00:04:22.669> and<00:04:23.000> so<00:04:23.780> when<00:04:23.930> you<00:04:24.020> take<00:04:24.200> a

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
reduce spending and so when you take a

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.010 
reduce spending and so when you take a
look<00:04:24.349> at<00:04:24.590> all<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.950> it<00:04:25.130> just<00:04:25.159> doesn't<00:04:25.700> add

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
look at all this it just doesn't add

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.960 
look at all this it just doesn't add
then<00:04:26.139> so<00:04:26.289> let's<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.680> finish<00:04:27.340> with<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.729> cost

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
then so let's just finish with the cost

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.180 
then so let's just finish with the cost
curve<00:04:28.240> are<00:04:28.479> we<00:04:29.110> bending<00:04:29.410> the<00:04:29.500> cost<00:04:29.650> curve<00:04:29.830> down

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
curve are we bending the cost curve down

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.670 
curve are we bending the cost curve down
or<00:04:30.460> are<00:04:30.910> we<00:04:31.000> bending<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.360> cost<00:04:31.509> curve<00:04:31.690> up<00:04:32.020> well

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
or are we bending the cost curve up well

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.890 
or are we bending the cost curve up well
if<00:04:32.830> you<00:04:32.949> look<00:04:33.099> at<00:04:33.310> your<00:04:33.520> own<00:04:33.729> chief<00:04:34.120> actuary<00:04:34.659> at

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
if you look at your own chief actuary at

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.050 
if you look at your own chief actuary at
Medicare<00:04:35.319> were<00:04:35.860> bending<00:04:36.159> it<00:04:36.280> up<00:04:36.430> he's

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
Medicare were bending it up he's

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.450 
Medicare were bending it up he's
claiming<00:04:37.509> that<00:04:37.599> we're<00:04:37.780> going<00:04:37.990> up<00:04:38.139> 222<00:04:39.099> billion

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
claiming that we're going up 222 billion

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.909 
claiming that we're going up 222 billion
dollars<00:04:39.789> adding<00:04:40.659> more<00:04:40.900> to<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.199> unsustainable

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
dollars adding more to the unsustainable

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.059 
dollars adding more to the unsustainable
fiscal<00:04:42.370> situation<00:04:42.729> we<00:04:43.210> have<00:04:43.389> and<00:04:43.659> so<00:04:44.319> when<00:04:44.979> you

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
fiscal situation we have and so when you

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.640 
fiscal situation we have and so when you
take<00:04:45.250> a<00:04:45.280> look<00:04:45.490> at<00:04:45.610> this<00:04:45.759> it's<00:04:46.479> really<00:04:46.720> deeper

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
take a look at this it's really deeper

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.279 
take a look at this it's really deeper
than<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.009> deficits<00:04:48.669> or<00:04:48.879> the<00:04:49.509> budget<00:04:49.900> gimmicks

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
than the deficits or the budget gimmicks

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:52.770 
than the deficits or the budget gimmicks
or<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:50.889> actuarial<00:04:51.430> analysis<00:04:52.060> there<00:04:52.599> really

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
or the actuarial analysis there really

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.960 
or the actuarial analysis there really
is<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.080> difference<00:04:53.409> between<00:04:53.470> us<00:04:53.889> and<00:04:54.129> we've

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
is a difference between us and we've

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.339 
is a difference between us and we've
been<00:04:55.120> talking<00:04:55.449> about<00:04:55.539> how<00:04:55.720> much<00:04:55.870> we<00:04:55.930> agree<00:04:56.319> on

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
been talking about how much we agree on

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:58.230 
been talking about how much we agree on
different<00:04:56.710> issues<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:57.550> there<00:04:57.729> really<00:04:57.879> is<00:04:58.210> a

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
different issues but there really is a

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.550 
different issues but there really is a
difference<00:04:58.690> between<00:04:58.750> us<00:04:58.990> and<00:04:59.199> it's<00:04:59.319> basically

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
difference between us and it's basically

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.680 
difference between us and it's basically
this<00:05:00.099> we<00:05:01.030> don't<00:05:01.180> think<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.599> government

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
this we don't think the government

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.080 
this we don't think the government
should<00:05:02.139> be<00:05:02.470> in<00:05:02.620> control<00:05:02.949> of<00:05:03.069> all<00:05:03.370> of<00:05:03.400> this<00:05:03.669> we

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
should be in control of all of this we

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.600 
should be in control of all of this we
want<00:05:04.330> people<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.930> be<00:05:05.050> in<00:05:05.289> control<00:05:05.590> and<00:05:05.919> that<00:05:06.490> at

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
want people to be in control and that at

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.339 
want people to be in control and that at
the<00:05:06.729> end<00:05:06.849> of<00:05:06.909> the<00:05:07.000> day<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.240> the<00:05:07.419> big<00:05:07.690> difference

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
the end of the day is the big difference

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.980 
the end of the day is the big difference
now<00:05:09.009> we've<00:05:09.190> offered<00:05:09.370> lots<00:05:09.639> of<00:05:09.849> ideas<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.360> last

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
now we've offered lots of ideas all last
