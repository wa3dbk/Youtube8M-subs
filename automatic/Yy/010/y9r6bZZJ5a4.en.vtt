00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
but the problem is his movesets and his

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.129 
but the problem is his movesets and his
abilities<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.150> everything<00:00:12.509> don't<00:00:12.660> back<00:00:13.110> it

abilities and everything don't back it

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.160 
abilities and everything don't back it
up<00:00:13.380> too<00:00:13.860> much<00:00:14.120> mostly<00:00:15.120> because<00:00:15.450> he<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:15.960> has<00:00:16.139> a

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
up too much mostly because he just has a

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.080 
up too much mostly because he just has a
pitiful<00:00:16.710> speed<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> dragon<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.760> therefore

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
pitiful speed for a dragon and therefore

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.279 
pitiful speed for a dragon and therefore
you're<00:00:18.210> just<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.690> kind<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:18.990> sit<00:00:19.260> there

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
you're just going to kind of sit there

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.650 
you're just going to kind of sit there
and<00:00:19.740> take<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> super<00:00:20.939> effective<00:00:21.300> hit<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
and take a super effective hit to the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.290 
and take a super effective hit to the
face<00:00:21.689> before<00:00:22.080> he<00:00:22.260> can<00:00:22.380> do<00:00:22.529> anything

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
face before he can do anything

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.960 
face before he can do anything
his<00:00:24.300> defense<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:24.930> alright<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.670> always

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
his defense is alright but it can always

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.359 
his defense is alright but it can always
be<00:00:27.180> better<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:27.689> feel<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.320> then<00:00:28.500> his<00:00:29.039> special

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369

offense<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.789> special<00:00:30.060> attack<00:00:30.240> are<00:00:30.480> strong

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
offense and special attack are strong

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.979 
offense and special attack are strong
but<00:00:31.109> they're<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.940> incredible

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
but they're not like incredible

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
but they're not like incredible
breakable<00:00:33.989> especially<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.590> Dragon<00:00:34.980> type<00:00:35.160> his

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
breakable especially for Dragon type his

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.180 
breakable especially for Dragon type his
base<00:00:35.820> stats<00:00:36.149> being<00:00:36.780> under<00:00:37.079> 500<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.829> just

base stats being under 500 or just

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.369 
base stats being under 500 or just
completely<00:00:39.000> underwhelming<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.930> his<00:00:40.140> hit

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
completely underwhelming and his hit

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.270 
completely underwhelming and his hit

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
overpowered as possible I was looking at

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.540 
overpowered as possible I was looking at
him<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.079> of<00:00:49.350> course<00:00:49.620> with<00:00:49.829> such<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> pitiful

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550

him and of course with such a pitiful
speed<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.649> look<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.870> start<00:00:54.870> up

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
speed and good look as well as start up

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220 
speed and good look as well as start up
like<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.199> special<00:00:55.649> attack<00:00:56.180> trick<00:00:57.180> room<00:00:57.420> he<00:00:58.109> is

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
like a special attack trick room he is

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.990 
like a special attack trick room he is
great<00:00:58.739> on<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> trick<00:00:59.280> room<00:00:59.430> team<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
great on a trick room team and

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.520 
great on a trick room team and
especially<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.440> ability<00:01:01.859> adaptability

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
especially with his ability adaptability

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.960 
especially with his ability adaptability
adaptability<00:01:04.530> pretty<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.189> doubles<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
adaptability pretty much doubles the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.080 
adaptability pretty much doubles the
power<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.450> any<00:01:06.750> same<00:01:07.229> type<00:01:07.470> attack<00:01:07.799> move<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.700> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
power of any same type attack move so a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.810 
power of any same type attack move so a
stab<00:01:10.020> goes<00:01:10.439> from<00:01:10.770> being<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.310> regular<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
stab goes from being just regular to

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
stab goes from being just regular to
like<00:01:11.939> a<00:01:11.970> super<00:01:12.299> effective<00:01:12.689> normal<00:01:13.170> move<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
like a super effective normal move and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.770 
like a super effective normal move and
if<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.040> super<00:01:14.880> effective<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.299> top<00:01:15.509> of<00:01:15.659> that

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
if it's a super effective on top of that

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.100 
if it's a super effective on top of that
that<00:01:16.470> pokemons<00:01:16.950> gone<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> really

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that pokemons gone so it is a really

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.039 
that pokemons gone so it is a really
good<00:01:19.380> check<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.479> fairy<00:01:21.479> types<00:01:21.750> because

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
good check to fairy types because

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.780 
good check to fairy types because
they're<00:01:22.200> weak<00:01:22.350> against<00:01:22.619> poison<00:01:23.100> anything

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
they're weak against poison anything

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.700 
they're weak against poison anything
it's<00:01:23.880> weak<00:01:24.030> against<00:01:24.299> poison<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:25.350> isn't

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it's weak against poison which isn't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.940 
it's weak against poison which isn't
really<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.369> lot<00:01:26.759> but<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:28.049> works<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.829> well

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
really a lot but it works really well

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.859 
really a lot but it works really well
against<00:01:29.310> anything<00:01:29.820> weak<00:01:30.090> against<00:01:30.360> dragon

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
against anything weak against dragon

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.950 
against anything weak against dragon
which<00:01:31.049> is<00:01:31.259> dragon<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:33.119> good<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.750> kind

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
which is dragon so it's good it's kind

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.410 
which is dragon so it's good it's kind
of<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> counter<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.070> those<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:36.150> can

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
of like a counter to those if you can

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.840 
of like a counter to those if you can
get<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> under<00:01:37.590> trick<00:01:37.920> room<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.670> other

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
get it under trick room because other

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.999 
get it under trick room because other
than<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> with<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.780> weakness<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.470> ice<00:01:40.680> and

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
than that with your weakness to ice and

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.740 
than that with your weakness to ice and
ground<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.490> feel<00:01:41.820> like<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.119> you're<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.689> to

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ground I feel like you you're going to

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
ground I feel like you you're going to
get<00:01:42.869> taken<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.259> before<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.710> get<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> chance<00:01:43.979> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
get taken out before you get a chance to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.719 
get taken out before you get a chance to
take<00:01:45.000> them<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.829> so<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.860> mean<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.220> first<00:01:47.250> turn

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
take them out so I mean at first turn

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.730 
take them out so I mean at first turn
you<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.030> protect<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> trick<00:01:49.350> room<00:01:49.530> set

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you go protect and get a trick room set

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
you go protect and get a trick room set
up<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.460> have<00:01:50.729> really<00:01:51.270> good<00:01:51.420> coverage

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
whole team into just some really bad bad

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.340 
whole team into just some really bad bad
things<00:02:34.430> so<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.970> think<00:02:36.450> that's<00:02:36.750> that's<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.200> good

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
things so I think that's that's a good

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.370 
things so I think that's that's a good
way<00:02:37.470> take<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:38.040> him<00:02:38.390> it's<00:02:39.390> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.230> best

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
way take with him it's kind of the best

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.560 
way take with him it's kind of the best
he<00:02:40.650> also<00:02:40.770> learns<00:02:41.070> acid<00:02:41.640> armor<00:02:41.940> but<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.450> was

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
he also learns acid armor but I was

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.090 
he also learns acid armor but I was
thinking<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.900> instead<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.350> giving<00:02:43.590> him<00:02:43.770> acid

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
thinking that instead of giving him acid

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.670 
thinking that instead of giving him acid
armor<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> could<00:02:44.520> give<00:02:44.640> him<00:02:44.760> an<00:02:44.850> assault<00:02:45.150> vest

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
armor you could give him an assault vest

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.830 
armor you could give him an assault vest
just<00:02:46.680> personal<00:02:47.100> preference<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.840> it's

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
just personal preference because it's

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
just personal preference because it's
like<00:02:49.080> half<00:02:49.290> an<00:02:49.440> acid<00:02:49.739> armor<00:02:50.010> but<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.340> just<00:02:50.550> get

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
like half an acid armor but you just get

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.090 
like half an acid armor but you just get
to<00:02:50.850> go<00:02:50.880> straight<00:02:51.480> up<00:02:51.600> into<00:02:51.800> attacking<00:02:52.800> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
to go straight up into attacking and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.270 
to go straight up into attacking and
whatnot<00:02:54.020> so<00:02:55.020> as<00:02:55.380> for<00:02:55.770> spreads

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
whatnot so as for spreads

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.910 
whatnot so as for spreads
I<00:02:56.370> was<00:02:56.489> thinking<00:02:56.760> sassy<00:02:57.090> nature<00:02:57.540> 160<00:02:58.530> special

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
I was thinking sassy nature 160 special

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.420 
I was thinking sassy nature 160 special
attack<00:02:59.180> V's<00:03:00.290> 148<00:03:01.290> defense<00:03:01.590> V's<00:03:01.890> 200<00:03:02.340> hit

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.080 
points V's with an assault vest assault
vest<00:03:04.950> pretty<00:03:05.190> much<00:03:05.340> makes<00:03:05.550> it<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> where<00:03:05.910> you

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
vest pretty much makes it to where you

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.900 
vest pretty much makes it to where you
can<00:03:06.120> swap<00:03:07.080> instead<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:07.800> putting<00:03:07.950> 160<00:03:08.700> into

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
can swap instead of putting 160 into

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.479 
can swap instead of putting 160 into
special<00:03:09.270> defense<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:10.170> can<00:03:10.290> put<00:03:10.430> 116<00:03:11.430> a

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
special defense you can put 116 a

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.550 
special defense you can put 116 a
special<00:03:11.820> attack<00:03:12.090> give<00:03:12.360> him<00:03:12.510> some<00:03:12.690> offensive

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
special attack give him some offensive

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.740 
special attack give him some offensive
bulk<00:03:13.800> and<00:03:13.980> then<00:03:14.459> put<00:03:14.640> an<00:03:14.820> assault<00:03:15.180> vest<00:03:15.390> on<00:03:15.570> him

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
bulk and then put an assault vest on him

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.020 
bulk and then put an assault vest on him
and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.770> this<00:03:16.980> could<00:03:17.190> hold<00:03:17.459> up<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.910> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
and I think this could hold up in a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.300 
and I think this could hold up in a
singles<00:03:18.450> battle<00:03:18.810> as<00:03:18.959> long<00:03:19.650> as<00:03:19.799> he<00:03:19.980> doesn't<00:03:20.250> get

singles battle as long as he doesn't get

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370 
singles battle as long as he doesn't get
directly<00:03:20.670> countered<00:03:21.120> like<00:03:21.690> if<00:03:21.840> you<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.170> you

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
directly countered like if you if you

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.340 
directly countered like if you if you
use<00:03:22.860> him<00:03:23.070> as<00:03:23.250> an<00:03:23.519> open<00:03:24.209> to<00:03:24.480> counter<00:03:24.900> fairy

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
use him as an open to counter fairy

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.590 
use him as an open to counter fairy
types<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:26.640> could<00:03:26.910> work<00:03:27.090> or<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.390> just<00:03:27.420> have

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600
