00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.330 

so<00:00:02.790> now<00:00:03.200> what<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:04.710> going<00:00:04.919> to<00:00:05.070> do<00:00:05.190> is

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 
so now what we're going to do is

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.930 
so now what we're going to do is
actually<00:00:05.490> turn<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:05.970> on<00:00:06.120> and<00:00:07.009> that<00:00:08.009> I<00:00:08.069> really<00:00:08.759> do

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
actually turn it on and that I really do

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.430 
actually turn it on and that I really do
think<00:00:09.150> that's<00:00:09.389> some<00:00:09.599> kind<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:09.990> boot<00:00:10.170> data

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
think that's some kind of a boot data

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.959 
think that's some kind of a boot data
that's<00:00:10.679> coming<00:00:10.889> up<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.429> looks<00:00:14.550> like<00:00:14.670> it

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
that's coming up and it looks like it

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.929 
that's coming up and it looks like it
might<00:00:15.179> be<00:00:15.210> two<00:00:15.929> different<00:00:16.109> boot<00:00:16.439> datas<00:00:16.939> two

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
might be two different boot datas two

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.309 
might be two different boot datas two
different<00:00:18.210> streams<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.659> looking<00:00:18.960> at<00:00:19.109> here

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:21.319 
different streams on looking at here

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:32.959 
different streams on looking at here
because<00:00:22.319> I<00:00:22.349> am<00:00:22.529> grounded<00:00:31.099> I'm<00:00:32.099> grounded<00:00:32.759> but

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
because I am grounded I'm grounded but

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.150 
because I am grounded I'm grounded but
it's<00:00:33.539> looking<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.199> though<00:00:34.230> I'm<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.829> grounded

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it's looking as though I'm not grounded

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:52.029 
it's looking as though I'm not grounded
which<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.570> little<00:00:37.109> bit<00:00:37.320> odd<00:00:43.550> hmm<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
which is a little bit odd hmm so I

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:03.919 
which is a little bit odd hmm so I
wonder<00:01:01.069> in<00:01:02.069> this<00:01:02.339> live<00:01:02.579> stream<00:01:02.629> are<00:01:03.629> there<00:01:03.809> any

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:03.929 
wonder in this live stream are there any

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.870 
wonder in this live stream are there any
kernel<00:01:04.559> developers<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.309> who<00:01:05.489> might<00:01:05.519> have

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
kernel developers here who might have

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.139 
kernel developers here who might have
some<00:01:06.210> Samsung<00:01:06.780> source<00:01:07.079> code<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.500> hand<00:01:08.149> some

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
some Samsung source code on hand some

galaxy s3 code Richard maybe I don't

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
galaxy s3 code Richard maybe I don't
have<00:01:13.649> that<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.220> any<00:01:14.369> source<00:01:14.610> code<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.119> hand

have that I have any source code on hand

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.499 
have that I have any source code on hand
for<00:01:15.479> one<00:01:16.100> all<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.969> way<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> looking

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
for one all right the way you looking

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.679 
for one all right the way you looking
for<00:01:18.719> well<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.860> any<00:01:20.490> kind<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.969> a<00:01:21.030> referenced<00:01:21.570> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
for well on any kind of a referenced in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:30.310 
for well on any kind of a referenced in
the<00:01:21.719> source<00:01:22.140> code<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:24.409> TTYL<00:01:26.390> hlhs<00:01:27.390> l0<00:01:28.369> it's<00:01:29.369> uh

the source code to TTYL hlhs l0 it's uh

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840 
the source code to TTYL hlhs l0 it's uh
whatever<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.860> there's<00:01:32.189> some<00:01:32.340> data<00:01:32.579> coming

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
whatever it is there's some data coming

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.029 
whatever it is there's some data coming
across<00:01:33.149> at<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.539> same<00:01:33.750> time<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.289> UART<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039 
across at the same time as the UART that

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:36.859 
across at the same time as the UART that
I'm<00:01:35.159> pushing<00:01:35.549> out<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.329> boot<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
I'm pushing out from the boot from the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.950 
I'm pushing out from the boot from the
colonel<00:01:37.229> so<00:01:38.450> obviously<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.630> got<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.869> be

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
colonel so obviously it's got to be

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.469 
colonel so obviously it's got to be
something<00:01:40.289> having<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.039> do<00:01:41.280> with<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.090> colonel

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
something having to do with the colonel

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
something having to do with the colonel
and<00:01:42.600> possibly<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.409> transmitting<00:01:44.100> at<00:01:44.189> too

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
and possibly it's transmitting at too

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.160 
and possibly it's transmitting at too
high<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.549> speed<00:01:45.439> or<00:01:46.439> too<00:01:47.009> low<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.399> speed<00:01:51.170> well

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
high of speed or too low the speed well

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.010 
high of speed or too low the speed well
I<00:01:52.409> guess<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:55.770> about<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.670> wrap<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.630> if

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
I guess that is about a wrap so if

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.260 
I guess that is about a wrap so if
you're<00:01:58.380> looking<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.490> device<00:02:01.310> from<00:02:02.310> this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
you're looking at the device from this

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.209 
you're looking at the device from this
angle<00:02:03.450> right<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.810> that's<00:02:04.200> straight<00:02:04.920> up<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
angle right here that's straight up and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.430 
angle right here that's straight up and
down<00:02:05.329> with<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.359> USB<00:02:06.719> port<00:02:07.109> to<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.320> bottom<00:02:08.360> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
down with the USB port to the bottom the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
down with the USB port to the bottom the
UART<00:02:10.440> port<00:02:10.740> is<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.400> side<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.470 

it's<00:02:14.940> right<00:02:15.300> here<00:02:15.630> on<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:17.520> little<00:02:17.970> debug

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
it's right here on this little debug

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.840 
it's right here on this little debug

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.340 
of that it's right here on this debug
