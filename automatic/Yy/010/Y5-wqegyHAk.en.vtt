power and steady aim to maximize your

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.209 
power and steady aim to maximize your
chances<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:46.020> getting<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.379> one-shot<00:00:46.950> kill

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
chances of getting a one-shot kill

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
chances of getting a one-shot kill
because<00:00:47.820> F<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.300> J<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.750> does<00:00:48.899> give<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.230> model

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because F and J it does give the model

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
because F and J it does give the model
some<00:00:49.739> penetration<00:00:50.190> capacity<00:00:50.879> but<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.239> all

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
some penetration capacity but that's all

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.450 
some penetration capacity but that's all
I<00:00:51.750> really<00:00:52.140> want<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.469> help<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.039> combat

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
because of the guns low fire rate and I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.430 
because of the guns low fire rate and I
like<00:00:57.120> all<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> other<00:00:57.480> shotguns<00:00:57.750> it<00:00:58.079> suffers

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
having the second worst pellet spread

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.249 
having the second worst pellet spread
after<00:01:43.049> they<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> 12<00:01:43.710> which<00:01:44.670> causes<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> not

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
after they a 12 which causes it to not

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.350 
after they a 12 which causes it to not
get<00:01:46.530> those<00:01:46.740> one-shot<00:01:47.220> kills<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:48.090> all

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
get those one-shot kills that we all

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.590 
get those one-shot kills that we all
really<00:01:48.990> like<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:50.549> highly<00:01:50.880> suggest<00:01:50.909> using

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
really like I would highly suggest using

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.170 
really like I would highly suggest using
the<00:01:51.990> range<00:01:52.439> or<00:01:52.890> damage<00:01:52.920> proficiency<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.090> you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the range or damage proficiency if you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.580 
the range or damage proficiency if you
don't<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.450> damage<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.930> lock<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.200> use<00:01:55.290> range

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
don't have damage and lock to use range

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
don't have damage and lock to use range
and<00:01:55.950> if<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.640> damaged<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.060> locked<00:01:57.240> i

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
and if you have damaged and locked i

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.240 
and if you have damaged and locked i
would<00:01:57.540> definitely<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.219> mainly<00:01:59.219> because

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
would definitely use that mainly because

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.639 
would definitely use that mainly because
his<00:01:59.880> gun<00:02:00.119> is<00:02:00.390> very<00:02:00.600> unpredictable<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.500> you're

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
his gun is very unpredictable and you're

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.110 
his gun is very unpredictable and you're
not

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
not

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.400 
not
to<00:02:02.480> know<00:02:02.600> when<00:02:02.780> you're<00:02:02.900> going<00:02:02.990> to<00:02:03.080> get<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.200> one

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
to know when you're going to get a one

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.970 
to know when you're going to get a one
hit<00:02:03.560> kill<00:02:03.850> from<00:02:04.930> halfway<00:02:05.930> across<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.530> map<00:02:06.710> or

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
hit kill from halfway across the map or

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.560 
hit kill from halfway across the map or
three<00:02:07.280> hitmarkers<00:02:07.970> when<00:02:08.270> you're<00:02:08.390> right

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
three hitmarkers when you're right

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.530 
three hitmarkers when you're right
behind<00:02:08.750> somebody<00:02:09.729> also<00:02:10.729> I'd<00:02:11.000> use<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.210> perks

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
behind somebody also I'd use the perks

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.210 
behind somebody also I'd use the perks
sleight<00:02:11.870> of<00:02:11.900> hand<00:02:12.110> quick<00:02:12.320> draw<00:02:12.560> in<00:02:12.770> steady<00:02:13.040> aim

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
sleight of hand quick draw in steady aim

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.310 
sleight of hand quick draw in steady aim
steady<00:02:13.550> aim<00:02:13.790> mainly<00:02:14.240> because<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:15.110> gun<00:02:15.290> is

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
steady aim mainly because this gun is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.500 
steady aim mainly because this gun is
really<00:02:15.650> great<00:02:15.800> for<00:02:15.860> hip<00:02:16.220> firing<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.910> getting

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
really great for hip firing and getting

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.990 
really great for hip firing and getting
those<00:02:17.630> long<00:02:18.020> distance<00:02:18.530> kills<00:02:18.740> and<00:02:19.340> unlike<00:02:19.700> its

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
those long distance kills and unlike its

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.400 
those long distance kills and unlike its
predecessor<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.810> gun<00:02:20.990> has<00:02:21.020> zero

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
predecessor this gun has zero

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.240 
predecessor this gun has zero
attachments<00:02:22.100> which<00:02:22.370> makes<00:02:22.670> it<00:02:22.790> even<00:02:22.910> harder

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
attachments which makes it even harder

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.290 
attachments which makes it even harder
so<00:02:25.250> you're<00:02:25.370> probably<00:02:25.520> wondering<00:02:25.850> why<00:02:26.270> I

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
so you're probably wondering why I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.090 
so you're probably wondering why I
haven't<00:02:26.780> made<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.350> of<00:02:27.470> these<00:02:27.560> videos<00:02:27.740> in

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
haven't made one of these videos in

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.830 
haven't made one of these videos in
about<00:02:28.310> four<00:02:28.580> months<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:29.030> since<00:02:29.240> March<00:02:29.570> it's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
about four months or since March it's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.510 
about four months or since March it's
because<00:02:30.200> if<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.410> can<00:02:30.560> already<00:02:30.680> tell<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.130> do<00:02:31.220> not

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
because if you can already tell I do not

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.610 
because if you can already tell I do not
