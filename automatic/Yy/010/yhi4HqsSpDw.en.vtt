00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:02.120
 hello bastards how are you doing 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.970
 it does not matter what matters is this video hahaha xd xd 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.410
 good to what I'm going the subject is 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.330
 stupid things that could be improved in video games 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.789
 first of all 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.679
 the fps video games better known as first person shooter games 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.779
 usually the best are those that develop in the middle of a war 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.769
 example of this are 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.759
 knowledge 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.259
 or leave them what I want to highlight is that if these games are developed in 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.719
 a war because they do not have much freedom of action and the fucking 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.000
 characters 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.680
 like when it's time to give a melee attack you can only 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.180
 make two types of attack 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 3 punch and hit them with the handle of the equipped weapon 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.820
 where was the world-famous low blow 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.680
 also called how to break eggs po kick descojonado hour 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.140
 I already know what you're thinking 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.660
 but what's wrong with you? 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.860
 the video games of shots in general are of shots there were no kicks in the 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.040
 that's true, but there's a phrase that says 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.010
 in war and in love everything is worth this same concept should be applied 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.660
 in the shooting games 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.570
 once I played a video game of bulls in which the character was an Indian who 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.900
 as it progressed this armadas to the teeth in that game brought 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.239
 history rifle rifle half revolver shotgun carabiner 

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:36.769
 submachine gun 47 here 47 bathed in gold launches missile grenades 

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:43.029
 flamethrower rocket launcher launches dads spring bow and arrow nuclear bombs 

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:46.420
 and how many weapons can you imagine 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.900
 but what I shit was the fact that when it came time to make a 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.140
 melee attack because I know the munitions were over you should look 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.270
 fast the knife of all your arsenal and this trend asia that you 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.950
 will kill several times I think if they had added the ability to give 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.840
 at least one hit under that would have lost a bit to his opponent while 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.739
 what are you looking for the fucking knife 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.389
 this from the low blow to just because I know that in real life nobody dies 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.709
 for a low blow but in video games everyone dies for the most 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.709
 minimum hit as in the known useful once you judge it the easy level and you 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.980
 It made me weird to hold the dense ones with bullets but he will not stand a 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.109
 punch 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:34.929
 nor that the enemies using steroids and that they are worth me fourth 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:38.269
 the reason why you endure many shots in bright colors because 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.279
 brings certain protections and fears of a blow by the enemy because he receives it 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:44.479
 after a serious failure 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:45.589
 I already know it 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:50.599
 but when you play Resident Evil, it does not make you more convenient to give 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.159
 a kick in the testicles to the zombies to upload them and finish them off 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.169
 punch instead of spending a lot of ammo just to stun the other 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.169
 thing I've only played three games 60 since as I've never had 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.889
 opportunity to play those of ps3 or those of the other consoles 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.819
 so do not get upset if you find it offensive for the fans to leave it or 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.179
 any other game in the game leaves the rivers on the mission again 

00:03:18.179 --> 00:03:19.150
 Alexandria 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.540
 When scared civilians appear, it's strange to me that they do not shout as if in 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.690
 true they were in the middle of a strange genocidal war 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.159
 do not believe it 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.829
 I think that to have spent too much time interviewing the 3 until the 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.870
 rivers should have thought about everything and not forget about the civilians that although 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 they are not game characters 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.530
 They also have an important role in the game to give a feeling 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.319
 of real danger 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.319
 something that took me a lot of the games leave it is the detail of the dialogues 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:55.489
 I'll explain it to you in far 2 there are always dialogues the Marines talk 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.889
 all free time 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.960
 but what are you talking about the worst of the fuss that were the dialogues 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.250
 kenya sometimes got a few dialogues too many points with speck and wow 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.659
 bagman stupid granny of that type 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.599
 I know but in this game until when you read points with your weapon to a 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.180
 soldier the soldier says something in exchange in the other games of health 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.259
 the soldiers only speak when the moment requires it and are only limited to 

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:25.660
 look at your helmet imagining how ugly you are in real life hahaha hahaha 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.340
 xd xd 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.470
 let's move on to something else in the games of assassin's creed 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.310
 something that I found very stupid in the first and the second was the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.289
 horse 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.639
 perhaps during the middle ages and the lights century it was forbidden to enter 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.380
 the cities with horses 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.790
 and if that's true because devils appear compact carts within the 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.800
 cities 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.220
 abergil and skirts ubisoft that is always well documented and the reason for said 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.659
 stupid that was because during the epochs in which the story unfolds 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:57.070
 of the first 2 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.190
 games had a nibble decree that it was forbidden to ride a horse inside 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.790
 from the cities because it made him uncomfortable with horse shit on the ground and threatened 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.990
 with demanding from the face of the earth the horses and one day he came to tread 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.990
 a battle horse shit inside a city 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.129
 that has a lot of logic 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:20.249
 but if this is true because in the brotherhood if you can ride a horse 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.370
 by the city 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.850
 at the start of the game the csio walk cavalier inside his little town because 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.580
 he is the owner and has the south permit standards for horseback riding 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.240
 within their domains 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.689
 yes I had forgotten 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:39.319
 these are good games but those details make me very stupid in 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:39.979
 true 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.520
 the ps3 and among those 60 are the best in terms of graphic capacity the 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:51.030
 60 stress has more exclusive games than the other consoles but few of 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:53.839
 the exclusivities are really good 

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:59.020
 however the ps3 has very few exclusivities and it is difficult to decide 

00:05:59.019 --> 00:06:01.729
 which is the bitchiest of all 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.449
 the wii also has several exclusivities but also few are 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.990
 good in wii games is seriously very hard to get that fucking 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.740
 characters articulate words instead of just displaying texts on the screen 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.620
 do not drive 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.740
 for something chic according to miyamoto he gave them a mouth that maybe only 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.470
 made for them to have breathe they have done for blisters what does it matter if 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.900
 they speak only in English but the fact is that they should articulate words 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:31.539
 motherfuckers xd 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:36.449
 In the last game of Resident Evil on 5 it was strange to me that all the doors 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.139
 they opened up just in front of me, this is all because I got tired of 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.119
 write xd xd 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:46.599
 I visited my channel and look at what in two of the knights of the zodiac 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.699
 see you later 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.289
 until good son of a bitch goes down just to fire her she understands that the 

00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.740
 ps3 console 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.139
 will already have some of his ex club follow time in latin spanish motive 

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.520
 joy for many of those who have a ps3 the bad thing is that it is not dubbing 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:07.780
 mexican the dubbing of maria victoria some place of age of the states 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.119
 united and that is a bit frustrating 

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:13.839
 to which I mean that if you want to see a dub as simple as in the game 

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:16.669
 of gears of war better you do not have illusions 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.229
 As he said Jorge visits my channel you will not regret
