00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.740 

we<00:00:10.280> only<00:00:10.429> have<00:00:10.670> a<00:00:10.700> certain<00:00:10.910> amount<00:00:11.120> of<00:00:11.330> time<00:00:11.540> on

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
we only have a certain amount of time on

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.330 
we only have a certain amount of time on
this<00:00:11.900> orb<00:00:12.410> and<00:00:13.059> I<00:00:14.059> want<00:00:14.480> to<00:00:14.660> have<00:00:14.840> as<00:00:15.049> many

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
this orb and I want to have as many

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.920 
this orb and I want to have as many
writing<00:00:16.340> projects<00:00:16.820> done<00:00:17.000> as<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.240> possibly<00:00:17.660> can

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
writing projects done as I possibly can

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.290 
writing projects done as I possibly can
so<00:00:18.289> I<00:00:18.500> don't<00:00:19.220> just<00:00:19.430> have<00:00:19.640> a<00:00:19.670> regular<00:00:19.880> writing

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 
so I don't just have a regular writing

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.800 
so I don't just have a regular writing
time<00:00:20.630> I<00:00:20.660> look<00:00:21.109> for<00:00:21.320> ways<00:00:21.470> to<00:00:21.529> snatch<00:00:22.310> time<00:00:22.850> to

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
time I look for ways to snatch time to

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.640 
time I look for ways to snatch time to
find<00:00:24.109> places<00:00:24.470> where<00:00:24.769> I<00:00:24.800> can<00:00:25.039> do<00:00:25.970> some<00:00:26.000> writing

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
find places where I can do some writing

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.130 
find places where I can do some writing
even<00:00:27.650> if<00:00:27.800> it's<00:00:27.949> only<00:00:28.070> a<00:00:28.160> short<00:00:28.369> burst<00:00:29.140> like

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
even if it's only a short burst like

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.920 
even if it's only a short burst like
that<00:00:30.439> carry<00:00:30.679> around<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:31.099> very<00:00:31.369> handy<00:00:31.880> little

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
that carry around a very handy little

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.100 
that carry around a very handy little
device<00:00:32.930> called<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.559> Alpha<00:00:34.010> smart<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.899> it<00:00:35.899> has

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
device called the Alpha smart and it has

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.410 
device called the Alpha smart and it has
a<00:00:36.140> full<00:00:36.440> keyboard<00:00:36.680> it's<00:00:37.340> very<00:00:37.550> light<00:00:37.850> it<00:00:38.149> runs

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
a full keyboard it's very light it runs

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.990 
a full keyboard it's very light it runs
on<00:00:38.570> double-a<00:00:39.020> batteries<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.670> can<00:00:40.820> just

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
on double-a batteries and you can just

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.819 
on double-a batteries and you can just
type<00:00:41.180> type<00:00:41.390> type<00:00:41.420> it's<00:00:41.809> a<00:00:41.870> dedicated<00:00:42.350> word

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
type type type it's a dedicated word

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.310 
type type type it's a dedicated word
processor<00:00:43.610> and<00:00:43.790> then<00:00:44.420> when<00:00:44.629> you're<00:00:44.750> done<00:00:44.930> you

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
processor and then when you're done you

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.410 
processor and then when you're done you
flow<00:00:45.739> it<00:00:45.890> into<00:00:46.160> your<00:00:46.309> word<00:00:46.910> processing

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
flow it into your word processing

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.500 
flow it into your word processing
program<00:00:48.050> and<00:00:48.710> you're<00:00:48.950> done<00:00:49.129> so<00:00:49.520> I<00:00:49.550> like<00:00:50.360> the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
program and you're done so I like the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.529 
program and you're done so I like the
snatch<00:00:50.750> time<00:00:51.110> when<00:00:51.289> I<00:00:51.320> can<00:00:51.440> now<00:00:52.120> you<00:00:53.120> can<00:00:53.149> carry

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
snatch time when I can now you can carry

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.500 
snatch time when I can now you can carry
this<00:00:53.780> too<00:00:53.989> rather<00:00:54.289> absurd<00:00:54.920> lengths<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.789> don't

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
this too rather absurd lengths I don't

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:19.900 
this too rather absurd lengths I don't
suggest<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:57.140> write<00:00:57.649> in<00:00:57.920> the<00:00:58.460> car

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.430 

but<00:01:20.910> there<00:01:21.090> are<00:01:21.180> places<00:01:21.450> where<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.140> or<00:01:22.320> I

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
but there are places where I go or I

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.540 
but there are places where I go or I
could<00:01:22.620> just<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:23.100> bit<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.370> writing

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
could just have a little bit of writing

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:35.300 
could just have a little bit of writing
time<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.840> mounts<00:01:25.050> up<00:01:25.410> I<00:01:33.410> like<00:01:34.410> something

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
time and it mounts up I like something

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.660 
time and it mounts up I like something
Isaac<00:01:35.730> Asimov<00:01:35.910> said<00:01:36.950> he<00:01:37.950> wrote<00:01:38.310> something

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
Isaac Asimov said he wrote something

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.719 
Isaac Asimov said he wrote something
like<00:01:38.790> 700<00:01:39.660> books<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.280> somebody<00:01:41.280> asked<00:01:41.610> him

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like 700 books and somebody asked him

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
like 700 books and somebody asked him
what<00:01:42.600> would<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:43.470> knew<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.890> only

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
what would you do if you knew you only

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.980 
what would you do if you knew you only
had<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:44.729> week<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:44.970> live<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> he<00:01:46.710> said<00:01:46.979> type

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
had one week to live and he said type

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.990 
had one week to live and he said type
faster
