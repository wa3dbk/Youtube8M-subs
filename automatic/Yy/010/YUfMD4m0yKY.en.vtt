00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
do it all by himself so he'll be in sort

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.760 
do it all by himself so he'll be in sort
of<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.939> safe<00:02:03.119> citizen<00:02:03.570> type<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:04.020> manner<00:02:04.530> he'll

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
of a safe citizen type of manner he'll

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.920 
of a safe citizen type of manner he'll
be<00:02:04.920> recruiting<00:02:05.490> assassins<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.420> sending<00:02:06.810> him

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
be recruiting assassins and sending him

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.380 
be recruiting assassins and sending him
out<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.320> missions<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.519> train<00:02:08.879> them<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.119> they're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
out on missions to train them so they're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.910 
out on missions to train them so they're
very<00:02:09.420> easy<00:02:09.659> missions<00:02:10.259> at<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.439> very<00:02:10.590> beginning

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
very easy missions at the very beginning

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.819 
very easy missions at the very beginning
and<00:02:11.009> they<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.549> up<00:02:11.760> to<00:02:11.790> very<00:02:12.560> very<00:02:13.560> difficult

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
and they go up to very very difficult

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:16.390 
and they go up to very very difficult
missions<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.579> are<00:02:14.669> historically<00:02:15.599> set

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
missions and are historically set

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.040 
missions and are historically set
so<00:02:16.760> for<00:02:16.910> example<00:02:16.970> you<00:02:17.239> have<00:02:17.300> a<00:02:17.390> Vasco<00:02:17.810> de<00:02:17.930> Gama

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
so for example you have a Vasco de Gama

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.750 
so for example you have a Vasco de Gama
mission<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.620> then<00:02:18.709> when<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.340> come<00:02:19.550> back

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
mission and then when they come back

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.510 
mission and then when they come back
they<00:02:20.360> get<00:02:20.540> experience<00:02:21.110> points<00:02:21.230> which<00:02:21.739> you'll

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
they get experience points which you'll

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.240 
they get experience points which you'll
be<00:02:22.610> able<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.940> spend<00:02:23.739> uniquely<00:02:24.739> on<00:02:24.890> each

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
be able to spend uniquely on each

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.850 
be able to spend uniquely on each
assassin<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:26.450> there's<00:02:26.630> this<00:02:26.720> entire<00:02:27.050> part<00:02:27.560> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
assassin but there's this entire part of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.550 
assassin but there's this entire part of
you<00:02:28.160> know<00:02:28.250> meanwhile<00:02:28.730> yeah<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.209> mean<00:02:29.560> Abstergo

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
back and as you'll see in the demo I

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.449 
back and as you'll see in the demo I
think<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:02.780> kill<00:04:03.079> like<00:04:03.260> 20<00:04:03.590> people<00:04:03.920> in<00:04:04.040> 25

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
think we kill like 20 people in 25

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:06.250 
think we kill like 20 people in 25
seconds<00:04:04.940> or<00:04:05.090> something<00:04:05.389> crazy<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:05.870> that<00:04:05.989> so

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
seconds or something crazy like that so

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.930 
seconds or something crazy like that so
it's<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:06.680> lot<00:04:06.799> more<00:04:06.950> fast-paced<00:04:07.340> we<00:04:07.609> wanted<00:04:07.850> to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
it's a lot more fast-paced we wanted to

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:00.599 
lifts to basically to reach the roof

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.659 
lifts to basically to reach the roof
quicker<00:05:01.500> because<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:02.220> pace<00:05:02.370> of<00:05:02.550> the

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
quicker because the pace of the

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.879 
quicker because the pace of the
multiplayer<00:05:03.090> was<00:05:03.389> so<00:05:03.599> intense<00:05:04.020> that<00:05:04.199> we

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
multiplayer was so intense that we

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.469 
multiplayer was so intense that we
definitely<00:05:05.130> needed<00:05:05.669> something<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.330> go

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
definitely needed something to go

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.480 
definitely needed something to go

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
quickly on the roof and to go very fast

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.029 
quickly on the roof and to go very fast
to<00:05:09.270> cope<00:05:09.449> with<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.720> pace<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.169> game<00:05:10.199> and<00:05:10.590> we

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
to cope with the pace of the game and we

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:13.309 
to cope with the pace of the game and we
wanted<00:05:11.250> just<00:05:11.669> like<00:05:11.729> edu<00:05:12.300> to<00:05:12.840> have<00:05:12.960> like<00:05:13.139> a
