00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello in this video I will show you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.990
 what to do when the toilet 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.900
 very slow for running when it really is very 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.110
 long does it actually comes to this in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.960
 that mini part a membrane and 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.820
 it is actually over after five and six euros 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 often also at the range or we 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.359
 specialized 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
 DIY store or so what you have to do in order to 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:33.630
 replacing is actually very simple 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:36.540
 screw this thing will then want to out 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:43.860
 and then you take the valve so carefully 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:46.770
 away in the toilet 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.200
 we see such a thing and actually 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.399
 below here behind this screw 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.110
 there he is 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.629
 but how do you get that loose first we go 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.449
 this little a shape as you disconnect 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.629
 backwards with it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.879
 beach is something very important 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.879
 turn off the main tap 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.570
 we see a bit on stage 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.229
 she has closed and for the sake of convenience me 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.229
 I rinse located 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.409
 talk is gone back and forth 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.940
 up 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.940
 and then you can pull back 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.799
 so that he was coming and I just put it on 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.960
 the edge here you can do this part 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.149
 Slightly pull new layers backwards 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 on the loose 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.550
 don't panic just let it go again 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.100
 Restore and then this death you must loosen 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.630
 run when I really stuck then you were 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.979
 the 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:54.080
 carefully and set up on the pliers 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.049
 also squeeze very hard it is plastic and 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.590
 often you only need a little care 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.590
 costs of 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:12.200
 release also come off the left and come back 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.380
 bit 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.660
 job is unloading and then you can do it 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.820
 things also pull church and back 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.829
 now red 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.640
 this is the membrane and then you see that 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:31.400
 he stands that white dot down 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:35.359
 had this case it delivers it on 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.030
 the point was you down and one 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.930
 green or two 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:46.790
 look inside where lies like this is not possible 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.359
 completely so down thing and just 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.660
 weather 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:58.930
 it really is hard to get in and out 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:01.060
 come that last second 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.750
 right here i also feel that he really does 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.599
 properly in place must not get tired 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.109
 just a handhold is enough 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.890
 after pasting that case it you here 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.379
 Of course that is actually you now 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.420
 first in the top one 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:22.180
 i see him anxious I know you 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.799
 own in sliders and then the trick is that 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.489
 you can slide a little bit straight away and 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.019
 then that should go back to actually 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.019
 up with that every now and then a bit 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:38.019
 state you find again yes there he is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 he goes all the way through and then to 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.090
 back again 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.590
 you snap and that was it 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.590
 actually a tap europe 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.210
 very quick 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:09.610
 from it i think was very slow 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:28.890
 repeat the sun again and over you see 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:36.620
 who wins the fight 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:36.620
 process tracking and he fixed and ready
