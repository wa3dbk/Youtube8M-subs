00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
thing I've done to my hair before I

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.069 
thing I've done to my hair before I
brushed<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> through<00:01:57.570> was<00:01:57.689> quite<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.899> bit<00:01:58.020> of

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
brushed it through was quite a bit of

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
brushed it through was quite a bit of
dry<00:01:58.259> shampoo<00:01:58.710> through<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> rare<00:01:59.159> usually<00:01:59.340> I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
dry shampoo through a rare usually I

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.179 
dry shampoo through a rare usually I
wash<00:02:00.420> my<00:02:00.570> hair<00:02:00.689> every<00:02:01.020> day<00:02:01.049> but<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.920> be<00:02:01.950> honest

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
wash my hair every day but to be honest

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.319 
wash my hair every day but to be honest
I<00:02:02.280> think<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.549> probably<00:02:02.729> quite<00:02:02.939> good<00:02:03.210> for

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
I think this is probably quite good for

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.179 
I think this is probably quite good for
my<00:02:03.420> hair<00:02:03.600> giving<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.290> bit<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> break<00:02:04.770> heat

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
my hair giving it a bit of a break heat

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.889 
my hair giving it a bit of a break heat
it<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.060> on<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.299> second<00:02:06.780> highest

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it up and put it on the second highest

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.490 
it up and put it on the second highest
one<00:02:07.369> it<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.610> depends<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.390> how<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:10.229> hair<00:02:10.470> is

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
one it really depends on how my hair is

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.230 
one it really depends on how my hair is
I<00:02:10.950> could<00:02:11.250> probably<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.940> one

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
I could probably put it on one

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.180 
I could probably put it on one
70<00:02:12.600> actually<00:02:12.930> i'll<00:02:13.170> do<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.740> middle<00:02:14.010> one

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
70 actually i'll do that the middle one

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.220 
70 actually i'll do that the middle one
it<00:02:14.970> really<00:02:15.180> depends<00:02:15.480> what<00:02:15.690> kind<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:16.020> state

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
it really depends what kind of a state

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.080 
it really depends what kind of a state
my<00:02:16.380> hair<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.710> in<00:02:16.860> if<00:02:17.100> it's<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.670> been<00:02:17.850> washed

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
it on the highest one because it makes a

that's<00:02:58.410> dry<00:02:58.680> I'm<00:02:59.070> gonna<00:02:59.280> part<00:02:59.550> my<00:02:59.730> hair<00:02:59.760> just

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.600 
that's dry I'm gonna part my hair just
roughly<00:03:01.320> down<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.710> middle<00:03:01.890> so<00:03:02.160> I've<00:03:02.250> got<00:03:02.430> my

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
roughly down the middle so I've got my

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.000 
roughly down the middle so I've got my
hair<00:03:03.000> on<00:03:03.210> either<00:03:03.420> side<00:03:03.720> okay<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.290> thi<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.830> was

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
hair on either side okay so thi that was

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.320 
hair on either side okay so thi that was
probably<00:03:05.280> more<00:03:05.430> than<00:03:05.580> half<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.120> probably

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
probably more than half a is probably

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.120 
probably more than half a is probably
about<00:03:06.420> three<00:03:06.990> quatres<00:03:07.410> up<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.920> quarter

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
about three quatres up and a quarter

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.550 
about three quatres up and a quarter
down<00:03:08.490> pick<00:03:08.910> about<00:03:09.120> half<00:03:09.390> of<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:10.230> hair<00:03:10.380> that's

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
down pick about half of the hair that's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.000 
down pick about half of the hair that's
down<00:03:10.860> make<00:03:11.850> sure<00:03:11.880> that<00:03:12.330> this<00:03:12.540> clip<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.860> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
down make sure that this clip is on the

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.310 
down make sure that this clip is on the
front<00:03:14.220> so<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.450> on<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> front<00:03:15.960> like<00:03:16.140> that

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
front so that's on the front like that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.780 
front so that's on the front like that
and<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.650> tilt<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.040> slightly<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:17.580> that<00:03:17.610> you

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and you tilt it slightly so that you

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.750 
and you tilt it slightly so that you
don't<00:03:18.030> get<00:03:18.270> a<00:03:18.540> line<00:03:19.340> pull<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.460> all<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.640> way

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
don't get a line pull it all the way

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.110 
don't get a line pull it all the way
down<00:03:20.850> the<00:03:21.150> hair<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.580> loosen<00:03:24.000> it<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
down the hair and I just loosen it a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.900 
down the hair and I just loosen it a
little<00:03:24.180> bit<00:03:24.480> as<00:03:24.570> i<00:03:24.660> get<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.050> ends<00:03:25.280> and<00:03:26.280> what

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
little bit as i get to the ends and what

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.640 
little bit as i get to the ends and what
this<00:03:27.060> does<00:03:27.120> when<00:03:27.840> you<00:03:27.960> pull<00:03:28.170> in<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.380> down<00:03:28.530> the

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
this does when you pull in it down the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.890 
this does when you pull in it down the
hair<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:29.190> don't<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.730> its<00:03:29.880> ceramic<00:03:30.180> coated<00:03:30.750> but

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
hair I don't have its ceramic coated but

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.450 
hair I don't have its ceramic coated but
there's<00:03:31.080> something<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.740> that<00:03:31.770> when<00:03:32.340> you

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
there's something on there that when you

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.430 
there's something on there that when you
pull<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.760> down<00:03:32.940> your<00:03:33.060> hair<00:03:33.240> really<00:03:33.600> smooths

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
pull it down your hair really smooths

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.750 
pull it down your hair really smooths
and<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.740> negates<00:03:35.190> the<00:03:35.370> need<00:03:35.400> for<00:03:35.730> a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and it negates the need for a

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.560 
and it negates the need for a
straightener<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.270> don't<00:03:36.420> need<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
straightener so you don't need to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.390 
straightener so you don't need to
straighten<00:03:36.900> first<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:37.470> curl<00:03:37.680> which<00:03:38.250> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
straighten first and then curl which I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.070 
straighten first and then curl which I
like<00:03:38.580> about<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:39.030> still<00:03:39.390> makes<00:03:39.540> it<00:03:39.750> nice<00:03:39.900> and

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
like about this still makes it nice and

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.990 
like about this still makes it nice and
smooth<00:03:40.290> which<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.680> good<00:03:40.920> so<00:03:41.460> I<00:03:41.520> hold<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> here

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
smooth which is good so I hold it here

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.900 
smooth which is good so I hold it here
for<00:03:42.150> a<00:03:42.180> little<00:03:42.330> while<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:43.130> then<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.460> just<00:03:44.580> let

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
go take my hand off the clump a little

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.810 
go take my hand off the clump a little
bit<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.180> pull<00:03:48.570> this<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:49.460> till<00:03:50.460> you've<00:03:50.610> got<00:03:50.790> a

bit and pull this out till you've got a

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.820 
bit and pull this out till you've got a
curl<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.480> this<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.200> just<00:03:52.380> leave<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.770> I

you can see my hairs here on top and the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.510 
you can see my hairs here on top and the
extension<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.690> underneath<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.380> I<00:04:20.160> just<00:04:20.370> make

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
extension is underneath and I just make

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.069 
extension is underneath and I just make
sure<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:20.880> I<00:04:20.940> curl<00:04:21.150> them<00:04:21.330> together<00:04:21.600> really

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
sure that I curl them together really

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.350 
sure that I curl them together really
then<00:04:22.409> they<00:04:22.530> just<00:04:22.680> blend<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.310> together<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.879> my

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
then they just blend in together and my

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.230 
then they just blend in together and my
hair<00:04:24.629> just<00:04:24.900> looks<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.259> shorter<00:04:25.770> layers<00:04:26.240> okay

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
hair just looks like shorter layers okay
