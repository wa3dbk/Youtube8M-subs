00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
screwdriver what I had to actually do is

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.149 
screwdriver what I had to actually do is
I<00:01:05.760> had<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.939> sand<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.380> tip<00:01:07.650> down<00:01:07.890> with

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
I had to sand the tip down with

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010 
I had to sand the tip down with
sandpaper<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:09.150> actually<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> thin

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
sandpaper to actually make it thin

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.710 
sandpaper to actually make it thin
enough<00:01:10.280> because<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.400> needs<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> fit<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.390> in

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
enough because it needs to fit right in

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.980 
enough because it needs to fit right in
that<00:01:13.080> tiny<00:01:13.439> slot<00:01:13.890> right<00:01:14.130> there<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.840> just

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
that tiny slot right there so you just

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.200 
that tiny slot right there so you just
grab<00:01:16.110> some<00:01:16.380> 60<00:01:16.799> grit<00:01:16.979> put<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> on<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> table

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
grab some 60 grit put this on a table

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.120 
grab some 60 grit put this on a table
and<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.659> drag<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.080> across<00:01:19.439> at<00:01:19.710> multiple

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
and just drag this across at multiple

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.429 
and just drag this across at multiple
times<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.450> will<00:01:21.600> sand<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> down<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
times and that will sand it down to a

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
times and that will sand it down to a
fine<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.009> yeah<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.430> might<00:01:23.790> have<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
tiny little notch that's back here

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.160 
tiny little notch that's back here
hopefully<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.689> place<00:01:36.900> that's

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
hopefully it's in a place that's

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.160 
hopefully it's in a place that's
convenient<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.700> but<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> want<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.020> make

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
convenient for you but you want to make

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.289 
convenient for you but you want to make
sure<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.560> screwdriver<00:01:41.130> fits<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.790> there<00:01:42.119> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
sure the screwdriver fits in there and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
sure the screwdriver fits in there and
it<00:01:42.360> has<00:01:42.540> some<00:01:42.780> grab<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.530> know<00:01:43.710> you'll

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
it has some grab and you know you'll

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.620 
it has some grab and you know you'll
know<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.880> be<00:01:44.939> pushing<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
know it I'm going to be pushing in this

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.660 
know it I'm going to be pushing in this
way<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.350> then<00:01:46.979> we're<00:01:47.100> going<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> turn

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
way on it and then we're going to turn

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
way on it and then we're going to turn
it<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.030> way<00:01:48.090> okay<00:01:48.720> so<00:01:48.780> we're<00:01:48.990> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> hold

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
it that way okay so we're going to hold

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.830 
it that way okay so we're going to hold
pressure<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.490> turn<00:01:50.729> just<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> pop<00:01:51.689> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pressure in and then turn just to pop it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.609 
pressure in and then turn just to pop it
off<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:55.020> sometimes<00:01:55.470> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
off just like that now sometimes it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.020 
off just like that now sometimes it
might<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.860> harder<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.250> remove<00:01:56.579> than<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
might be harder to remove than that

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.719 
might be harder to remove than that
sometimes<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.930> easier<00:01:58.320> once<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.310> pop<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
sometimes it's easier once you pop it

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.580 
sometimes it's easier once you pop it
off<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.180> can<00:02:00.329> see<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> reveals<00:02:00.990> first<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.439> all

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
off you can see it reveals first of all

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.030 
off you can see it reveals first of all
this<00:02:01.799> lithium<00:02:02.369> polymer<00:02:02.610> battery<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:04.040> this

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
this lithium polymer battery here this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.330 
this lithium polymer battery here this
is<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.189> tiny<00:02:05.549> lipo<00:02:06.509> one<00:02:06.840> cell<00:02:07.140> battery<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.920> so

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is a tiny lipo one cell battery and so

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.919 
is a tiny lipo one cell battery and so
it's<00:02:08.550> basically<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.030> three<00:02:09.239> point<00:02:09.479> seven<00:02:09.750> volt

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
it's basically a three point seven volt

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.530 
it's basically a three point seven volt
battery<00:02:10.500> this<00:02:10.770> battery<00:02:11.510> powers<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.540> camera

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
battery this battery powers the camera

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.559 
battery this battery powers the camera
it<00:02:13.689> does<00:02:13.959> not<00:02:14.370> power<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.700> hands<00:02:16.150> on<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.360> face

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
it does not power the hands on the face

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.690 
it does not power the hands on the face
of<00:02:16.599> the<00:02:16.840> clock<00:02:17.080> okay<00:02:17.950> there's<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.310> separate

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
of the clock okay there's a separate

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.089 
of the clock okay there's a separate
battery<00:02:18.909> for<00:02:19.269> that<00:02:19.420> now<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.439> ever<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.920> to

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
battery for that now if you ever need to

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.610 
battery for that now if you ever need to
replace<00:02:21.129> this<00:02:21.700> battery<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:23.019> need<00:02:23.079> a<00:02:23.230> very

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
replace this battery you need a very

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.039 
replace this battery you need a very
small<00:02:23.799> soldering<00:02:24.640> iron<00:02:24.939> now<00:02:25.689> I'm<00:02:25.780> not<00:02:25.930> going

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
small soldering iron now I'm not going

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.170 
small soldering iron now I'm not going
to<00:02:26.110> cover<00:02:26.319> replacing<00:02:27.040> this<00:02:27.129> battery<00:02:27.549> because

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
to cover replacing this battery because

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.050 
to cover replacing this battery because
that's<00:02:28.329> a<00:02:28.420> little<00:02:28.629> bit<00:02:28.750> more<00:02:28.900> advanced<00:02:29.409> so

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
that's a little bit more advanced so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.979 
that's a little bit more advanced so
what<00:02:31.060> we're<00:02:31.180> going<00:02:31.299> to<00:02:31.329> do<00:02:31.569> is<00:02:31.720> we're<00:02:31.810> going<00:02:31.840> to

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.170 
what we're going to do is we're going to
get<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.379> the<00:02:32.500> other<00:02:32.650> battery<00:02:33.040> right<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.280> for

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
get to the other battery right now for

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
get to the other battery right now for
the<00:02:34.269> next<00:02:34.390> step<00:02:34.690> you're<00:02:34.870> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.079> need<00:02:35.170> a

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the next step you're going to need a

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.009 
the next step you're going to need a
really<00:02:35.799> tiny<00:02:36.069> phillips<00:02:36.610> screwdriver<00:02:37.019> this

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
really tiny phillips screwdriver this

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:40.680 
really tiny phillips screwdriver this
set<00:02:38.349> works<00:02:38.590> really<00:02:38.769> good<00:02:39.540> they're<00:02:40.540> really

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
set works really good they're really

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.240 
set works really good they're really
small<00:02:41.109> and<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.379> get<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.590> job<00:02:41.620> done

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
small and they get the job done

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.050 
small and they get the job done
usually<00:02:43.090> these<00:02:43.180> watches<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:44.019> two<00:02:44.500> screws

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
usually these watches have two screws

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.670 
usually these watches have two screws
right<00:02:46.060> here<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.450> right<00:02:46.569> here<00:02:46.810> which<00:02:47.290> hold<00:02:47.560> the

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
right here and right here which hold the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.619 
right here and right here which hold the
circuit<00:02:48.159> board<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:49.269> we're<00:02:49.359> just<00:02:49.480> going<00:02:49.599> to

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
circuit board in so we're just going to

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.930 
circuit board in so we're just going to
unscrew<00:02:50.140> both<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:50.650> these<00:02:53.489> now<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.549> get<00:02:54.760> this

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
unscrew both of these now to get this

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.899 
unscrew both of these now to get this
circuit<00:02:55.359> board<00:02:55.569> out<00:02:55.750> um<00:02:56.519> it<00:02:57.519> takes<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.790> little

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
circuit board out um it takes a little

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.670 
circuit board out um it takes a little
bit<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.180> trial<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.599> error<00:02:58.780> just<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.530> tip

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
bit of trial and error just use the tip

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:07.080 
bit of trial and error just use the tip
of<00:02:59.859> your<00:02:59.889> screwdriver<00:03:00.489> you<00:03:05.459> can<00:03:06.459> also<00:03:06.609> use<00:03:06.879> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
of your screwdriver you can also use the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.759 
of your screwdriver you can also use the
you<00:03:07.389> can<00:03:07.540> also<00:03:07.599> use<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.019> flat<00:03:08.290> one<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.680> you

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
you can also use the flat one that you

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.660 
you can also use the flat one that you
just<00:03:08.799> made<00:03:09.159> and<00:03:09.989> if<00:03:10.989> you<00:03:11.139> can<00:03:11.290> get<00:03:11.470> behind<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
just made and if you can get behind the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.509 
just made and if you can get behind the
circuit<00:03:13.060> board<00:03:13.239> it's<00:03:13.540> always<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.049> best

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
circuit board it's always the best

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.770 
circuit board it's always the best
sometimes<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.790> can<00:03:15.940> maybe<00:03:16.120> lift<00:03:16.389> it<00:03:16.510> up<00:03:16.629> by

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
sometimes you can maybe lift it up by

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.039 
sometimes you can maybe lift it up by
the<00:03:16.840> by<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.440> by<00:03:17.949> the<00:03:18.010> SD<00:03:18.819> slot<00:03:21.870> sometimes<00:03:22.870> it's

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
the by the by the SD slot sometimes it's

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:24.360 
the by the by the SD slot sometimes it's
more<00:03:23.199> difficult<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.949> just<00:03:24.099> want<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.250> be

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
more difficult you just want to be

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.860 
more difficult you just want to be
really<00:03:24.519> careful<00:03:24.760> how<00:03:25.299> you<00:03:25.329> pull<00:03:25.599> this<00:03:25.720> out

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
really careful how you pull this out

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.819 
really careful how you pull this out
there<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.199> go<00:03:26.290> looks<00:03:26.470> like<00:03:26.500> we're<00:03:26.680> going<00:03:26.769> to

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
there you go looks like we're going to

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.839 
there you go looks like we're going to
go<00:03:26.949> from<00:03:27.129> this<00:03:27.280> end<00:03:28.769> and<00:03:29.769> once<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.489> have<00:03:30.639> it<00:03:30.669> out

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
go from this end and once I have it out

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.280 
go from this end and once I have it out
a<00:03:30.910> little<00:03:31.239> bit<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:34.209> feels<00:03:34.629> like<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:34.959> sticking

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
a little bit it feels like it's sticking

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.229 
a little bit it feels like it's sticking
like<00:03:35.949> maybe<00:03:36.190> there's<00:03:36.430> some<00:03:36.549> tape<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.060> back

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
like maybe there's some tape on the back

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:48.629 
like maybe there's some tape on the back
of<00:03:37.599> it<00:03:46.620> there<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:47.709> go<00:03:47.859> okay<00:03:48.129> what<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> did<00:03:48.519> okay

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:48.639 
of it there you go okay what I did okay

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:50.939 
of it there you go okay what I did okay
it<00:03:49.060> was<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.329> USB<00:03:49.900> port<00:03:50.199> that<00:03:50.260> was<00:03:50.470> holding<00:03:50.859> it

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:50.949 
it was the USB port that was holding it

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:52.680 
it was the USB port that was holding it
it<00:03:51.099> was<00:03:51.190> stuck<00:03:51.459> right<00:03:51.639> there<00:03:51.819> so<00:03:52.359> what<00:03:52.449> I<00:03:52.480> did

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
it was stuck right there so what I did

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.689 
it was stuck right there so what I did
is<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:52.870> just<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:53.290> stuck<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.099> screwdriver<00:03:54.549> in

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
is I just I stuck the screwdriver in

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.250 
is I just I stuck the screwdriver in
there<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:54.970> rotated<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.690> kind<00:03:55.870> of<00:03:55.930> push<00:03:56.109> it

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
there and I rotated to kind of push it

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.009 
there and I rotated to kind of push it
away<00:03:56.430> and<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.940> helped<00:03:58.269> it<00:03:58.389> come<00:03:58.569> out<00:03:58.599> so<00:03:58.930> I'm

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
away and that helped it come out so I'm

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.119 
away and that helped it come out so I'm
just<00:03:59.049> going<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.319> go<00:03:59.470> over<00:03:59.590> that<00:03:59.680> okay<00:03:59.859> now<00:03:59.980> and

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
just going to go over that okay now and

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.490 
just going to go over that okay now and
you<00:04:00.400> see<00:04:00.579> the<00:04:00.730> camera<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.180> still<00:04:01.540> wanting<00:04:02.409> to

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
you see the camera is still wanting to

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.539 
you see the camera is still wanting to
stay<00:04:02.739> in<00:04:02.769> there<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.310> camera<00:04:03.519> lens<00:04:05.190> so<00:04:06.190> let's

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
stay in there the camera lens so let's

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:07.500 
stay in there the camera lens so let's
go<00:04:06.669> ahead<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:06.940> we're<00:04:07.030> going<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.180> go<00:04:07.299> ahead<00:04:07.359> and

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
go ahead and we're going to go ahead and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.839 
go ahead and we're going to go ahead and
do<00:04:07.659> this<00:04:07.870> one<00:04:08.049> without<00:04:08.430> moving<00:04:09.430> that<00:04:09.579> lens

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
do this one without moving that lens

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.009 
do this one without moving that lens
we're<00:04:10.090> going<00:04:10.120> to<00:04:10.239> leave<00:04:10.389> the<00:04:10.540> lens<00:04:10.750> right

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
we're going to leave the lens right

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.229 
we're going to leave the lens right
where<00:04:11.260> it's<00:04:11.409> at<00:04:11.590> but<00:04:12.340> as<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.729> can<00:04:12.819> see<00:04:13.060> what

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
where it's at but as you can see what

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.839 
where it's at but as you can see what
was<00:04:13.359> holding<00:04:13.720> the<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.139> circuit<00:04:14.859> board<00:04:15.040> up<00:04:15.190> was

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
was holding the the circuit board up was

back in there okay now what we've

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:27.480 
back in there okay now what we've
revealed<00:04:27.099> here

revealed here

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.400 
revealed here
this<00:04:27.639> tiny<00:04:27.940> little<00:04:28.180> battery<00:04:28.660> okay<00:04:29.229> that

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
this tiny little battery okay that

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.570 
this tiny little battery okay that
battery<00:04:29.770> is<00:04:29.889> known<00:04:30.130> as<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:31.199> 377<00:04:32.199> or<00:04:32.380> a<00:04:32.580> 376

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
battery is known as a 377 or a 376

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.240 
battery is known as a 377 or a 376
silver<00:04:34.090> oxide<00:04:34.569> battery<00:04:35.080> it's<00:04:35.380> supposed<00:04:36.039> to<00:04:36.099> be

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
silver oxide battery it's supposed to be

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.839 
silver oxide battery it's supposed to be
one<00:04:36.490> point<00:04:36.789> five<00:04:37.120> five<00:04:37.449> volts<00:04:38.050> and<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:39.669> looks

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:39.849 
one point five five volts and it looks

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.520 
one point five five volts and it looks
just<00:04:40.030> like<00:04:40.270> that<00:04:40.509> now<00:04:40.960> I'm<00:04:41.050> going<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.229> replace

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
just like that now I'm going to replace

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.260 
just like that now I'm going to replace
it<00:04:41.770> with<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.009> Energizer<00:04:42.490> battery<00:04:42.759> because

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
it with the Energizer battery because

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.850 
it with the Energizer battery because
the<00:04:43.389> batteries<00:04:43.750> that<00:04:43.900> come<00:04:44.110> from<00:04:44.229> China<00:04:44.319> are

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
the batteries that come from China are

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.400 
the batteries that come from China are
probably<00:04:45.550> not<00:04:45.819> energizer<00:04:46.419> and<00:04:46.690> that's<00:04:47.229> why

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
probably not energizer and that's why

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.189 
probably not energizer and that's why
the<00:04:47.470> hand<00:04:47.860> stops<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:48.460> easily<00:04:48.699> sometimes<00:04:49.199> now

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
the hand stops so easily sometimes now

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.230 
the hand stops so easily sometimes now
in<00:04:50.319> order<00:04:50.440> to<00:04:50.620> get<00:04:50.770> this<00:04:50.919> out<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.310> here<00:04:51.460> again<00:04:52.210> I

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
in order to get this out of here again I

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.670 
in order to get this out of here again I
haven't<00:04:52.630> done<00:04:52.750> one<00:04:52.930> of<00:04:52.960> these<00:04:53.110> let<00:04:53.349> me<00:04:53.410> see<00:04:53.560> if

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
haven't done one of these let me see if

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.779 
haven't done one of these let me see if
I<00:04:53.740> can<00:04:53.860> get<00:04:53.979> it<00:04:54.099> in<00:04:54.160> one<00:04:54.190> shot

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
I can get it in one shot

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:57.150 
I can get it in one shot
oh<00:04:54.870> look<00:04:55.870> at<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.020> now<00:04:56.500> sometimes<00:04:56.919> they<00:04:57.039> have

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
oh look at that now sometimes they have

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.040 
oh look at that now sometimes they have
a<00:04:57.190> little<00:04:57.370> clip<00:04:57.759> that<00:04:58.030> holds<00:04:58.479> them<00:04:58.750> in<00:04:58.870> there

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
a little clip that holds them in there

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.510 
a little clip that holds them in there
so<00:04:59.289> they<00:04:59.470> sometimes<00:04:59.919> you<00:05:00.009> have<00:05:00.099> to<00:05:00.159> fight<00:05:00.340> with

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
so they sometimes you have to fight with

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.920 
so they sometimes you have to fight with
them<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.729> little<00:05:00.909> bit<00:05:01.060> sometimes<00:05:01.509> they<00:05:01.810> have

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
them a little bit sometimes they have

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.309 
them a little bit sometimes they have
tape<00:05:02.229> over<00:05:02.470> them<00:05:03.479> Chinese<00:05:04.479> manufacturers<00:05:05.139> put

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
tape over them Chinese manufacturers put

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:06.540 
tape over them Chinese manufacturers put
these<00:05:05.470> in<00:05:05.650> here<00:05:05.800> in<00:05:05.949> so<00:05:06.099> many<00:05:06.190> different<00:05:06.340> ways

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
these in here in so many different ways

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.730 
these in here in so many different ways
this<00:05:06.759> one<00:05:06.940> came<00:05:07.120> out<00:05:07.240> extremely<00:05:07.960> easily<00:05:08.169> now

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
this one came out extremely easily now

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.430 
this one came out extremely easily now
let's<00:05:08.949> put<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.280> on<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.400> voltmeter<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.440> see

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
let's put it on the voltmeter and see

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.999 
let's put it on the voltmeter and see
how<00:05:11.560> many<00:05:11.620> volts<00:05:12.039> it<00:05:12.130> is<00:05:13.560> okay<00:05:14.560> just<00:05:14.590> using<00:05:14.949> a

00:05:14.999 --> 00:05:15.009 
how many volts it is okay just using a

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.710 
how many volts it is okay just using a
craftsman<00:05:15.460> voltmeter<00:05:15.849> here<00:05:15.909> let's<00:05:16.389> see<00:05:16.539> what

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
craftsman voltmeter here let's see what

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.300 
craftsman voltmeter here let's see what
we're<00:05:16.870> reading<00:05:17.080> so<00:05:17.590> this<00:05:17.740> one<00:05:17.860> is<00:05:17.919> reading<00:05:18.069> one

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
we're reading so this one is reading one

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.480 
we're reading so this one is reading one
point<00:05:18.550> four<00:05:18.819> seven<00:05:19.150> volts<00:05:19.720> okay<00:05:20.680> so<00:05:21.280> that's

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
point four seven volts okay so that's

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.089 
point four seven volts okay so that's
plenty<00:05:21.909> good<00:05:22.060> enough<00:05:22.120> um<00:05:22.569> a<00:05:23.409> lot<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:23.949> times

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
plenty good enough um a lot of times

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.409 
plenty good enough um a lot of times
when<00:05:24.220> they're<00:05:24.310> brand<00:05:24.639> new<00:05:24.880> they<00:05:25.030> might<00:05:25.180> read

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
when they're brand new they might read

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.420 
when they're brand new they might read
like<00:05:25.449> one<00:05:25.780> point<00:05:26.020> six<00:05:26.590> volts<00:05:26.979> or<00:05:27.069> one<00:05:27.220> point

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
like one point six volts or one point

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.339 
like one point six volts or one point
seven<00:05:27.909> but<00:05:28.449> this<00:05:28.569> one<00:05:28.720> is<00:05:28.780> totally<00:05:29.169> well

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
seven but this one is totally well

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.540 
seven but this one is totally well
within<00:05:29.560> range<00:05:29.830> so<00:05:30.039> I'm<00:05:30.130> going<00:05:30.310> to<00:05:30.400> go<00:05:30.490> ahead

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
within range so I'm going to go ahead

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.700 
within range so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:30.699> reinstall<00:05:30.909> this<00:05:31.330> one<00:05:31.570> now<00:05:32.349> once<00:05:32.560> the

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
and reinstall this one now once the

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.700 
and reinstall this one now once the
batteries<00:05:33.099> out<00:05:33.310> real<00:05:33.639> quick<00:05:33.940> you'll<00:05:34.150> notice

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
batteries out real quick you'll notice

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:40.279 
batteries out real quick you'll notice
that<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.949> analog<00:05:36.490> clock<00:05:37.120> has<00:05:37.389> stopped<00:05:37.719> okay

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
that the analog clock has stopped okay

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.950 
that the analog clock has stopped okay
so<00:05:41.289> let's<00:05:41.409> go<00:05:41.500> ahead<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:41.710> put<00:05:41.800> it<00:05:41.860> back<00:05:42.009> in<00:05:42.250> I

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.390 

just<00:05:46.960> push<00:05:47.139> this<00:05:47.229> back<00:05:47.440> in<00:05:47.740> sometimes<00:05:48.250> there's

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
just push this back in sometimes there's

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.920 
just push this back in sometimes there's
little<00:05:48.490> tabs<00:05:48.880> on<00:05:49.150> each<00:05:49.270> side<00:05:49.539> you<00:05:49.750> have<00:05:49.840> to

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
little tabs on each side you have to

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.939 
little tabs on each side you have to
kind<00:05:50.080> of<00:05:50.169> work<00:05:50.289> around<00:05:50.469> I<00:05:50.590> have<00:05:50.680> to<00:05:50.740> get<00:05:50.860> in

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
kind of work around I have to get in

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.170 
kind of work around I have to get in
there<00:05:51.039> with<00:05:51.130> a<00:05:51.219> screwdriver<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.849> kind<00:05:51.969> of<00:05:52.060> get

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
there with a screwdriver to kind of get

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.810 
there with a screwdriver to kind of get
the<00:05:52.270> tab<00:05:52.479> back<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:52.930> then<00:05:53.020> push<00:05:53.229> it<00:05:53.380> in<00:05:53.699> you<00:05:54.699> can

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
the tab back and then push it in you can

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.820 
the tab back and then push it in you can
see<00:05:55.030> that<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.690> second<00:05:56.380> hand<00:05:56.530> is<00:05:56.650> still

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
see that the second hand is still

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.899 
see that the second hand is still
ticking<00:05:58.289> and<00:05:59.289> then<00:05:59.560> just<00:05:59.740> reverse<00:06:00.099> everything

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
ticking and then just reverse everything

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:03.779 
ticking and then just reverse everything
now<00:06:01.300> on<00:06:01.599> this<00:06:01.840> side<00:06:02.110> over<00:06:02.259> here<00:06:02.380> this<00:06:02.710> USB<00:06:03.400> port

now on this side over here this USB port
that<00:06:03.880> was<00:06:04.150> sticky<00:06:04.630> coming<00:06:04.990> out<00:06:05.139> you<00:06:05.380> want<00:06:05.530> to

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
that was sticky coming out you want to

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.260 
that was sticky coming out you want to
put<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.919> in<00:06:06.099> first<00:06:06.370> okay<00:06:06.870> so<00:06:07.870> try<00:06:08.169> to<00:06:08.560> try<00:06:08.889> to

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
put that in first okay so try to try to

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.719 
put that in first okay so try to try to
maneuver<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.479> the<00:06:11.199> circuit<00:06:11.590> board<00:06:11.830> on<00:06:12.039> the

way in so now once that's in let's go

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.200 
way in so now once that's in let's go
ahead<00:06:58.960> and<00:06:59.230> put<00:06:59.410> the<00:06:59.530> screws<00:06:59.770> back<00:06:59.800> in<00:07:03.210> very

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:04.210 
ahead and put the screws back in very

ahead and put the screws back in very
gently<00:07:04.690> cinch<00:07:05.020> them<00:07:05.170> down<00:07:05.230> they're<00:07:05.890> not

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:06.040 
gently cinch them down they're not

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.860 
gently cinch them down they're not
supposed<00:07:06.340> to<00:07:06.430> it's<00:07:07.270> just<00:07:07.480> supposed<00:07:07.570> to<00:07:07.720> keep

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:07.870 
supposed to it's just supposed to keep

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.270 
supposed to it's just supposed to keep
it<00:07:07.990> from<00:07:08.110> rattling<00:07:08.380> in<00:07:08.710> there<00:07:08.830> that's<00:07:09.040> it

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
it from rattling in there that's it

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.680 
it from rattling in there that's it
that's<00:07:09.610> all<00:07:09.790> the<00:07:09.940> tighter<00:07:10.150> you<00:07:10.330> need<00:07:10.450> to<00:07:10.510> put
