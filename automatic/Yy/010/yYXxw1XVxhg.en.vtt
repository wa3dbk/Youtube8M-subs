00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
so here and talk about what I actually

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.659 
so here and talk about what I actually
think<00:05:03.210> about<00:05:03.509> modern<00:05:03.720> warfare<00:05:04.050> 3<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.830> game<00:05:05.490> is

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
think about modern warfare 3 the game is

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:08.089 
think about modern warfare 3 the game is
very<00:05:05.880> very<00:05:06.210> fast<00:05:06.659> it's<00:05:06.960> like<00:05:07.050> three<00:05:07.590> times<00:05:07.830> as

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
very very fast it's like three times as

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.950 
very very fast it's like three times as
fast<00:05:08.280> as<00:05:08.520> modern<00:05:08.789> warfare<00:05:08.940> 2<00:05:09.150> wasn't<00:05:09.780> about

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
fast as modern warfare 2 wasn't about

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.200 
fast as modern warfare 2 wasn't about
50,000<00:05:10.770> times<00:05:10.889> as<00:05:11.130> fast<00:05:11.280> as<00:05:11.490> black<00:05:11.699> ops<00:05:11.940> was

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
50,000 times as fast as black ops was

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.330 
50,000 times as fast as black ops was
you<00:05:12.539> die<00:05:12.690> really<00:05:12.960> fast<00:05:13.349> and<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.800> rage<00:05:14.009> a<00:05:14.039> lot

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
you die really fast and you rage a lot

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.399 
you die really fast and you rage a lot
it<00:05:14.580> is<00:05:14.729> very<00:05:14.970> hard<00:05:15.240> to<00:05:15.389> get<00:05:15.479> high<00:05:15.690> kill<00:05:16.020> streaks

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:16.409 
it is very hard to get high kill streaks

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:18.680 
it is very hard to get high kill streaks
I<00:05:16.590> think<00:05:16.889> the<00:05:17.190> best<00:05:17.580> game<00:05:17.880> that<00:05:17.909> I<00:05:18.090> had<00:05:18.419> out<00:05:18.659> of

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
I think the best game that I had out of

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.070 
I think the best game that I had out of
the<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.930> live<00:05:19.409> stream<00:05:19.710> was<00:05:19.800> 39<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:20.849> 16<00:05:21.419> and<00:05:21.659> the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
the a live stream was 39 and 16 and the

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.050 
the a live stream was 39 and 16 and the
best<00:05:22.259> kill<00:05:22.470> streak<00:05:22.650> I<00:05:22.770> got<00:05:22.949> was<00:05:23.190> the<00:05:23.460> Osprey

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
best kill streak I got was the Osprey

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.120 
best kill streak I got was the Osprey
gunner<00:05:24.090> but<00:05:24.930> I<00:05:24.960> cheated<00:05:25.319> and<00:05:25.560> got<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.800> out<00:05:25.889> of<00:05:25.949> a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
gunner but I cheated and got it out of a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.860 
gunner but I cheated and got it out of a
care<00:05:26.340> package<00:05:26.550> and<00:05:27.120> I'll<00:05:27.240> tell<00:05:27.419> you<00:05:27.509> one<00:05:27.690> thing

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
receiving end of that kill streak it is

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.510 
receiving end of that kill streak it is
devastating<00:05:31.409> I<00:05:31.710> didn't<00:05:32.130> know<00:05:32.190> what<00:05:32.280> dropped

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
devastating I didn't know what dropped

this<00:05:40.620> game<00:05:40.860> looks<00:05:41.159> to<00:05:41.340> support<00:05:41.940> teamwork<00:05:42.360> a

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 
this game looks to support teamwork a

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.879 
this game looks to support teamwork a
little<00:05:42.690> bit<00:05:42.780> more<00:05:42.960> than<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.199> lone<00:05:43.380> wolf<00:05:43.680> or

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
little bit more than the lone wolf or

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.680 
little bit more than the lone wolf or
maybe<00:05:44.580> that's<00:05:44.729> just<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.060> impression<00:05:45.509> I<00:05:45.570> got

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
maybe that's just the impression I got

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.879 
maybe that's just the impression I got
from<00:05:45.870> last<00:05:46.020> night<00:05:46.289> because<00:05:46.530> I<00:05:46.650> was<00:05:46.770> getting

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
from last night because I was getting

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.020 
from last night because I was getting
slapped<00:05:47.219> left<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:47.669> right<00:05:47.759> when<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:47.909> was

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
slapped left and right when I was

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.249 
slapped left and right when I was
playing<00:05:48.150> by<00:05:48.330> myself<00:05:48.479> and<00:05:48.840> did<00:05:48.960> a<00:05:48.990> little<00:05:49.080> bit

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 
playing by myself and did a little bit

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:50.839 
playing by myself and did a little bit
better<00:05:49.380> with<00:05:49.590> my<00:05:49.710> team<00:05:49.919> but<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.610> guess<00:05:50.729> that's

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
better with my team but I guess that's

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.060 
better with my team but I guess that's
with<00:05:51.090> any<00:05:51.270> game<00:05:51.509> but<00:05:51.810> uh<00:05:51.840> not<00:05:52.500> as<00:05:52.620> easy<00:05:52.830> to<00:05:52.979> go

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
with any game but uh not as easy to go

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.830 
with any game but uh not as easy to go
in<00:05:53.219> as<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.370> lone<00:05:53.580> wolf<00:05:53.819> so<00:05:54.479> if<00:05:54.630> you're<00:05:54.719> gonna

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
in as a lone wolf so if you're gonna

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.540 
in as a lone wolf so if you're gonna
play<00:05:55.020> this<00:05:55.139> game<00:05:55.319> for<00:05:55.469> the<00:05:55.500> first<00:05:55.650> time<00:05:55.919> or<00:05:56.219> you

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
play this game for the first time or you
