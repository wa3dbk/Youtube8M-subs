00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.609
 Hello my dear snowflakes I am 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.160
 is the of the network there hardly gone 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:17.789
 two hooks my new series of videos 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:21.390
 It's all about growth in this project 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.189
 to clear out the topic the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 get a free apartment 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.740
 superfluous krims krams why that's good 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.630
 for the soul is and an approach to 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.180
 the minimalist lifestyle 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 what exactly minimalism means to me 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.380
 I explained in my first video 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.480
 The You can watch here 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.899
 I also link you below in the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.000
 infobox today I would like a whole 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.000
 honest inventory with you 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.739
 because I have to admit mine 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 Apartment is quite a mess of mine 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.640
 mother would do that with a broad 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 so sign off smiling now and then 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.760
 especially when I get visit it is 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 really clean on other days 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 It is not and I have it now 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.640
 a bit missing on those days 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.090
 it is not specifically was the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.930
 a weekend after my niece to 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.729
 my nephew slept with me and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.939
 Just how it is when you are 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:32.180
 I think small children to visit 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:35.250
 I can summarize that best 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.439
 Just take a look it is real 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.140
 not nice to look at but i want to go there 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.950
 also completely honest in this challenge 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.560
 start in and just show that 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.920
 I'm not here from a high one now 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.409
 Ross somehow talk to you but 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 I really do that even to himself a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.619
 little more order in my life and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.049
 to get into my head with it 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.049
 and yes, just have a look 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.280
 So that was the chaos this way 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.349
 of course things are like 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.510
 So maybe you can wash your dishes 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:04.409
 easier to get a grip on than 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.409
 now overflowing cabinets I am 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:12.120
 here also in front of my wardrobe 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:14.970
 I show that it is so short here 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.409
 Something like that is nothing 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:22.650
 summarized and yes we do that 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.079
 Just go back to it quickly 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.829
 every case that is the inventory 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.780
 I'm identical with you I think for 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.849
 every problem that you in the handle 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.290
 you want to get it first 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.180
 admit that you are even one 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.889
 has a problem and I have it very clear 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.220
 recognized me i have a problem 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:44.250
 too much krempel and I now 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:46.859
 approach the issue with a system 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.200
 starting tomorrow, it's really going on 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.590
 and I will get this baby here 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.319
 So I'll just go in 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.220
 wardrobe muck the classic 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.079
 among the spring cleaning actions 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.879
 also take place here in my apartment 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.329
 Of course I will with the camera 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:07.919
 for you hold to see again 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.010
 that I show you now also the 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:13.440
 other side that is not so now 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.599
 But it is also just because we are here 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.500
 the hang section does not look that much though 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:22.250
 in the drawers here are the 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.919
 can you see who are here because 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.760
 it's also time to get back to business 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:28.760
 so the camera marked 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:39.770
 so I have yes when a door opens 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.020
 another joins and vice versa 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.210
 not true 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.699
 So that's the inventory I 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.870
 would like to play here with open cards 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:55.250
 It's my big goal, I think 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:58.340
 especially clear with this challenge 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.830
 To have surfaces so fascinated 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.620
 me always in apartment magazines like that 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.610
 create a table just a table 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:14.380
 let it be and not one 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:19.220
 Wardrobe not a filing and a 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:22.280
 yes a mailbox so a table somehow 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.590
 such a smooth surface always for me 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.130
 to request a small nest 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.630
 to build 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:33.220
 My mother always says pretty farmer 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:36.470
 Yesterday, yes, I want those nests in 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.599
 attack and minimize and how 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.340
 I'm going to tell you this 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:43.610
 worth it for this journey 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.020
 give practical tips but now is 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.810
 First, a small inventory 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.780
 just to give you a better one 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:53.240
 insight to give what we for it here 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.400
 I hope you stay with me 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.740

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.560

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.180

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.289
 this many things everyday 

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.330
 From time to time household is overwhelmed and 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.530
