00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
a lot of smart basketball so I think we

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.980 
a lot of smart basketball so I think we
had<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.070> continue<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.660> hammer<00:00:24.660> away<00:00:24.840> at

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
had to just continue to hammer away at

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
had to just continue to hammer away at
it<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.619> figure<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.000> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it you know and figure out the the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
it you know and figure out the the
nuances<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.140> offense<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> make<00:00:29.340> sure

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
nuances of this offense and make sure

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
nuances of this offense and make sure
that<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.670> run<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.000> with<00:00:30.119> running<00:00:30.330> hard<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.720> run

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
that we run it with running hard to run

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.740 
that we run it with running hard to run
it<00:00:30.990> right<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.380> i<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.560> when<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it right and i think when we do that the

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.660 
it right and i think when we do that the
ball<00:00:33.930> will<00:00:34.079> find<00:00:34.290> open<00:00:34.559> man<00:00:34.710> will<00:00:34.920> get<00:00:35.100> quality

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
ball will find open man will get quality

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.160 
ball will find open man will get quality
shots<00:00:35.940> what<00:00:36.540> accounts<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.020> lack<00:00:37.140> of

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
shots what accounts for the lack of

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.660 
shots what accounts for the lack of
consent<00:00:37.649> being<00:00:37.829> able<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.070> consistently<00:00:38.340> do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
consent being able to consistently do

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
consent being able to consistently do
that<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:38.910> there<00:00:39.059> are<00:00:39.090> games<00:00:39.420> where<00:00:39.719> you

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that because there are games where you

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.170 
that because there are games where you
guys<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.340> well<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.000> other<00:00:42.090> night

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
guys do that very well the other night

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.790 
guys do that very well the other night
was<00:00:42.420> against<00:00:42.750> like<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.930> city<00:00:43.230> was<00:00:43.320> an<00:00:43.379> example

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
was against like the city was an example

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.479 
was against like the city was an example
there's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.640> lot<00:00:44.820> of<00:00:44.850> factors<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.989> mean<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.800> think

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
there's a lot of factors I mean I think

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.580 
there's a lot of factors I mean I think
for<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.870> thing<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.440> I've<00:00:49.559> noticed

not just this year in general is just

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.459 
not just this year in general is just
the<00:00:52.920> unselfishness<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> contagious<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.960> when

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
the unselfishness is contagious and when

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
the unselfishness is contagious and when
we're<00:00:56.129> doing<00:00:56.430> but<00:00:57.109> when<00:00:58.109> everybody's

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we're doing but when everybody's

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.160 
we're doing but when everybody's
