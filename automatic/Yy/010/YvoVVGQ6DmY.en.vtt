00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.890
 with friends another club so good today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.120
 bringing them a new texture the only 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.670
 what is this pack of textures that 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 improves the quality of the game in terms of 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.719
 the graphics so well, I do not expect anything 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.190
 like it and let's start as you know 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.250
 I always use this block application 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.600
 launcher so then to install the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.430
 textures pack I leave in the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.260
 description of the video I leave the paper 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.730
 of texture and if you want to know how it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.900
 uses the block launcher even more 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.640
 I also leave a video for you 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 learn how they can do more things with 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.800
 the blog launcher and my facebook so 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.989
 Well, we'll open today's blog. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.280
 We have a beautiful girl installed and she's going 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 to open as if it were the minecraft itself 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
 opens the minecraft but we will go 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.980
 options this is going to be to make a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.270
 mini logic tutorial on how to install 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 for those who do not know how to install pack 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.680
 of textures I'll show you right here 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.450
 we will go options as you are going to see then 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.539
 will appear much more options than in 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.190
 the main craft poker edition normally 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.050
 and then we will go to look for this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.149
 option of use textures are going to 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.329
 select from there we go to the text of 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.739
 pack 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.539
 from there they will see that they will open 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.550
 many folders here in these folders 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.379
 they will go to look for you where 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.939
 have saved the texture pack I 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.920
 as always when I download it and then 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.810
 I keep it here or I save it 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.430
 here in this download folder like this 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.780
 I'm going to open it and they're just going to 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.159
 select the texture pack that 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.649
 you want in your case you have to 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.200
 downloaded they select it when what 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.730
 have selected then they will 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.310
 restart the minecraft him 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.960
 the blog launcher is going to restart them or 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.240
 they will be closed if they are closed 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.920
 they open it if they are reset 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.600
 it will automatically open again 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 and they will see that they already have the pack of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 texture installed so then nothing 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.740
 comment modifies the start 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.240
 and well nothing I liked this 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.159
 step of texture I think maybe my 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.499
 connect the continuum 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.800
 and then nothing like they see the texture of 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:55.250
 what is this things change a lot 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.520
 the wood changes its why its texture is 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.080
 much clearer the earth the whole 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.910
 simply everything changes its texture 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.160
 as they realize and playing with 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.470
 graphics to the maximum looks like this from this 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.500
 way and then almost do not tell me my 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.869
 phone too 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.230
 and you do not know it just looks good to me 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.120
 I liked it a lot and without the nothing so 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.180
 well nothing 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.470
 of texture this week I will not go up in 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.420
 these days maybe it will not keep going up 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.860
 because I've run out of the ones I have 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.020
 They have a book and I do not want to upload them 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.380
 So I look for more and if you like it to 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.320
 the cock looks like a tree here witchcraft and 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.670
 maybe it will go up but then follow 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.570
 going up more texture pack when 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.910
 find many more 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.040
 even so I will continue uploading hugo videos and 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:43.500
 Well, I hope nothing like the whole club 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.500
 see you until next time
