tutorial for the specific T flip-flop i
was<00:00:13.769> using<00:00:13.950> former<00:00:14.759> zippers<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.650> before<00:00:16.650> i

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
was using former zippers and before i

was using former zippers and before i
show<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.119> how<00:00:18.359> to<00:00:18.420> build<00:00:18.660> i<00:00:18.810> want<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.080> explain

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
show you how to build i want to explain

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
show you how to build i want to explain
why<00:00:19.680> it's<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.670> important<00:00:22.279> as<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.760> can<00:00:23.880> see

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
why it's so important as you can see

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
why it's so important as you can see
here<00:00:24.449> i<00:00:24.480> have<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> button<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.619> pressure

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
here i have a button and a pressure

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.720 
here i have a button and a pressure
plate<00:00:26.300> hooked<00:00:27.300> up<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:28.010> my<00:00:29.010> standard<00:00:29.519> t

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
plate hooked up to my standard t

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.590 
plate hooked up to my standard t
flip-flop<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.420> i<00:00:30.449> use<00:00:32.120> if<00:00:33.120> i<00:00:33.210> press<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
flip-flop that i use if i press the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.080 
flip-flop that i use if i press the
button<00:00:33.870> you<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.070> output<00:00:35.100> works

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
button you can see that the output works

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790 
button you can see that the output works
normally<00:00:36.360> by<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.780> way<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.590> two

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
normally by the way this does have two

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.889 
normally by the way this does have two
outputs<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> guys<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:38.969> ignore<00:00:39.420> one

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
outputs so you guys can just ignore one

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.580 
outputs so you guys can just ignore one
of<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.200> doesn't<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.100> matter<00:00:41.450> and<00:00:42.559> then<00:00:43.559> i

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
of them doesn't really matter and then i

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.240 
of them doesn't really matter and then i
click<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.890> again<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:44.960> you<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:47.070> t

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
click it again and then you know it to t

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.850 
click it again and then you know it to t
flip-flop<00:00:47.640> works<00:00:47.969> awesome<00:00:48.690> problem<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.590> it

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
flip-flop works awesome problem is it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.790 
flip-flop works awesome problem is it
only<00:00:50.100> works<00:00:50.760> appropriately<00:00:51.469> for<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> length

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
only works appropriately for the length

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
only works appropriately for the length
of<00:00:53.039> a<00:00:53.160> button<00:00:53.370> pulse<00:00:54.020> so<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:56.780> so<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:57.989> if

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
of a button pulse so it's so like if

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.260 
of a button pulse so it's so like if
you're<00:00:58.289> standing<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.710> pressure<00:00:58.829> plate

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
you're standing on a pressure plate

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.979 
you're standing on a pressure plate
longer<00:01:00.270> than<00:01:00.510> what<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.079> button<00:01:01.710> pulse<00:01:02.989> would

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
longer than what a button pulse would

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.760 
longer than what a button pulse would
would<00:01:04.589> work<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:05.240> then<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.630> causes<00:01:07.140> problems

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
would work as then it causes problems

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.920 
would work as then it causes problems
i'll<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.580> guys<00:01:08.700> right<00:01:08.970> now<00:01:11.330> as<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.810> can

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
i'll show you guys right now as you can

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
i'll show you guys right now as you can
see<00:01:13.110> there<00:01:13.320> didn't<00:01:13.710> flip<00:01:14.640> anything<00:01:17.270> so<00:01:18.270> i<00:01:18.299> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
see there didn't flip anything so i just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.789 
see there didn't flip anything so i just
spent<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.750> little<00:01:18.869> bit<00:01:18.990> more<00:01:19.229> time<00:01:19.470> on<00:01:19.500> there

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
spent a little bit more time on there

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.499 
spent a little bit more time on there
than<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.070> should<00:01:20.310> have<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.909> didn't<00:01:21.240> flip<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
than I should have and it didn't flip it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
than I should have and it didn't flip it
I'm<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> fight<00:01:21.900> stand<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.130> off<00:01:23.159> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I'm a fight stand on it then get off of

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'm a fight stand on it then get off of
a<00:01:23.520> real<00:01:23.670> quick<00:01:23.909> it'll<00:01:24.420> work<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.689> fine<00:01:25.850> but

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
a real quick it'll work just fine but

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.789 
a real quick it'll work just fine but
that's<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.450> not<00:01:27.659> what<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.080> want<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> just

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
that's that's not what we want so just

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.770 
that's that's not what we want so just
kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.490> show<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.700> guys<00:01:32.850> what<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.630> trying

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
kind of show you guys what we're trying

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.460 
kind of show you guys what we're trying
to<00:01:33.869> accomplish<00:01:33.990> here<00:01:34.340> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:36.470> t

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
to accomplish here this is my t

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.980 
to accomplish here this is my t
flip-flop<00:01:37.860> design<00:01:38.299> which<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.450> kind<00:01:39.900> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
flip-flop design which is kind of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.240 
flip-flop design which is kind of
similar<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.380> what<00:01:40.740> we're<00:01:40.920> going<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.189> be

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
similar to what we're going to be

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.179 
similar to what we're going to be
building<00:01:41.869> however<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.200> lot<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.649> compact

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
building however it's a lot more compact

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
building however it's a lot more compact
this<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.119> pretty<00:01:45.420> big<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.810> one<00:01:46.110> we're

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
this one is pretty big and one we're

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.359 
this one is pretty big and one we're
going<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.380> build<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:47.270> too<00:01:48.380> low<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
going to build is too low what is it to

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.410 
going to build is too low what is it to
buy<00:01:50.579> 5<00:01:51.090> by<00:01:51.479> 2<00:01:52.430> so<00:01:53.430> big<00:01:53.820> difference<00:01:54.240> in

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
buy 5 by 2 so big difference in

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.889 
buy 5 by 2 so big difference in
dimensions<00:01:55.579> so<00:01:56.579> basically<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.719> this

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
dimensions so basically you know this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.020 
dimensions so basically you know this
one<00:01:58.079> flips<00:01:58.829> what's<00:01:59.219> great<00:01:59.310> about<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.700> one<00:01:59.909> is

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
one flips what's great about this one is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
one flips what's great about this one is
it<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:01.020> flips<00:02:01.610> very<00:02:02.610> quickly<00:02:03.439> and<00:02:04.439> then<00:02:04.619> when<00:02:04.860> I

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
it it flips very quickly and then when I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.830 
it it flips very quickly and then when I
step<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.549> pressure<00:02:05.729> plate<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.600> stay

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
step on the pressure plate I could stay

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.710 
step on the pressure plate I could stay
on<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.200> for<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.500> long<00:02:07.560> as<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.129> it<00:02:08.720> will

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
on here for as long as I want it will

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.809 
on here for as long as I want it will
not<00:02:09.929> change<00:02:10.170> back

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.640 

and<00:02:13.480> that's<00:02:14.109> what<00:02:14.290> we're<00:02:14.409> trying<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
and that's what we're trying to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.879 
and that's what we're trying to
accomplish<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:16.329> we<00:02:16.480> want<00:02:16.689> that<00:02:16.870> t<00:02:17.319> flip-flop

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:17.889 
accomplish so we want that t flip-flop

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:21.839 
accomplish so we want that t flip-flop
but<00:02:18.700> we<00:02:18.909> want<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.269> in<00:02:20.139> a<00:02:20.950> more<00:02:21.159> compact<00:02:21.609> design

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
but we want it in a more compact design

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.869 
but we want it in a more compact design
this<00:02:22.299> is<00:02:22.359> how<00:02:23.260> we're<00:02:23.409> going<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.590> do<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.889> you

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
this is how we're going to do it you

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.610 
this is how we're going to do it you
want<00:02:25.060> to<00:02:25.090> start<00:02:25.359> with<00:02:25.480> finding<00:02:26.290> your<00:02:26.469> Center

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
want to start with finding your Center

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.770 
want to start with finding your Center
Point<00:02:26.999> then<00:02:27.999> going<00:02:28.299> to<00:02:28.840> over<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.409> over<00:02:30.689> so<00:02:31.689> you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
Point then going to over to over so you

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.910 
Point then going to over to over so you
want<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:31.989> have<00:02:32.079> three<00:02:32.290> spaces<00:02:32.590> in<00:02:32.889> between

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
want to have three spaces in between

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.530 
want to have three spaces in between
your<00:02:33.700> blocks<00:02:33.939> then<00:02:34.689> you<00:02:34.810> want<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.019> put<00:02:35.459> a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
your blocks then you want to put a

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.800 
your blocks then you want to put a
regular<00:02:37.540> pistons<00:02:38.349> on<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:38.680> outside<00:02:39.629> dig<00:02:40.629> out

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
regular pistons on the outside dig out

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.550 
regular pistons on the outside dig out
holes<00:02:41.379> right<00:02:42.069> on<00:02:42.249> the<00:02:42.459> front<00:02:43.299> of<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:44.019> Pistons

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
holes right on the front of the Pistons

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.429 
holes right on the front of the Pistons
and<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:45.489> one<00:02:45.730> side<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.299> want<00:02:46.870> to<00:02:46.989> put<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.109> torch

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
and on one side you want to put a torch

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.009 
and on one side you want to put a torch
and<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:48.219> the<00:02:48.340> other<00:02:48.459> side<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.359> can<00:02:49.510> either<00:02:49.659> put

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
and on the other side you can either put

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.429 
and on the other side you can either put
a<00:02:50.049> piece<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.319> redstone<00:02:50.620> or<00:02:51.449> you<00:02:52.449> can<00:02:52.780> put<00:02:53.139> a

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
a piece of redstone or you can put a

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.220 
a piece of redstone or you can put a
button<00:02:54.180> preferably<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.239> like<00:02:55.480> using<00:02:55.689> a<00:02:55.900> button

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
button preferably I like using a button

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.750 
button preferably I like using a button
I<00:02:57.010> just<00:02:57.819> think<00:02:57.969> it<00:02:58.090> looks<00:02:58.269> cleaner<00:02:59.280> then<00:03:00.280> you

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
I just think it looks cleaner then you

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.959 
I just think it looks cleaner then you
want<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.180> put<00:03:01.480> redstone<00:03:02.379> in<00:03:02.949> the<00:03:03.489> center<00:03:03.819> and

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:03.969 
want to put redstone in the center and

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.830 
want to put redstone in the center and
on<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:05.489> side<00:03:06.489> with<00:03:06.669> the<00:03:06.699> button<00:03:07.060> then<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
on the side with the button then the

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.770 
on the side with the button then the
side<00:03:08.019> with<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.260> torch<00:03:08.799> you<00:03:09.040> want<00:03:09.189> to<00:03:09.250> put<00:03:09.430> a

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
side with the torch you want to put a

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.500 
side with the torch you want to put a
repeater<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:12.819> reason<00:03:13.120> why<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.329> have<00:03:13.480> a

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
repeater the reason why we have a

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.819 
repeater the reason why we have a
repeater<00:03:13.930> here<00:03:14.049> basically<00:03:14.620> is<00:03:15.010> just<00:03:15.159> so<00:03:15.549> that

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
repeater here basically is just so that

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:22.559 
repeater here basically is just so that
the<00:03:17.829> power<00:03:18.069> here<00:03:19.439> does<00:03:20.439> not<00:03:20.620> transfer<00:03:21.220> up<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.790> a

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
the power here does not transfer up to a

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.059 
the power here does not transfer up to a
piece<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:22.989> redstone<00:03:23.400> right<00:03:24.400> there<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:26.049> it<00:03:26.829> also

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
piece of redstone right there so it also

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.849 
piece of redstone right there so it also
allows<00:03:27.699> for<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.120> delay<00:03:28.659> for<00:03:29.319> when<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> power

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:29.859 
allows for a delay for when the power

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.800 
allows for a delay for when the power
comes<00:03:30.129> in<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:31.720> when<00:03:32.049> if<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:32.949> cut<00:03:33.220> off<00:03:33.250> it

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
comes in that when if this is cut off it

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.449 
comes in that when if this is cut off it
will<00:03:34.810> automatically<00:03:35.409> go<00:03:35.650> directly<00:03:36.009> into<00:03:36.129> this

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
will automatically go directly into this

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.999 
will automatically go directly into this
one<00:03:36.669> first<00:03:36.939> and<00:03:37.269> then<00:03:37.930> push<00:03:38.259> it<00:03:38.290> this<00:03:38.530> way<00:03:38.739> but

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009 
one first and then push it this way but

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:44.809 
one first and then push it this way but
if<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.519> is<00:03:40.079> broken<00:03:41.079> off<00:03:41.609> then<00:03:42.609> as<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.239> see<00:03:43.419> the

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
if it is broken off then as you see the

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.249 
if it is broken off then as you see the
red<00:03:45.819> stone<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.209> cut<00:03:46.359> so<00:03:46.750> will<00:03:46.959> not<00:03:47.109> go<00:03:47.229> into

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
red stone is cut so will not go into

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.670 
red stone is cut so will not go into
this<00:03:47.560> block<00:03:48.489> which<00:03:48.699> part<00:03:48.939> sorry<00:03:49.180> Peter<00:03:49.479> so<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
this block which part sorry Peter so it

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.179 
this block which part sorry Peter so it
will<00:03:50.799> go<00:03:50.949> into<00:03:51.220> this<00:03:51.909> one<00:03:52.590> very<00:03:53.590> nifty<00:03:54.959> so<00:03:56.189> this

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
will go into this one very nifty so this

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:01.949 
will go into this one very nifty so this
is<00:03:57.519> our<00:03:57.819> output<00:03:59.669> split<00:04:00.669> up<00:04:00.790> thing<00:04:01.569> right<00:04:01.750> there

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
is our output split up thing right there

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.330 
is our output split up thing right there
and<00:04:02.430> this<00:04:03.430> is<00:04:03.669> our<00:04:03.819> input<00:04:05.129> right<00:04:06.129> here<00:04:06.519> oops

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
and this is our input right here oops

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.390 
and this is our input right here oops
I'm<00:04:09.340> going<00:04:09.879> to<00:04:09.939> go<00:04:10.150> right<00:04:10.509> oops<00:04:11.109> did<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.709> might

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
I'm going to go right oops did I might

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.580 
I'm going to go right oops did I might
as<00:04:12.459> well<00:04:12.519> line<00:04:12.759> this<00:04:12.879> up<00:04:13.060> properly<00:04:13.509> let's<00:04:14.409> talk

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
as well line this up properly let's talk

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.160 
as well line this up properly let's talk
about<00:04:14.739> the<00:04:14.949> lag<00:04:15.189> gaiz

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:25.520 

and<00:04:19.170> then<00:04:19.590> we<00:04:19.769> put<00:04:20.040> our<00:04:20.220> button<00:04:23.900> button<00:04:24.900> and<00:04:25.170> a

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and then we put our button button and a

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.320 
and then we put our button button and a
pressure<00:04:25.770> plate<00:04:28.040> as<00:04:29.040> you<00:04:29.280> can<00:04:29.460> see<00:04:32.330> that

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
pressure plate as you can see that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.970 
pressure plate as you can see that
actually<00:04:33.720> goes<00:04:34.010> very<00:04:35.010> quickly<00:04:36.680> this<00:04:37.680> T

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:37.980 
actually goes very quickly this T

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.920 
actually goes very quickly this T
flip-flop<00:04:38.520> actually<00:04:39.030> has<00:04:39.210> quite<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.630> bit<00:04:39.840> of

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
flip-flop actually has quite a bit of

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.600 
flip-flop actually has quite a bit of
delay<00:04:40.880> before<00:04:41.880> it<00:04:42.389> flips<00:04:42.980> backwards<00:04:43.980> not<00:04:44.370> as

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
delay before it flips backwards not as

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.640 
delay before it flips backwards not as
much<00:04:44.850> but<00:04:45.180> yeah<00:04:45.840> this<00:04:46.740> one<00:04:47.010> is<00:04:47.690> one<00:04:49.040> tick<00:04:50.040> delay

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
much but yeah this one is one tick delay

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.950 
much but yeah this one is one tick delay
yeah<00:04:52.650> one<00:04:52.950> tick<00:04:53.160> delay<00:04:53.460> either<00:04:53.790> way<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.419> think

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
yeah one tick delay either way I think

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.530 
yeah one tick delay either way I think
one<00:04:55.290> way<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.500> actually<00:04:55.860> faster<00:04:56.210> if<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:57.300> were<00:04:57.450> to

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
one way is actually faster if I were to

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.540 
one way is actually faster if I were to
kind<00:04:57.690> of<00:04:57.780> like<00:04:57.930> a<00:04:57.960> probably<00:04:58.320> do<00:04:58.470> but<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.400> best

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
kind of like a probably do but the best

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:00.920 
kind of like a probably do but the best
part<00:04:59.760> about<00:04:59.850> it<00:05:00.000> I<00:05:00.240> could<00:05:00.480> step<00:05:00.720> on<00:05:00.810> this

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
part about it I could step on this

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.170 
part about it I could step on this
pressure<00:05:01.169> plate<00:05:01.470> all<00:05:01.680> day<00:05:02.370> long<00:05:02.580> and<00:05:02.940> it'll

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
pressure plate all day long and it'll

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.040 
pressure plate all day long and it'll
stay<00:05:03.390> in<00:05:03.720> its<00:05:04.110> state<00:05:05.000> step<00:05:06.000> off<00:05:06.180> step<00:05:06.720> back<00:05:06.840> on

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
stay in its state step off step back on

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.130 
stay in its state step off step back on
change<00:05:07.560> state<00:05:07.890> no<00:05:08.250> problem<00:05:08.640> so<00:05:09.390> this<00:05:09.840> is

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
change state no problem so this is

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.570 
change state no problem so this is
probably<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.680> whoops<00:05:11.340> that<00:05:11.910> was<00:05:12.060> stupid<00:05:13.580> this

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
probably the whoops that was stupid this

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.030 
probably the whoops that was stupid this
is<00:05:14.760> probably<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.210> best<00:05:15.419> t<00:05:16.200> flip-flop<00:05:16.800> that

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
is probably the best t flip-flop that

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.629 
is probably the best t flip-flop that
you<00:05:17.310> are<00:05:17.520> going<00:05:17.820> to<00:05:17.940> find<00:05:18.650> there<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.950> other

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
you are going to find there is other

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.570 
you are going to find there is other
ones<00:05:20.940> for<00:05:21.240> single-player<00:05:21.720> that<00:05:22.620> are<00:05:22.800> a<00:05:23.130> lot

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
ones for single-player that are a lot

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.770 
ones for single-player that are a lot
more<00:05:23.610> compact<00:05:24.150> but<00:05:24.780> as<00:05:25.530> far<00:05:25.860> as<00:05:25.919> functionality

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
more compact but as far as functionality

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.190 
more compact but as far as functionality
with<00:05:27.780> design<00:05:28.169> this<00:05:29.060> this<00:05:30.060> is<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.419> best<00:05:30.660> it

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
with design this this is the best it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.440 
with design this this is the best it
really<00:05:31.500> is<00:05:33.380> alright<00:05:34.380> guys<00:05:34.530> I<00:05:35.400> hope<00:05:35.910> this

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
really is alright guys I hope this

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:40.430 
really is alright guys I hope this
helped<00:05:37.100> see<00:05:38.100> on<00:05:38.190> the<00:05:38.250> flip<00:05:38.400> side
