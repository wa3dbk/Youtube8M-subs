00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.320
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.200
 from tazio tv and that's because I 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.779
 today in zeestow beginners maybe 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.070
 Can explain how your mouse 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.439
 have to adjust 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.400
 and of course there are a few 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.760
 pay someone you can calculate around 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.090
 the perfect speed 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.070
 out 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.809
 i will do that in a simple way 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.540
 Build now and I'll show you 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.940
 how I did that with me or 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.510
 as some people do 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.430
 and first in the windows 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.570
 settings the mouse accelerations 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.520
 issue the level of a 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.430
 speed of the mouse on the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.280
 this is the sixth stroke 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.320
 and then I know what a mouse 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.650
 says I have a razer mouse now 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.740
 will now also be a picture a dazzle 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.920
 as the db is now set by me 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.340
 and that the mouse speed up old 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.409
 and then you go if you all that 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.219
 then I've done that now 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.619
 to 800 dpi with my mouse and then 

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:33.109
 is she ingame and I now have a 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:34.880
 Austin city ​​of 17 mouse acceleration 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.819
 here in the course also from the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:41.359
 red use must decide for yourself 

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:46.459
 whether he lets it outside or inside 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:52.759
 just minimal what you possibly feel 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:54.590
 but I will show it that way now 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.329
 I have one, for example 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.119
 giant mouse pad i can now use this 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:03.319
 Otherwise , I can perfect my mouse 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.310
 here on the giant from begging and 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.300
 move around 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.060
 and I do not know if he beginners since 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.590
 I do it just always so shoots a 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.250
 up to two times on the wall with it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.580
 you see these black dots you see 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:30.410
 of course now here and then just in 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:32.030
 ground left and right try 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
 always to stay 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.799
 Of course it will always be a deviation 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.760
 to recognize what system 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.260
 was programmed 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.260
 and then summer makes lan 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.460
 so i stop main cruiser if 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.850
 you could have liked that 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.140
 Lighter if you want and that 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.180
 is not much to note that is 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.150
 Just go out of an app like this me 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.070
 am now on the offline server goes 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.770
 just a band with your crosser and 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.420
 shoot once against moves and 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.550
 here and there you will see already 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.890
 far 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.780
 whether the cross is set correctly for 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.100
 your relationship about it not many 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.340
 another example, I have one now 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.450
 slower monster city can do so 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.180
 play perfect 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.670
 I'm out of the fight I'm all with now 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.190
 wreath 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.380
 some eg fast must be fast 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.780
 settings the problem is always you 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.730
 if you are the mouse sensitive the 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.160
 that then also maintains that 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.780
 Does not bring you anything if you are only 1.7 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.550
 then have 25 getting used to the side 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.320
 quite a long time you need it for that 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.350
 so that's been with me that the 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:54.790
 getting used to nothing at half past I'm with 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.020
 24 started and am now on 17 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.340
 since the habituation is with me 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.170
 for a long time the truth is really long 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.480
 and that's the best way to keep it that way 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:10.070
 step by step he stopped 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.930
 x 10.6 for example plays 16 plays 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.230
 then by 150 so now of you 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.840
 seeded and two times something that he 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.650
 that then always down regulates and 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.870
 then you will also see someone on 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.370
 set yours correctly in the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.560
 next video I will show how that 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.630
 Spray is how to control the spray 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.330
 can keep 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:38.570
 and there is the muslim such as legal 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.880
 important and I hope that you 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.740
 but you could enjoy video here 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.650
 perhaps because I am now let new 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.510
 started and look forward to the 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.780
 next videos will be the next video 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.780
 around 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.890
 control sprey and afterwards 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.330
 I still get a video of the cross 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:02.030
 generally of the size of 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:04.130
 dynamic more of the static and there 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.020
 I could turn it on 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.840
 I am happy if you also have comments there 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.560
 would leave and this i am out to do this 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.560
 from the tv
