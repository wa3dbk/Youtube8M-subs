00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 And now the next moment that glue 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:09.269
 what not to glue here I dug out of the bins 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.240
 already the oldest wreck I'll show you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.200
 as usually happens here on the edge 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.610
 will break 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.449
 this is very often so traumatic 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.460
 the place is beat the skin comes off and look 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.119
 there is a free can millimeter 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.420
 maybe 2 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.460
 what people do does one of two things or 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 generally just put and pour there 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.210
 glue thinks she is grabbing 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.370
 is all this already a murder right away or 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 take this edge and ointment from it and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.530
 pritulyak 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 this one millimeter that nato with us 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 there is another option to spread them so write them 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.329
 2 but deeper so stuff will paste 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.739
 like a big piece though 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.840
 half a centimeter but thanks 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.410
 Firstly, this is also not enough because 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.410
 look right here stitch so but here 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.020
 half a centimeter even 67 subway but its 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.369
 sew it here the tension she glued 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.430
 should not it be paste up 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:12.180
 need more piece more stocks 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:15.090
 this is the second and the second for sawing 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.270
 some shoes breathed right here so 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.369
 here here here here here this whole 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.860
 the sole must be taken away properly 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.009
 smear can be glued and now here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.320
 where the burst here is just a patch 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.409
 do external or internal stealth 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.920
 here but only a patch so if this 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.990
 tip even deeply shove and glue 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 it gets worse i'm already talking like 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.170
 half a centimeter seems to be stuck a lot but 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.200
 mandate here vlazit tension intensifies 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.780
 and the tension increases and it is even more 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.119
 will pull out this patch to tear up 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.509
 also if you poured from liquid 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.100
 glue it will saturate this skin this piece 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.579
 just soaked will come off 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.500
 gel gel will not do colitis but with 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.540
 soles other options so only 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 need to 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.730
 tearing as flexible as possible such 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.480
 Sole I would advise but this is what 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.150
 that whoever looks means does not stick here 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.310
 such where absolutely small tips are not 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.800
 do it without a nozzle so here's the main thing 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.750
 insult that people came off by bought in 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.420
 the super quick glue store poured 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.610
 there is a puddle 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.160
 grabbed and all ara she long so not 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.950
 hold on then it will be worse echer 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.740
 glue only good such road pieces 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.530
 video track do this patch 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.790
 just do it and this glue is applied 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.400
 on one side only 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.830
 but how to do it more or less 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.830
 I will show the technology a little further
