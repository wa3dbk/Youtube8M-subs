on that never summer fun slinger
this<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.879> 153<00:00:06.779> centimeter<00:00:07.290> board<00:00:07.589> like<00:00:08.550> every

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
this is 153 centimeter board like every

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.669 
this is 153 centimeter board like every
never<00:00:09.660> somewhere<00:00:10.019> in<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.170> line<00:00:10.349> it<00:00:10.530> has<00:00:10.559> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
never somewhere in the line it has a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.740 
never somewhere in the line it has a
combination<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.550> cambers<00:00:12.059> going<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.540> or

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
combination of cambers going on or

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.440 
combination of cambers going on or
rocker<00:00:13.590> camber<00:00:13.950> technology<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.120> rocker

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
rocker camber technology so it's rocker

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.349 
rocker camber technology so it's rocker
in<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.750> middle<00:00:16.220> camber<00:00:17.220> under<00:00:17.520> feet<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.210> can

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
in the middle camber under feet you can

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.380 
in the middle camber under feet you can
actually<00:00:18.720> see<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.730> you<00:00:20.730> put<00:00:20.970> weight<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
actually see it you put weight on the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.090 
actually see it you put weight on the
tip<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.869> tails<00:00:22.109> coming<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.619> if<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:22.800> put

weight on the tail the tips coming up

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.630 
weight on the tail the tips coming up
it's<00:00:25.350> actually<00:00:25.769> already<00:00:26.160> there<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:27.470> reverse

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
forth getting a little bit of a feel for

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.740 
forth getting a little bit of a feel for
the<00:00:48.780> board<00:00:49.340> this<00:00:50.340> is<00:00:50.400> not<00:00:50.730> really<00:00:51.060> trying<00:00:51.360> and

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the board this is not really trying and

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
the board this is not really trying and
this<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.260> how<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.560> board's<00:00:52.920> flexing

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
this is how the board's flexing

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.780 
this is how the board's flexing
that's<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.900> comfort<00:00:55.320> zone<00:00:55.830> pulling<00:00:56.550> past

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
that's the comfort zone pulling past

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.220 
that's the comfort zone pulling past
that<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.570> wants<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.870> pull<00:00:58.080> back

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
that it kind of wants to pull back

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.470 
that it kind of wants to pull back
towards<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> ground<00:01:01.490> yep<00:01:02.520> past<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.120> comfort

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
towards the ground yep past the comfort

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.860 
towards the ground yep past the comfort
zone

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
zone

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.680

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
one thing that is very obviously

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.250 
one thing that is very obviously
different<00:01:14.700> from<00:01:14.760> any<00:01:15.450> other<00:01:15.780> board<00:01:16.050> that<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
different from any other board that I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.210 
different from any other board that I
flex<00:01:16.590> tested<00:01:17.010> yet<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.550> year<00:01:17.910> is<00:01:19.040> all<00:01:20.040> right

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
flex tested yet this year is all right

so<00:01:20.490> instead<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.880> just<00:01:21.090> having<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.420> lean<00:01:21.900> my

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
so instead of just having to lean my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.930 
so instead of just having to lean my
whole<00:01:22.410> body<00:01:22.650> weight<00:01:22.860> out<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.760> do

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
whole body weight out all I have to do

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.719 
whole body weight out all I have to do
is<00:01:24.180> make<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.140> one<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.619> my<00:01:25.740> feet<00:01:26.130> doesn't

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

is make it so one of my feet doesn't
have<00:01:27.000> any<00:01:27.240> weight<00:01:27.510> on<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:27.960> this<00:01:28.110> just

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
have any weight on it and this just

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.910 
have any weight on it and this just
actually<00:01:28.800> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.070> feel<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> spring<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.920> so

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
actually you can feel it spring up so

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
when I actually stand on the camber zone

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.080 
when I actually stand on the camber zone
of<00:01:33.960> my<00:01:34.080> right<00:01:34.290> foot<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.190> foot<00:01:35.520> wants<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.940> be

right<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.660> with<00:01:36.900> nothing

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
right there with nothing

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.320 
right there with nothing
I<00:01:37.619> don't<00:01:37.830> not<00:01:38.100> even<00:01:38.400> pulling<00:01:38.640> up<00:01:38.910> that's<00:01:39.150> what

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
I don't not even pulling up that's what

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.560 
I don't not even pulling up that's what
it<00:01:39.420> wants<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.930> unless<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.410> push<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.890> down<00:01:40.920> it

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
it wants to do unless I push it down it

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.710 
it wants to do unless I push it down it
wants<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.660> be<00:01:42.810> right<00:01:43.080> there<00:01:44.509> it's<00:01:45.509> actually

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
wants to be right there it's actually

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.469 
wants to be right there it's actually

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
doing that on its own so if I stand on

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
doing that on its own so if I stand on
the<00:01:48.630> front<00:01:48.780> camber<00:01:49.170> zone<00:01:49.440> on<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.710> nose<00:01:49.920> the

the front camber zone on my nose the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.480 
the front camber zone on my nose the
tail<00:01:50.520> wants<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:52.490> imagine

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
tail wants to be right there imagine

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.279

nice stable stiff zone it'll bend a
little<00:02:35.610> bit<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.530> got<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.830> energy

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
