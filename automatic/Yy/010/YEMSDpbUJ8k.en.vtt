now<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.100> analyzer<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.640> special<00:01:09.060> that<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.270> has

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
now this analyzer is special that it has

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
now this analyzer is special that it has
a<00:01:09.420> real-time<00:01:09.869> engine<00:01:10.140> in<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> can

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a real-time engine in it and that I can

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.609 
a real-time engine in it and that I can
take<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.270> data<00:01:12.450> that's<00:01:12.689> coming<00:01:12.960> in<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
take the data that's coming in from the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
take the data that's coming in from the
front<00:01:13.799> end<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> stream<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.939> through<00:01:15.090> a

front end and stream it through a
real-time<00:01:15.600> engine<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.320> these

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
real-time engine to do these

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.789 
real-time engine to do these
computations<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.490> Fourier<00:01:17.790> transforms

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799

analyzer<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.680> again<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.159> we're<00:01:26.310> doing<00:01:26.610> about

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
analyzer so again here we're doing about

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.740 
analyzer so again here we're doing about
you<00:01:28.170> know<00:01:28.259> 3<00:01:28.560> 3<00:01:28.979> spectrums<00:01:29.400> per<00:01:29.549> second<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.479> if

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
you know 3 3 spectrums per second and if

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.690 
you know 3 3 spectrums per second and if
I<00:01:30.810> hook<00:01:30.990> up<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.650> audio<00:01:31.799> source<00:01:32.250> which<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
I hook up my audio source which in this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910 
I hook up my audio source which in this
case<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.450> little<00:01:33.659> 8<00:01:33.780> ohm<00:01:33.960> speaker<00:01:34.500> so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
case is just a little 8 ohm speaker so

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.050 
case is just a little 8 ohm speaker so
it's<00:01:35.070> just<00:01:35.130> going<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.460> used<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> pick<00:01:35.850> up

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
it's just going to be used to pick up

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.550 
it's just going to be used to pick up
room<00:01:36.329> noise<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.840> vibration<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.470> just

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
room noise and vibration and I'm just

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
room noise and vibration and I'm just
going<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:37.770> couple<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.130> into<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> analyzer

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
going to couple that into the analyzer

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.210 
going to couple that into the analyzer
here<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:40.259> what<00:01:40.380> I<00:01:40.409> do<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> can<00:01:40.979> kind<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
here and what I do that I can kind of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
here and what I do that I can kind of
see<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.850> know<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> spectrum<00:01:43.259> of<00:01:43.350> my

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
see you know kind of the spectrum of my

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.819 
see you know kind of the spectrum of my
voice<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.220> taken<00:01:44.930> it's<00:01:45.930> about<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> 250

300,000 spectrums a second and then

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.350 
300,000 spectrums a second and then

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
how often areas are being occupied so

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.510 
how often areas are being occupied so
like<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.020> brighter<00:02:47.320> are<00:02:47.620> hotter<00:02:47.890> colors<00:02:48.310> like

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
like the brighter are hotter colors like

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.520 
like the brighter are hotter colors like
the<00:02:48.670> yellows<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.390> Reds<00:02:49.480> are<00:02:50.020> areas<00:02:50.500> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the yellows and the Reds are areas that

occupied most often the cooler colors

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.570 
occupied most often the cooler colors
like<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.260> light<00:02:53.440> might<00:02:53.709> know<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> green<00:02:54.250> the

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
like the light might know the green the

like the light might know the green the
light<00:02:54.730> blue<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.090> dark<00:02:55.330> blue<00:02:55.570> are<00:02:56.200> areas<00:02:56.620> that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
light blue the dark blue are areas that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.830 
light blue the dark blue are areas that
are<00:02:56.800> occupied<00:02:57.280> less<00:02:57.520> often<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.270> snap<00:02:58.810> my

are occupied less often I snap my

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.380 
are occupied less often I snap my
fingers<00:02:58.959> here<00:02:59.530> and<00:02:59.590> kind<00:02:59.860> of<00:02:59.890> see<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:01.300> know

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
fingers here and kind of see you know

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.720 
fingers here and kind of see you know
that<00:03:01.540> kind<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.840> pop<00:03:02.020> up<00:03:02.050> there<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.519> know<00:03:03.580> is

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
that kind of pop up there you know is

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.270 
that kind of pop up there you know is
that<00:03:04.080> those<00:03:05.080> instantaneous<00:03:05.860> so<00:03:06.160> the

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
that those instantaneous so the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.100 
that those instantaneous so the
instantaneous<00:03:06.760> spectrum<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.570> sound<00:03:07.900> is

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
instantaneous spectrum of that sound is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.509 
instantaneous spectrum of that sound is
being<00:03:08.320> picked<00:03:08.530> up<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:08.920> converted<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
being picked up and converted to the

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.030 
being picked up and converted to the
display<00:03:10.080> so<00:03:11.080> it's<00:03:11.290> gives<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.590> really<00:03:11.890> nice

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
display so it's gives you a really nice

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.270 
display so it's gives you a really nice
way<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> doing<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.060> live<00:03:13.360> view<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:14.739> what<00:03:15.130> can

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
way of doing a live view of what can

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.410 
way of doing a live view of what can
happen<00:03:15.310> with<00:03:15.730> some<00:03:15.880> of<00:03:15.970> these<00:03:16.060> slowly

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
happen with some of these slowly

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.780 
happen with some of these slowly
changing<00:03:17.080> phenomena<00:03:17.620> we<00:03:18.280> can<00:03:18.400> look<00:03:18.519> at<00:03:18.640> that<00:03:18.730> a

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
changing phenomena we can look at that a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.449 
changing phenomena we can look at that a
couple<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:19.150> ways<00:03:19.299> too

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
couple of ways too

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.039 
couple of ways too
just<00:03:21.459> as<00:03:21.580> one<00:03:21.820> example<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.390> can<00:03:22.570> put<00:03:22.750> up<00:03:22.780> what<00:03:22.959> we

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
just as one example I can put up what we

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.770 
just as one example I can put up what we
call<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.260> spectrogram<00:03:24.040> a<00:03:24.600> spectrogram<00:03:25.600> is

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
call a spectrogram a spectrogram is

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.920 
call a spectrogram a spectrogram is
basically<00:03:26.549> taking<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.700> kind<00:03:28.330> of<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.480> results

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
basically taking the kind of the results

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.750 
basically taking the kind of the results
that<00:03:29.080> we're<00:03:29.230> getting<00:03:29.260> here<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:30.070> then<00:03:30.519> once

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
that we're getting here and then once

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.009 
that we're getting here and then once
you're<00:03:30.880> finished<00:03:31.000> viewing<00:03:31.540> them<00:03:31.690> kind<00:03:31.959> of

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
you're finished viewing them kind of

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.770 
you're finished viewing them kind of
folding<00:03:32.440> them<00:03:32.590> up<00:03:32.850> onto<00:03:33.850> this<00:03:33.970> display<00:03:34.480> here

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
folding them up onto this display here

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.330 
folding them up onto this display here
and<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.019> rolling<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:35.560> stuff<00:03:35.830> all<00:03:36.040> through

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
and then rolling that stuff all through

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.800 
and then rolling that stuff all through
so<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:37.180> vertical<00:03:37.480> axis<00:03:37.989> here<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.560> time<00:03:39.600> okay

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
so the vertical axis here is time okay

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.840 
so the vertical axis here is time okay
the<00:03:41.320> horizontal<00:03:41.860> axis<00:03:42.250> is<00:03:42.280> obviously<00:03:42.760> the

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
the horizontal axis is obviously the

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.430 
the horizontal axis is obviously the
same<00:03:43.060> as<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.329> spectrum<00:03:43.720> analyzer<00:03:43.840> but<00:03:44.200> now

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
same as the spectrum analyzer but now

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.920 
same as the spectrum analyzer but now
color<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:45.040> this<00:03:45.190> upper<00:03:45.489> display<00:03:45.940> is<00:03:46.209> amplitude

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
color in this upper display is amplitude

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.740 
color in this upper display is amplitude
so<00:03:47.829> it's<00:03:47.980> really<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.250> way<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.610> viewing<00:03:48.850> how<00:03:49.510> that

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
so it's really a way of viewing how that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.949 
so it's really a way of viewing how that
spectrum<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.350> changing<00:03:50.920> over<00:03:51.340> time<00:03:51.549> and<00:03:52.030> you

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
spectrum is changing over time and you

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.080 
spectrum is changing over time and you
can<00:03:53.079> see<00:03:53.290> when<00:03:53.530> I<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:53.980> between<00:03:54.340> my<00:03:54.489> voices<00:03:54.730> you

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
can see when I in between my voices you

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.930 
can see when I in between my voices you
can<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.420> activity<00:03:55.900> going<00:03:56.140> away<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.940> then

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
can see the activity going away and then

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.509 
can see the activity going away and then
as<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.360> speak<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.870> kind<00:03:59.110> of<00:03:59.140> see<00:03:59.519> essentially

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
as I speak and kind of see essentially

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.569 
as I speak and kind of see essentially
the<00:04:00.730> voice<00:04:00.910> print<00:04:01.299> if<00:04:01.480> you<00:04:01.510> will<00:04:01.780> of<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
the voice print if you will of of the

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.340 
the voice print if you will of of the
signals<00:04:04.269> kind<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.510> popping<00:04:04.870> up<00:04:04.959> and<00:04:05.170> going

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
signals kind of popping up and going

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.409 
signals kind of popping up and going
away<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:06.220> can<00:04:06.400> be<00:04:06.549> we<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:06.730> change<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.269> speed

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:07.419 
away this can be we can change the speed

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:09.569 
away this can be we can change the speed
of<00:04:07.810> how<00:04:07.930> fast<00:04:08.230> this<00:04:08.500> is<00:04:08.709> rolling<00:04:09.100> if<00:04:09.250> I<00:04:09.340> wanted

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
of how fast this is rolling if I wanted

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:10.190 
of how fast this is rolling if I wanted
to<00:04:09.669> roll

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
to roll

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800 
to roll
or<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.890> kind<00:04:11.010> of<00:04:11.130> get<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.310> better<00:04:11.730> view<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.150> kind

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
or to kind of get a better view of kind

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.280 
or to kind of get a better view of kind
of<00:04:12.900> the<00:04:12.959> long-term<00:04:14.150> variability<00:04:15.150> of<00:04:15.290> the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
of the long-term variability of the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.840 
of the long-term variability of the
vibration<00:04:17.100> or<00:04:17.280> whatever<00:04:17.489> that<00:04:17.609> we're<00:04:17.760> doing

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
vibration or whatever that we're doing

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.390 
vibration or whatever that we're doing
we<00:04:18.030> can<00:04:18.150> slow<00:04:18.359> this<00:04:18.510> way<00:04:18.720> down<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:20.100> really

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
we can slow this way down and I really

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.330 
we can slow this way down and I really
get<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.549> much<00:04:21.239> longer-term<00:04:21.750> view<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.889> can<00:04:23.070> speed

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
get a much longer-term view we can speed

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.580 
get a much longer-term view we can speed
this<00:04:23.520> up<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:24.030> get<00:04:24.419> a<00:04:24.450> much<00:04:24.630> shorter<00:04:24.900> term<00:04:25.260> view

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
this up and get a much shorter term view

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.080 
this up and get a much shorter term view
to<00:04:25.740> see<00:04:25.889> what's<00:04:26.070> going<00:04:26.280> on<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.550> could<00:04:26.760> speed<00:04:27.060> it

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
to see what's going on I could speed it

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.409 
to see what's going on I could speed it
up<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.450> go<00:04:27.540> really<00:04:27.840> fast<00:04:28.250> okay<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.790> kind<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.270> do

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
up and go really fast okay I kind of do

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.540 
up and go really fast okay I kind of do
it<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.840> know<00:04:30.900> live<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.380> real<00:04:31.560> time<00:04:31.800> we<00:04:32.430> could

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
it you know live in real time we could

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.180 
it you know live in real time we could
even<00:04:32.700> show<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.090> in<00:04:33.330> 3d<00:04:34.200> for<00:04:34.710> kind<00:04:34.860> of<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:35.010> neat

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
even show this in 3d for kind of a neat

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.680 
even show this in 3d for kind of a neat
effect<00:04:35.310> it's<00:04:36.060> kind<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.300> see<00:04:36.480> how<00:04:36.630> that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
effect it's kind of see how that

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.300 
effect it's kind of see how that
spectrum<00:04:37.230> is<00:04:37.320> kind<00:04:37.530> of<00:04:37.590> rolling<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.250> know

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
spectrum is kind of rolling you know

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.260 
spectrum is kind of rolling you know
over<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.030> time<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.669> so<00:04:41.669> this<00:04:41.790> is<00:04:41.910> just<00:04:42.030> one

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
over in time so so this is just one

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.390 
over in time so so this is just one
aspect<00:04:42.479> of<00:04:42.930> being<00:04:43.169> able<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.410> use<00:04:43.740> you<00:04:44.250> know<00:04:44.370> a

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
aspect of being able to use you know a

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.540 
aspect of being able to use you know a
real-time<00:04:45.210> analyzer<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:46.110> view<00:04:46.979> kind<00:04:47.370> of<00:04:47.460> the

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
real-time analyzer to view kind of the

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:48.950 
real-time analyzer to view kind of the
instantaneous<00:04:48.000> spectral<00:04:48.600> characteristics

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
instantaneous spectral characteristics

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.500 
instantaneous spectral characteristics
of<00:04:49.500> anything<00:04:50.070> from<00:04:50.340> microwave<00:04:50.760> signals<00:04:51.330> down

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
of anything from microwave signals down

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.469 
of anything from microwave signals down
to<00:04:51.570> even<00:04:52.169> in<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.530> case<00:04:52.770> very<00:04:53.610> low<00:04:53.910> frequency

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
to even in this case very low frequency

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.170 
to even in this case very low frequency
audio<00:04:55.169> and<00:04:55.440> even<00:04:55.650> sub<00:04:55.919> audio<00:04:56.250> types<00:04:57.030> of

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
audio and even sub audio types of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.550 
audio and even sub audio types of
signals<00:04:57.570> so<00:04:57.690> we<00:04:57.810> look<00:04:57.960> way<00:04:58.110> down<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.470> the

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
signals so we look way down to the

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.020 
signals so we look way down to the
bottom<00:04:58.710> corner<00:04:59.220> here<00:04:59.250> we're<00:04:59.550> going<00:04:59.700> down<00:04:59.850> to

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
bottom corner here we're going down to

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.350 
bottom corner here we're going down to
the<00:05:00.180> 1<00:05:00.570> Hertz<00:05:00.830> okay<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.880> it<00:05:03.000> gives<00:05:03.180> you<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
the 1 Hertz okay so it gives you the

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.300 
the 1 Hertz okay so it gives you the
ability<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:03.750> really<00:05:04.320> visualize<00:05:04.530> what's<00:05:05.220> going

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
ability to really visualize what's going

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.270 
ability to really visualize what's going
on<00:05:06.050> with<00:05:07.050> these<00:05:07.169> signals<00:05:07.620> in<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.800> way<00:05:07.950> that<00:05:08.160> be

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
on with these signals in a way that be

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.050 
on with these signals in a way that be
very<00:05:08.490> tough<00:05:08.729> to<00:05:08.760> see<00:05:09.060> with<00:05:09.600> other<00:05:09.780> tools
