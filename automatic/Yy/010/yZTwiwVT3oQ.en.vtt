00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
it's pretty much ripping off because I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
it's pretty much ripping off because I
grind<00:01:40.860> on<00:01:41.159> like<00:01:41.430> um<00:01:43.159> it's<00:01:44.159> called<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.790> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

guess<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.450> say<00:01:45.780> rough<00:01:46.049> surfaces<00:01:46.590> they're

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
guess you say rough surfaces they're

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.050 
guess you say rough surfaces they're
like<00:01:47.280> um<00:01:48.380> break<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.829> like<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.430> size<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.880> all

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
like um break and like the size just all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.050 
like um break and like the size just all
rough<00:01:51.619> so<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.649> pretty<00:01:52.890> much<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.369> tears

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
rough so I pretty much just like tears

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.230 
rough so I pretty much just like tears
this<00:01:54.270> right<00:01:54.630> off<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.820> makes<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.090> tighter

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
this right off and it makes it tighter

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.399 
this right off and it makes it tighter
look<00:01:57.540> horrible<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:59.420> just<00:02:00.420> letting<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.380> know

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
look horrible so just letting you know

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.170 
look horrible so just letting you know
that<00:02:01.530> so<00:02:02.070> if<00:02:02.310> you're<00:02:02.430> gonna<00:02:02.549> consider<00:02:02.939> buying

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that so if you're gonna consider buying

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.889 
that so if you're gonna consider buying
this<00:02:04.130> remember<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.280> if<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.490> grind<00:02:05.700> and<00:02:06.149> then

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
this remember that if you grind and then

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.260 
this remember that if you grind and then
um<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:08.179> think<00:02:09.179> that's<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:10.970> never<00:02:11.970> popped<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
um I think that's it never popped the

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.330 
um I think that's it never popped the
two<00:02:12.420> of<00:02:12.629> them<00:02:12.750> never

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
two of them never

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.390 
two of them never
do<00:02:13.580> with<00:02:13.730> any<00:02:13.910> fit<00:02:14.209> FAF<00:02:14.569> I've<00:02:14.720> had<00:02:15.400> that's
