is growing becoming like a free market

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:09.020 
is growing becoming like a free market

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
because I don't want to throw them away

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.600 
because I don't want to throw them away
but<00:00:09.240> this<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.719> exhibition<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:11.070> did<00:00:11.280> last

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
year where I built a sort of arch of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.260 
year where I built a sort of arch of
Triomphe<00:00:15.360> with<00:00:15.809> all<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.310> male<00:00:17.310> artwork<00:00:18.000> it

Triomphe with all this male artwork it

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.010 
Triomphe with all this male artwork it
was<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> sort<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.380> parody<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.369> McElveen<00:00:21.180> it

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
was a sort of parody of the McElveen it

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.519 
was a sort of parody of the McElveen it
was<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.470> 30<00:00:23.039> years<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.730> male<00:00:23.970> art

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
was like 30 years of male art

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.929 
was like 30 years of male art
commemoration<00:00:25.529> with<00:00:25.740> his<00:00:25.920> heart<00:00:26.279> which

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
commemoration with his heart which

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.230 
commemoration with his heart which
wasn't<00:00:27.390> built<00:00:27.750> like<00:00:28.619> kids<00:00:29.220> boxes<00:00:29.880> so<00:00:30.090> if

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
wasn't built like kids boxes so if

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.209 
wasn't built like kids boxes so if
somebody<00:00:30.990> would<00:00:31.230> bump<00:00:31.500> into<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.099> would

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
somebody would bump into it it would

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
somebody would bump into it it would
just<00:00:32.250> fall<00:00:32.610> down<00:00:32.669> because<00:00:33.300> they<00:00:33.450> were<00:00:33.480> just

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
just fall down because they were just

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.410 
just fall down because they were just
one<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.500> top<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.070> other<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.460> someone

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
one on top of the other and someone

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.510 
one on top of the other and someone
actually<00:00:36.600> did<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.440> opening<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.370> the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
actually did that the opening of the

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.470 
actually did that the opening of the
show<00:00:38.550> someone<00:00:39.390> bent<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.899> it<00:00:40.790> but<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> idea<00:00:42.239> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
show someone bent on it but the idea was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.139 
show someone bent on it but the idea was
that<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:43.230> could<00:00:43.739> happen<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> bit

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
that that could happen and it was a bit

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.500 
that that could happen and it was a bit
again<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.289> again<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:47.039> had<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.329> whole

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
again to put it up again I had the whole

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.350 
again to put it up again I had the whole
floor<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> room<00:00:49.410> where<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.739> made<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
floor of the room where I made this

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.470 
floor of the room where I made this
installation<00:00:51.980> covered<00:00:52.980> with<00:00:53.280> real<00:00:53.850> letters

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.319 
installation covered with real letters
and<00:00:55.140> envelopes<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.670> as<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:56.940> received

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
and envelopes and that's as I received

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.869 
and envelopes and that's as I received

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
thing business was not - it was just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.510 
thing business was not - it was just
strewn<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> floor<00:01:04.680> all<00:01:05.189> these<00:01:05.460> letters<00:01:06.299> I

received and on one side there's a and a
blown-up<00:01:52.270> page<00:01:53.270> of<00:01:53.569> stands<00:02:04.479> which<00:02:05.479> was<00:02:05.780> my

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189 
blown-up page of stands which was my

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
idea

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.509 
idea
that's<00:02:07.849> it<00:02:08.030> from<00:02:08.239> the<00:02:08.420> beginning<00:02:08.929> was<00:02:09.140> that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
that's it from the beginning was that

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.720 
that's it from the beginning was that
art<00:02:10.519> more<00:02:11.030> or<00:02:11.180> less<00:02:11.450> was<00:02:11.720> finished<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.620> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
art more or less was finished with the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.119 
art more or less was finished with the
Duchamp<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.940> all<00:02:14.090> the<00:02:14.269> rest<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.750> all<00:02:15.530> was<00:02:15.860> left

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
Duchamp and all the rest so all was left

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.610 
Duchamp and all the rest so all was left
to<00:02:16.250> do<00:02:16.519> is<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:17.000> play<00:02:17.209> or<00:02:17.480> together<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.349> fight

to do is to play or together just fight
and<00:02:18.890> I<00:02:19.430> may<00:02:19.940> not<00:02:20.440> because<00:02:21.440> it<00:02:21.590> becomes<00:02:21.950> more

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
and I may not because it becomes more

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.770 
and I may not because it becomes more
like<00:02:24.250> collaboration<00:02:25.250> sort<00:02:25.819> of<00:02:26.060> utopian

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
like collaboration sort of utopian

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.089

Network

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.580 

but<00:02:31.760> anytime<00:02:32.030> every<00:02:32.599> time<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.170> build<00:02:33.409> it

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
but anytime every time you can build it

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.250 
but anytime every time you can build it
a<00:02:33.859> little<00:02:34.370> different<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.629> just<00:02:35.810> play<00:02:36.079> with

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
would would have thrown it down and

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:58.599 
would would have thrown it down and
built<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.079> in<00:02:51.439> a<00:02:51.560> different<00:02:51.709> way<00:02:56.319> since<00:02:57.609> this

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
built it in a different way since this

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.670 
built it in a different way since this
is<00:02:58.790> another<00:02:59.090> series<00:02:59.750> for<00:03:00.290> her<00:03:00.439> and<00:03:01.310> show<00:03:01.579> that

show and part of this which is playing

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.830 
show and part of this which is playing
with<00:04:42.370> silhouette<00:04:42.940> which<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:45.000> somehow<00:04:46.000> linked

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
with silhouette which is somehow linked

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.469 
with silhouette which is somehow linked
to<00:04:47.139> Ray<00:04:47.680> Johnson<00:04:48.250> which<00:04:48.520> is<00:04:48.789> a<00:04:48.819> little<00:04:49.330> bit

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
to Ray Johnson which is a little bit

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.100 
to Ray Johnson which is a little bit
like<00:04:49.659> the<00:04:49.840> father<00:04:50.080> of<00:04:50.379> the<00:04:50.590> malar<00:04:51.159> the<00:04:51.430> idea

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
like the father of the malar the idea

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.800 
like the father of the malar the idea
that's<00:04:53.110> what<00:04:53.319> is<00:04:53.530> going<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.830> happen<00:04:54.039> anyway

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.460 

and<00:04:59.130> so<00:05:00.599> regions<00:05:01.599> who<00:05:01.720> used<00:05:01.900> to<00:05:02.020> do<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.199> lot<00:05:02.409> of

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
and so regions who used to do a lot of

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.950 
and so regions who used to do a lot of
works<00:05:02.830> based<00:05:03.190> on<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.580> silhouette<00:05:03.970> and<00:05:04.690> so

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
works based on the silhouette and so

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.290 
works based on the silhouette and so
what<00:05:05.199> I<00:05:05.229> plan<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.220> do<00:05:06.610> is<00:05:06.970> I<00:05:07.949> leave<00:05:08.949> one<00:05:09.220> wall<00:05:09.729> of

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
what I plan to do is I leave one wall of

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.499 
what I plan to do is I leave one wall of
this<00:05:10.539> gallery<00:05:10.900> wide<00:05:11.800> and<00:05:12.340> I've<00:05:12.819> just<00:05:13.090> had<00:05:13.330> a

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.439 
this gallery wide and I've just had a
light<00:05:13.719> pointing<00:05:14.500> on<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:14.979> and<00:05:15.310> at<00:05:15.789> the<00:05:15.969> opening

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
light pointing on it and at the opening

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:18.330 
light pointing on it and at the opening
I<00:05:16.630> take<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.110> silhouette<00:05:17.560> of<00:05:17.590> the<00:05:17.860> people

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
I take the silhouette of the people

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.879 
I take the silhouette of the people
who's<00:05:18.520> there<00:05:18.759> and<00:05:19.300> have<00:05:19.539> them<00:05:19.780> sign<00:05:20.080> and<00:05:20.560> then

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
who's there and have them sign and then

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:22.800 
who's there and have them sign and then
people<00:05:21.250> can<00:05:21.490> do<00:05:21.639> it<00:05:21.789> by<00:05:22.060> themselves<00:05:22.270> because

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
people can do it by themselves because

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:24.899 
people can do it by themselves because
it's<00:05:23.139> very<00:05:23.349> easy<00:05:23.590> if<00:05:23.830> you<00:05:23.979> have<00:05:24.009> a<00:05:24.129> strong

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
it's very easy if you have a strong

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.170 
it's very easy if you have a strong
light<00:05:25.180> and<00:05:25.599> what<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.500> see<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.919> shadow<00:05:27.789> and

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
light and what you see the shadow and

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.050 
light and what you see the shadow and
you<00:05:28.300> just<00:05:28.539> make<00:05:28.900> a<00:05:28.930> silhouette<00:05:29.380> so<00:05:29.830> I<00:05:30.060> like

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
you just make a silhouette so I like

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.439 
you just make a silhouette so I like
this<00:05:31.300> every<00:05:31.960> time<00:05:32.169> I<00:05:32.229> do<00:05:32.440> something<00:05:33.330> to<00:05:34.330> have

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270

I<00:06:10.810> mean<00:06:11.169> this<00:06:11.319> is<00:06:11.380> a<00:06:11.560> like<00:06:12.520> if<00:06:13.300> you<00:06:13.539> you<00:06:14.380> jump

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
I mean this is a like if you you jump

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:17.159 
I mean this is a like if you you jump
without<00:06:15.279> the<00:06:15.610> net<00:06:15.789> because<00:06:16.330> if<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.659> receive

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
without the net because if you receive

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:20.790 
without the net because if you receive
1,000<00:06:18.069> books<00:06:18.610> of<00:06:19.449> course<00:06:19.630> you<00:06:19.930> keep<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.590> books

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
1,000 books of course you keep the books

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.649 
1,000 books of course you keep the books
which<00:06:21.130> may<00:06:21.400> have<00:06:21.610> a<00:06:21.639> value<00:06:21.969> but<00:06:22.210> you<00:06:22.389> have<00:06:22.479> to

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
which may have a value but you have to

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.950 
which may have a value but you have to
make<00:06:22.979> 1,000<00:06:23.979> copies<00:06:24.190> of<00:06:24.490> a<00:06:24.580> catalog<00:06:25.150> and<00:06:25.360> send

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
make 1,000 copies of a catalog and send

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.890 
make 1,000 copies of a catalog and send
it<00:06:26.080> to<00:06:26.199> a<00:06:26.229> town<00:06:26.469> and<00:06:26.500> so<00:06:26.800> it<00:06:26.919> becomes

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
it to a town and so it becomes

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.030 
it to a town and so it becomes
it's<00:06:28.470> bad<00:06:28.710> so<00:06:29.430> I<00:06:29.460> just<00:06:29.639> took<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.210> risk<00:06:30.479> because

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
it's bad so I just took the risk because

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:34.430 
it's bad so I just took the risk because
I<00:06:32.040> know<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:32.790> was<00:06:33.150> late<00:06:33.389> when<00:06:33.750> I<00:06:33.840> sent<00:06:34.080> out<00:06:34.259> the

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
I know I was late when I sent out the

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.499 
I know I was late when I sent out the
invitation<00:06:35.100> was<00:06:35.250> only<00:06:35.639> two<00:06:35.910> months<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.479> the

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:36.509 
invitation was only two months to the

00:06:36.509 --> 00:06:40.010 
invitation was only two months to the
show<00:06:36.870> so<00:06:37.169> I<00:06:37.410> didn't<00:06:38.070> expect<00:06:38.550> that<00:06:38.850> many<00:06:39.600> I

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
show so I didn't expect that many I

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.460 
show so I didn't expect that many I
thought<00:06:40.620> maybe<00:06:40.919> 100<00:06:41.789> 115<00:06:42.780> that's<00:06:42.990> more<00:06:43.320> or

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470 
thought maybe 100 115 that's more or

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.550 
thought maybe 100 115 that's more or
less<00:06:43.500> what<00:06:43.830> I'm<00:06:44.070> getting<00:06:44.930> but<00:06:45.930> it<00:06:46.110> could<00:06:46.350> have

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
less what I'm getting but it could have

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.850 
less what I'm getting but it could have
gone<00:06:46.889> without<00:06:47.280> control<00:06:48.060> because<00:06:48.509> if<00:06:49.350> people

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
gone without control because if people

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.480 
gone without control because if people
would<00:06:50.100> just<00:06:50.780> from<00:06:51.780> one<00:06:52.050> website<00:06:52.620> to<00:06:53.160> the<00:06:53.310> other

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490 
would just from one website to the other

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.590 
would just from one website to the other
and<00:06:53.880> then<00:06:54.120> if<00:06:54.360> I<00:06:54.539> get<00:06:55.350> maybe<00:06:55.889> 500<00:06:56.789> words<00:06:57.300> I

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:57.600 
and then if I get maybe 500 words I

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.930 
and then if I get maybe 500 words I
would<00:06:57.660> have<00:06:57.960> a<00:06:58.229> lot<00:06:58.410> of<00:06:58.590> problem<00:06:58.979> to<00:06:59.250> put<00:06:59.699> them

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
would have a lot of problem to put them

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.830 
would have a lot of problem to put them
in<00:07:00.150> one<00:07:00.389> room<00:07:00.449> and<00:07:00.960> so<00:07:01.919> I<00:07:02.190> like<00:07:02.460> the<00:07:02.840> risk

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
in one room and so I like the risk

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:08.539 
in one room and so I like the risk
involved<00:07:04.650> in<00:07:05.400> doing<00:07:05.580> these<00:07:05.970> sort<00:07:06.210> of<00:07:06.330> things
