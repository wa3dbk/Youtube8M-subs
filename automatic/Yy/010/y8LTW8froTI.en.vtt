it always sends me into the wall and the

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.030 
it always sends me into the wall and the
first<00:04:11.450> corner<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:11.840> just<00:04:12.049> as<00:04:12.200> bad<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.650> every

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
first corner is just as bad and every

first corner is just as bad and every
caller<00:04:13.280> just<00:04:13.519> sends<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:13.970> haywire<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.630> while

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
caller just sends you haywire and while

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:16.330 
caller just sends you haywire and while
I've<00:04:15.200> been<00:04:15.230> chatting<00:04:15.590> gibberish<00:04:16.220> I've

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
I've been chatting gibberish I've

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.500

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:20.800 
opportunity to overtake the tour also
and<00:04:19.310> it's<00:04:19.580> looking<00:04:19.729> like<00:04:19.850> p6<00:04:20.390> is<00:04:20.510> going<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.720> be

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
and it's looking like p6 is going to be

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.270

the finishing position here I've taken

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.940 
the finishing position here I've taken
that<00:04:22.460> last<00:04:22.610> corner<00:04:23.210> fantastically<00:04:24.200> well<00:04:24.380> even

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
that last corner fantastically well even

is not bad at all
and<00:04:33.260> that<00:04:33.530> was<00:04:33.650> a<00:04:33.680> fairly<00:04:34.010> carnage<00:04:34.580> race<00:04:34.790> on

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970

Monaco I'm just gonna go and have a cup
of<00:04:36.500> tea<00:04:36.560> because<00:04:36.920> my<00:04:37.070> throat's<00:04:37.370> a<00:04:38.180> bit<00:04:38.570> sore

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
of tea because my throat's a bit sore

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.740 
of tea because my throat's a bit sore
but<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:39.560> will<00:04:40.010> gloss<00:04:40.310> over<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.790> and<00:04:41.030> I<00:04:41.600> hope

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
but that will gloss over that and I hope

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.150 
but that will gloss over that and I hope
