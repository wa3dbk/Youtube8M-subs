gloves and of course my lab coat and now
I'm<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> work<00:00:39.360> out<00:00:39.629> how<00:00:39.840> much<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.170> each

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
I'm going to work out how much of each

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.830 
I'm going to work out how much of each
solution<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.890> need<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.340> make<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> stage<00:00:43.739> 1

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
solution I need to make this so stage 1

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:55.220 
solution I need to make this so stage 1
the<00:00:45.840> ratio<00:00:46.579> ethanol<00:00:49.190> to<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:53.510> if<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.750> 70

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
the ratio ethanol to water if it's 70

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.979 
the ratio ethanol to water if it's 70
percent<00:00:55.260> ethanol<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.910> means<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
percent ethanol that means that there is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.740 
percent ethanol that means that there is
30<00:00:58.559> percent<00:00:58.890> water<00:00:59.670> as<00:01:00.390> 30<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.500> 70<00:01:01.920> equals<00:01:02.219> 100

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
30 percent water as 30 and 70 equals 100

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.740 
30 percent water as 30 and 70 equals 100
so<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.899> ratio<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.409> 70<00:01:05.420> to<00:01:06.420> 30<00:01:06.979> in<00:01:07.979> other<00:01:08.130> words

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
so the ratio is 70 to 30 in other words

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.240 
so the ratio is 70 to 30 in other words
7<00:01:09.750> parts<00:01:10.520> of<00:01:11.520> alcohol<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:13.560> 3<00:01:14.369> parts<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:15.080> water

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
7 parts of alcohol to 3 parts of water

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
7 parts of alcohol to 3 parts of water
because<00:01:17.479> 7<00:01:18.479> plus<00:01:18.720> 3<00:01:18.960> equals<00:01:19.380> 10<00:01:20.180> but<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.479> want

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
because 7 plus 3 equals 10 but we want

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.850 
because 7 plus 3 equals 10 but we want
500<00:01:22.770> milliliters<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.700> total<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.930> stage<00:01:25.229> 2<00:01:26.330> 500

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
500 milliliters in total so stage 2 500

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:35.569 
500 milliliters in total so stage 2 500
milliliters<00:01:29.329> total<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> by<00:01:34.049> applying<00:01:34.579> the

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
milliliters total so by applying the

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:42.999 
milliliters total so by applying the
ratio<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.240> 500<00:01:36.960> we<00:01:37.290> obtain<00:01:37.820> 7<00:01:38.820> over<00:01:39.780> 10<00:01:39.990> by<00:01:41.360> 500

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
ratio to 500 we obtain 7 over 10 by 500

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.380 
ratio to 500 we obtain 7 over 10 by 500
is<00:01:44.009> alcohol

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:58.900 

equals<00:01:50.870> 350<00:01:51.870> milliliters<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:55.370> 3<00:01:56.370> over<00:01:56.720> 10<00:01:57.720> by

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
equals 350 milliliters and 3 over 10 by

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.740 
equals 350 milliliters and 3 over 10 by
500<00:02:00.020> is<00:02:01.020> water<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.560> equals<00:02:05.420> 150<00:02:06.420> milliliters

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
500 is water and equals 150 milliliters

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
500 is water and equals 150 milliliters
so<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.869> now<00:02:09.990> have<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> 350<00:02:11.220> mils<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.520> alcohol

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
so we now have a 350 mils of alcohol

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.500 
so we now have a 350 mils of alcohol
plus<00:02:12.750> our<00:02:12.930> 150<00:02:13.560> mils<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.860> water<00:02:14.060> which<00:02:15.060> equals

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
plus our 150 mils of water which equals

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.370 
plus our 150 mils of water which equals
five<00:02:16.290> hundred<00:02:16.650> mils

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
five hundred mils

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.930 
five hundred mils
so<00:02:19.380> let's<00:02:19.530> go<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.739> make<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:20.010> up<00:02:20.070> now<00:02:20.280> because

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
so let's go and make it up now because

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.060 
so let's go and make it up now because
we're<00:02:21.270> handling<00:02:21.540> alcohol<00:02:22.020> I<00:02:22.230> need<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.830> put<00:02:22.950> my

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
we're handling alcohol I need to put my

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.780 
we're handling alcohol I need to put my
gloves<00:02:23.280> on<00:02:24.739> yeah<00:02:29.030> one<00:02:30.030> last<00:02:30.180> recommendation

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
gloves on yeah one last recommendation

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.100 
gloves on yeah one last recommendation
because<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.910> scale<00:02:33.209> of<00:02:33.330> these<00:02:33.450> cylinders<00:02:33.870> is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
because the scale of these cylinders is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.900 
because the scale of these cylinders is
fairly<00:02:34.410> imprecise<00:02:34.920> at<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.130> very<00:02:35.310> bottom<00:02:35.700> we

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
fairly imprecise at the very bottom we

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.210 
fairly imprecise at the very bottom we
need<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> pour<00:02:36.690> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.230> larger<00:02:37.620> volumes<00:02:37.950> first

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
need to pour in the larger volumes first

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:52.270 
need to pour in the larger volumes first
in<00:02:39.209> this<00:02:39.360> case<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:40.410> our<00:02:40.620> alcohol

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:06.730 

I<00:03:02.950> put<00:03:03.950> my<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.130> at<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.970> level<00:03:05.270> of<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.600> 350<00:03:06.560> mils

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
I put my I at the level of the 350 mils

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.880 
I put my I at the level of the 350 mils
I<00:03:08.739> pour<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:10.130> alcohol<00:03:10.930> until<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.410> bottom<00:03:12.739> of

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
I pour the alcohol until the bottom of

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:24.220 
I pour the alcohol until the bottom of
the<00:03:13.010> meniscus<00:03:13.840> touches<00:03:14.840> the<00:03:15.410> line<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.989> now<00:03:24.110> I'm

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
the meniscus touches the line so now I'm

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.290 
the meniscus touches the line so now I'm
going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.470> complete<00:03:24.860> up<00:03:25.400> to<00:03:25.640> the<00:03:25.700> 500<00:03:26.120> meals

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
going to complete up to the 500 meals

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:45.950 
going to complete up to the 500 meals
with<00:03:27.050> water

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:55.260 

okay<00:03:47.200> slice<00:03:53.640> so<00:03:54.640> now<00:03:54.760> I'm<00:03:54.820> going<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.030> put<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
okay slice so now I'm going to put the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:03.630 
okay slice so now I'm going to put the
phone<00:03:55.390> on<00:03:55.450> my<00:03:56.100> 70%<00:03:57.720> bottle<00:03:58.720> of<00:03:58.840> alcohol<00:04:02.640> and

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
phone on my 70% bottle of alcohol and

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:14.830 
phone on my 70% bottle of alcohol and
pour<00:04:04.630> my<00:04:04.810> liquid<00:04:05.140> in

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.460 

and<00:04:15.840> that's<00:04:16.500> it<00:04:17.060> we<00:04:18.060> just<00:04:18.210> made<00:04:18.450> our<00:04:18.690> 500<00:04:19.290> meals

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
and that's it we just made our 500 meals

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:39.439 
and that's it we just made our 500 meals
of<00:04:19.880> 70%<00:04:20.880> alcohol

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.509 

you
