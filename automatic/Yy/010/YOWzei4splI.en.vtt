00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 now he talks to andres for the doctor 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.190
 Ten and today I bring you the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 unboxing and review of hearing aids 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.380
 I have here are 2000 if and where they see 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.330
 are the headphones and nerd and the funny thing about 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.099
 these hearing aids that are made of 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.500
 wood part of the hearing aids have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.330
 wood and good are very curious this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.890
 Special model has a microphone 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 then we can use it with our 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.600
 iphone ipod touch or with any 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.369
 Android phone or any smartphone 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.680
 so good if your cell phone has a 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 3.5 mm input that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.279
 they would work like a hands-free 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.540
 great so let's open these 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.850
 hearing aids and let's see what's inside 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.540
 from the box ok so we're just going 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.470
 to cut through the back the 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.230
 sticker that brings and we will see how it is 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.390
 that opens this 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.880
 ok then let's see what's inside 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.309
 of the box simply comes its case 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.320
 the wta that looks pretty elegant this 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.030
 case in black and the print on 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.980
 golden color and good here they will be able 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.020
 logically load their children so they do not 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.629
 they are mistreated they do not get into dust anything 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.420
 of that that has its closure here and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.650
 Well, you will know what is coming 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.690
 in 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.330
 ok the first thing we're going to find 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 this side here are the sponges that 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.440
 are to fit your size of 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.990
 ear then good we 'll leave it 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.380
 here to the side then here we go to 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 find and a small one as of 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.060
 force it on the keychain and I do not know how to 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.130
 they are called these but good that in this 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.320
 kind of keychains do not come to be 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.240
 use I was going to tell you and finally 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.410
 have the hearing aids as such 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 how are we going to focus on the 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.580
 hearing aids ok here I have the hearing aids 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.220
 as in the part here is the one that is 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.490
 wood actually give it a look 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.130
 very father and here we have the logo of the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.080
 brand mix and good here we can 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.380
 change depending what you 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.420
 want for your ear size 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.969
 you can reach to see a little the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.649
 headset speaker and good here 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.930
 is the microphone then good as 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.100
 I told them what they can use as hands 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.200
 free without problems I would have liked 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.119
 more that I had controls here 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.819
 volume is to say that you can upload or 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.060
 lower the volume directly and good 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.500
 this cable is not a normal cable yes 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.019
 Well now you are going to see more 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 detail but it's as if it were fabric and 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:18.750
 here at the bottom it becomes more 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.660
 width 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.130
 after the microphone then good the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.690
 true that it is not going to be a knot with 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.540
 these hearing aids I think by the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.599
 cable material and here at the end in the 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.010
 3.5 mm input the curious thing about 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.530
 this entry is that I put as 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.989
 used in all hearing aids and 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.390
 high-end this was bathing and this is 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.280
 the case then when this is bathed 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.560
 in gold then we will have very good 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.049
 audio quality and something very father this 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
 entrance is that it's pretty thin this 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.220
 then you would have no problem putting it 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.019
 with no sleeve on your device that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.090
 I'm on my ipod and how he came into the 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.280
 perfection will be able to turn any 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.380
 thing will work very well and not 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.940
 it is only compatible with ipad 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.250
 and it will be compatible with any 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 device that has an input of 3.5 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.390
 millimeters and in any case they are going to 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.160
 be able to use the microphone so that 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.200
 these hearing aids become hands 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.450
 free good I tried these hearing aids and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.130
 the truth is that the volume is good if 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.380
 listen loudly but logically that's not 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.450
 the important thing about hearing aids and good 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.400
 not the most important thing the most important 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.260
 is that we are listening to the bass everything 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.420
 that and the truth that audio quality 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.190
 I'm not an audio expert but I know 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 listen well enough you hear a lot 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.530
 better than any common hearing aid 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.060
 let's say apolo classics be bots 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.860
 so good if I recommend them 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.780
 true and so I highly recommend it not 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.130
 I've tried it logically enough 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.140
 but from what I just approved 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.300
 they definitely look like they are not 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.370
 common hearing aids you see that they are 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.130
 Hearing aids of very good brand with others 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.800

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.750
 dollars on the official page of this 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.880
 brand and you can also find it in 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.870
 some other online store but not me 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.030
 I recommend that you buy it directly 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.550
 with them they ship to the whole world 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.200
 it's pretty economical then, wench

 case to carry it anywhere 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:18.269
 It's not so big I would put it in my 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.680
