 we are going to present you beetle 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.160
 arbitrators is a ultimate version but 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.820
 well what's up with this in this one came out 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.980
 three versions in the comics but they were 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 five characters who have interpreted it 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 the first one came out in the extreme 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 'such number 123 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.170
 and only this one lasted a couple of years too 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 of the image the next one was in thunder 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.579
 balls number 1 April 1997 and after 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.309
 in the same thunder bos number 35 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.960
 February 2000 are looking at the design 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 that came out that has been one of the most 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.359
 characteristic and lately and good 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.559
 lately the ultimate spider-man 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.640
 although we know that it is not the same 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 line 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.100
 the normal continuity of spider-man 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.760
 number 124 are seeing it and good is 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 this now when I buy it I thought not 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.420
 I'll tell you what we say is a version 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.790
 of the normal comics and even what 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.619
 I got to confuse with this but not anymore 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.320
 exposed applied with a neuronal 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.380
 irma hernández I remembered the successes of 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.520
 the ultimate good version but that's how it is 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.409
 that the purchase I think I do not know how to use the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.500
 I like the character but how is it ultimate 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.330
 because it is not discussed last previously 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.399
 I like the versions of the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.140
 comics and it's good 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.330
 I'm going to like what I'm going to put there 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.070
 see how it looks being that I can 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 modify possibly lose me 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.090
 I do not know and will encourage well let's get her in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 yes the figure 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.890
 it's something father look i have two feet 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.740
 well this time the other foot I want it 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.800
 customize I want to do something something father 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.990
 I do not know what looks good in my conditions 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.430
 or with some other character I want 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.010
 try and start the custom hoist 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.200
 as I'm having time and good 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.880
 look at this is the character and once 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.010
 taking advantage of let's see the movements 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.880
 good to be once it is placed 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.310
 back here 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.160
 look at the movement upwards and towards 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.350
 down backwards this does not allow 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.540
 these points here I did not remember and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.880
 it has 360 degrees here but it has a 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.220
 good movement the material is a bit 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.690
 hard rigid like those of ironman I do not know 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.740
 how a little further not 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.930
 it feels weird 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.150
 two points of articulation in what they are 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.970
 the elbows in the hand back and towards 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.250
 go ahead and turn the 360 ​​degrees in the 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.020
 head the 360 ​​degrees up 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.650
 perfect that's going to help him look 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:52.020
 that is flying very very well in the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.470
 chest back not much forward 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 already saw that yes and that's great in the 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.690
 waist 360 degrees the positions of the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.750
 good hands and Czech feet 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
 until here it comes forward very well 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.560
 back good can be done 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.959
 putting a little more aside than the turn 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.670
 further back 360 degrees in this part 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.680
 from here a comedian fell 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.690
 Believe and ready two points 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.060
 articulation in the knees in the feet 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.800
 sideways very very well towards 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.360
 forward it reaches here and back 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.750
 look, there 's the help that possibly 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.430
 it will be that it is flying and here it is 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.890
 excellent and moving is good would be 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.750
 everything we are going to see now what are the 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.440
 characteristics of this 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.600
 aura and good color is a kind of 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.400
 material that if we are not careful is going 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.400
 to wear out is going to get rid of and it's going to 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 see horrible indeed moving it feel 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.060
 that I will be left with material in the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.310
 fingers but it has not stopped but 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.239
 if I feel that this is going to happen in the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.910
 face 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.670
 I like it if it's very well characterized 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.040
 the character in the face in everything in everything 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:58.769
 all the modeling is very well I like them 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.470
 those antennas and you could say that 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.390
 good shape red is a neutral color 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.790
 does not have any kind of shadows like in 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.459
 the gray neither the yellow color in the 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:11.130
 good eyes is a neutral color could not 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.170
 speaking badly is more about him the modeling is 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.840
 father also the same here in the suit 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.599
 I will father your balls the kind of 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.579
 metallic modeling 

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:23.460
 just like you see in the body a suit 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:26.190
 metallic is very good balls 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.590
 it was a weird design here because its 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:31.949
 shooting is not competing with 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.979
 yellow hands look at the position no 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:37.560
 is grabbing nothing to hold it but 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.360
 well here is the character equal to 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.789
 model of the feet is very father this 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.729
 type of modeling very very well what I 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.150
 he liked very much the pieces and large 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:51.150
 with this type of modeling with two fingers 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.889
 and you could say they do not talk about 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.380
 you would get it, not what 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.699
 would get if they liked it they did not like it anymore 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.190
 they saw the model from the back 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:00.599
 all lines is very father I can not 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.139
 say that they did not want him and 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.749
 they wanted 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.509
 in what are your rooms is a kind of 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:10.270
 biography on this side and you reach 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:12.340
 see so they did not apply it wrong when 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.930
 less with a yellow background 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.539
 phosphorescent if you could say with a 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.789
 phosphorescent green in chasm although not 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.999
 go so phosphorescent but good look at 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.069
 this back of those wings I do not know here 

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:27.460
 you see that you drop a bit of the 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:29.469
 silver paint no of 7 what is going to 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.840
 happen is then look is placed here 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:34.900
 and it's everything changes a lot and maximum the 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.969
 character in this way in positions 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.069
 possibly if you have a lot to 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.229
 position and look can be done from a 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.569
 side to make it firm is 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.719
 something good I feel it will not cost me 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.449
 so much I can do it so be 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:51.250
 flying or you're looking up 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.479
 It is very good your my trainer more 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.360
 not for the figure 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:57.879
 look 20 that photo head if it is 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.889
 so great very very well very well 

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:01.689
 figure I will compare it with others know 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.909
 which one I have the hand in here is look 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:06.610
 boomerang juanes clear right of this 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.289
 almost the same size do not look is more 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.629
 I already saw it 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:14.430
 more for the antennas but itself by the 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:17.409
 same body is a little bit there is 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.059
 doubled term they're pretty much what 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:21.550
 we compared with veil that according to was the most 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:24.159
 High will look and take it there if I win 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:26.199
 speak they beat up to the head nothing more and 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:29.279
 let's see with superior superior look 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.279
 we go with another 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.259
 is smaller but good is a 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.720
 multimedia version so that's what 

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:40.639
 I leave to your consideration if 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.580
 they want to get if they do not want it 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.870
 get good that 's up to you for 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.400
 meego be happy that in a way 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.830
 I do not have logic the last versions 

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.800
 how to put the board that's something that 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.650
 it bothered me so it's that good again 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.539

 we are seeing there are two up and 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.069
 down the cycles 360 degrees towards 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:13.129
 back until removed for forward 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:15.889
 rotate your arm 360 degrees 2 points 

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:20.259
 articulation in the elbow your hand also 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.259
 we just rotate 360 ​​degrees forward
