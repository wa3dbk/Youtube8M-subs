00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.310
 With 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.399
 he 

00:00:11.399 --> 00:00:13.149
 times 

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:15.690
 having a beauty contest has cancer 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.130
 a diagnosis which also calculated for his potency was said 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.690
 He therefore rejected the operations recommended by his family doctor 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.599
 a lot of worries 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:27.419
 the radical Oppostion is the cheapest 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.960
 then as expect 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.319
 and nothing happens anymore 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.499
 mourns the whole ca after even organ game Kentzler 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.820
 too complicated and that is actually the reason why I punish Merkel Globes 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.310
 "I was at 17 this year to 4 percent that 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.340
 is a sprint of a certain source you work but it is even fuller 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.410
 Sirte WS also wants to be 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.160
 next to Hens beauty was allowed to decide because he is with exactly 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.710
 the participation criteria of the current efficacy study on nano-therapy 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.929
 and that's how nano-particles look like 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.339
 if you mix them together billions of times 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.530
 they are made of iron oxide which makes the liquid to brew and leaves the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.030
 Particles react magnetically 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.330
 every single particle of the fluid has a huge specially coated one 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.230
 surface 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.380
 And yet it is 1000 times smaller than a red blood cell 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.380
 That is why nanoparticles can pass over antimony system in large quantities 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.250
 Tumor cells are introduced 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.250
 and manipulating them from the inside out there 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 as by the nanoparticles we have the opportunity for the first time 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.780
 to direct the heat directly to the tumor cells and to preserve the normal 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 that is something completely new 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.160
 The nanoparticles were developed by Merck Forst as a spin-off 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.480
 the boss Niki 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.020
 as well as the devices that the magnetic alternating field for heating 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.440
 generate the particles 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.090
 This field does not cause any side effects in normal healthy 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 tissue 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.840
 Tugging says that only because of where it hits the nano-particles 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.700
 little in the tumor itself 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.730
 or as here experimentally in coin 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.290
 as long as the tumor is not completely destroyed as long as the body builds 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.290
 not even the nano-particles 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.280
 That's a plus for a threader 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.370
 As one says today what no therapy percent can offer all of us 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.450
 Radiation therapy has its dose limits the same as Immo therapy 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.360
 even an operation can not be repeated arbitrarily but here we have 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.820
 always a treatment option that can be repeated as often as you like 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:37.809
 leaves 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.840
 Depending on the severity of the cancer, the Nano Therapy may be single 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.010
 or in combination with another therapy to be applied to the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.290
 Patients from the current prostate study for example with 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:57.310
 made of radioactive iodine 125 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.310
 and, if present, are implanted directly into the tumor 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.149
 No 14 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.149
 There they give to their radiation gradually 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.799
 They have to be set to millimeter accuracy so they really just hit the tumor 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.879
 and do not attack the urethra or the rectum 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.080
 therefore after a choir the kinds system is planned 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.770
 transferred directly to the tumor via a matrix applied to the patient 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.360
 so the urologist can position the needle perfectly with the pulls 

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:31.670
 he just came in for control 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.959
 Ramholt quickly finds Europe in the right place 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.049
 and g here they see exactly the same letters and numbers there is and 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:43.419
 Illuminating reflex right there is the NADA here we see very bright spot 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:44.449
 there 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.309
 according to the same planning system as the seats 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:51.159
 Subsequently, the nano-fluid is introduced into the tumor 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.099
 to lead 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.589
 gradually provided again 

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:00.589
 Norbert Böhnke and would be able to live 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.349
 unlike the delicate ones the nano particles alone 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:09.030
 no effect on the body either 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.200
 when later on, together with the tent, wreckage of the tumor on natural 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.180
 Pathways are transported via the liver and they do not quite 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.000
 be placed so precisely the main thing the fluid with homogeneously distributed so that the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.110
 Tumor can also be heated accordingly evenly later 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.740
 Just a few days after the procedure Wilhelm Schönheit got his first 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.020
 heat treatment 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.270
 The physicist can check at any time via a probe 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.430
 Whether the right temperature in the tumor prevails during prostate treatment 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 That's a maximum of 42 degrees Celsius 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.060
 only once a week and a total of only six times should patients should 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.909
 on a daily basis instead of five weeks as in the classic one 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:55.240
 Irradiation, too, is one reason 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.789
 Why does Wilhelm Schönheit accept the study on nano-Terra PETA? 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.800
 so he can despite his illness throughout his hobby and thus 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.229
 give in to his original profession as a civil engineer 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.150
 he only has urination after the first six weeks of treatment 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.520
 but sometimes problems 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.990
 lie with it 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.999
 Percent pronounced 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:19.219
 and the word 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.389
 even more beautiful the protein 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.930
 and below 2 0 percent "That's already been the case with the Academy 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.020

 at the acts exists 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.020
 because of his positive attitude he had the strength because of beauty 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.630
 independently to search for gentle treatment options 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.740
 his quality of life ensures patients who are like him for the 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.690
