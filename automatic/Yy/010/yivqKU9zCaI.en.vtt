down to a 220 grit surface we

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.410 
down to a 220 grit surface we
disassembled<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.280> whole<00:00:14.400> car<00:00:14.639> because<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.269> no

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
disassembled the whole car because we no

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.240 
disassembled the whole car because we no
longer<00:00:15.450> needed<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.139> body<00:00:16.320> panels<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.220> be

longer needed the body panels to be
lined<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> next<00:00:18.510> phase<00:00:18.960> which<00:00:19.260> was

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
lined up for the next phase which was

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.580 
lined up for the next phase which was
primer<00:00:20.180> then<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.300> went<00:00:21.480> ahead<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.660> mask<00:00:22.080> being

primer then we went ahead a mask being
chevelles<00:00:22.949> body<00:00:23.449> for<00:00:24.449> primers<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.199> we

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
chevelles body for primers so that we

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.140 
chevelles body for primers so that we
wouldn't<00:00:25.470> get<00:00:25.650> overspray<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.849> bottom

the<00:00:40.170> previous<00:00:40.559> surface<00:00:41.010> John<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:42.090> blew<00:00:42.360> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the previous surface John first blew the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.840 
the previous surface John first blew the
car<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.649> wiped<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.100> down<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.670> an

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
car out and then wiped it down with an

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.790 
car out and then wiped it down with an
appropriate<00:00:45.390> wax<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.899> grease<00:00:45.930> remover<00:00:46.200> and

appropriate wax and grease remover and

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
appropriate wax and grease remover and
then<00:00:47.280> just<00:00:47.520> before<00:00:47.670> spray<00:00:48.090> time<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.629> was<00:00:48.750> wiped

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
then just before spray time it was wiped

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.110 
then just before spray time it was wiped
down<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> tack<00:00:49.559> rag<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.460> minimize<00:00:50.850> any

down with a tack rag to minimize any

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.260 
down with a tack rag to minimize any
dust<00:00:51.920> then<00:00:52.920> John<00:00:53.219> mixed<00:00:53.550> up<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.789> batch<00:00:53.820> of

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
dust then John mixed up a batch of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.500 
dust then John mixed up a batch of
DuPont<00:00:54.719> hot<00:00:54.960> prime<00:00:55.320> primer<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:57.090> time<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
DuPont hot prime primer and this time it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
DuPont hot prime primer and this time it
was<00:00:57.660> reduced<00:00:57.989> with<00:00:58.500> its<00:00:58.910> appropriate<00:00:59.910> amount

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
was reduced with its appropriate amount

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.229 
was reduced with its appropriate amount
of<00:01:00.510> reducer<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> activator<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
of reducer and activator and when you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.820 
of reducer and activator and when you
pour<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.570> hot<00:01:03.600> prime<00:01:04.019> right<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> can

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
pour the hot prime right out of the can

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.039 
pour the hot prime right out of the can
it<00:01:05.070> comes<00:01:05.250> up<00:01:05.430> pretty<00:01:05.580> thick<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.659> once<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
it comes up pretty thick but once you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.570 
it comes up pretty thick but once you
start<00:01:07.320> cutting<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.100> reducer

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
start cutting it down with the reducer

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.760 
start cutting it down with the reducer
in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.729> activator<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:10.140> actually<00:01:10.500> becomes

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
in the activator it actually becomes

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.510 
in the activator it actually becomes
pretty<00:01:11.460> thin<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> sprays<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.720> nice

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
pretty thin and it sprays really nice

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.740 
pretty thin and it sprays really nice
for<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.640> task<00:01:14.880> John<00:01:15.420> used<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.020> sada<00:01:16.610> KLC

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
to spray primers and other materials

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.490 
to spray primers and other materials
that<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.330> little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:24.869> heavier<00:01:25.170> with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that are a little bit heavier with

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
that are a little bit heavier with
bigger<00:01:25.680> particles<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.180> does<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.420> good<00:01:27.540> job

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
bigger particles and it does a good job

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.200 
bigger particles and it does a good job
of<00:01:27.860> atomizing<00:01:28.860> those<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> nice<00:01:29.850> pattern

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
of atomizing those into a nice pattern

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080 
of atomizing those into a nice pattern
so<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.990> spray<00:01:31.320> out<00:01:31.500> smoothly<00:01:32.090> without

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
so they spray out smoothly without

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.859 
so they spray out smoothly without
wasting<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.720> lot<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.990> material<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.439> overspray
