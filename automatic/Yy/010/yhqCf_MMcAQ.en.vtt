00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
will stop working that in the fact that

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.609 
will stop working that in the fact that
it<00:01:37.979> is<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.549> 12<00:01:38.939> odd<00:01:39.150> years<00:01:39.420> old<00:01:39.689> here<00:01:39.990> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
it is you know 12 odd years old here so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
it is you know 12 odd years old here so
what<00:01:40.950> we've<00:01:41.100> done<00:01:41.280> is<00:01:41.490> we're<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
what we've done is we're going to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.539 
what we've done is we're going to
replace<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.479> black<00:01:42.689> line<00:01:42.960> with<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
replace all the black line with a the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.310 
replace all the black line with a the
grey<00:01:44.729> line<00:01:44.970> with<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.299> new<00:01:45.479> black<00:01:45.780> line<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.229> we

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
grey line with a new black line so we

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
grey line with a new black line so we
have<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.770> okay

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
have that here okay

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.580 
have that here okay
the<00:01:49.399> jet<00:01:50.399> ski<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.909> has<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.720> valve<00:01:52.380> assembly

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the jet ski also has a valve assembly

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.359 
the jet ski also has a valve assembly
and<00:01:53.220> we<00:01:54.030> noticed<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.450> was<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:55.649> fact<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.100> broke

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and we noticed this was in fact it broke

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.950 
and we noticed this was in fact it broke
just<00:01:56.729> turning<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.420> while<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> were<00:01:57.840> doing

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
just turning it on while we were doing

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.170 
just turning it on while we were doing
some<00:01:58.079> troubleshooting<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.850> that's<00:02:00.000> going

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
some troubleshooting and so that's going

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.459 
some troubleshooting and so that's going
to<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.360> replaced<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.020> just<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.259> knob<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
to be replaced it's just a knob that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.649 
to be replaced it's just a knob that
sits<00:02:01.890> on<00:02:02.009> top<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.549> gas<00:02:02.759> lines<00:02:03.030> run<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> it

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
sits on top and the gas lines run to it

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.889 
sits on top and the gas lines run to it
and<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.259> an<00:02:04.380> on/off<00:02:05.030> situation<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.810> are

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
and it's an on/off situation so we are

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.029 
and it's an on/off situation so we are
going<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> replace<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.819> $17

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
going to replace that $17

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.970 
going to replace that $17
by<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.310> way<00:02:09.519> and<00:02:09.969> then<00:02:10.420> we<00:02:10.509> have<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:10.810> two<00:02:10.989> card

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
by the way and then we have the two card

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.119 
by the way and then we have the two card
kits<00:02:12.280> in<00:02:12.610> this<00:02:13.269> in<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:14.109> arrangement<00:02:14.439> there

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
kits in this in this arrangement there

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.240 
kits in this in this arrangement there
are<00:02:15.250> only<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.959> addition<00:02:17.439> to<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:19.109> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
are only two and in addition to that the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.000 
are only two and in addition to that the
they<00:02:21.250> are<00:02:21.370> not<00:02:21.549> it's<00:02:22.150> an<00:02:22.299> asymmetrical

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
they are not it's an asymmetrical

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.839 
they are not it's an asymmetrical
situation<00:02:24.010> if<00:02:24.129> you<00:02:24.219> can<00:02:24.310> kind<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.519> zoom<00:02:24.579> in

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
situation if you can kind of zoom in

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.580 
situation if you can kind of zoom in
here<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> little<00:02:25.150> bit<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:26.170> look<00:02:26.379> identical

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
here a little bit they look identical

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.550 
here a little bit they look identical
however<00:02:27.250> they're<00:02:27.579> not<00:02:27.609> exactly<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.780> way<00:02:28.989> if

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
however they're not exactly that way if

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.770 
however they're not exactly that way if
you<00:02:29.769> look<00:02:29.950> at<00:02:30.159> the<00:02:30.370> top<00:02:30.579> one<00:02:30.849> here<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.359> it's<00:02:31.659> a

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
you look at the top one here it's it's a

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
you look at the top one here it's it's a
bit<00:02:31.930> wider<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.620> got<00:02:32.829> some<00:02:33.040> more<00:02:33.189> parts<00:02:33.879> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
bit wider it's got some more parts and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.039 
bit wider it's got some more parts and
pieces<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.750> on<00:02:35.319> either<00:02:35.379> side<00:02:35.920> and<00:02:36.689> this<00:02:37.689> one

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
pieces to it on either side and this one

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.959 
pieces to it on either side and this one
here<00:02:38.379> is<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.739> bit<00:02:39.010> smaller<00:02:39.310> so<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.609> don't<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.879> if

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
here is a bit smaller so I don't know if

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.089 
here is a bit smaller so I don't know if
it's<00:02:40.090> a<00:02:40.180> slave<00:02:40.510> type<00:02:41.049> of<00:02:41.200> situation<00:02:41.769> or<00:02:41.950> what

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
it's a slave type of situation or what

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.259 
it's a slave type of situation or what
but<00:02:43.439> Evan<00:02:44.439> was<00:02:44.620> over<00:02:44.889> at<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.819> parts<00:02:46.120> house

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
but Evan was over at the the parts house

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.670 
but Evan was over at the the parts house
picking<00:02:46.689> this<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.260> guy<00:02:47.409> seemed<00:02:47.650> to

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
picking this up and the guy seemed to

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.259 
picking this up and the guy seemed to
know<00:02:47.919> what<00:02:48.010> he<00:02:48.069> was<00:02:48.250> talking<00:02:48.459> about<00:02:48.760> he<00:02:49.090> kind

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
know what he was talking about he kind

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.610 
know what he was talking about he kind
of<00:02:49.329> gave<00:02:49.450> us<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.599> little<00:02:49.780> few<00:02:49.930> pointers<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:50.500> so

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
of gave us a little few pointers and so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.069 
of gave us a little few pointers and so
forth<00:02:50.889> about<00:02:51.129> how<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.819> might<00:02:52.090> go<00:02:52.689> about<00:02:52.720> this

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
forth about how we might go about this

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.129 
forth about how we might go about this
project<00:02:53.650> and<00:02:53.859> all<00:02:54.669> told<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.540> all<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:55.840> parts

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:56.139 
project and all told with all the parts

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.670 
project and all told with all the parts
so<00:02:56.290> far<00:02:56.560> we<00:02:57.250> have<00:02:57.430> about<00:02:57.840> $140<00:02:58.840> into<00:02:59.169> this<00:02:59.319> and

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
so far we have about $140 into this and

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.589 
so far we have about $140 into this and
we're<00:03:00.519> expecting<00:03:00.790> after<00:03:01.120> we<00:03:01.329> put<00:03:01.510> this

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:01.599 
we're expecting after we put this

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.839 
we're expecting after we put this
together<00:03:01.810> is<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.680> machine<00:03:03.400> will<00:03:03.519> start

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
together is that the machine will start

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.220 
together is that the machine will start
but<00:03:04.000> we<00:03:04.120> need<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.419> take<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.689> to<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.900> lake<00:03:05.049> in

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
but we need to take it to the lake in

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.530 
but we need to take it to the lake in
order<00:03:05.439> to<00:03:05.590> do<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.010> full-on<00:03:06.579> you<00:03:07.419> know

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
order to do the the full-on you know

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.289 
order to do the the full-on you know
test<00:03:08.069> we<00:03:09.069> also<00:03:09.340> notice<00:03:09.609> too<00:03:09.849> when<00:03:09.879> we<00:03:10.180> were

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
test we also notice too when we were

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.789 
test we also notice too when we were
back<00:03:10.599> at<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.870> boat<00:03:11.049> ramp<00:03:11.079> there<00:03:11.500> was<00:03:11.620> this

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
back at the boat ramp there was this

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.210 
back at the boat ramp there was this
device<00:03:12.099> and<00:03:12.370> it<00:03:12.459> hangs<00:03:12.669> right<00:03:12.970> underneath<00:03:13.329> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
device and it hangs right underneath the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.849 
device and it hangs right underneath the
steering<00:03:15.220> column<00:03:15.400> of<00:03:15.729> the<00:03:16.120> jetski<00:03:16.479> and<00:03:16.840> if<00:03:17.590> it

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
steering column of the jetski and if it

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.289 
steering column of the jetski and if it
was<00:03:18.010> filled<00:03:18.190> with<00:03:18.370> gas<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.909> there<00:03:19.000> was<00:03:19.090> gas

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
was filled with gas and there was gas

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.699 
was filled with gas and there was gas
lines<00:03:19.599> going<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> it<00:03:20.199> and<00:03:20.319> all<00:03:20.379> these<00:03:20.530> other

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
lines going to it and all these other

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.800 
lines going to it and all these other
things<00:03:20.769> and<00:03:21.280> at<00:03:21.519> first<00:03:21.729> blush<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.090> looked<00:03:22.569> like

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
things and at first blush it looked like

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.170 
things and at first blush it looked like
well<00:03:23.169> that's<00:03:23.530> probably<00:03:23.739> a<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.430> fuel<00:03:24.819> filter

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
well that's probably a the fuel filter

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.839 
well that's probably a the fuel filter
although<00:03:25.479> we<00:03:25.599> didn't<00:03:25.870> know<00:03:25.989> that<00:03:26.169> for<00:03:26.379> sure

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
although we didn't know that for sure

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.369 
although we didn't know that for sure
and<00:03:27.849> found<00:03:28.389> out<00:03:28.540> later<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.900> this<00:03:29.229> is

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
and found out later that this is

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.409 
and found out later that this is
actually<00:03:29.620> a<00:03:29.650> water<00:03:29.859> trap<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.609> it's<00:03:31.120> got<00:03:31.269> this

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
actually a water trap and it's got this

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.390 
actually a water trap and it's got this
piece<00:03:31.720> inside<00:03:32.169> of<00:03:32.349> it<00:03:32.500> and<00:03:32.829> if<00:03:33.069> you<00:03:33.190> look<00:03:33.370> down

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
piece inside of it and if you look down

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
piece inside of it and if you look down
inside<00:03:33.790> there's<00:03:34.359> some<00:03:34.569> there's<00:03:34.959> some<00:03:35.049> snotty

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
inside there's some there's some snotty

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.229 
inside there's some there's some snotty
looking<00:03:35.949> stuff<00:03:36.250> that<00:03:36.489> that's<00:03:36.790> accumulated

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
looking stuff that that's accumulated

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:38.969 
looking stuff that that's accumulated
over<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.750> years<00:03:37.870> has<00:03:38.260> probably<00:03:38.530> never<00:03:38.739> been

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.979 
over the years has probably never been

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.069 
over the years has probably never been
cleaned<00:03:39.280> and<00:03:39.569> we're<00:03:40.569> probably<00:03:40.690> going<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:40.989> have

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
cleaned and we're probably going to have

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:42.629 
cleaned and we're probably going to have
to<00:03:41.109> deal<00:03:41.319> with<00:03:41.379> that<00:03:41.620> either<00:03:41.829> replace<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.489> if

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:42.639 
to deal with that either replace it if

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.580 
to deal with that either replace it if
we<00:03:42.760> can't<00:03:42.970> clean<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.269> but<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.079> is<00:03:44.290> actually

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
we can't clean it but this is actually

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.189 
we can't clean it but this is actually
what<00:03:45.459> this<00:03:45.639> is<00:03:45.879> it's<00:03:46.150> not<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.389> fuel<00:03:46.659> filter<00:03:46.840> per

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
what this is it's not a fuel filter per

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.319 
what this is it's not a fuel filter per
se<00:03:47.409> but<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.680> is<00:03:47.799> a<00:03:47.829> water<00:03:48.099> trap<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:48.970> we're<00:03:49.239> going

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
se but it is a water trap so we're going

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.210 
se but it is a water trap so we're going
to<00:03:49.389> get<00:03:49.540> into<00:03:49.659> the<00:03:49.720> project<00:03:50.139> this<00:03:50.590> evening<00:03:51.010> and

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
to get into the project this evening and

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.530 
to get into the project this evening and
see<00:03:51.639> where<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.819> leads<00:03:52.000> us<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.389> hopefully

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
see where it leads us and hopefully

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.000 
see where it leads us and hopefully
we'll<00:03:52.810> get<00:03:52.900> it<00:03:52.959> all<00:03:53.079> put<00:03:53.290> together<00:03:53.409> thanks<00:03:53.859> for

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
we'll get it all put together thanks for

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.340 
we'll get it all put together thanks for
watching
