because it's really tedious after a
while<00:00:26.400> making<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:26.970> game<00:00:27.529> it<00:00:28.529> gets<00:00:28.740> really

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
while making this game it gets really

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.040 
while making this game it gets really
tedious<00:00:29.429> entering<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> code<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.570> let<00:00:30.779> me<00:00:30.810> just

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
tedious entering the code so let me just

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.100 
tedious entering the code so let me just
throw<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.560> using<00:00:32.399> easy<00:00:32.730> normal<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.840> hard

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
cool too so I'll show you all the code

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.660 
cool too so I'll show you all the code
for<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> I'm<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.930> giving<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.770> source<00:01:23.400> for

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
this i'm giving you the code and that's

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.080 
this i'm giving you the code and that's
it<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:28.140> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.400> looks<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.790> visual

it so this is how it looks in visual
basic<00:01:30.170> i'll<00:01:31.170> just<00:01:31.409> stop<00:01:31.680> debugging<00:01:32.659> okay<00:01:34.159> so

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
basic i'll just stop debugging okay so

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
basic i'll just stop debugging okay so
for<00:01:36.420> your<00:01:36.869> normal<00:01:37.500> tile<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.970> tile
