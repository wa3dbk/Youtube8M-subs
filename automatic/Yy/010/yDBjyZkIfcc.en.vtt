these two styles you know and and

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
these two styles you know and and
Bradley<00:05:26.040> is<00:05:26.100> a<00:05:26.220> guy<00:05:26.400> I<00:05:26.730> think<00:05:27.390> on<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:28.550> think

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
Bradley is a guy I think on I think

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.940 
Bradley is a guy I think on I think
Bradley<00:05:29.850> might<00:05:30.300> first<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.500> know<00:05:31.650> start

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
Bradley might first you know start

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.970 
Bradley might first you know start
boxing<00:05:32.419> with<00:05:33.419> rustling<00:05:33.840> but<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.410> think<00:05:34.770> as<00:05:34.860> the

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
boxing with rustling but I think as the

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.500 
boxing with rustling but I think as the
fight<00:05:35.160> progresses<00:05:35.730> you'll<00:05:35.880> add<00:05:36.060> pressure<00:05:36.300> to

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
fight progresses you'll add pressure to

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.640 
fight progresses you'll add pressure to
him<00:05:36.690> because<00:05:36.870> Bradley's<00:05:37.200> the<00:05:37.230> more<00:05:37.440> skilled

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
him because Bradley's the more skilled

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.890 
him because Bradley's the more skilled
guy<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:38.580> know<00:05:38.669> just<00:05:38.910> a<00:05:39.000> more<00:05:39.180> skill<00:05:39.419> guy<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.840> I

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
guy you know just a more skill guy and I

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.070 
guy you know just a more skill guy and I
don't<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.200> don't<00:05:40.230> think<00:05:40.620> Ruslan<00:05:41.550> is<00:05:41.700> in<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.930> is

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
rustling and and possibly might even

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.960 
rustling and and possibly might even
stop<00:06:25.320> him<00:06:25.500> like<00:06:25.620> I<00:06:25.710> said<00:06:25.890> Bradley<00:06:26.310> doesn't

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
stop him like I said Bradley doesn't

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:28.610

have<00:06:27.300> knocked<00:06:27.540> out<00:06:27.750> power<00:06:27.930> obviously<00:06:28.230> but

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
have knocked out power obviously but

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.860 
have knocked out power obviously but
he's<00:06:28.710> got<00:06:28.890> enough<00:06:29.190> power<00:06:29.400> to<00:06:29.610> hurt<00:06:29.970> you<00:06:30.210> to

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
he's got enough power to hurt you to

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.640 
he's got enough power to hurt you to
slow<00:06:31.080> you<00:06:31.140> down<00:06:31.290> and<00:06:31.860> to<00:06:32.070> cut<00:06:32.340> you<00:06:32.550> so<00:06:33.650> overall

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:34.650 
slow you down and to cut you so overall

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.409 
slow you down and to cut you so overall
though<00:06:35.039> this<00:06:35.250> rustling<00:06:35.700> guy<00:06:35.880> seems<00:06:36.300> pretty

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
though this rustling guy seems pretty

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.850 
though this rustling guy seems pretty
tough<00:06:36.930> and<00:06:37.229> I<00:06:38.190> think<00:06:38.640> this<00:06:38.729> fight<00:06:38.970> will<00:06:39.180> go<00:06:39.210> out

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
tough and I think this fight will go out

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.709 
tough and I think this fight will go out
rounds<00:06:40.460> the<00:06:40.639> only<00:06:40.879> way<00:06:41.000> I<00:06:41.030> see<00:06:41.360> it<00:06:41.389> being

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
rounds the only way I see it being

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.899 
rounds the only way I see it being
stopped<00:06:42.080> is<00:06:42.379> it<00:06:43.099> rustling<00:06:43.460> knocks<00:06:43.699> out

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
stopped is it rustling knocks out

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.360 
stopped is it rustling knocks out
Bradley<00:06:44.180> which<00:06:44.419> I<00:06:44.539> highly<00:06:44.719> doubt<00:06:45.080> or<00:06:45.800> if

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.370 
Bradley which I highly doubt or if

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.119 
Bradley which I highly doubt or if
there's<00:06:46.639> a<00:06:46.699> cut<00:06:47.000> arm<00:06:47.469> from<00:06:48.469> a<00:06:48.560> clash<00:06:48.770> of<00:06:48.949> heads

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:49.129 
there's a cut arm from a clash of heads

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.369 
there's a cut arm from a clash of heads
but<00:06:49.789> I<00:06:49.819> think<00:06:49.909> you'll<00:06:50.270> go<00:06:50.449> 12<00:06:50.810> rounds<00:06:50.930> the

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:51.379 
but I think you'll go 12 rounds the

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.159 
but I think you'll go 12 rounds the
distance<00:06:51.849> um<00:06:52.849> you<00:06:53.419> know<00:06:53.539> I'm<00:06:53.629> not<00:06:54.400> so<00:06:55.400> I<00:06:55.430> got<00:06:55.729> a

00:06:56.159 --> 00:06:56.169 
distance um you know I'm not so I got a

00:06:56.169 --> 00:06:58.600 
distance um you know I'm not so I got a
Bradley<00:06:57.169> winning<00:06:57.439> a<00:06:57.560> 12-round<00:06:58.460> unanimous

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
Bradley winning a 12-round unanimous

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.379 
Bradley winning a 12-round unanimous
decision<00:06:59.599> when<00:06:59.750> it's<00:06:59.870> all<00:06:59.990> said<00:07:00.199> and<00:07:00.229> done<00:07:00.409> um

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:05.159 
decision when it's all said and done um
I<00:07:02.389> just<00:07:02.750> think<00:07:02.930> he<00:07:03.319> our<00:07:03.469> classes<00:07:04.009> this<00:07:04.159> guy<00:07:04.430> um

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
I just think he our classes this guy um

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.909 
I just think he our classes this guy um
you<00:07:06.169> know<00:07:06.289> but<00:07:06.439> it<00:07:06.530> could<00:07:06.650> be<00:07:06.740> some

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:06.919
