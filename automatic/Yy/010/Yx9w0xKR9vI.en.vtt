00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:10.349
 how to make a bracelet organizer 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.410
 as materials we are going to need a 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:18.359
 roll of kitchen paper a gun 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:22.370
 silicone or glue cloth scissors and for 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.530
 fill the paper or cardboard roll 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.400
 we'll start filling in the roll 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.450
 kitchen paper with sticks or cartons 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.930
 we do this to make it more 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.580
 resistant and not deformed now we measure 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.730
 enough fabric to wrap the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.080
 roll of kitchen paper has to 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.080
 overrun ones a bit by the most 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.230
 we cut it 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.230
 one of the sides will be stuck to the roll 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.930
 of kitchen paper but the other one 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.110
 we have to double because it's going to be the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.120
 that you see then we have to fold it 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.900
 as I teach you and this part will 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.810
 we will stick 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.610
 with our silicone gun or 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.250
 glue if you want to use it for 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.780
 fabrics 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.780
 and then we try it 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.510
 and once this is done we paste the other 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.400
 end to the roll of kitchen paper 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.540
 we put a little more glue or 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.870
 silicone on the end and we introduce the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.210
 fabric so that it stays there stuck 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:37.020
 we do the same with the other end 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.350
 Now that we have it, we roll up and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:44.450
 we pasted the part that we had folded is 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 which it is smooth and back 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.170
 and finally we paste and introduce the 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.650
 rest of the fabric that we have left in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.200
 extremes 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:03.170
 and now you have it super easy now you can 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.210
 put your wristbands and watches on 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:14.780
 these organizers to have them to the 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:16.880
 seen by the way if you want to see how 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.150
 make these two knot bracelets do 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.860
 click on them I hope that I have 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.860
 liked this video see you
