what device they're connected to which

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.439 
what device they're connected to which
is<00:00:58.500> really<00:00:58.530> neat<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.609> sound<00:00:59.850> quality<00:01:00.000> which

is really neat for sound quality which
of<00:01:00.570> course<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.960> most<00:01:01.140> important<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:02.219> sound

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of course is most important these sound

very smooth mids and very crisp eyes

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.140 
very smooth mids and very crisp eyes
which<00:01:07.380> makes<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.890> long-term<00:01:08.070> listening<00:01:08.700> very

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
which makes for long-term listening very

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719 
which makes for long-term listening very
easy<00:01:09.390> they<00:01:10.110> they're<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.860> too<00:01:11.040> biased<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.520> any

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
easy they they're not too biased on any

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.910 
easy they they're not too biased on any
of<00:01:11.909> these<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:13.049> they're<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.260> fatiguing

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
of these so really they're not fatiguing

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.370 
of these so really they're not fatiguing
at<00:01:14.010> all<00:01:14.159> another<00:01:14.850> thing<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.240> they<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.600> really

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
at all another thing is they have really

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.690 
at all another thing is they have really
nice<00:01:16.500> signal-to-noise<00:01:16.890> ratio<00:01:17.520> which<00:01:17.670> means

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
nice signal-to-noise ratio which means

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.520 
nice signal-to-noise ratio which means
you<00:01:18.000> don't<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.540> turn<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.320> much

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
you don't have to turn them up that much

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
you don't have to turn them up that much
to<00:01:19.950> make<00:01:20.159> them<00:01:20.369> loud<00:01:20.580> they<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:21.479> block<00:01:21.840> out

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
to make them loud they also block out

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.840 
to make them loud they also block out
outside<00:01:22.560> noise<00:01:22.830> very<00:01:23.130> well<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.759> though

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
outside noise very well even though

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.070 
outside noise very well even though
they're<00:01:24.000> not<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.150> noise<00:01:24.390> cancelling<00:01:24.750> headphone

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
they're not a noise cancelling headphone

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.560 
they're not a noise cancelling headphone
because<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.680> ear<00:01:25.920> design<00:01:26.270> boses<00:01:27.270> also

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
because of the on ear design boses also

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.499 
because of the on ear design boses also
allows<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.430> plug<00:01:29.430> these<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.909> hardwire<00:01:30.390> it

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
allows you to plug these in hardwire it

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.260 
allows you to plug these in hardwire it
as<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.409> can<00:01:31.590> either<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.270> cord

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
as well so you can either use the cord

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.420 
as well so you can either use the cord
