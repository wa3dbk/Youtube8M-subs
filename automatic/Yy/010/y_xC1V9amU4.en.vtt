I<00:00:41.690> just<00:00:42.320> don't<00:00:42.649> really<00:00:42.860> think<00:00:42.980> it's<00:00:43.280> all<00:00:43.520> that

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
I just don't really think it's all that

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.610 
I just don't really think it's all that
great<00:00:44.149> though<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:44.600> terms<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.989> just<00:00:45.170> moves<00:00:45.440> that

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
great though in terms of just moves that

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.750 
great though in terms of just moves that
it<00:00:45.739> gets<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:46.100> things<00:00:46.219> like<00:00:46.340> that<00:00:46.399> though

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
it gets and things like that though

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.799 
it gets and things like that though
because<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.000> lot<00:00:47.149> of<00:00:47.270> its<00:00:47.390> better<00:00:47.539> moves

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
because a lot of its better moves

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.930 
because a lot of its better moves
weren't<00:00:48.079> introduced<00:00:48.469> until<00:00:48.739> later<00:00:48.980> games<00:00:49.340> so

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
weren't introduced until later games so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.209 
weren't introduced until later games so
I'm<00:00:50.930> not<00:00:51.110> really<00:00:51.289> sure<00:00:51.530> if<00:00:51.649> I'd<00:00:51.770> recommend

I'm not really sure if I'd recommend

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.860 
I'm not really sure if I'd recommend
this<00:00:52.340> one<00:00:52.579> but<00:00:53.030> if<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.210> really<00:00:53.539> really<00:00:53.750> want

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.640 
version
it<00:01:16.210> doesn't<00:01:16.510> have<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.750> fighting<00:01:17.080> subtype<00:01:17.470> and

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
it doesn't have the fighting subtype and

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.020 
it doesn't have the fighting subtype and
it<00:01:17.710> doesn't<00:01:17.950> learn<00:01:18.040> quite<00:01:18.490> as<00:01:18.640> many<00:01:18.790> good

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
it doesn't learn quite as many good

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.640 
it doesn't learn quite as many good
moves<00:01:19.240> as<00:01:19.390> heracross<00:01:19.810> does<00:01:20.020> but<00:01:20.290> its<00:01:20.410> stats

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
moves as heracross does but its stats

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.230 
moves as heracross does but its stats
are<00:01:20.830> really<00:01:21.130> similar<00:01:21.430> and<00:01:21.610> it<00:01:21.910> learns<00:01:22.090> at

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
are really similar and it learns at

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.640 
are really similar and it learns at
least<00:01:22.390> some<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.840> same<00:01:23.020> moves<00:01:23.320> so<00:01:23.620> I

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
least some of the same moves so I

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.410 
least some of the same moves so I
actually<00:01:24.040> think<00:01:24.310> this<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.610> a<00:01:24.640> very<00:01:24.820> solid<00:01:25.240> bug

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
actually think this is a very solid bug

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.140 
actually think this is a very solid bug

this<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.010> porygon<00:01:36.460> now<00:01:37.300> porygon<00:01:37.780> has<00:01:38.110> an

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
this is porygon now porygon has an

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.630 
this is porygon now porygon has an
evolution<00:01:38.890> that<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.130> cannot<00:01:39.400> normally

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
obtain and evolution has really good

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.710 
obtain and evolution has really good
defense<00:01:41.800> but<00:01:42.490> really<00:01:42.850> I<00:01:43.090> wouldn't<00:01:43.390> recommend

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
defense but really I wouldn't recommend

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.390 
defense but really I wouldn't recommend
picking<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.230> porygon<00:01:44.590> for<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:44.980> main<00:01:45.130> story

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
picking up porygon for the main story

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.340 
picking up porygon for the main story
it's<00:01:45.640> kind<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:45.910> just<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.210> trophy<00:01:46.540> Pokemon<00:01:47.110> in<00:01:47.260> my

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
it's kind of just a trophy Pokemon in my

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.910 
it's kind of just a trophy Pokemon in my
opinion<00:01:48.330> because<00:01:49.330> you<00:01:49.780> know<00:01:49.900> it<00:01:50.050> son<00:01:50.200> evolved

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
opinion because you know it son evolved

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.200 
opinion because you know it son evolved
and<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.220> stats<00:01:51.460> really<00:01:51.700> weren't<00:01:51.940> that<00:01:52.090> great

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
and it stats really weren't that great

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.260 
and it stats really weren't that great
to<00:01:52.300> begin<00:01:52.540> with<00:01:52.870> so<00:01:53.400> yeah<00:01:54.400> I<00:01:54.430> wouldn't<00:01:55.090> really

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
to begin with so yeah I wouldn't really

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.730 
to begin with so yeah I wouldn't really
recommend<00:01:55.390> it<00:01:55.900> in<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.080> beginning<00:01:56.290> it's<00:01:56.620> got

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
recommend it in the beginning it's got

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.500 
recommend it in the beginning it's got
kind<00:01:56.980> of<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.160> cool<00:01:57.430> ability<00:01:57.940> and<00:01:58.180> I<00:01:58.210> guess<00:01:58.390> it

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
kind of a cool ability and I guess it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.760 
kind of a cool ability and I guess it
learned<00:01:58.660> some<00:01:58.870> all<00:01:59.050> right<00:01:59.200> moves<00:01:59.470> they<00:01:59.650> can

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
learned some all right moves they can

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.820 
learned some all right moves they can
change<00:02:00.040> its<00:02:00.190> own<00:02:00.340> type<00:02:00.700> but<00:02:01.330> it's<00:02:02.290> really<00:02:02.680> just

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
change its own type but it's really just

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.830 
change its own type but it's really just
a<00:02:02.980> novelty<00:02:03.340> Pokemon<00:02:03.940> for<00:02:04.120> the<00:02:04.240> story<00:02:04.510> so<00:02:04.810> I

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
a novelty Pokemon for the story so I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.120 
a novelty Pokemon for the story so I
wouldn't<00:02:05.170> recommend<00:02:05.350> picking<00:02:05.740> one<00:02:05.980> up

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
wouldn't recommend picking one up

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.609 
wouldn't recommend picking one up
especially<00:02:06.430> for<00:02:06.730> how<00:02:06.820> expensive<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.570> is<00:02:07.690> you

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
especially for how expensive it is you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.109 
especially for how expensive it is you
also<00:02:08.770> can<00:02:09.010> buy<00:02:09.040> some<00:02:09.340> various<00:02:09.610> items<00:02:09.940> which

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
also can buy some various items which

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.060 
also can buy some various items which
should<00:02:10.480> appear<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:10.840> screen<00:02:10.990> right<00:02:11.410> now<00:02:11.620> just

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
should appear on screen right now just

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.030 
should appear on screen right now just
for<00:02:12.250> reference<00:02:12.960> now<00:02:13.960> it<00:02:14.230> cost<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.620> thousand

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
for reference now it cost a thousand

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.550 
for reference now it cost a thousand
poka<00:02:15.220> dollars<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:15.760> 50<00:02:16.090> coins<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.440> also

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
poka dollars for 50 coins you can also

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.150 
poka dollars for 50 coins you can also
get<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.800> few<00:02:18.010> coins<00:02:18.370> from<00:02:18.580> NPCs<00:02:19.270> like<00:02:19.540> these

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
get a few coins from NPCs like these

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.560 
get a few coins from NPCs like these
it's<00:02:21.160> good<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.610> see<00:02:21.850> you<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.150> guy<00:02:22.360> here

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.940 
I think there's also something you can
find<00:02:24.130> on<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.340> ground<00:02:24.400> like<00:02:24.880> a<00:02:24.910> random<00:02:25.950> just

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
find on the ground like a random just

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.020 
find on the ground like a random just
you<00:02:27.130> know<00:02:27.220> laying<00:02:27.430> around
