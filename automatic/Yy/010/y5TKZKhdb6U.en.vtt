00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.890

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.660

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.850

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.829
 I believe the concept will be packed 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.480
 in any case very well if it is just 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.250

 We definitely see how the whole 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.979

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.930

 whole guys these are the athletes 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.479
 I was not sure at the start either 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.970
 but comes promis mister no excuse 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.409
 That's why I think it's really cool that you 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.009
 at the start it was we have kohlisch video 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 made or boys fail here after the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:37.400
 hard worker and gave it one now 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.400
 Good job day or tim malt or simon 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.200
 really fat the citizens in us 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:58.430
 just a bit over 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:02:02.210
 570 grams reingehauen has really good 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.640
 Always so curious to do so often 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.320
 all other riders encounter the 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.690
 We threw a game of thrown tournaments 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.200
 So I have but I always have everything 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.840
 asked how long trained and 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.120
 disease twice a day sunday two 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.739
 each two hours each 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.050
 the course always a mixture 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.070
 from between tours and strength training 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.239
 or strength training in strength training 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.680
 So I have always been a type where I am 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.380
 I said you can not simultaneously 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.420
 run marathon and and super sprinter 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.780
 and I can also do that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.540
 tunnel tunnels and and become heavy 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.940
 weights somehow do not bite though 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.950
 today I have the opposite 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:52.090
 experienced 160 kilo almost twice 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.090
 once the 58 5 pushed away again 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.560
 look at the mix 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.310
 agility and power I find great 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:13.820
 is fun and above all a blatant 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.790
 definition on 6 82 meters 82 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.160
 So the pictures you then too 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.210

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.490
 I think they were really good 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:29.570
 a good photographer of the sub so invited 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:32.350
 The world has the chance to make the most of it 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:36.590
 Sven is a final word 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:41.260
 were tasty and was happy and 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:52.120
 I look forward to the next time on the 15th 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:55.010
 all good to very good 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.520
