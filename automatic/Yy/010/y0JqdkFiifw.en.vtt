00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.110
 one wants to tell now come to a first video 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.200
 The Innsbrucker have as a first I really do not have what many very 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.099
 Interested 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.099
 Chip 6 percent I can do a lot more but the ones I can I'll give you 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.179
 show again 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.880
 the first one is the so-called 4th 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880
 the files have to be made says 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.229
 and husband best for starters on chips 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.879
 Reason the Diekmann so in the hand that between 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.480
 lie to the two children here 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 and preferably between the three 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.120
 You just pull at the front 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.890
 about these 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 annaberg-buchholz Niemann 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.070
 the rest 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 but again suppressed 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.810
 invest 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.950
 that's how you would say 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.430
 Penske following simple physics 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.440
 in the opinion of Hecking the Program Advisory Board virtually fake 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.340
 since 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.340
 Man's slow make her a bit more difficult 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.170
 but I think you have 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.690
 so reasonably 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.940
 as she is misunderstood 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.730
 how it works 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.980
 where that was Jett wears number one more 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.440
 will follow 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.510
 and PrÃ¶ll if the video Weinert make you why high 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.800
 and then where I stand 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.650
 of course you can also videotape this channel for more 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.590
 videos 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840
 otherwise 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.760
 have fun commenting 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.960
 Of course we can protest this video again on the weekend 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.890
 then you can fix it again 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.490
 also show or 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.820
 6 who commissioned me would be interested 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.330
 for Intel after the autopsy is 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.360
 until then and have not had much fun
