00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 at 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.710
 hi to all and balsan case i hope that 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.150
 you are fine 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.580
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.990
 new video on gta 5 online this 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.390
 this time to talk about the trophies that 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.310
 will be added with the dlc but also 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.349
 exclusive t-shirt so we had some 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.149
 spoken a few days ago but there in 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.169
 knowing the trophies and having a 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.579
 image of t-shirts 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.649
 good we can really see that there is 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.030
 several things that are related so 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.920
 it's gone first we'll throw a 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.500
 look at the new trophies that will be at 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.719
 unlock from Tuesday 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.649
 so it's gone first trophy 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.330
 invest your hard earned money 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.670
 in the preparation of a robbery 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.960
 so that's a trophy that only the 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.270
 who will launch the robbery 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.010
 can unlock because when we go 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.350
 launch a single robbery the leader will have to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.380
 put money to be able to launch 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.430
 and buy the equipment of the robbery 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.380
 then here second trophy 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.690
 the leader must share the total sum 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.960
 of the robbery in four equal parts so 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.360
 he will have to make 4 part of 25% for each 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.619
 to be able to unlock this trophy so 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.899
 like this trophy will unblock 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.509
 only if you are leader then 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.610
 here trophy number 3 spent a total of 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.440
 $ 8 million in vehicles in 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.450
 the framework of the update hold up which 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.400
 robberies will still have 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.170
 a lot of money aside this a trophy 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.700
 that everyone can unlock but 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.979
 it will buy a lot of vehicles 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.500
 in total 8 million to unlock this 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.840
 trophy then here fourth trophy 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.049
 completed the final robbery without suffering 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.460
 no damage so a trophy who who 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.400
 may still be hard enough to 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.860
 then achieve fifth trophy won 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.690
 25 platinum medal through the 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.670
 preparation missions and robberies 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.350
 final so that too that will be some 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.540
 something that will not be hard to do but 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.790
 long enough then we also have some 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.830
 trophies is created so those are a 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.439
 little all the same finish a mission 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.299
 preparing two robberies so this one 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.369
 everybody the rat is then so we 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.840
 has two secret trophies but these are all 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.640
 the same so finish each robbery 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.979
 by being the leader 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.840
 so there are five robberies in total five 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.360
 trophies we must finish each robbery 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.769
 by being the leader of this robbery so that 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.360
 also it will still be quite long and 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.680
 not everyone will be able to do it 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 will necessarily be the leader of 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.640
 robbery so one in four 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.870
 so that was for the list of 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.720
 new trophies that will be added to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.250
 from Tuesday in the game 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.080
 then here I will show you the picture 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.340
 new t-shirts so it's not 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.230
 official watch I put it to you 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.700
 the screen but you'll see that if we 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.850
 puts everything butt we really had 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.920
 a rally and a lot of things and that's it 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.020
 really agree so look here we 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.130
 like the new t-shirts and here 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.080
 I will show you a screen that I 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.190
 you had already shown well down there 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.490
 a week I believe in another 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.170
 video 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.300
 it was actually the information of the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.160
 exclusive t-shirts but in source code 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.570
 look and look here I'm going to you 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.250
 put a screen where I had fun at 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.600
 make some arrows and we can see 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.430
 that there are a lot of things that beat that 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.750
 so maybe connects that after here to 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.430
 a few small arrows that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.080
 are wrong maybe there are some 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.490
 little arrows that I have not put and who 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.470
 are obvious for some of them 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.030
 you it was me who had fun doing 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.490
 this little scheme do not hesitate to put 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.870
 in comment if you see some stockings 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.090
 things that are right and things 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.130
 maybe I did not see who would have 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.420
 could be linked and that's why we come to 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.860
 the end of this information video where 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.760
 I was able to show you the new 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.110
 trophies 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 the new t-shirts and where I could 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.080
 have a little fun to connect all this so 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.580
 as I say do not hesitate to put 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.500
 in comment if you see something else 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.880

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.500
