00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
if their smartphones the Heinz Martin's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510 
if their smartphones the Heinz Martin's
you<00:00:57.120> get<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.570> stuff<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:58.379> don't<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.100> get

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you get good stuff why don't these get

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.000 
you get good stuff why don't these get
like<00:00:59.820> at<00:01:00.149> least<00:01:00.300> one<00:01:00.840> point<00:01:01.020> 4<00:01:01.260> gigahertz<00:01:01.530> CPU

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like at least one point 4 gigahertz CPU

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.250 
like at least one point 4 gigahertz CPU
that<00:01:02.489> they<00:01:02.609> have<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> galaxy<00:01:03.329> note<00:01:03.359> why

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
that they have in the galaxy note why

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.020 
that they have in the galaxy note why
don't<00:01:04.500> they<00:01:04.650> get<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.339> because<00:01:05.640> they

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
don't they get that because they

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.359 
don't they get that because they
definitely<00:01:06.390> do<00:01:06.720> need<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:06.990> like<00:01:07.439> if<00:01:07.710> they<00:01:08.189> are

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
definitely do need that like if they are

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
definitely do need that like if they are
in<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> bigger<00:01:09.330> form<00:01:09.840> factor<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
in like in a bigger form factor I

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500 
in like in a bigger form factor I
suppose<00:01:10.830> or<00:01:11.100> maybe<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.700> such<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> case<00:01:12.240> maybe

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
suppose or maybe not such a case maybe

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.109 
suppose or maybe not such a case maybe
it's<00:01:12.720> only<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.439> resolution<00:01:13.979> 1280<00:01:14.369> x<00:01:14.490> 800<00:01:14.760> mean

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it's only the resolution 1280 x 800 mean

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.780 
it's only the resolution 1280 x 800 mean
ok<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.470> galaxy<00:01:16.860> tab<00:01:17.100> this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
ok so this is the galaxy tab this is the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.429 
ok so this is the galaxy tab this is the
best<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.509> have<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.900> hell<00:01:19.080> out<00:01:19.200> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
best like to have the hell out the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.580 
best like to have the hell out the
galaxy<00:01:19.710> tab<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.130> 1280<00:01:20.880> x<00:01:21.060> 800<00:01:21.299> is<00:01:21.659> play<00:01:21.900> that's

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
galaxy tab to 1280 x 800 is play that's

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.300 
galaxy tab to 1280 x 800 is play that's
the<00:01:22.770> same<00:01:23.070> as<00:01:23.490> i<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.070> galaxy<00:01:26.070> note

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the same as i have on my galaxy note

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.969 
the same as i have on my galaxy note
that's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.790> 5.3<00:01:27.509> inch<00:01:27.540> version<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.680> why<00:01:28.920> don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that's a 5.3 inch version but why don't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.340 
that's a 5.3 inch version but why don't
they<00:01:29.340> give<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.060> one<00:01:30.119> has<00:01:30.509> my<00:01:31.110> phone

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
they give it but this one has my phone

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.749 
they give it but this one has my phone
has<00:01:31.530> one<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.860> four<00:01:32.070> Gators<00:01:32.310> dual-core

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
has one but four Gators dual-core

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300 
has one but four Gators dual-core
processor<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:33.630> why<00:01:33.869> is<00:01:33.930> these<00:01:34.439> tabs<00:01:34.860> only

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
processor but why is these tabs only

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.730 
processor but why is these tabs only
getting<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.670> 1<00:01:35.880> gigahertz<00:01:36.150> CPU<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.990> not<00:01:37.710> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
getting a 1 gigahertz CPU and not a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.679 
getting a 1 gigahertz CPU and not a
school<00:01:38.040> screen<00:01:38.460> okay<00:01:39.119> first<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.450> all<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.600> know

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
school screen okay first of all I know

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.810 
school screen okay first of all I know
that<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:40.229> it's<00:01:40.590> bigger<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.460> can't

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820

stand<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> screen<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.630> part<00:01:42.930> but<00:01:43.170> why<00:01:43.799> not

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
stand the screen the part but why not

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
stand the screen the part but why not
getting<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> better<00:01:44.640> cpu<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
getting a better cpu because it's the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.770 
getting a better cpu because it's the
same<00:01:46.500> model<00:01:46.920> ram<00:01:47.100> 1<00:01:47.399> gigabyte<00:01:47.790> also<00:01:48.450> become

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
same model ram 1 gigabyte also become

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.359 
same model ram 1 gigabyte also become
with<00:01:48.960> external<00:01:49.229> SD<00:01:49.710> card<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.159> could<00:01:50.250> be

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with external SD card that could be

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.639 
with external SD card that could be
something<00:01:50.490> new<00:01:50.850> also<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.439> they

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
something new also you can see that they

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.530 
something new also you can see that they
have<00:01:52.680> stereo<00:01:53.159> speakers<00:01:53.549> on<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.970> both<00:01:54.240> sides

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
have stereo speakers on like both sides

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
have stereo speakers on like both sides
over<00:01:54.899> here<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.829> could<00:01:55.979> also<00:01:56.189> be

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
over here so that could also be

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.429 
over here so that could also be
something<00:01:56.759> new<00:01:56.850> i<00:01:56.909> think<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.479> also<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.290> can

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
something new i think and also you can

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.620 
something new i think and also you can
see<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.130> they<00:01:59.520> have<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.820> template<00:02:00.149> 18

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
see it that they have the template 18

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.039 
see it that they have the template 18
10.1<00:02:01.409> n<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.820> kind<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.119> design<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.659> can<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.930> on

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
10.1 n the kind of design you can see on

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.280 
10.1 n the kind of design you can see on
the<00:02:04.140> sides<00:02:04.409> that<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.670> is<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.000> galaxy<00:02:06.570> tab<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the sides that this is a galaxy tab you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.830 
the sides that this is a galaxy tab you
can't<00:02:07.649> confuse<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.250> an<00:02:08.520> ipad<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.270> i<00:02:09.479> think

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
can't confuse it with an ipad so i think

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.170 
can't confuse it with an ipad so i think
that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.300
