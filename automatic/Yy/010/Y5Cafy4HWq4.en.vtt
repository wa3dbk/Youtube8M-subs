okay<00:00:00.570> I<00:00:00.599> start<00:00:00.870> giving<00:00:01.110> you<00:00:01.199> an<00:00:01.290> injection<00:00:01.530> or

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
okay I start giving you an injection or

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.490 
okay I start giving you an injection or
radioactive<00:00:02.370> material<00:00:02.990> this<00:00:03.990> is<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.230> we<00:00:04.350> get

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
radioactive material this is so we get

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.320 
radioactive material this is so we get
to<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> bone<00:00:04.859> scan<00:00:05.009> that<00:00:05.250> your<00:00:05.339> doctor<00:00:05.700> ordered

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
to a bone scan that your doctor ordered

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.509 
to a bone scan that your doctor ordered
I'm<00:00:06.569> not<00:00:06.690> gonna<00:00:06.810> glow<00:00:07.140> anything<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:07.680> like<00:00:07.710> no

yeah<00:00:53.089> ahead<00:00:53.390> of<00:00:53.480> spill<00:00:53.780> and<00:00:54.019> then<00:00:54.140> it's

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
yeah ahead of spill and then it's

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.719 
yeah ahead of spill and then it's
contaminated<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.370> send<00:00:55.579> somebody

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
contaminated so you send somebody

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:44.920 
contaminated so you send somebody
quickly<00:00:56.089> thank<00:00:56.479> you

you

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.130 

first<00:01:54.670> survey<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.390> area<00:01:55.720> with<00:01:55.900> a<00:01:55.930> Geiger

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
first survey the area with a Geiger

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.260 
first survey the area with a Geiger
meter<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.860> make<00:01:57.040> sure<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.640> cell<00:01:57.850> has<00:01:58.090> not

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
meter to make sure the cell has not

meter to make sure the cell has not
spread<00:02:01.890> second<00:02:02.890> secure<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.730> area<00:02:03.940> with

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
spread second secure the area with

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:24.030 
spread second secure the area with
radioactive<00:02:04.990> tape<00:02:21.600> next<00:02:22.600> by<00:02:23.380> using<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> shock

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
radioactive tape next by using the shock

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.620 
radioactive tape next by using the shock
clean<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.790> spill<00:02:25.030> from<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.390> outside<00:02:25.810> in

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
clean the spill from the outside in

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.940 
clean the spill from the outside in
carefully<00:02:28.630> fold<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.020> chucks<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:29.620> put<00:02:29.830> them

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
into the read radioactive back and spray

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:57.150 
into the read radioactive back and spray
the<00:02:32.590> area<00:02:54.090> if<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.300> area<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.870> still<00:02:56.170> hot<00:02:56.410> spray

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
the area if the area is still hot spray

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.310 
the area if the area is still hot spray
again<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:57.790> repeat<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.330> step<00:02:58.570> cleaning<00:02:59.230> the

again and repeat the step cleaning the

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.970 
again and repeat the step cleaning the

finally resurvey the area thoroughly to

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.839 
finally resurvey the area thoroughly to
background<00:03:06.290> reading<00:03:07.040> no<00:03:07.189> radioactivity

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.459 
background reading no radioactivity
present<00:03:08.359> and<00:03:08.840> decontamination<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:10.099> complete
