00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
insurance that's something that I've put

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.119 
insurance that's something that I've put
in<00:02:44.060> my<00:02:44.450> proposal<00:02:45.019> that's<00:02:45.530> actually<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.099> the

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
in my proposal that's actually in the

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.420 
in my proposal that's actually in the
Senate<00:02:46.550> proposal<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.239> think<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.319> it<00:02:48.680> shows

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
Senate proposal I think that it shows

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.600 
Senate proposal I think that it shows

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
some promise you mentioned that as that

some promise you mentioned that as that
Mike<00:02:55.790> Enzi<00:02:56.000> has<00:02:57.040> previously<00:02:58.040> said<00:02:58.370> that<00:02:58.580> he's

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
Mike Enzi has previously said that he's

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.330 
Mike Enzi has previously said that he's
interested<00:03:00.019> in<00:03:00.050> small<00:03:00.680> business<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.129> being

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
interested in small business of being

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.670 
interested in small business of being
able<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.610> pull<00:03:01.849> in<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.959> equivalent<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.500> some

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
able to pull in the equivalent of some

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.740 
able to pull in the equivalent of some
sort<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:03.920> exchange<00:03:04.159> so<00:03:04.970> that's<00:03:05.209> where<00:03:05.480> there's

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
sort of exchange so that's where there's

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.220 
sort of exchange so that's where there's
some<00:03:05.930> overlap<00:03:06.519> but<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.879> just<00:03:08.659> think<00:03:08.900> it's<00:03:09.080> very

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
some overlap but I just think it's very

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.110 
some overlap but I just think it's very
important<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.769> understand<00:03:10.250> that<00:03:10.400> what<00:03:10.970> we've

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
important to understand that what we've

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.470 
important to understand that what we've
done<00:03:11.299> is<00:03:11.450> to<00:03:11.599> try<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:11.810> take<00:03:12.140> every<00:03:12.650> single<00:03:13.480> cost

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
done is to try to take every single cost

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.660 
done is to try to take every single cost

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
but as I said we've adopted a lot of the

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.509 
but as I said we've adopted a lot of the
ideas<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.540> we've<00:04:06.439> heard<00:04:06.680> from<00:04:06.860> your<00:04:07.280> side<00:04:07.489> of

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
the aisle so I hope maybe you could say

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.780 
the aisle so I hope maybe you could say
well<00:04:09.379> those<00:04:09.980> are<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.220> ones<00:04:10.400> that<00:04:10.489> we<00:04:10.640> think

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
well those are the ones that we think

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.490 
well those are the ones that we think
are<00:04:10.939> good<00:04:11.090> ideas<00:04:11.450> here<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:11.810> things<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.409> we

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
are good ideas here the things that we

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.380 
are good ideas here the things that we
think<00:04:12.650> are<00:04:12.799> bad<00:04:12.980> ideas<00:04:13.400> as<00:04:13.790> opposed<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.209> just

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390
