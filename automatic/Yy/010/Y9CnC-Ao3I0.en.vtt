00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.279
 achievement your face sounds to me that consists of 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.660
 get a thousand achievement points well as 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.720
 we have already achieved it previously 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.510
 this is retroactively and we 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.110
 they will give the reward signal cuerva 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.410
 c's and sign said you have to take that 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.410
 achievement 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.380
 and from there 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.870
 look at the inventory a new 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.400
 small square to put the companion 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 sign said with account since creation 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.880
 you have to be a subscriber and say with this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.980
 object you can call asia so that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.970
 fight your side we replace them 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.080
 crows acz 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.080
 and but let's trust 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.790
 with this group for example look look 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.040
 we are going to leave there 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.010
 nothing, we are going to exchange positions 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.120
 for no more fences that is nice is a 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:26.409
 character that I love are very 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.299
 beautiful 3,650 days of life 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.299
 and let's see what little things 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.870
 and as soon as we start we release blood and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.870
 from abraham gone 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.460
 for example it has protective bark 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.079
 thrown receives damage instead of 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.759
 objective for each attractive stroke 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.759
 released the goal almost a 93 by 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.359
 very real cent like a trunk takes away from 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.250
 flowering earth exchange 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.609
 positions and hits ground are we going to 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.609
 see him 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.520
 and again you can not give anything two 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:09.500
 times but it is also removed from ground 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.580
 and teleports to the target cell 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.580
 well, we have to give that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.069
 fantastic these gentlemen multi man 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.900
 that help appeared 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.980
 great especially for those kids 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.500
 those people who fuck alone 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.500
 let's see this the pirouette 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.020
 to 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.269
 oysters what a nice attack to traction 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.219
 wild and 36 squares and it's so 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.890
 indispensable 10 percent of 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:50.860
 good resistance let's see if it attracts 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.600
 in cross can attract all those who 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.510
 they are in a crossing I like and more 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.750
 fractured 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.990
 earth damage 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.270
 and it lowers the damage power and the 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.730
 flight very very well 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.190
 and this means that the multi 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.840
 man depending on the one we use 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.840
 will help us in one way or another 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.240
 it's funny I like let's try that 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.240
 protective bark 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.870
 and that as a trunk too 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.799
 flowering 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.530
 and the bark with a trunk now 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.530
 and we have seen that the water is 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 in line perpendicular a t very well 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.410
 that is also interesting 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.520
 and well, they will not have an excuse 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.980
 the 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.290
 characters that go solo go to 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.689
 to struggle 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.390
 icir every time he throws like a log 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.430
 retrieves half of what it takes away from 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.959
 adversary 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.959
 with stronger mods 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.800
 I loved a round of applause for 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:23.970
 qualify fantastic bona encourage you to 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:27.330
 try them already mentalized that you have 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.040
 always a fantastic help if still 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.660
 does not have 2,000 achievement points 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.030
 quick to get them because this 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.810
 lately they are going to help 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:39.240
 Well come try it and good luck 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.840
 we continue enjoying the game 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.840
 see you later
