00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
you look at it underneath of course you

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.280 
you look at it underneath of course you
see<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.070> it's<00:01:55.189> not<00:01:55.400> a<00:01:55.729> quartz<00:01:56.270> movement<00:01:56.630> this

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
see that it's not a quartz movement this

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.210 
see that it's not a quartz movement this
is<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:58.270> our<00:01:59.270> mechanical<00:01:59.930> automatic<00:02:00.590> winding

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
is a our mechanical automatic winding

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.609 
is a our mechanical automatic winding
movement<00:02:01.549> based<00:02:02.479> on<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.720> job

movement based on the job

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.609 
movement based on the job
3300<00:02:04.759> move<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.909> up<00:02:06.030> front<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.229> get<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
3300 move it up front you get the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.070 
3300 move it up front you get the

go<00:02:35.280> either<00:02:35.400> way<00:02:35.519> you<00:02:36.480> see<00:02:36.690> how<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> hours<00:02:37.230> jump

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560

interesting<00:02:44.819> touch<00:02:44.940> about<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.390> machine<00:02:45.750> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
interesting touch about this machine is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.559 
interesting touch about this machine is
the<00:02:46.080> construction<00:02:46.769> of<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.920> case<00:02:47.420> what<00:02:48.420> you

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
the construction of the case what you

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.509 
the construction of the case what you
see<00:02:48.870> on<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:49.319> outside<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.280> you<00:02:50.400> could

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
see on the outside is what you could

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.220 
see on the outside is what you could
call<00:02:50.549> the<00:02:50.880> body<00:02:51.090> work<00:02:51.360> just<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.080> body

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230

work of a supercar inside this machine

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.699 
work of a supercar inside this machine
is<00:02:55.440> our<00:02:56.280> chassis<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.120> a<00:02:57.180> an<00:02:57.750> internal

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
is our chassis is a an internal

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.490 
is our chassis is a an internal
compartment<00:02:59.580> that's<00:03:00.209> absolutely<00:03:00.870> waterproof

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
compartment that's absolutely waterproof

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.880 
compartment that's absolutely waterproof
and<00:03:02.000> protects<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> movement<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:04.680> inner

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and protects the movement on this inner

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.640 
and protects the movement on this inner
container<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:06.060> screw<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.810> bodywork<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.350> top

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
container we screw the bodywork on top

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.789 
container we screw the bodywork on top
and<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.340> allows<00:03:08.579> us<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.910> change<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.359> as<00:03:09.989> often

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
and that allows us to change it as often

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.430 
and that allows us to change it as often
as<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.579> like<00:03:11.840> now<00:03:12.840> there's<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.230> little

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
as we like now there's one little

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.069 
as we like now there's one little
consequence<00:03:14.040> of<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.609> in<00:03:15.060> fact<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
consequence of that is that in fact the

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.050 
consequence of that is that in fact the
case<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.470> in<00:03:16.890> two<00:03:17.040> parts<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.579> i<00:03:17.730> said<00:03:17.790> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
case is in two parts as i said the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.849 
case is in two parts as i said the
internal<00:03:18.450> compartment<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.650> external

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
internal compartment and the external

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.960 
internal compartment and the external
body<00:03:20.160> work<00:03:20.370> if<00:03:21.350> you<00:03:22.350> open<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.040> flaps<00:03:23.459> like

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
body work if you open up the flaps like

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.300 
body work if you open up the flaps like
what<00:03:24.329> you<00:03:24.540> see<00:03:24.570> here<00:03:25.079> water<00:03:26.040> will<00:03:26.280> actually

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
what you see here water will actually

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.849 
what you see here water will actually
get<00:03:26.970> in<00:03:27.090> between<00:03:27.239> those<00:03:27.600> two<00:03:27.780> parts<00:03:28.140> that's

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
get in between those two parts that's

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.979 
get in between those two parts that's
not<00:03:29.130> a<00:03:29.160> problem<00:03:29.250> because<00:03:29.940> it<00:03:30.239> then<00:03:30.329> drains<00:03:30.750> out

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
not a problem because it then drains out

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:31.840 
not a problem because it then drains out
through<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.410> two<00:03:31.560> weeks

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850

all sports what you see here the back so
that's<00:03:35.170> designed<00:03:36.170> to<00:03:36.350> work<00:03:36.500> that<00:03:36.770> way<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.580> lot

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
that's designed to work that way a lot

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.270
