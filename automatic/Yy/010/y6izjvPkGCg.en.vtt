is how it works you grab your Rubik's

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.270 
is how it works you grab your Rubik's
Cube<00:00:09.929> we're<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.559> scramble<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> same

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
Cube we're going to scramble it the same

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.350 
Cube we're going to scramble it the same
and<00:00:11.490> we're<00:00:11.610> all<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.880> solve<00:00:12.090> it<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.269> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
and we're all going to solve it at the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.870 
and we're all going to solve it at the
same<00:00:12.540> time<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.830> can<00:00:13.980> use<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.340> timer<00:00:14.580> on

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
same time and you can use the timer on

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.730 
same time and you can use the timer on
the<00:00:15.089> screen<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.599> if<00:00:15.660> not<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.619> use

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
the screen and if not if you want to use

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.529 
the screen and if not if you want to use
a<00:00:16.770> real<00:00:16.980> timer<00:00:17.220> use<00:00:17.460> a<00:00:17.490> real<00:00:17.699> timer<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.359> also

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
a real timer use a real timer you also

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.019 
a real timer use a real timer you also
go<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> cube<00:00:19.350> timer<00:00:19.619> calm<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.400> use<00:00:20.789> their

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
go to cube timer calm and use their

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.970 
go to cube timer calm and use their
timer<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.630> anyway<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.500> should<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.740> fine<00:00:22.890> I'll

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
timer and anyway it should be fine I'll

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.470 
timer and anyway it should be fine I'll
have<00:00:23.130> my<00:00:23.279> timer<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.699> throughout<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.180> rest<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
have my timer go throughout the rest of

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.240 
have my timer go throughout the rest of
the<00:00:24.600> video<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.470> guys<00:00:25.650> can<00:00:25.949> use<00:00:25.980> it

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the video so that you guys can use it

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040 
the video so that you guys can use it
and<00:00:26.400> if<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.760> solvent<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.330> know<00:00:27.420> maybe<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and if it you solvent you know maybe a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.900 
and if it you solvent you know maybe a
minute<00:00:28.289> or<00:00:28.560> longer<00:00:28.920> maybe<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.490> need<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> use

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
minute or longer maybe you need to use

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.130 
minute or longer maybe you need to use
another<00:00:30.150> timer<00:00:30.420> because<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.779> video<00:00:30.990> might

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
another timer because the video might

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.110 
another timer because the video might
end<00:00:31.320> I'm<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.219> how<00:00:32.340> long<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> video<00:00:32.910> will

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
end I'm not sure how long the video will

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
end I'm not sure how long the video will
be<00:00:33.239> anyway<00:00:33.570> let's<00:00:34.140> jump<00:00:34.410> into<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.710> so<00:00:34.980> what

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
be anyway let's jump into it so what

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.260 
be anyway let's jump into it so what
you're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> want<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> hold

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
you're going to do is you want to hold

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.729 
you're going to do is you want to hold
your<00:00:36.510> green<00:00:36.780> side<00:00:36.989> facing<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.620> white

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
your green side facing you the white

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.990 
your green side facing you the white
side<00:00:37.980> facing<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> we're<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> do<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
side facing up and we're going to do the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
side facing up and we're going to do the
scrambling<00:00:39.420> algorithm<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.290> don't<00:00:40.469> know

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
scrambling algorithm if you don't know

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440 
scrambling algorithm if you don't know
how<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> do<00:00:41.489> notation<00:00:41.940> that's<00:00:42.059> okay<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.390> can

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
how to do notation that's okay you can

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150 
how to do notation that's okay you can
follow<00:00:42.719> along<00:00:42.809> although<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.440> go<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:44.040> of

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
follow along although I do go kind of

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
follow along although I do go kind of
fast<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.730> anyway<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.809> let's<00:00:46.260> do<00:00:46.469> right

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
fast so anyway here we go let's do right

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.029 
fast so anyway here we go let's do right

don't<00:01:20.909> look<00:01:21.000> at<00:01:21.150> your<00:01:21.270> cube<00:01:21.509> we're<00:01:21.630> going<00:01:21.750> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
don't look at your cube we're going to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
don't look at your cube we're going to
have<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> fifteen<00:01:22.770> second<00:01:23.130> inspection<00:01:23.340> time

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
have a fifteen second inspection time

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
have a fifteen second inspection time
and<00:01:24.060> then<00:01:24.450> we're<00:01:24.570> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.720> solve<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.049> but

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
and then we're going to solve it but

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.179 
and then we're going to solve it but
before<00:01:25.470> we<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.830> should<00:01:26.009> probably

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
before we do that you should probably

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.620 
before we do that you should probably
let's<00:01:26.520> check<00:01:26.759> our<00:01:26.909> cubes<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.360> sure<00:01:27.479> they

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
let's check our cubes make sure they

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.300 
let's check our cubes make sure they
look<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.900> same<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.619> have<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.740> green<00:01:29.009> side

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
look the same we have the green side

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.210 
look the same we have the green side
with<00:01:29.490> white<00:01:29.700> facing<00:01:30.090> up<00:01:30.210> looks<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:30.689> this<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
with white facing up looks like this and

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.600 
with white facing up looks like this and
then<00:01:32.220> here's<00:01:32.880> red<00:01:33.180> with<00:01:33.360> white<00:01:33.509> facing<00:01:33.900> up

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
then here's red with white facing up

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.359 
then here's red with white facing up
blue<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.939> white<00:01:36.119> facing<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:37.159> orange<00:01:38.159> with

blue with white facing up orange with
white<00:01:38.400> facing<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.320> green<00:01:40.320> we<00:01:40.799> already<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.159> at

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
white facing up green we already look at

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.679 
white facing up green we already look at
that<00:01:41.430> white<00:01:41.610> facing<00:01:41.970> up<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.119> here's<00:01:42.479> white

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
with green facing up okay so Hydra cube

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.429 
with green facing up okay so Hydra cube
we're<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.740> 15<00:01:50.700> seconds<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.439> we

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
we're going to have 15 seconds and we

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.260 
we're going to have 15 seconds and we
that's<00:01:52.770> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.100> 15<00:01:53.460> seconds<00:01:53.729> we'll<00:01:54.000> start

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
that's kind of 15 seconds we'll start

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.399 
that's kind of 15 seconds we'll start
right<00:01:54.450> now

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
right now

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
right now
so<00:01:55.799> inspect<00:01:56.159> your<00:01:56.250> cube<00:01:56.490> all<00:01:57.149> right<00:01:57.299> here<00:01:57.420> we

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
so inspect your cube all right here we

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.459 
so inspect your cube all right here we
go<00:01:58.549> hmm<00:01:59.610> I'll<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.810> solving<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> red<00:02:01.290> side

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
go hmm I'll be solving the red side

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.340 
go hmm I'll be solving the red side
first<00:02:01.680> I'm<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.189> solve<00:02:02.399> corners<00:02:02.700> first<00:02:03.350> I'm

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
first I'm gonna solve corners first I'm

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.119 
first I'm gonna solve corners first I'm
using<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.979> dayan<00:02:05.369> guhong<00:02:05.630> stickerless<00:02:07.129> three

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
using a dayan guhong stickerless three

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
inspection but I never do okay let's see

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.740 
inspection but I never do okay let's see
I<00:02:23.020> forget<00:02:24.020> that<00:02:24.170> algorithm<00:02:24.620> so<00:02:24.860> up<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.340> two

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
I forget that algorithm so up to two

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.990 
I forget that algorithm so up to two
instead<00:02:26.750> of<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:30.230> cube<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.800> kind<00:02:31.070> of<00:02:31.130> have

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
instead of one this cube is kind of have

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.750 
instead of one this cube is kind of have
it<00:02:32.120> have<00:02:32.210> been<00:02:32.360> played<00:02:32.600> with<00:02:32.630> for<00:02:33.020> a<00:02:33.080> while

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
it have been played with for a while

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.510 
it have been played with for a while
it's<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.820> little<00:02:35.000> crunchy

one thing I really like about them is

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.120 
one thing I really like about them is
that<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.520> can<00:02:55.760> shoot<00:02:56.060> them<00:02:56.209> pretty<00:02:56.480> quickly<00:02:56.750> and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
know maybe some speed cubers in the

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.020 
know maybe some speed cubers in the
future<00:03:24.050> or<00:03:24.290> who<00:03:24.769> knows<00:03:25.010> it<00:03:25.550> could<00:03:25.700> be<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:25.820> lot<00:03:26.000> of

on when she learns how to solve a

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.910 
on when she learns how to solve a
Rubik's<00:03:29.480> Cube<00:03:29.540> we<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:29.900> race<00:03:30.050> with<00:03:30.260> her<00:03:30.410> so

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
Rubik's Cube we can race with her so

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.800
