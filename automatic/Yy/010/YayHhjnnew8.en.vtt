00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:10.300
 so hello to everyone we continue Akimichi 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:14.880
 the stove will show what's next for the stove 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:18.190
 I need to tell you now 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.529
 scraps I need a wire well I took 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:25.240
 10 meters I always take with a margin to 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:28.960
 but don't mess it out 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:32.109
 positive wire is like meters for mass 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.949
 Well , I suppose that for the masses a lot and 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:37.269
 don't need this resistor this thing 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:41.530
 how to explain to you 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:43.239
 it will in principle be installed where 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.069
 then somewhere here here here it is necessary to have 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:49.179
 will supply and power specifically 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:53.079
 the stove is for the inscription 

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:56.739
 switched momentum then there will be two 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:01.769
 positions average turns and big 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:05.140
 there is a well, so let her be on 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:08.530
 further need need blades 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.939
 surely such screeds are for this 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.200
 30 centimeter inside to 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:19.299
 roll up all the wires 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:21.130
 let's say yes here and under itself 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.640
 cars there too here when to lay 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.689
 wires 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.840
 hoses will be there it turns out that they are you 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.600
 in any need and corrugation coffer for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.939
 what in order to have wires where 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 got not hung but they were something even 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:41.619
 specially protected 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.829
 Here is such a special little thing I tap 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.030
 I will install it but I have not thought it out yet 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:51.130
 I did not consider this situation so well I 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.700
 I think it's better to install it somewhere 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.799
 here here is cut and set 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.159
 this is to 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.810
 bleed the air here the stove itself well then 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:07.119
 eat it will be the highest. 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:08.830
 it turns out not to be the day that's airborne 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.040
 I understand that the pump can push through 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.450
 such a stove but in some places for 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.099
 air is special 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:21.160
 gathered here such then how to become 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.190
 bleed air he is with me 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.650
 from the little choke it in order to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.860
 here it's already ran this salt Nutty 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 with air to a big patient big 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.510
 on 18 fittings 2 pieces and tee tee 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.450
 and the crane itself the crane itself in my German 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.480
 and very good advised me 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.060
 it is this here that is actually further 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.950
 Further on we climb under the car now I will show 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.950
 how I have everything installed here 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.200
 that we have a car machine we see two 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 hose 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:05.750
 I specially warmed them so they went to 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:09.970
 I can see that so yes here as if on 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.970
 I attached an extra pump to the frame 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.730
 should be seen so here it turns out 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.160
 this u this already comes back the hose here 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:27.380
 this one here it is he goes for the return and 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:32.530
 comes into the engine and here it is 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:38.320
 and went it i will connect to the engine already and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:42.780
 I will collect matches from the return line 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:50.060
 hose so what's a hose so 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:52.560
 it's me to you then now it's me to you 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.100
 shows as i now have on 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.100
 this stage 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.709
 here 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:10.270
 Basically all I think later well 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.270
 probably the video next
