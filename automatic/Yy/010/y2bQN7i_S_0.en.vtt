00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.360
 Yes 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.880
 welcome to friends minecraft pocket 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.490
 is here and this time it is like her 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.189
 stefan cheek too but for the 1 point 4.4 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.710
 yes this one seemed and wants this server 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.380
 There is not that much at all 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.020
 say why did it happen so fast 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.190
 yes it is because of this in this 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.870
 update are actually just 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.820
 bugfixes and of course that for 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.440
 the strong team not even that way 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.360
 a lot to do like now with the others 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.880
 versions for example at the 1.4 point 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.010
 two who bake themselves on the point 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.559
 crime scenes are then on or netways 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.149
 gone down here and then right here 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.250
 to get to the block with picture what 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:56.739
 Just to say something important first 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:01:00.160
 Yes, now it will be exciting rica mpls 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.600
 the still green and it's good you may 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.180
 drive through the traffic lights 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920
 yes that's how ricard picture you own 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.470
 rarely only grow and are very 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.240
 are very good at running the beta build 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.010
 of course, better again and that 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.780
 worst of this picture in 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.030
 quotes seen with the block 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.380
 picture that simply the version the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.050
 developer version probably still bugs 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.760
 be tested where he still resonates 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.860
 Write comes where he still finds bugs 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.020
 sometimes the ram utilization is on 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 a bit higher but others are 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.440
 No things bucket takes at all 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.840
 no liability whatsoever in the area 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.180
 in this picture 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.980
 but if you really wanted me 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.900
 I want to play my god on the 1 point 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.970
 4.4 then he just goes to load yourself 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.040
 this version down and have your fun 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.150
 so if you always wait two days 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.010
 then yes actually already like that 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.750
 sure you 're looking for signs 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.060
 bigger servers are already on everyone 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.950
 fall where you can not use 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.780
 just play with your friends on it 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.220
 of course you can already do it now 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.200
 I already know server right now 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.260
 have updated and then said yes we 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.180
 do it immediately and the user of course 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.740
 Of course this is then a user thing 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.080
 so that the user as fast as possible 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.649
 skip to your server yes if you 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.750
 know how I mean that so we load ourselves 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.800
 now the sneaky picture down me 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.540
 I do not want to be like that anymore 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.709
 complicates the video you like the 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.080
 last time because I'm only three 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.450
 Weeks create a server video 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.950
 I uploaded the link which 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.270
 because I'll explain everything to you if you 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.520
 still 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.840
 also no idea with back it up now 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.660
 I just show you how to do it all 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.490
 down he loads very exciting things 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.380
 and how to then in the other 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.180
 backend server in the old how to do that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.910
 maybe updated shortly 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.500
 the starting point parties but the rest 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.060
 still has no idea about it 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.870
 then please look at the video to what 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.880
 I linked now so ok then would have 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.590
 I also ask the clarified ever we 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.790
 invite us all down, I have in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.380
 Done in the case she finds out 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.740
 my desktop this part is called 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.700
 totally funny yes power package beta 1.4 me 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.770
 I have something behind him now 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.970
 written because I actually 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.910
 already renamed has been renamed 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.340
 no matter that's called weird disney 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.520
 file under second download link 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.300
 what shows city bath prada part 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.600
 to adjust 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.520
 jaha understood well so i did 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.650
 your old server and you are now 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.980
 only 9 go on 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.050
 a tactical starting point for bad files 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.490
 I'm so in the mood today 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.410
 slip of the tongue 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.130
 a pact ii after here in my budget 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.130
 server c 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.510
 what like me can play a no that 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.190
 no problem at all 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.930
 we have to get the power package now 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.720
 renamed call that we see here too 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.280
 with jeff powerpack point yes how can 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.490
 they do not find and we have to in 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.220
 Just change the case by using his 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.290
 make bucket and then done 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.220
 that it automatically celebrates year is 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.110
 yes, this year too was a symbol 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.090
 and when we start the whole thing 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.770
 yes it worked great, I'm glad it 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.150
 it works out now, the whole thing still needs 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.360
 start faster faster faster 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.370
 faster faster faster 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:11.580
 yes I'm a bit freaky today 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.590
 but no matter how finished we have that 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.810
 completely done and our budget a little bit 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.239
 finished we made it challenge 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.739
 complete yes and here is our plugins 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.470
 folder we all know that and you can 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.510
 be quite normal so make plugins 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.860
 but if you still gamble 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.720
 an old server you have to, for example 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.419
 Server means all plugins 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.890
 installed everything ready set 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.940
 then it is not a problem at all 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.280
 just go here 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.890
 take you pulls the force bake kia the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.040
 over and click on different 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.630
 finish now you can completely 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.380
 normal us but everything starts again 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.900
 works just fine 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.210
 why is there no 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.040
 error message sets that even 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.620
 educate the console is it at all 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.080
 no error message entered here 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.160
 so far and it will not 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.710
 I can promise you more 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.000
 no error message in the whole loose 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.360
 I can give you that big one 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.960
 show everything properly collected 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.130
 written down and you can 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.390
 but now use it as normal because you 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.400
 do you have to imagine it that way I 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.380
 does not know if we know that from word 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.150
 or from other things in the newest 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.010
 you can always program so in the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.750
 latest in the case i say i 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.590
 explain you differently fits you too 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.440
 now your server 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.210
 you have a plug in from 1990 and now 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.650
 have the server of 2010 then you can 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:30.270
 at 2010 still the plugins of 1990 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.950
 but it still works 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.110
 other not so that's now 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.120
 their server from 1990 but plugins from 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.380
 2010 the completely different new things 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.540
 then you can not use that 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.890
 plugins on the old to cover that 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.870
 So always up to date 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.810
 stay and the plugins we will too 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.640
 so it looked exactly like it was coming 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.530
 now some very big ones 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.840
 Changes where it needs to be where the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.300
 whole must be changed than the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.380
 whole source code or other things 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.790
 but that is normal the work 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.350
 all because otherwise it looks like chatting 

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.510
 and just throw out the plug-in 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.490
 that's it on the whole 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.410
 this video i 'm watching 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:14.220
 Have a nice day and say there 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.940
 times until your people have fun with your 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:16.940
 own server
