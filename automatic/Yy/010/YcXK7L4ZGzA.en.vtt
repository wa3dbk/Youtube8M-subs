00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.610
 the pope speaks beauty train guys with you 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.160
 another personal video 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.109
 in this video is a novelty yard 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.230
 From today I'm doing mine. 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:32.059
 videos with a small set of free 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.690
 the vehicle is watching there, do not govern 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.949
 new channel is grown bank made the werley 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.360
 he's thinking and not long ago and 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.800
 Did you do it for me? 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.530
 Nice thing is that I really 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.930
 I wanted and what time will you have to 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.899
 also copycat of the shameful that is well 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.820
 Look how much I wanted to say what I wanted 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.789
 watch because I really liked guessing 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.960
 interesting very pretty and this on 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.610
 I really want to bring you with the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.280
 channel was dangerous 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.100
 the video was much more dynamic with this 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.840
 So it will be legal or post matters and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.750
 they are living but it's a good thing 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.360
 interesting in this personal video about the 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.470
 new colleague of yuri is the changes in 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.400
 then I think that the game has changed 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.650
 enough 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.900
 It is now no longer only 27 had an edit 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.090
 is to be less competitive than 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.090
 People are using it a lot. It 's a 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.340
 about very good 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.100
 formerly only 27 the game because it was 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.930
 so well treated but at the last pet was in the 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.630
 my opinion the greatest pet of all 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.090
 cup time and because it has changed 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.880
 really quite a thing and changed the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:50.299
 game mechanic really now 27 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.840
 took in the strongest ambition the strongest 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.670
 he really knows you see that you had 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.710
 really the best booth biggest bank was 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.390
 the fm a reason why increased 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.890
 mainly yields 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.979
 so you can trade 27 sometimes long 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.320
 distance is very complicated but this 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.170
 really changes the game's dynamics very much 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:21.230
 because they now usually have a 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.940
 team playing with 2 to 1 and 2 bal then 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.980
 It's much better to defend who is inside. 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.019
 hp to a mere advantage since it is 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.019
 with sm1 that the priest has very high pace 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.760
 and it really is very good on the field does 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:35.090
 pee in the field ahead 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.110
 so as I was saying the game has changed 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.420
 enough 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.980
 you most currents of opinion technical 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.140
 hp also who is within the goal 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.590
 can make plays more easily 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.170
 with the sub 40,000 in the case 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.709
 a lot has changed exposing ht changed 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.450
 also with this way then the position to 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.970
 extinct the figure of the anchor is more 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.069
 respected by the end of the game is that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.920
 has lied at the time to a person the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.319
 team will be on the other side of the map almost 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.299
 main opposite and I asked 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.829
 that modifying also has no way of 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.609
 plus you throw the ball a lot 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:15.890
 far by 4 can be done as long as this 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:17.599
 your team standing the spanish pep changed 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.549
 enough is also very excited 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.849
 many people complaining and saying that the 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.220
 cetep will get out of rotation do not know what 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.380
 I have not had much of a major problem yet. 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.700
 but it 's a strong rumor and we'll see what 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.169
 It happens, I just hope that in my 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.269
 opinion was very good 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:35.090
 It's the only thing that carries the same was 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.709
 rafael flat out but rafa balancing 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.690
 and I quite enjoyed this 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:44.150
 cool new release and has more 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.459
 fun that he already is but basically is 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.859
 This is how people can see the whole 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.859
 I now put the appliance on 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.769
 Monday and human are my days 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:56.480
 you may notice that the voice may be 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.940
 A little strange I do not know why I do not 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.489
 I'm listening, but you're watching the 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.510
 video may notice a difference my voice 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:07.220
 I'm sorry if I have this way I do not know anymore 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.359
 The machine is kind of difficult for me. 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.950
 accustom 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.810
 I'm eating very little of the boys. 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.280
 because it really hurts but get to that 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.510
 ceiling is who has appliances knows how it is 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.229
 what is the suffering in the first days 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.199
 but there personal by the presence and I hope 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.940
 you like this video and and prevents here in 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.849
 channel from today onwards 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.510
 They will be in the style of this video right here 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.610
 folks 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.930
 basically it binds in all 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.599
 links and description that I always say 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.990
 There are important things worth talking about and even 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.990
 the video itself 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.990
 O
