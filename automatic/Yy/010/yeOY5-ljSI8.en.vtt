00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
with tire selection and he says no one

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.470 
with tire selection and he says no one
thing<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.400> they<00:02:42.489> had<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.760> their<00:02:42.850> benefit<00:02:43.300> is

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
thing that they had in their benefit is

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.030 
thing that they had in their benefit is
that<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.230> track<00:02:44.440> temperature<00:02:44.590> right<00:02:44.890> now<00:02:44.920> is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
that the track temperature right now is

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.809 
that the track temperature right now is
34<00:02:45.519> degrees

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
34 degrees

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.600 
34 degrees
last<00:02:46.750> year<00:02:46.959> was<00:02:47.140> 38<00:02:47.530> degrees<00:02:47.890> and<00:02:48.489> they're

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
last year was 38 degrees and they're

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.190 
last year was 38 degrees and they're
basically<00:02:48.760> using<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.269> similar<00:02:49.540> tire<00:02:49.780> to<00:02:50.080> what

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
basically using the similar tire to what

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.020 
basically using the similar tire to what
they<00:02:50.290> ran<00:02:50.440> last<00:02:50.680> year<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.010> that's<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.340> benefit

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
they ran last year so that's the benefit

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.750 
they ran last year so that's the benefit
of<00:02:52.090> knowing<00:02:52.500> when<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> come<00:02:53.769> to<00:02:53.890> a<00:02:53.920> track<00:02:54.610> that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
of knowing when you come to a track that

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.850 
of knowing when you come to a track that
we've<00:02:54.880> already<00:02:55.000> been<00:02:55.209> to<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.620> don't

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
we've already been to so they don't

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.710 
we've already been to so they don't
don't<00:02:57.250> suspect<00:02:57.430> any<00:02:57.850> any<00:02:58.239> sort<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.540> tire

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
don't suspect any any sort of tire

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.360 
don't suspect any any sort of tire
problem<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.319> let's<00:02:59.560> just<00:02:59.709> hope<00:02:59.830> out<00:03:00.010> that<00:03:00.250> it's

that<00:04:35.919> they<00:04:36.010> did<00:04:36.280> make<00:04:36.460> an<00:04:36.580> adjustment<00:04:36.840> they

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
that they did make an adjustment they

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.600 
that they did make an adjustment they
did<00:04:37.990> not<00:04:38.169> equal<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.620> time<00:04:38.830> in<00:04:39.130> this<00:04:39.280> morning's

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
did not equal the time in this morning's

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.129 
did not equal the time in this morning's
warm-up<00:04:39.940> as<00:04:40.060> what<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.360> pole<00:04:40.539> position<00:04:40.690> was

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
warm-up as what the pole position was

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:42.600 
warm-up as what the pole position was
and<00:04:41.680> they<00:04:41.800> felt<00:04:42.010> that<00:04:42.070> they<00:04:42.160> could<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.430> better

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
and they felt that they could be better

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.920 
and they felt that they could be better
so<00:04:42.789> they've<00:04:42.940> gone<00:04:43.060> back<00:04:43.300> to<00:04:43.479> what<00:04:43.630> they<00:04:43.750> know

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
so they've gone back to what they know

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.300 
so they've gone back to what they know
and<00:04:44.820> we'll<00:04:45.820> see<00:04:45.940> what<00:04:46.060> happens<00:04:46.389> the<00:04:46.570> other<00:04:47.310> the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
and we'll see what happens the other the

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.159 
and we'll see what happens the other the
front<00:04:48.550> row<00:04:48.699> is<00:04:48.940> Max<00:04:49.180> Biaggi<00:04:49.479> I<00:04:49.690> still<00:04:49.960> think

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
front row is Max Biaggi I still think

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:51.779 
front row is Max Biaggi I still think
that<00:04:50.229> he<00:04:50.440> could<00:04:50.740> be<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.070> dark<00:04:51.280> horse<00:04:51.490> in<00:04:51.699> this

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
that he could be the dark horse in this

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.870 
that he could be the dark horse in this
race<00:04:51.849> again<00:04:52.330> like<00:04:52.539> last<00:04:52.570> week<00:04:53.500> you<00:04:54.310> know<00:04:54.699> he

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880
