00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
think we've got a really good bunch of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.330 
think we've got a really good bunch of
st.<00:00:18.570> your<00:00:18.689> Indian<00:00:18.990> players<00:00:19.340> international

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.010 
st. your Indian players international
players<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.849> perhaps<00:00:21.090> our<00:00:21.270> most<00:00:21.419> exciting

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
players and perhaps our most exciting

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.300 
players and perhaps our most exciting
part<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.289> our<00:00:22.439> team<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.829> their<00:00:22.980> younger

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
part of our team is their younger

part of our team is their younger
players<00:00:23.579> I<00:00:23.820> think<00:00:24.029> if<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:24.270> play<00:00:24.480> their<00:00:24.750> full

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
players I think if they play their full

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
players I think if they play their full
potential<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.710> get<00:00:25.890> them<00:00:26.070> playing<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
potential and we get them playing the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.550 
potential and we get them playing the
exciting<00:00:27.599> brand<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> cricket<00:00:28.169> that<00:00:28.289> we'd<00:00:28.410> like

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.090 

I<00:01:10.510> think<00:01:11.510> paid<00:01:11.630> positive<00:01:12.110> from<00:01:12.230> Baldwin<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:12.830> a

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
I think paid positive from Baldwin is a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.950 
I think paid positive from Baldwin is a
good<00:01:13.760> way<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.910> get<00:01:14.030> on<00:01:14.120> top<00:01:14.330> of<00:01:14.360> the<00:01:14.480> opposition

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
good way to get on top of the opposition

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.080 
good way to get on top of the opposition
and<00:01:15.170> I<00:01:15.740> really<00:01:16.400> put<00:01:16.550> it<00:01:16.640> back<00:01:16.790> on<00:01:16.910> there

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and I really put it back on there

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.880 
and I really put it back on there
because<00:01:17.390> that's<00:01:18.230> what<00:01:18.350> teaching<00:01:18.560> is<00:01:18.710> all

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
because that's what teaching is all

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.380 
because that's what teaching is all
about<00:01:19.160> it<00:01:19.280> swings<00:01:19.520> around<00:01:19.610> a<00:01:19.880> lot<00:01:20.030> of<00:01:20.060> momentum

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
about it swings around a lot of momentum

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.180 
about it swings around a lot of momentum
I<00:01:20.900> think<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.440> think<00:01:21.650> there's<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.830> top<00:01:22.040> water

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:22.190 
I think I think there's a top water

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.330 
I think I think there's a top water
batter<00:01:23.800> especially<00:01:24.800> when<00:01:24.920> you<00:01:25.010> go<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.190> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
batter especially when you go in the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.100 
batter especially when you go in the
first<00:01:25.490> six<00:01:25.790> your<00:01:26.000> job<00:01:26.270> is<00:01:26.420> to<00:01:26.540> put<00:01:26.690> pressure<00:01:26.960> on

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
first six your job is to put pressure on

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.690 
first six your job is to put pressure on
the<00:01:27.170> opposition<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:27.740> really<00:01:28.220> set<00:01:28.460> up<00:01:28.550> the

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the opposition and really set up the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.640 
the opposition and really set up the
platform<00:01:28.910> for<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.420> last<00:01:29.660> few<00:01:29.870> overs<00:01:30.200> so<00:01:30.230> I

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
platform for the last few overs so I

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.770 
platform for the last few overs so I
don't<00:01:31.250> think<00:01:31.730> about<00:01:31.820> how<00:01:32.090> many<00:01:32.270> times<00:01:32.480> I<00:01:32.660> go

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
don't think about how many times I go

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.270 
don't think about how many times I go
out<00:01:32.960> or<00:01:33.170> anything<00:01:33.320> like<00:01:33.470> that<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:33.680> just<00:01:34.070> try<00:01:34.250> and

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
out or anything like that I just try and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.830 
out or anything like that I just try and
play<00:01:34.520> as<00:01:34.580> many<00:01:34.790> shots<00:01:35.090> as<00:01:35.210> possible<00:01:35.300> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
play as many shots as possible and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.810 
play as many shots as possible and
really<00:01:36.530> test<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:36.890> boundaries<00:01:37.220> of<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:37.580> and

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
really test the boundaries of what and

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.359 
really test the boundaries of what and
you<00:01:38.270> can<00:01:38.480> do<00:01:38.690> in<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.500> next<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:39.979> when<00:01:40.280> you

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
you can do in the next and then when you

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:41.500 
you can do in the next and then when you
get<00:01:40.520> into<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.760> middle<00:01:40.940> obviously<00:01:41.390> you've

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
get into the middle obviously you've

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.300 
get into the middle obviously you've
applied<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.140> situation<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:42.860> trying<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.220> the
