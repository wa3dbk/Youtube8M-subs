this is a part five of our basic
training<00:00:04.589> for<00:00:04.879> tidy<00:00:05.879> pushin<00:00:06.629> you<00:00:07.620> should<00:00:07.799> have

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
training for tidy pushin you should have

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.520 
training for tidy pushin you should have
watched<00:00:08.250> our<00:00:08.580> previous<00:00:08.970> video<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:10.320> make<00:00:10.500> sure

helpful to you can someone else make
more<00:00:32.520> mistake<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.329> pony<00:00:33.600> eg<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.340> someone

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
more mistake on the pony eg on someone

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:59.780 
more mistake on the pony eg on someone
else<00:00:35.520> practice<00:00:36.120> yeah

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.350 

they're<00:01:00.790> being<00:01:01.060> forward<00:01:02.070> its<00:01:03.070> position<00:01:03.790> is

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
they're being forward its position is

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.310 
they're being forward its position is
clearly<00:01:04.809> leaning<00:01:05.320> forward<00:01:06.070> in<00:01:06.610> angle<00:01:07.320> instead

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
clearly leaning forward in angle instead

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
feeling different right yeah you can

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:58.750 
feeling different right yeah you can
find<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.860> treasure<00:01:51.369> in<00:01:51.729> between

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.540 

you<00:01:59.760> see<00:01:59.970> the<00:02:00.150> pressure<00:02:00.450> increases<00:02:01.550> he's

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
you see the pressure increases he's

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.810 
you see the pressure increases he's
hiding<00:02:02.970> out<00:02:03.120> here<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.870> forward<00:02:04.460> now<00:02:05.460> don't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
hiding out here and in forward now don't

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.430 
hiding out here and in forward now don't
lean<00:02:06.000> forward<00:02:06.590> lean<00:02:07.590> your<00:02:08.009> body<00:02:08.700> weight<00:02:09.060> here

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
lean forward lean your body weight here

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.070 
lean forward lean your body weight here
your<00:02:10.440> tailbone<00:02:10.800> goes<00:02:11.250> in<00:02:11.870> no<00:02:12.870> printer<00:02:13.350> tenure

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
your tailbone goes in no printer tenure

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.699 
your tailbone goes in no printer tenure
that's<00:02:16.080> this<00:02:16.740> house<00:02:17.190> we<00:02:18.150> gonna<00:02:18.720> get<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.320> that's

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
that's this house we gonna get it that's

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:20.780 
that's this house we gonna get it that's
what<00:02:19.950> we<00:02:20.220> want

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
what we want

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.479 
what we want
you're<00:02:21.510> moving<00:02:21.780> your<00:02:22.020> body<00:02:22.380> in<00:02:22.590> but<00:02:23.250> no

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
you're moving your body in but no

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.150 
you're moving your body in but no
pressure<00:02:23.790> engineer<00:02:24.630> which<00:02:25.410> means<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.890> have

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
pressure engineer which means you have

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.110 
pressure engineer which means you have
to<00:02:26.310> loosen<00:02:26.520> up<00:02:26.880> all<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.180> joint<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.640> legend

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
to loosen up all the joint the legend

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.390 
to loosen up all the joint the legend
using<00:02:33.570> our<00:02:33.750> leaning<00:02:34.380> forward<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.950> gradual

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
using our leaning forward the gradual

00:02:35.400 --> 00:03:50.020 
using our leaning forward the gradual
increase<00:02:41.870> find<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.050> open<00:02:43.410> position

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:04:25.880 

people<00:03:51.030> doing<00:03:54.020> this<00:03:55.020> because<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:56.610> body<00:04:24.890> all

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
people doing this because this body all

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.460 
people doing this because this body all
the<00:04:26.220> tiny<00:04:26.490> action<00:04:27.210> all<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.510> push<00:04:27.930> yet<00:04:28.170> demo

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
the tiny action all the push yet demo

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.630 
the tiny action all the push yet demo
it's<00:04:29.160> because<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:31.220> so<00:04:32.220> while<00:04:32.460> they're

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
it's because this so while they're

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.320 
it's because this so while they're
training<00:04:32.970> everyone<00:04:34.130> would<00:04:35.130> always<00:04:35.250> look<00:04:35.970> for

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
training everyone would always look for

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:43.250 
training everyone would always look for
that<00:04:36.360> no<00:04:37.080> matter<00:04:37.320> how<00:04:37.740> aware<00:04:38.190> move<00:04:40.250> like
