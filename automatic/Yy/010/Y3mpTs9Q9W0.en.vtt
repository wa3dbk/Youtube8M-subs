00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.529
 hello in this video tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.679
 teach how to make a bag pick up 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.749
 pockets with 100% recyclable materials is 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.700
 very useful because I will not touch them jce new 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:16.160
 of plastic and the impact it will cause 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.960
 nature is much smaller for 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.970
 to do it we will need a publicity of 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.730
 40 by 30 wide and high 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.120
 respectively a cardboard not very 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.120
 flimsy 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.850
 a scissors ruler 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:38.079
 a pen and homemade glue that stops 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.050
 do it you will need to remove only 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:43.510
 one or two tablespoons of flour and 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:47.020
 very little water to create a mass 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.430
 thickens the glue that does not pollute 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.190
 when we have all the materials 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.830
 ready we apply a little bit of glue on 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.860
 two sides of advertising in the middle 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.590
 wider is to say this and in the more 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.190
 small is creating a perpendicular 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.059
 between the two sides 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.059
 I'm going to do it 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.820
 when using the glue try to have 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.359
 an advertisement below to not stain the 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.359
 table with this 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.470
 ready now we close 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.350
 we press a little 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.350
 because it has 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.660
 and good 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.090
 at the end of this step we will cut two 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.950
 rectangles 10 59 50 width and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.110
 height respectively or the size that 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.000
 you want 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.180
 since we will need it to handle the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.920
 bag now we stick the wider end 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.760
 of a card in the opening of the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.610
 advertising for example this 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.970
 and we repeat the process in the other 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.970
 opening 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.020
 and the other one goes here 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.020
 A) Yes 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.660
 and now 2 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.660
 Y 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 do not 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.460
 very well now to finish we will add 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.990
 two small cuts to advertising 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.850
 right next to each end of the 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.850
 cardboard using the scissors 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:04.720
 we remember here since here 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.720
 one 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.310
 to 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.519
 we wait for a note and we hope some 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.519
 hours 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.329
 Y 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.810
 we will have our bag made with 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:28.229
 100% recyclable materials to use 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.229
 correctly just here 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.919
 st carlos the pardons 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.919
 open 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.350
 and collect the prize 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.280
 cast 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.700
 simply when throwing it 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.639
 make a small opening in the mouse 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.770
 Bend 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.690

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.169
