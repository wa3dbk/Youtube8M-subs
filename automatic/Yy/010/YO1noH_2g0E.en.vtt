deep<00:00:59.120> spread<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> tank<00:01:00.539> top<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:00.960> cut<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
deep spread out the tank top and cut the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
deep spread out the tank top and cut the
strap<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:03.539> same<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.840> not<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.110> center<00:01:04.379> of

strap the same is not in the center of
the<00:01:04.530> strap<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.670> little<00:01:05.880> towards<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> back

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the strap it's a little towards the back

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240 
the strap it's a little towards the back
so<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.290> went<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.650> less<00:01:07.860> than<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.130> inch

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
so we went a little less than an inch

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
so we went a little less than an inch
behind<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.000> seam<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.630> two<00:01:09.840> inches<00:01:10.110> in

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
behind the seam about two inches in

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
behind the seam about two inches in
front<00:01:10.290> we<00:01:10.979> removed<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.430> three<00:01:11.760> inches<00:01:11.970> of

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
front we removed about three inches of

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.590 
front we removed about three inches of
cloth<00:01:13.490> use<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.670> first<00:01:14.880> piece<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.210> cut<00:01:15.390> as<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
cloth use the first piece you cut as a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.420 
cloth use the first piece you cut as a
guide<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.380> where<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> cut<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> second<00:01:17.310> piece

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
guide on where to cut the second piece

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.070 
guide on where to cut the second piece
so<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.880> cut<00:01:18.060> an<00:01:18.210> even<00:01:18.450> amount<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.840> each

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
so that you cut an even amount of each

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
so that you cut an even amount of each
side<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> balanced<00:01:20.610> tank<00:01:20.790> top<00:01:20.939> you

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
side and get a balanced tank top you

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.649 
side and get a balanced tank top you
don't<00:01:21.119> want<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.600> lopsided<00:01:23.330> now<00:01:24.330> it's<00:01:24.509> time

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
don't want to be lopsided now it's time

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.530 
don't want to be lopsided now it's time
so<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> cut<00:01:25.530> ends<00:01:25.799> together<00:01:26.270> with<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.390> shirt

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
so the cut ends together with the shirt

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.109

make it even if applicable here we

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359 
make it even if applicable here we
angled<00:01:45.570> about<00:01:45.869> half<00:01:46.110> inch<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.530> cloth<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.189> cut

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
angled about half inch of cloth we cut

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.789 
angled about half inch of cloth we cut
off<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> angled<00:01:48.180> about<00:01:48.360> two<00:01:48.540> inches<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.770> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
off and we angled about two inches so it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.499 
off and we angled about two inches so it
is<00:01:50.009> even<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.430> just<00:01:50.579> curl<00:01:50.759> right<00:01:50.970> over<00:01:51.299> so

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is even it just curl right over so

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.440 
is even it just curl right over so
there's<00:01:51.659> no<00:01:51.840> need<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.229> perfect<00:01:53.329> here<00:01:54.329> we're
