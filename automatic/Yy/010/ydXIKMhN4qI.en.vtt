00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
line on there so what we what happened

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.660 
line on there so what we what happened
is<00:00:33.260> we<00:00:33.440> netted<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:33.860> fish<00:00:34.010> we<00:00:34.190> played<00:00:34.400> it<00:00:34.519> very

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
is we netted the fish we played it very

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.190 
is we netted the fish we played it very
quickly<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:35.390> the<00:00:35.420> fish<00:00:35.690> was<00:00:35.899> still<00:00:36.079> very

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
quickly and so the fish was still very

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.590 
quickly and so the fish was still very
active<00:00:36.770> when<00:00:36.950> it<00:00:37.070> was<00:00:37.190> in<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:37.430> net<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:38.239> rolls

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
active when it was in the net it rolls

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.840 
active when it was in the net it rolls
around<00:00:38.840> in<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.350> tippet<00:00:39.770> it<00:00:40.340> gets<00:00:40.610> a<00:00:40.700> little

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
around in the tippet it gets a little

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.389 
around in the tippet it gets a little
bit<00:00:41.059> tangled<00:00:41.480> up<00:00:41.629> this<00:00:42.140> is<00:00:42.410> 4x<00:00:42.890> tippet

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399

that can be very harmful to the fish if

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.510 
that can be very harmful to the fish if
the<00:00:47.239> if<00:00:47.510> the<00:00:47.780> line<00:00:47.960> is<00:00:48.140> pulled<00:00:48.350> pipe<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:49.160> very

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
the if the line is pulled pipe is very

gonna<00:01:33.140> have<00:01:33.409> to<00:01:33.530> retie<00:01:33.829> it<00:01:33.860> anyways<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.610> only

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
gonna have to retie it anyways it's only

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.370 
gonna have to retie it anyways it's only
gonna<00:01:34.909> take<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.180> minute<00:01:35.270> or<00:01:35.630> two<00:01:35.780> half<00:01:36.020> the<00:01:36.170> time

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
gonna take a minute or two half the time

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.810 
gonna take a minute or two half the time
the<00:01:36.500> tip<00:01:36.680> it<00:01:36.799> probably<00:01:37.100> has<00:01:37.220> a<00:01:37.250> wind<00:01:37.520> knot<00:01:37.670> in

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
the tip it probably has a wind knot in

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.340 
the tip it probably has a wind knot in
it<00:01:37.880> by<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.150> point<00:01:38.450> with<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> dried<00:01:38.840> dropper<00:01:39.229> on

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
it by that point with a dried dropper on

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.050 
it by that point with a dried dropper on
there<00:01:39.500> but<00:01:40.100> if<00:01:40.189> you<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.490> do<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.759> technique

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
there but if you can do that technique

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.819 
there but if you can do that technique
get<00:01:41.509> them<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.780> net<00:01:41.960> if<00:01:42.140> they<00:01:42.259> get<00:01:42.409> tangled

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
get them in the net if they get tangled

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.420 
get them in the net if they get tangled
at<00:01:42.890> all<00:01:43.009> on<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.189> double<00:01:43.549> fly<00:01:43.729> rig<00:01:44.000> snip<00:01:44.869> it

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
at all on a double fly rig snip it

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.350 
at all on a double fly rig snip it
generally<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.549> barbless<00:01:46.850> hook<00:01:47.060> will<00:01:47.180> just

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
generally the barbless hook will just

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.670 
generally the barbless hook will just
fall<00:01:47.540> right<00:01:47.750> out<00:01:47.899> all<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.259> have<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.470> do<00:01:48.560> is

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
fall right out all you have to do is

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.679 
fall right out all you have to do is
snip<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.100> and<00:01:49.250> then<00:01:49.759> sometimes<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.329> fish<00:01:50.509> will

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
snip it and then sometimes the fish will

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.149 
snip it and then sometimes the fish will
swim<00:01:50.810> right<00:01:51.079> out<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.290> those<00:01:51.470> tangles<00:01:51.710> on<00:01:52.009> its

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
swim right out of those tangles on its

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.200 
swim right out of those tangles on its
own<00:01:52.280> you<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.460> get<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.700> back<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:53.090> water

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
own you can get it back in the water

hook<00:03:29.489> is<00:03:29.670> already<00:03:29.970> out<00:03:30.379> but<00:03:31.379> you<00:03:31.470> can<00:03:31.620> see<00:03:31.769> this

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
hook is already out but you can see this

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.710 
hook is already out but you can see this
tip<00:03:32.129> it<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.340> around<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:32.940> that<00:03:33.269> tip<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.599> can

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
tip it is around it and that tip it can

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.110 
tip it is around it and that tip it can
be<00:03:33.810> very<00:03:33.989> harmful<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.709> trout<00:03:34.950> in<00:03:35.940> that

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
be very harmful to the trout in that

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.929 
be very harmful to the trout in that

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:38.939 
situation and so we don't fight the fish

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:40.520 
situation and so we don't fight the fish
we<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:39.510> cut<00:03:39.689> that<00:03:39.870> line<00:03:40.109> we're<00:03:40.260> gonna<00:03:40.379> have

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530

to retie it anyways and I can pull that

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.550 
to retie it anyways and I can pull that
line<00:03:43.500> out<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:44.099> it's<00:03:44.340> now<00:03:44.549> clear<00:03:45.200> fish<00:03:46.200> isn't
