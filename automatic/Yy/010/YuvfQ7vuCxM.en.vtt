about this actually came up on reddit
here<00:00:43.340> lately<00:00:44.060> but<00:00:44.450> here's<00:00:45.110> the<00:00:45.230> code<00:00:45.440> that<00:00:45.470> he

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
here lately but here's the code that he

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.230 
here lately but here's the code that he
was<00:00:45.890> talking<00:00:46.220> about<00:00:46.310> if<00:00:46.640> you<00:00:46.730> look<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.150> you

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
was talking about if you look and you

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.930 
was talking about if you look and you

sensor version I'm sorry and you look

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.880 
sensor version I'm sorry and you look
down<00:00:55.910> here<00:00:55.970> and<00:00:56.510> there's<00:00:57.110> got<00:00:57.230> a<00:00:57.260> lot<00:00:57.560> of<00:00:57.680> code

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
down here and there's got a lot of code

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.540 
down here and there's got a lot of code
it's<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.340> C++<00:00:59.240> code<00:00:59.510> that<00:00:59.810> has<00:01:00.350> been<00:01:00.550> pointing

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
it's a C++ code that has been pointing

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.289 
it's a C++ code that has been pointing
to<00:01:01.760> the<00:01:01.970> light<00:01:02.330> sensor<00:01:03.850> he's<00:01:04.850> been<00:01:05.059> talking

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
to the light sensor he's been talking

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.320 
to the light sensor he's been talking
about<00:01:05.479> a<00:01:05.720> bunch<00:01:06.020> of<00:01:06.110> unused<00:01:06.560> code<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:08.240> have

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
about a bunch of unused code that have

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.270 
about a bunch of unused code that have
been<00:01:08.420> causing<00:01:08.660> some<00:01:08.840> weird<00:01:09.170> issues<00:01:09.620> and<00:01:09.950> this

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
been causing some weird issues and this

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.010 
been causing some weird issues and this
the<00:01:10.550> thread<00:01:10.820> that<00:01:10.940> has<00:01:11.030> come<00:01:11.240> up<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.510> red<00:01:11.750> I

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
the thread that has come up on red I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.230 
the thread that has come up on red I
know<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.500> sounds<00:01:12.800> crazy<00:01:13.100> but<00:01:13.760> there's<00:01:13.940> been

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
know this sounds crazy but there's been

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.680 
know this sounds crazy but there's been
a<00:01:14.270> bug<00:01:14.510> caused<00:01:14.780> by<00:01:14.960> the<00:01:15.020> light<00:01:15.440> sensor

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
a bug caused by the light sensor

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.390 
a bug caused by the light sensor
basically<00:01:17.690> what<00:01:17.870> happens<00:01:18.409> is<00:01:18.710> if<00:01:18.980> your<00:01:19.130> phone

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
basically what happens is if your phone

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.940 
basically what happens is if your phone
is<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.080> dark<00:01:21.440> as<00:01:21.740> it<00:01:22.310> boots<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:24.409> may<00:01:24.620> have

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
is in the dark as it boots you may have

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.260 
is in the dark as it boots you may have
a<00:01:24.980> chance<00:01:25.370> to<00:01:25.940> go<00:01:26.120> into<00:01:26.500> what's<00:01:27.500> called<00:01:27.590> in<00:01:28.159> an

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
a chance to go into what's called in an

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.800 
a chance to go into what's called in an
infinite<00:01:29.270> loop<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:31.420> basically<00:01:32.420> what<00:01:32.690> they

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
infinite loop so basically what they

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.800 
infinite loop so basically what they
said<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.170> fix<00:01:33.560> for<00:01:33.710> it<00:01:33.950> was<00:01:34.220> is<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.240> actually

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
said the fix for it was is you actually

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.230 
said the fix for it was is you actually
just<00:01:35.990> take<00:01:36.320> a<00:01:36.350> flashlight<00:01:36.830> can<00:01:37.580> you<00:01:37.700> shine<00:01:37.909> on

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
just take a flashlight can you shine on

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.620 
just take a flashlight can you shine on
this<00:01:38.420> little<00:01:38.600> bit<00:01:38.840> up<00:01:38.990> here<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:40.760> it<00:01:41.090> should

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
this little bit up here and it should

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.440 
this little bit up here and it should
turn<00:01:41.990> on<00:01:42.260> it's<00:01:42.590> really<00:01:43.130> really<00:01:43.520> weird<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.330> it

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
turn on it's really really weird but it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.480 
turn on it's really really weird but it
sounds<00:01:45.020> like<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.260> has<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.590> tends<00:01:46.040> to<00:01:46.220> deal<00:01:46.460> with

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
sounds like it has it tends to deal with

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.210 
sounds like it has it tends to deal with
some<00:01:46.850> things<00:01:47.060> code<00:01:47.540> obviously<00:01:47.810> all<00:01:48.740> credit

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
some things code obviously all credit
