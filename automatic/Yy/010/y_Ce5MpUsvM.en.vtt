00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.250
 good morning Dear readers of Tan Online I greet you now 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.979
 meanwhile fourth video is already for the German Intendant Reiter 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.239
 Today I would like to present you for activity 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.739
 which is approximately comparable to the Canary Islands Kamui has already offered 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:27.019
 pm Activity Slok not only shows you how many games you have played so far 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.039
 or how long, but also the steps 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.329
 as already known 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.960
 the content dish 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.900
 3ds a kind of kilometer he has the steps counting on the top 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.900
 Screen is now also indirectly displayed to the state 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.320
 new owner 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.559
 today's date 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.149
 I want steps I have made Differences Games I have previously submitted 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.660
 Has 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.660
 someone would like to go directly to the statistics 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.770
 the statistics on the upper screen are drawn under this heading 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.970
 Percent today's steps up to that day the speedometer and 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.890
 which looks especially nice in 3d different charts today i have 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.630
 For example, no steps have been taken by the legislature on the table 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.560
 coming 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.750
 which is why you can not see any steps now 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.750
 yesterday it was all the more diligent in 3d first choice 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.200
 For example, you can see that Dark is just before our estimated 15 o'clock 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.220
 Klemperer steps have made 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.080
 22 o'clock again 300 steps 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 and percent in the night then again two after writings 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.200
 Of course it should be synonymous in the season talk 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.580
 Here you can see that today I am about 8 percent back around 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.200
 Ten minutes that were before had the door 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.830
 to the sound channel 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.090
 and then give only one for this video 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.140
 this almost ten minutes for the course now too 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.030
 Not only today's data can be displayed but also from yesterday 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.280
 from the day before yesterday 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.230
 I have the 3ds he is for three days 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.300
 and you can additionally 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.280
 Percent the statistics something from Brighton Prof a week ago 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.430
 whether a month 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.430
 and yes 

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.069
 Of course you can not look at such statistics 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.939
 but also as a list 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:23.209
 which shows what I played today, what I played yesterday 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.209
 and so on 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.050
 in addition there is still the software acquired the Hoftor album shows then 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.449
 noted presentation 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:36.519
 what have already played 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.650
 The manners, for example, are not just the Zoff MÃ¶ller's 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.679
 Skin burns Mr Channels 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.019
 such is one too 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.239
 who play it but I played once a week again per community yesterday 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.129
 of course they loot a total playing time 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:55.049
 today I have three percent in total I have the word channel 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.049
 Have been using for 30 minutes already starting five times 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.299
 used for an average of six minutes 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:02.180
 first 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.499
 on the twelfth third time were guests 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.699
 and last this morning and 13 Trittin 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.749
 I can show him more information about each title here 

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.749
 gives a leaderboard with the most played games 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.379
 and Hans sort episode frequency Average duration last played 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.379
 played first 

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:30.879
 and you can make single-player out of bottles which is quite practical 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.029
 Deuce 

00:03:33.029 --> 00:03:35.390
 the water of the lot becomes Duke 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.910
