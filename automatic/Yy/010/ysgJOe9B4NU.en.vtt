00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.629
 on the children's adventure farm on the edge 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.500
 from freiburg is almost always something going on 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:09.870
 leisure groups and afternoon care 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.330
 use the rest of the terrain in the green 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.610
 as well as school classes actively involved 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.470
 want to get in touch with nature 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 lots of curiosity and no pressure 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 Children and adolescents are here with 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.060
 ecological questions and cycles 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.619
 apart 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.890
 for example, when nurturing and caring 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.730
 of a specially created garden the goal 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.769
 behind an action and play experience 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.360
 to have room where it is normal 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.450
 in addition to school, ecology too 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.860
 to learn ecological learning directly 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:46.469
 can act hereby with 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.899
 Natural materials work as it were 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.530
 Experienced whole contexts directly and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.160
 thus determine what we do here and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.739
 what not 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 be it when building mud huts or 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.000
 as here a straw fire honors fridge 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.170
 on the farm, it is sustainable and 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 resource-saving too 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.760
 In the last 16 years, the 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.390
 professional kids and 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.430
 youth welfare institutions offer you 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.990
 always evolve 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 always allowed the children 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:22.409
 itself and so comes the pleasure 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:24.119
 not too short in the metallurgical industry 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.650
 actually something can think and that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.509
 we can still build 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.560
 you can not do it at home because 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.350
 one does not like lama and or left 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.140
 to be here nice because so many 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.840
 Other children are and are also 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.759
 just nice to be here in nature 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.869
 and not so easy at school anymore 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.460
 implement 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 then you stay beautiful and young 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.940
 under the guidance of experts 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.030
 look after the kids in the yard pigs 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.200
 Sheep chickens and even horses 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.190
 responsibility for another creature 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.420
 to take over 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.670
 often does the children especially well instead 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.330
 experienced nature have to offer me here 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.150
 Many children are no longer the subject of animal 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.550
 pedagogy to experience the animals too 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.900
 to grow up with them on what 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.470
 very bad for an emotional 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.980
 Bonding later is for many too 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.250
 no longer possible and we say so too 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.380
 as a great summer times as a reason 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.730
 content here elementary to the children 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.980
 to allow experiences 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.410
 playfully , the children do 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.330
 adventure high freiburg nature with all 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.030
 to experience and mediate in this way 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.360
 craft social and creative 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.360
 know-how
