00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
a Christian by just going to the church

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.449 
a Christian by just going to the church

or do Christian activities and then I

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.400 
or do Christian activities and then I
remember<00:04:02.820> thinking<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.209> myself<00:04:03.330> how<00:04:03.720> does<00:04:03.780> one

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
remember thinking to myself how does one

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.140 
remember thinking to myself how does one
become<00:04:04.770> a<00:04:04.950> cow<00:04:05.220> and<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.760> course<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.090> know

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
become a cow and of course I know

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.820 
become a cow and of course I know
because<00:04:06.480> we<00:04:07.020> raised<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.200> couple<00:04:07.560> of<00:04:07.620> them

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
because we raised a couple of them

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.160 
because we raised a couple of them
animals<00:04:08.130> in<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.489> village<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.060> grew<00:04:09.270> up<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.570> to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
animals in the village I grew up in to

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.800 
animals in the village I grew up in to
become<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> cow<00:04:10.769> or<00:04:11.070> any<00:04:11.340> animals<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.360> got<00:04:12.660> to

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
become a cow or any animals you got to

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.410 
become a cow or any animals you got to
be<00:04:12.930> born<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.410> to<00:04:13.440> that<00:04:13.860> animal<00:04:14.130> group<00:04:15.120> of

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
be born and to that animal group of

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.349 
be born and to that animal group of
family<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.049> then<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:17.100> remember<00:04:17.549> what<00:04:17.970> Jesus

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
family and then I remember what Jesus

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.150 
family and then I remember what Jesus
told<00:04:18.570> Nicodemus<00:04:18.690> Nicodemus<00:04:19.680> was<00:04:19.799> a<00:04:19.830> very

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
told Nicodemus Nicodemus was a very

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.310 
told Nicodemus Nicodemus was a very
religious<00:04:20.760> man<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:21.239> Jesus<00:04:22.020> said<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.200> him

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
religious man and Jesus said to him

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.920 
religious man and Jesus said to him
using<00:04:22.979> this<00:04:23.250> analogy<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:24.060> Holy<00:04:24.419> Spirit<00:04:24.840> is

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
using this analogy the Holy Spirit is

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.090 
using this analogy the Holy Spirit is
just<00:04:25.050> like<00:04:25.289> when<00:04:25.560> God<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> spirit

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
just like when God is a spirit

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.240 
just like when God is a spirit
so<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.480> become<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.020> child<00:04:29.230> of<00:04:29.440> God<00:04:29.500> we<00:04:29.980> have<00:04:30.040> to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
so to become the child of God we have to

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.700 
so to become the child of God we have to
be<00:04:30.370> born<00:04:30.670> again<00:04:30.970> by<00:04:31.480> the<00:04:31.540> spirit<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.470> first

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
be born again by the spirit the first

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.430 
be born again by the spirit the first
time<00:04:32.950> we<00:04:33.100> are<00:04:33.190> born<00:04:33.400> were<00:04:33.550> born<00:04:33.820> in<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:35.200> flesh

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
time we are born were born in the flesh

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.100 
time we are born were born in the flesh
a<00:04:35.710> physical<00:04:36.400> being<00:04:36.640> born<00:04:37.150> into<00:04:37.480> our<00:04:37.630> families

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
a physical being born into our families

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.550 
a physical being born into our families
but<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.860> second<00:04:39.220> bird<00:04:39.430> is<00:04:39.840> we<00:04:40.840> are<00:04:40.960> born<00:04:41.230> by

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
but the second bird is we are born by

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.050 
but the second bird is we are born by
the<00:04:41.620> Spirit<00:04:42.040> because<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> Bible<00:04:42.730> said<00:04:42.910> in

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
the Spirit because the Bible said in

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.110 
the Spirit because the Bible said in
John<00:04:43.330> Force<00:04:43.960> 1<00:04:44.230> chapter<00:04:44.740> 1<00:04:44.920> verse<00:04:45.250> 12<00:04:45.520> as<00:04:45.730> many
