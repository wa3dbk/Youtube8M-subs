00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
where the name is and it's our new entry

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.810 
where the name is and it's our new entry
in<00:00:32.349> the<00:00:32.410> market<00:00:32.830> and<00:00:33.040> we've<00:00:33.280> gone<00:00:33.489> a<00:00:33.550> little

in the market and we've gone a little
different<00:00:34.269> direction<00:00:34.420> it's<00:00:35.080> so<00:00:35.290> I<00:00:35.670> think<00:00:36.670> it's

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
different direction it's so I think it's

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.189 
different direction it's so I think it's
a<00:00:36.820> little<00:00:37.030> softer<00:00:37.540> and<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.780> little<00:00:37.989> more<00:00:38.140> on

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
kind of a modified tweed tremolo which

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.250 
kind of a modified tweed tremolo which
is<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:32.050> cat<00:01:32.260> affects<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.010> bias<00:01:33.250> of<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
is the cat affects the bias of the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.180 
is the cat affects the bias of the
opportunites<00:01:35.260> real<00:01:35.440> pretty<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.860> we<00:01:35.920> slowed

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
opportunites real pretty and we slowed

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.950 
opportunites real pretty and we slowed
it<00:01:36.220> down<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.670> speeded<00:01:37.060> it<00:01:37.090> up<00:01:37.210> Bob<00:01:37.480> so<00:01:37.780> he's<00:01:37.930> a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
it down and speeded it up Bob so he's a

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.590 
it down and speeded it up Bob so he's a
real<00:01:38.350> big<00:01:38.950> speed<00:01:39.280> variation<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.210> and<00:01:40.480> it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
real big speed variation on it and it

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.740 
real big speed variation on it and it
works<00:01:40.750> out<00:01:40.870> well<00:01:41.050> take<00:01:41.800> us<00:01:41.890> on<00:01:42.010> a<00:01:42.040> tour<00:01:42.280> of
