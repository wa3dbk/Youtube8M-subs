point2<00:00:32.700> by<00:00:32.910> pressing<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.300> left<00:00:33.480> stick

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
point2 by pressing the left stick

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.350 
point2 by pressing the left stick
forward<00:00:34.050> twice<00:00:34.800> quickly<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:36.149> if<00:00:36.239> you're

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
forward twice quickly so if you're

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.600 
forward twice quickly so if you're
flying<00:00:36.600> you'll<00:00:37.050> enter<00:00:37.320> fast<00:00:37.620> flying<00:00:37.920> mode<00:00:38.250> so

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
flying you'll enter fast flying mode so

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.130 
flying you'll enter fast flying mode so
i<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.820> guess<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.420> Jay<00:00:39.600> made<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:40.020> this

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
i would guess that for Jay made it this

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.930 
i would guess that for Jay made it this
way<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.649> pc<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.610> pressing

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
way because the pc is you know pressing

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
way because the pc is you know pressing
the<00:00:42.030> letter<00:00:42.210> W<00:00:42.570> twice<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.530> makes<00:00:43.739> sense<00:00:43.920> but

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the letter W twice it makes sense but

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.410 
the letter W twice it makes sense but
it's<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.850> be<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> little<00:00:45.210> weird

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's going to be a little weird

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
it's going to be a little weird
transition<00:00:45.690> because<00:00:46.140> most<00:00:46.530> FPS<00:00:47.010> games<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
transition because most FPS games that

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.490

we do play on the xbox having a little

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
we do play on the xbox having a little
similar<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.250> instead<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.700> Minecraft<00:00:51.180> it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
similar but instead of Minecraft it's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
similar but instead of Minecraft it's
gonna<00:00:51.390> make<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> press<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.930> twice<00:00:52.260> instead<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
gonna make you press it twice instead of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.400 
gonna make you press it twice instead of
once<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.910> no<00:00:54.090> biggie<00:00:54.300> i<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.660> mind<00:00:54.809> but
