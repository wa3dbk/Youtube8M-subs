00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
think they're a great idea

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.810 
think they're a great idea
it<00:00:13.410> seemed<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.740> working<00:00:13.889> great<00:00:14.250> for<00:00:14.429> me<00:00:14.549> and

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
it seemed to be working great for me and

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.630 
it seemed to be working great for me and
I<00:00:15.650> originally<00:00:16.650> came<00:00:16.800> across<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.340> from<00:00:17.490> just

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
I originally came across them from just

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.720 
I originally came across them from just
a<00:00:17.760> guy<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.090> was<00:00:18.240> at<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:19.189> track<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.430> wasn't

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
a guy that was at a track it wasn't

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.460 
a guy that was at a track it wasn't
local<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.150> me<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.630> actually<00:00:21.810> out<00:00:22.080> visiting

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
local to me I was actually out visiting

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.790 
local to me I was actually out visiting
somebody<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.900> he<00:00:24.900> had<00:00:25.109> some<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.410> these<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.740> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
somebody and he had some of these and I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000 
somebody and he had some of these and I
thought<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.070> were<00:00:26.160> pretty<00:00:26.310> neat<00:00:26.900> and<00:00:28.010> all

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
thought they were pretty neat and all

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.279 
thought they were pretty neat and all
they<00:00:29.369> are<00:00:29.490> is<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.789> little<00:00:30.119> clip<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.900> snaps

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
they are is a little clip that snaps

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.639 
they are is a little clip that snaps

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
over your balance plug to make it easier

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.020 
over your balance plug to make it easier

these in packs of five if I remember
right<00:00:44.180> for<00:00:45.260> 56<00:00:46.260> cents<00:00:47.809> now<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:49.140> they<00:00:49.410> were<00:00:49.469> a

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right for 56 cents now if they were a

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.150 
right for 56 cents now if they were a
really<00:00:49.980> cruddy<00:00:51.620> terrible<00:00:52.620> product<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:55.160> that

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
really cruddy terrible product I that

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.869 
really cruddy terrible product I that
might<00:00:56.370> be<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.879> terrible<00:00:57.719> price<00:00:57.899> but<00:00:58.789> for<00:00:59.789> how

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
might be a terrible price but for how

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.110 
might be a terrible price but for how
easy<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:00.329> are<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.750> well<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.199> I

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
easy they are and how well they do I

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
easy they are and how well they do I
think<00:01:03.120> they're<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.359> great<00:01:03.629> great<00:01:04.409> idea<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> I'm

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
think they're a great great idea so I'm

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.190 
think they're a great great idea so I'm
going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.409> show<00:01:07.590> installing<00:01:08.159> one<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:10.020> right

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
going to show installing one this right

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
going to show installing one this right
here<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.409> one<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.680> turnigy<00:01:11.100> batteries<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
here is one of the turnigy batteries I

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.510 
here is one of the turnigy batteries I
got<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:13.979> reason<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:14.369> haven't

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
got in and for some reason I haven't

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.830 
got in and for some reason I haven't
gotten<00:01:14.729> around<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> putting<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.689> yet

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
gotten around to putting one on it yet

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.719 
gotten around to putting one on it yet
but<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.009> make<00:01:17.130> sure<00:01:17.159> there's<00:01:17.640> no

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
but you want to make sure there's no

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.719 
but you want to make sure there's no
heat<00:01:17.939> shrink<00:01:18.210> or<00:01:18.299> anything<00:01:18.479> around<00:01:18.830> tip<00:01:19.830> here

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.840 

zoom<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.060> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:28.400> alright

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.130 

and<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.899> look<00:01:34.110> at<00:01:34.229> this<00:01:34.380> closely

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
and if you look at this closely

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.780 
and if you look at this closely
hopefully<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.259> be<00:01:37.290> able<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.100> there

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
hopefully you'll be able to see it there

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.340 
hopefully you'll be able to see it there
are<00:01:39.000> ridges<00:01:39.420> here<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> wires<00:01:40.049> to

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
are ridges here for the wires to

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.010 
are ridges here for the wires to
actually<00:01:40.680> lay<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.600> then<00:01:42.600> there<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.990> a

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
actually lay in and then there is a

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.240 
actually lay in and then there is a
guide<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.729> balance<00:01:45.270> plug<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> set<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.250> and

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
guide for the balance plug to set in and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770 
guide for the balance plug to set in and
all<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.729> make<00:01:47.880> sure<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> wires<00:01:48.420> are

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
all you do is make sure the wires are

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.539 
all you do is make sure the wires are
sitting<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:49.380> their<00:01:49.530> grooves<00:01:52.250> fold<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.580> over

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
sitting in their grooves fold this over

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.230 
sitting in their grooves fold this over
and<00:01:56.549> snap<00:01:57.360> it<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:58.039> once<00:01:59.039> it's<00:01:59.130> snapped<00:01:59.490> it's

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
and snap it and once it's snapped it's

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.499 
and snap it and once it's snapped it's
almost<00:02:00.479> impossible<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:01.079> unsnap<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.509> mean

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
almost impossible to unsnap so I mean

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.639 
almost impossible to unsnap so I mean
you<00:02:03.630> can't<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:03.959> in<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.170> flathead<00:02:04.619> screwdriver

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you can't get in a flathead screwdriver

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.270 
you can't get in a flathead screwdriver
but<00:02:05.280> really<00:02:05.580> there's<00:02:05.729> no<00:02:05.880> reason<00:02:07.280> unless

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
but really there's no reason unless

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.979 
but really there's no reason unless
you're<00:02:08.489> jumped<00:02:09.030> out<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.269> battery<00:02:09.600> which<00:02:09.780> at

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
you're jumped out of battery which at

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.720 
you're jumped out of battery which at
that<00:02:10.049> point<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:11.989> have<00:02:13.130> no<00:02:14.130> idea<00:02:14.160> why<00:02:14.549> you'd

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
that point I have no idea why you'd

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.809 
that point I have no idea why you'd
really<00:02:14.940> want<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.980> partly<00:02:17.310> gravely

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
really want to but it partly gravely

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.580 
really want to but it partly gravely
hurt<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:19.230> firmly<00:02:19.560> grabs<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.519> wires<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.590> this

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
hurt it firmly grabs the wires and this

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.930 
hurt it firmly grabs the wires and this
way<00:02:22.769> they're<00:02:22.950> not<00:02:23.069> actually<00:02:23.430> rubbing<00:02:23.819> or

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
way they're not actually rubbing or

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.250 
way they're not actually rubbing or
anything<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:24.330> has<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> pretty<00:02:24.660> good<00:02:24.840> grip<00:02:25.049> on

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
anything it has a pretty good grip on
