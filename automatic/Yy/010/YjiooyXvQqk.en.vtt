00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
people out in the UK

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.540 
people out in the UK
what<00:00:18.460> is<00:00:18.580> it<00:00:18.759> clear<00:00:19.000> here<00:00:19.210> is<00:00:20.200> light<00:00:20.980> red<00:00:21.310> wine

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.609 
what is it clear here is light red wine
in<00:00:21.789> fact<00:00:22.090> and<00:00:22.360> this<00:00:22.630> has<00:00:22.869> got<00:00:23.079> to<00:00:23.230> do<00:00:23.380> with<00:00:23.410> the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
in fact and this has got to do with the

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.089 
in fact and this has got to do with the
process<00:00:24.070> that<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.880> the<00:00:25.210> first<00:00:25.869> step<00:00:26.169> of<00:00:26.439> the

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
process that is the first step of the

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.700 
process that is the first step of the
verification<00:00:27.849> which<00:00:28.509> is<00:00:28.689> called<00:00:28.930> massive

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
verification which is called massive

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.220 
verification which is called massive
asean<00:00:30.040> maceration<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:31.210> leave<00:00:31.450> the<00:00:31.779> juice<00:00:31.989> in

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
asean maceration you leave the juice in

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.430 
asean maceration you leave the juice in
contact<00:00:32.710> with<00:00:32.980> the<00:00:33.190> skins<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.780> a<00:00:34.809> longer<00:00:35.200> time

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
contact with the skins for a longer time

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.709 
contact with the skins for a longer time
to<00:00:35.680> get<00:00:35.950> a<00:00:35.980> clear<00:00:36.370> rather<00:00:36.940> than<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.360> whole<00:00:37.510> day

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:37.719 
to get a clear rather than the whole day

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:39.510 
to get a clear rather than the whole day
for<00:00:37.840> example<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.559> if<00:00:38.739> you<00:00:38.890> leave<00:00:39.219> it<00:00:39.370> even

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
for example and if you leave it even

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.340 
for example and if you leave it even
longer<00:00:39.879> then<00:00:40.329> it's<00:00:40.480> going<00:00:40.660> to<00:00:40.750> be<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:40.960> red<00:00:41.140> wine

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
longer then it's going to be a red wine

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.169 
longer then it's going to be a red wine
so<00:00:41.739> in<00:00:42.219> stages

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
so in stages

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.470 
so in stages
Rosie<00:00:43.929> is<00:00:43.989> the<00:00:44.170> lightest<00:00:44.649> Clary<00:00:45.429> is<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:46.059> next

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
Rosie is the lightest Clary is the next

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.139 
Rosie is the lightest Clary is the next
and<00:00:46.989> then<00:00:47.199> it's<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.710> red<00:00:47.890> wine<00:00:48.100> yeah<00:00:48.429> so<00:00:48.999> this

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
and then it's the red wine yeah so this

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.950 
and then it's the red wine yeah so this
is<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.629> typical<00:00:49.839> clear<00:00:50.829> it<00:00:51.609> is<00:00:51.789> cafes<00:00:52.719> have<00:00:52.809> been

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.509 
is a typical clear it is cafes have been
around<00:00:53.140> for<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.379> long<00:00:53.499> time<00:00:53.559> it's<00:00:54.190> not<00:00:54.249> a<00:00:54.339> new

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.990 
barbecue with salads
usually<00:01:10.210> it's<00:01:10.390> picnics<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.440> know<00:01:11.560> it's<00:01:11.740> more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
usually it's picnics you know it's more

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.780 
usually it's picnics you know it's more
outside<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.360> wine<00:01:13.990> rather<00:01:14.890> than<00:01:15.250> winter<00:01:15.610> one

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
outside the wine rather than winter one

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.679 
outside the wine rather than winter one
it's<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.750> lighter<00:01:17.020> red<00:01:17.259> but<00:01:17.799> it's<00:01:17.950> not<00:01:18.130> quite<00:01:18.430> as

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
it's a lighter red but it's not quite as

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.719 
it's a lighter red but it's not quite as
should<00:01:19.689> we<00:01:19.810> try<00:01:20.290> some<00:01:20.320> yes<00:01:20.799> of<00:01:21.159> course

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
should we try some yes of course

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.310 
should we try some yes of course
and<00:01:22.030> so<00:01:22.390> how<00:01:22.509> would<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.750> say<00:01:22.930> it<00:01:22.960> sort<00:01:23.290> of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
and so how would you say it sort of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.249 
and so how would you say it sort of
tastes<00:01:23.799> different<00:01:24.399> from<00:01:24.460> from<00:01:24.969> a<00:01:25.149> Rosie<00:01:25.600> well

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
tastes different from from a Rosie well

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.179 
tastes different from from a Rosie well
as<00:01:26.530> you<00:01:26.710> can<00:01:26.890> see<00:01:27.100> from<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.460> color<00:01:28.079> everything

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
as you can see from the color everything

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.609 
as you can see from the color everything
you<00:01:30.189> extract<00:01:30.640> more<00:01:31.180> color<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.990> attract<00:01:32.409> no

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
you extract more color you attract no

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.959 
you extract more color you attract no
structure<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:33.490> extract<00:01:33.880> more<00:01:34.119> fruit<00:01:34.450> so<00:01:35.259> the

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
structure you extract more fruit so the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.690 
structure you extract more fruit so the
the<00:01:36.969> taste<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:38.469> smell<00:01:38.500> everything<00:01:39.399> is

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
the taste the smell everything is

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.060 
the taste the smell everything is
stronger<00:01:40.090> in<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.299> clarity<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.740> what<00:01:41.950> should

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
stronger in the clarity so what should

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.819 
stronger in the clarity so what should
one<00:01:42.219> be<00:01:42.310> looking<00:01:42.579> for<00:01:42.820> with<00:01:43.270> anyone<00:01:44.259> first<00:01:44.649> you

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
one be looking for with anyone first you

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.709 
one be looking for with anyone first you
should<00:01:44.890> look<00:01:45.219> at<00:01:45.399> the<00:01:45.520> color<00:01:45.729> which<00:01:46.299> will<00:01:46.509> give

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
should look at the color which will give

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:49.080 
should look at the color which will give
you<00:01:46.869> an<00:01:46.960> indication<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.890> whether<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.609> wine<00:01:48.820> is

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
you an indication on whether the wine is

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.050 
you an indication on whether the wine is
a<00:01:49.119> young<00:01:49.719> wine<00:01:49.990> or<00:01:50.229> not<00:01:50.409> then<00:01:51.219> you<00:01:51.579> smell<00:01:51.850> it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
a young wine or not then you smell it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.639 
a young wine or not then you smell it
first<00:01:52.679> without<00:01:53.679> agitation<00:01:54.130> as<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.240> say<00:01:55.649> each

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
first without agitation as we say each

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.940 
first without agitation as we say each
step<00:01:57.130> will<00:01:57.700> give<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.329> different

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
step will give you a different
