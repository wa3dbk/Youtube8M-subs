00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
damage done it's played in the key of D

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.880 
damage done it's played in the key of D
with<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> descending<00:00:36.989> base<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.440> database

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
with a descending base the database

with a descending base the database
descending<00:00:38.400> by<00:00:38.489> half<00:00:38.790> steps<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.300> over<00:00:39.329> the

chord<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.540> going<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.720> play<00:00:42.839> this<00:00:42.930> with<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> pic

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
chord I'm going to play this with a pic

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
chord I'm going to play this with a pic
and<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.530> usually<00:00:43.769> show<00:00:43.860> people<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.400> do<00:00:44.640> it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
and I usually show people how to do it

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.549 
and I usually show people how to do it
like<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.390> Neil<00:00:45.900> Young<00:00:46.080> usually<00:00:46.410> plays

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
like that but Neil Young usually plays

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.600 
like that but Neil Young usually plays
it<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.739> his<00:00:46.890> fingers<00:00:47.190> he<00:00:47.309> does<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> lot<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
it with his fingers he does a lot of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.010 
it with his fingers he does a lot of
things<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.970> this

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
this with a pic first and it's a d chord

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.100 
this with a pic first and it's a d chord
in<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> beginning<00:01:04.520> what<00:01:04.790> he<00:01:04.850> does<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.180> hits

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
in the beginning what he does is hits

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.550 
in the beginning what he does is hits
the<00:01:06.170> D<00:01:06.350> in<00:01:06.470> the<00:01:06.530> base

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.380 

four<00:01:10.189> downs<00:01:10.460> on<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.820> bass<00:01:10.970> note<00:01:11.210> each

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
four downs on the bass note each

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.300 
four downs on the bass note each
followed<00:01:11.780> by<00:01:11.869> an<00:01:11.990> up<00:01:12.259> on<00:01:12.500> the<00:01:12.680> higher<00:01:12.890> strings

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
followed by an up on the higher strings

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.030 
followed by an up on the higher strings
on<00:01:13.579> each<00:01:13.939> of<00:01:14.060> those<00:01:14.149> ups<00:01:14.450> you<00:01:15.140> focus<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.740> one

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
on each of those ups you focus on one

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.480 
on each of those ups you focus on one
note<00:01:16.310> first<00:01:17.180> up<00:01:17.479> is<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.659> wall<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.170> strings

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
note first up is the wall of the strings

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.770 
note first up is the wall of the strings
so<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.549> hear<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.820> f-sharp<00:01:19.970> particularly

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
so you hear the f-sharp particularly

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.779 
so you hear the f-sharp particularly
clean<00:01:21.130> oops<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:23.720> hit<00:01:23.899> the<00:01:23.960> base<00:01:24.110> again<00:01:24.789> and

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:25.789 
clean oops you hit the base again and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.590 
clean oops you hit the base again and
then<00:01:25.939> it<00:01:26.060> up<00:01:26.380> hearing<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.470> open<00:01:27.740> a<00:01:27.950> very<00:01:28.250> clean

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
then it up hearing the open a very clean

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.080 
then it up hearing the open a very clean
relatively<00:01:29.600> clean<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:29.990> on<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.490> base<00:01:31.729> again

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
relatively clean and on the base again

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.550 
relatively clean and on the base again
this<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:34.270> you<00:01:35.270> want<00:01:35.420> to<00:01:35.479> hear<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:35.689> d<00:01:35.869> sometimes

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
this up you want to hear the d sometimes

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.190 
this up you want to hear the d sometimes
you<00:01:36.649> would<00:01:36.740> do<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:36.979> this

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.230 

sometimes<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.070> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.370 

focusing<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.390> again<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.900> that<00:01:47.080> time<00:01:47.230> knows

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
focusing on again that that time knows

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.770 
focusing on again that that time knows
the<00:01:47.530> third<00:01:47.740> third<00:01:48.220> up<00:01:48.400> I<00:01:48.640> get<00:01:49.060> only<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.450> second

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
the third third up I get only the second

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.640 
the third third up I get only the second
string<00:01:49.900> or<00:01:50.080> mostly<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> second<00:01:50.770> string

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.040 

the<00:01:54.650> base<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.400> moves<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.090> c<00:01:56.450> by<00:01:56.750> moving<00:01:56.960> your

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
the base then moves to c by moving your

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.420 
the base then moves to c by moving your
second<00:01:57.409> finger<00:01:57.560> down<00:01:57.830> to<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.040> sea<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
second finger down to the sea in the

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.330 
second finger down to the sea in the
base

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 

and<00:02:02.729> alternating<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.539> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.929> constant

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and alternating this the same constant

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.740 
and alternating this the same constant
down<00:02:04.829> up<00:02:05.070> motion<00:02:05.520> each<00:02:06.179> of<00:02:06.329> these<00:02:06.420> strokes

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
down up motion each of these strokes

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.229 
down up motion each of these strokes
sort<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.109> focuses<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.190> different<00:02:08.940> part<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
sort of focuses on a different part of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:15.300 
sort of focuses on a different part of
the<00:02:09.300> strings<00:02:09.629> it's<00:02:09.899> not<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.100 

struggle<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.060> strings<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.569> record

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
struggle all the strings on a record

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.570 
struggle all the strings on a record
same<00:02:17.980> song

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
same song

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.070 
same song
but<00:02:19.940> one<00:02:20.120> thing<00:02:20.240> that<00:02:20.270> Neil<00:02:20.480> Young<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.900> very

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
but one thing that Neil Young is very

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.800 
but one thing that Neil Young is very
good<00:02:21.260> at<00:02:21.440> is<00:02:21.740> sort<00:02:22.670> of<00:02:22.760> focused<00:02:23.210> picking<00:02:23.600> where

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
good at is sort of focused picking where

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290 
good at is sort of focused picking where
he's<00:02:24.110> just<00:02:24.140> hitting<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.830> little<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.400> one<00:02:26.060> or<00:02:26.150> two

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
he's just hitting a little of one or two

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.120 
he's just hitting a little of one or two
strings<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:27.020> that's<00:02:27.440> coming<00:02:27.590> out<00:02:27.770> clean

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.740 

seeing<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.220> base

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
seeing the base

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.410 
seeing the base
be<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.130> base<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.970> same<00:02:35.150> type<00:02:35.390> of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
be in the base and the same type of

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.450 
be in the base and the same type of
thing<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:35.990> this<00:02:36.380> D<00:02:36.590> chord<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.130> kind<00:02:37.340> of

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
thing so this D chord is kind of

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.580 
thing so this D chord is kind of
disintegrating<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:38.420> go<00:02:38.570> here<00:02:41.110> B<00:02:42.110> flat<00:02:42.440> in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
disintegrating as we go here B flat in

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.130 
disintegrating as we go here B flat in
the<00:02:42.650> base
