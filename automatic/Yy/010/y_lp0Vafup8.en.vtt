00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
as you can see there's barely enough

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.010 
as you can see there's barely enough
clearance<00:05:30.389> me<00:05:31.389> move<00:05:31.509> this<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.810> back

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
clearance me move this to the back

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.020 
clearance me move this to the back
there's<00:05:32.680> barely<00:05:32.949> enough<00:05:33.070> clearance<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.729> hit

there's barely enough clearance to hit

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.969 
there's barely enough clearance to hit
the<00:05:34.150> ground<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:34.539> it<00:05:34.570> doesn't<00:05:35.229> roll<00:05:35.380> quite<00:05:35.740> that

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
the ground so it doesn't roll quite that

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.939 
the ground so it doesn't roll quite that
well<00:05:36.130> ok<00:05:37.060> see<00:05:37.270> if<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.479> get<00:05:38.229> that<00:05:38.380> pegged<00:05:38.710> in

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:38.949 
well ok see if I get that pegged in

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.649 
well ok see if I get that pegged in
that's<00:05:39.190> what's<00:05:39.699> weird<00:05:39.849> about<00:05:40.000> these<00:05:40.330> reverse

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:40.659 
that's what's weird about these reverse

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.540 
that's what's weird about these reverse
transformations<00:05:41.560> all<00:05:42.159> right<00:05:42.280> let's<00:05:42.490> move

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
transformations all right let's move

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:49.080 
transformations all right let's move
that<00:05:42.820> back<00:05:42.969> down<00:05:45.000> all<00:05:46.000> right<00:05:46.300> go<00:05:47.139> all<00:05:48.090> right

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
that back down all right go all right

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.510 
that back down all right go all right
see<00:05:49.539> how<00:05:49.599> it<00:05:49.870> rolls<00:05:50.110> doesn't<00:05:50.889> roll<00:05:51.039> very<00:05:51.280> well

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
see how it rolls doesn't roll very well

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.129 
see how it rolls doesn't roll very well
and<00:05:52.210> that's<00:05:52.300> because<00:05:52.539> of<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:52.840> lack<00:05:53.110> of

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
and that's because of the lack of

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.740 
and that's because of the lack of
clearance<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:53.680> I<00:05:53.770> understand<00:05:54.159> f1<00:05:54.460> cars

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
clearance and I understand f1 cars

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.830 
clearance and I understand f1 cars
pretty<00:05:55.750> much<00:05:56.020> are<00:05:56.349> like<00:05:56.650> that<00:05:56.830> anyhow<00:05:57.250> so<00:05:57.840> good

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
pretty much are like that anyhow so good

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.620 
pretty much are like that anyhow so good
on<00:05:58.960> it<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.229> keep<00:05:59.409> it<00:05:59.590> lower<00:05:59.880> low<00:06:00.880> profile<00:06:01.389> but
