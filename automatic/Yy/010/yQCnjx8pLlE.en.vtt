00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.370 
just launches them up in the air it's
supposed<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:20.970> create<00:03:21.239> like<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.660> guess<00:03:21.989> a<00:03:22.019> block

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
supposed to create like I guess a block

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.949 
supposed to create like I guess a block
of<00:03:22.590> stone<00:03:22.829> or<00:03:22.890> something<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.120> used<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
of stone or something but I used it

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.050 
of stone or something but I used it
twice<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.440> haven't<00:03:25.650> seen<00:03:25.829> it<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.250> oh<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.940> see

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
twice and I haven't seen it so oh I see

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.150 
twice and I haven't seen it so oh I see
if<00:03:27.329> I<00:03:27.390> know<00:03:27.510> what<00:03:27.600> that's<00:03:27.720> about<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.230> then<00:03:28.890> the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
if I know what that's about and then the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.780 
if I know what that's about and then the
there's<00:03:29.549> uh<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:30.269> think<00:03:30.720> it's<00:03:30.930> called<00:03:33.260> what

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
there's uh I think it's called what

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.520 
there's uh I think it's called what
levitation<00:03:35.790> saw<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.450> levitations<00:03:37.200> felt

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
levitation saw with levitations felt

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.460 
levitation saw with levitations felt
wrong<00:03:38.090> stone<00:03:39.090> needles<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.780> what<00:03:40.019> that<00:03:40.200> does

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
wrong stone needles and what that does

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.569 
wrong stone needles and what that does
is<00:03:40.739> um<00:03:41.250> like<00:03:41.870> it'll<00:03:42.870> throw<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.139> kunai<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.829> then

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
is um like it'll throw a kunai and then

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.210 
is um like it'll throw a kunai and then
wherever<00:03:44.970> the<00:03:45.329> kunai<00:03:45.690> lands<00:03:46.170> it'll<00:03:46.500> drop<00:03:46.859> like

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
wherever the kunai lands it'll drop like

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.289 
wherever the kunai lands it'll drop like
three<00:03:47.609> more<00:03:48.150> sets<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.889> kunai<00:03:49.889> on<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.910> person

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
three more sets of kunai on the person

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.530 
three more sets of kunai on the person
uh-huh<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:53.280> problem<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.269> when

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
he hits on with a kunai if it doesn't

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.470 
he hits on with a kunai if it doesn't
stick<00:03:57.690> into<00:03:57.959> them<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.470> just<00:03:59.010> they<00:03:59.970> get<00:04:00.209> knocked
