00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.200
 Of the path rather than when the Gane 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:08.430
 It is difficult to say and here in crispy millefeuille 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.660
 Please try going 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:17.860
 It is not Paris Paris paris Paris Millefeuille Aso 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:25.440
 It's been about 3 years since I was renewed . 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:29.880
 But this please look and examine the word Tteyuu now I a net nap 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:36.090
 It's really that old Panap 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.520
 It seems that it is quite likely that there is no Paris Parr Millefeille . 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.880
 I 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.750
 So in the world, maybe still 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:47.000
 It's compatible when saying "panap" 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.020
 Vertical source is better 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.739
 Well I think it is known to the majority of people 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.739
 While 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.700
 Is it useless? 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 It doesn't mean that it is no good Glicau to renew it to Paris Paris Millefeille 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:08.470
 you know 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.970
 You've made great efforts, isn't it really good? 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.820
 Because 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:17.400
 This towards the new one crispy millefeuille, which was renewed 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.940
 I want many people to know 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.750
 It kick in at Haa 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.750
 Convenience is what 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.650
 Right? 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:33.650
 me 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:36.830
 If you are a good cook, you have a source of center of gravity and a layer of ice 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.920
 Probably does just delicious it is has become millefeuille basis 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:44.180
 ic and more in the meantime 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.340
 I think I can enjoy the texture because I say that chocolate in Paris is included 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 Is it fun fun 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:59.520
 Well, it is a campaign that the original Panup and the new Panup confront each other this time 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:05.280
 But how is this feeling like it's also likely to win a new panup 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:07.829
 Well that's right, it's possible that some of our ancestor Panup will disappear 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.420
 It is a little sad 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.690
 It does not go away 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.700
 eh 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.580
 What is the cry 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.280

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.280
 I eh not go away wonder if large 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.250
 Confrontation 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.550
 Confrontation 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.710
 There is no Shonan 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.710
 Why do you confront me 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:38.069
 It is said that it is said that it is true 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.689
 It is boring 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.689
 This causes Hekkoma 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.390
 I came to the garden 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.319
 Well, did you not eat and compare both? 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.319
 How is it better? 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.319
 Oh 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.670
 Load I muscle barb towards God it is the heart 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.800
 Why not 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.490
 End 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.670
 Use goods 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:16.180
 Yes I understand so well 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:21.160
 There are more than 8 original people who are larger in amount, but you also have more sources. 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.490
 In the above it was based on the kind of I'd have been or become delicious it is renewed 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.490
 how is it 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:33.170
 I knew I was going to go in 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.520
 I Hamou towards here of Ganso is by the way, but what is Chinami 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:39.510
 This is it 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.629
 I only sell in 6 pack 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.629
 Oh 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.970

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.940
 I'm six 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:59.890
 It seems that there is a lot of blood 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:03.520
 I wonder if this gunst pants 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.180
 But I think that it is well know I'm that contains anti-source to vertical 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.719
 So this kind of looks, for example, 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.049
 A strange face is mixed 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:21.759
 This is also true 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:26.110
 Only Tin Is or Ne is the originator pattern that say delicious interesting be interesting 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:27.590
 Yes, it's a chain, so many sides are good at it 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.289
