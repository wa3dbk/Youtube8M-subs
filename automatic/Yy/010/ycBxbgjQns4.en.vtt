00:00:00.465 --> 00:00:02.322
 Let's think how many blocks with boxes 

00:00:02.322 --> 00:00:03.583
 we have here. 

00:00:03.583 --> 00:00:07.406
 Which number do these blocks represent? 

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.752
 Here I have 4 groups of 100, 

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:12.422
 so I can say I have 4 hundred. 

00:00:12.422 --> 00:00:14.480
 4 hundreds. 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.645
 Here I have 3 groups of 10. 

00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:20.216
 So I can write plus 3 tens. 

00:00:20.216 --> 00:00:22.708
 Plus 3 tens. 

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.403
 And last here I have 6 units. 

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:27.026
 So I can write plus 6 units. 

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:30.185
 Plus 6 units. 

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:32.900
 So I can record that this is equal to ... 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.271
 I can record that this is ... 

00:00:34.271 --> 00:00:35.943
 I can write 6 in the order of the units 

00:00:35.943 --> 00:00:37.940
 for my 6 units. 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.958
 3 in the order of the decimal 

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:42.653
 for my 3 tens. 

00:00:42.653 --> 00:00:44.186
 And finally 4 in the hundreds 

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:46.669
 for my 4 hundred. 

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:48.328
 Therefore, this is 436. 

00:00:48.328 --> 00:00:49.991
 Four hundred and thirty-six. 

00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:53.195
 436. 

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:55.168
 Now let's get it out of it. 

00:00:55.168 --> 00:00:57.838
 Let's get out of it ... 

00:00:57.838 --> 00:00:59.385
 Let's get out of it 

00:00:59.385 --> 00:01:01.568
 the number ... 

00:01:01.568 --> 00:01:04.958
 the number three hundred ... 

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:08.274
 312. 

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.202
 Let us think how we would introduce 

00:01:12.202 --> 00:01:15.012
 here the extraction of three hundred ... 

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:19.470
 removing 312. 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.211
 We had 6 units at the beginning, 

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:22.697
 we subtract 2 units. 

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:23.718
 Let me write. 

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:27.944
 We'll get 2 units. 

00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:29.663
 We remove 1 tenth. 

00:01:29.663 --> 00:01:32.496
 We remove 1 tenth. 

00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:35.244
 So minus 1 tenth. 

00:01:35.244 --> 00:01:38.161
 And we draw 3 hundred. 

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:40.088
 So we pull out ... 

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:43.620
 So we get 3 hundred. 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.591
 3 hundreds. 

00:01:45.591 --> 00:01:47.425
 How much will we get? 

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:49.260
 How much will we get? 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.605
 We had 4 hundred, 

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.020
 we draw 3 hundred, 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.996
 so let's cut them off. 

00:01:53.996 --> 00:01:55.181
 Let's scratch ... 

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.362
 Let's cross these ... 

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.508
 Let's cross 1 ... 

00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.296
 2 ... 

00:02:04.296 --> 00:02:05.968
 and 3 hundreds. 

00:02:05.968 --> 00:02:08.151
 Only one hundred remained. 

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:11.308
 1 hundred. 

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:12.214
 We can get out here. 

00:02:12.214 --> 00:02:15.581
 4 hundreds minus 3 hundreds 

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:17.972
 will be 1 hundred. 

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:20.666
 Now we had 3 tens, 

00:02:20.666 --> 00:02:22.431
 we deduct 1 tenth. 

00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.660
 Let's cross it. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.796
 So we'll have 2 tens. 

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:29.698
 So, plus 2 tens. 

00:02:29.698 --> 00:02:31.154
 3 minus 1 is 2. 

00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.204
 3 minus 1 equals 2. 

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.199
 And finally, 

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:39.115
 we had 6 units, 

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:41.367
 we subtract 2 units 

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:42.846
 and we will have 4 units. 

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:46.349
 6 minus 2 is 4. 

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:50.306
 6 minus 2 equals 4. 

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:51.583
 And we are ready! 

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:55.430
 436 minus 312 is 124. 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.249
 You see how we did it. 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:02:59.571
 We scratched 3 hundred. 

00:02:59.571 --> 00:03:01.150
 We scraped one tenth. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.377
 And we scratched 2 units. 

00:03:04.377 --> 00:03:06.537
 So we get 124, 

00:03:06.537 --> 00:03:10.537
 which is 1 hundred, 2 tens and 4 units.
