hello<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:23.030> welcome<00:00:23.420> today<00:00:24.020> i'll<00:00:24.260> be<00:00:24.380> keeping

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:24.530 
hello and welcome today i'll be keeping

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:25.990 
hello and welcome today i'll be keeping
it<00:00:24.800> rather<00:00:24.950> short<00:00:25.310> because<00:00:25.580> there's<00:00:25.790> not<00:00:25.970> a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 
it rather short because there's not a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.359 
it rather short because there's not a
whole<00:00:26.210> lot<00:00:26.480> to<00:00:26.720> explain<00:00:27.170> involving<00:00:27.920> cannons

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
whole lot to explain involving cannons

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.670 
whole lot to explain involving cannons
just<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.420> basics<00:00:29.540> is<00:00:29.990> really<00:00:30.320> all<00:00:30.440> you<00:00:30.650> need

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
just the basics is really all you need

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.340 
just the basics is really all you need
because<00:00:31.450> everything<00:00:32.450> else<00:00:32.630> will<00:00:32.840> most<00:00:33.080> likely

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
because everything else will most likely

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.320 
because everything else will most likely
be<00:00:33.560> dependent<00:00:34.250> on<00:00:34.340> your<00:00:34.640> current<00:00:35.150> situation

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
be dependent on your current situation

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.440 
be dependent on your current situation
because<00:00:36.170> this<00:00:36.350> is<00:00:36.530> mostly<00:00:37.460> used<00:00:37.580> in<00:00:37.910> pvp

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
because this is mostly used in pvp

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.540 
because this is mostly used in pvp
environments<00:00:39.200> since<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:40.129> only<00:00:40.370> real

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
environments since the only real

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.960 
environments since the only real
application<00:00:41.239> for<00:00:41.450> pvp<00:00:42.200> ve<00:00:42.400> would<00:00:43.400> be<00:00:43.550> lining

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
application for pvp ve would be lining

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.570 
application for pvp ve would be lining
your<00:00:44.239> walls<00:00:44.570> with<00:00:45.080> cannons<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.010> just

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:46.580 
your walls with cannons and just

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.290 
your walls with cannons and just
chucking<00:00:47.090> tnt<00:00:47.900> at<00:00:48.800> mobs<00:00:49.370> that<00:00:49.580> spawn<00:00:49.970> around

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
chucking tnt at mobs that spawn around

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.020 
chucking tnt at mobs that spawn around
you<00:00:50.510> which<00:00:50.659> is<00:00:50.690> fun<00:00:51.080> but<00:00:51.860> it's<00:00:52.309> not<00:00:52.550> really<00:00:52.790> as

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
you which is fun but it's not really as

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.020 
you which is fun but it's not really as
useful<00:00:53.269> as<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.780> pvp<00:00:54.320> environments<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.250> just

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
useful as in pvp environments so just

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.729 
useful as in pvp environments so just
the<00:00:56.150> basics<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.750> got<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.900> button<00:00:57.140> here<00:00:57.470> you<00:00:57.589> can

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
the basics I got a button here you can

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.079 
the basics I got a button here you can
put<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:57.949> button<00:00:58.129> wherever<00:00:58.430> you<00:00:58.730> want<00:00:58.940> you

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
put the button wherever you want you

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.280 
put the button wherever you want you
don't<00:00:59.269> need<00:00:59.390> to<00:00:59.480> have<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.690> in<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.839> back<00:01:00.019> I<00:01:00.050> just

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
don't need to have it in the back I just

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.710 
don't need to have it in the back I just
had<00:01:00.620> it<00:01:00.650> here<00:01:00.949> so<00:01:01.100> I<00:01:01.129> get<00:01:01.400> a<00:01:01.430> good<00:01:01.610> angle<00:01:01.790> but<00:01:02.690> I

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
had it here so I get a good angle but I

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.590 
had it here so I get a good angle but I
have<00:01:02.809> a<00:01:02.870> button<00:01:03.229> that<00:01:03.909> comes<00:01:04.909> up<00:01:05.089> here<00:01:05.449> and

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
have a button that comes up here and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.100 
have a button that comes up here and
makes<00:01:06.340> make<00:01:07.340> sure<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.700> goes<00:01:08.300> above<00:01:08.540> so<00:01:08.960> that

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
makes make sure it goes above so that

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.040 
makes make sure it goes above so that
it's<00:01:09.229> not<00:01:09.350> touching<00:01:09.890> any<00:01:10.040> Pistons<00:01:10.820> but<00:01:11.690> it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's not touching any Pistons but it

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.710 
it's not touching any Pistons but it
fondles<00:01:12.680> up<00:01:12.770> this<00:01:12.950> T<00:01:13.159> and<00:01:13.310> T<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.729> then<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
fondles up this T and T and then the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.210 
fondles up this T and T and then the
same<00:01:14.900> wire<00:01:15.110> goes<00:01:15.380> around<00:01:15.620> and<00:01:15.979> through<00:01:16.190> a

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
same wire goes around and through a

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.789 
same wire goes around and through a
default<00:01:16.970> setting<00:01:17.330> repeater<00:01:18.080> for<00:01:18.409> a<00:01:18.440> delay

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
default setting repeater for a delay

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.370 
default setting repeater for a delay
which<00:01:19.580> then<00:01:19.880> touches<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.420> piston<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:21.080> launch

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
which then touches the piston to launch

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.310 
which then touches the piston to launch
it<00:01:21.560> upward<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.070> then<00:01:22.970> three<00:01:23.240> spaces<00:01:23.510> up<00:01:23.840> one

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
it upward and then three spaces up one

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.590 
it upward and then three spaces up one
two<00:01:24.650> three<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.370> then<00:01:25.580> then<00:01:25.910> the<00:01:26.030> piston<00:01:26.210> we

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
two three and then then the piston we

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.810 
two three and then then the piston we
have<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> piston<00:01:27.200> that<00:01:27.350> will<00:01:28.100> be<00:01:28.250> launching

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
have the piston that will be launching

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.220 
have the piston that will be launching
it<00:01:28.940> forward<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.590> then<00:01:30.590> up<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:30.800> we<00:01:31.340> have<00:01:31.610> a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
it forward and then up here we have a

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.590 
it forward and then up here we have a
one<00:01:33.230> more<00:01:33.470> tick<00:01:33.710> than<00:01:33.920> default<00:01:34.280> so<00:01:34.640> a<00:01:34.670> to

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
one more tick than default so a to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.970 
one more tick than default so a to
setting<00:01:37.330> delay<00:01:38.330> for<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.050> this<00:01:39.350> repeater<00:01:39.740> and

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
setting delay for the this repeater and

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.010 
setting delay for the this repeater and
then<00:01:40.430> it<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:40.790> touches<00:01:41.030> this<00:01:41.330> piston<00:01:41.840> and

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
then it just touches this piston and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.680 
then it just touches this piston and
that<00:01:42.650> just<00:01:42.890> launches<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:43.430> forward<00:01:43.820> so<00:01:44.420> that's

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
that just launches it forward so that's

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.570 
that just launches it forward so that's
pretty<00:01:44.930> much<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:45.350> basic<00:01:45.770> as<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.950> gets<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.430> can

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
pretty much as basic as it gets you can

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.790 
pretty much as basic as it gets you can
modify<00:01:47.300> it<00:01:47.480> however<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:47.960> need<00:01:48.110> just<00:01:48.620> make

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
modify it however you need just make

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.240 
modify it however you need just make
sure<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.960> light<00:01:50.960> up<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.230> TNT<00:01:51.590> launch<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:52.100> up

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
sure you light up the TNT launch it up

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:53.500 
sure you light up the TNT launch it up
and<00:01:52.430> then<00:01:52.520> launch<00:01:52.700> it<00:01:52.910> forward<00:01:53.090> however

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
and then launch it forward however

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.140 
and then launch it forward however
there's<00:01:53.900> a<00:01:53.990> problem<00:01:54.290> it<00:01:54.560> does<00:01:54.890> go<00:01:55.250> left<00:01:55.940> and

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
there's a problem it does go left and

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.900 
there's a problem it does go left and
right<00:01:56.360> a<00:01:56.390> bit<00:01:56.660> wonky<00:01:56.870> and<00:01:57.260> it<00:01:58.220> does<00:01:58.430> have

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
right a bit wonky and it does have

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.040 
right a bit wonky and it does have
problems<00:01:59.390> with<00:01:59.540> the<00:02:00.220> some<00:02:01.220> other<00:02:01.370> way

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
problems with the some other way

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.330 
problems with the some other way
positions<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:03.860> you<00:02:03.950> want<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.220> make<00:02:04.310> sure

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
positions so what you want to make sure

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
positions so what you want to make sure
you<00:02:04.550> do<00:02:04.700> is<00:02:04.910> have<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.550> blocks<00:02:07.550> in<00:02:07.760> front<00:02:08.030> here

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
you do is have the blocks in front here

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.509 
you do is have the blocks in front here
to<00:02:09.019> make<00:02:09.200> sure<00:02:09.229> that<00:02:09.619> the<00:02:09.769> teens<00:02:10.039> he<00:02:10.190> doesn't

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
to make sure that the teens he doesn't

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.600 
to make sure that the teens he doesn't
pop<00:02:10.729> up<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:11.239> then<00:02:11.510> hit<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.989> corner<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.610> this

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
pop up and then hit the corner of this

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.490 
pop up and then hit the corner of this
piston<00:02:14.150> and<00:02:14.269> fall<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.750> back<00:02:14.780> down<00:02:14.989> and

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
piston and fall right back down and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.309 
piston and fall right back down and
explode<00:02:16.069> all<00:02:16.280> up<00:02:16.430> in<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.670> area<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.090> stuff<00:02:17.540> so

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
explode all up in your area and stuff so

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.410 
explode all up in your area and stuff so
to<00:02:19.099> prevent<00:02:19.220> that<00:02:19.550> all<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.909> really<00:02:20.090> need<00:02:20.390> is

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
to prevent that all you really need is

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.080 
to prevent that all you really need is
just<00:02:20.840> to<00:02:21.489> build<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.730> your<00:02:24.159> your<00:02:25.159> to<00:02:25.370> below<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
just to build up your your to below the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.750 
just to build up your your to below the
piston<00:02:26.600> that<00:02:26.810> I<00:02:27.020> have<00:02:27.260> here<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.770> then<00:02:27.950> just<00:02:28.310> to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
piston that I have here and then just to

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.650 
piston that I have here and then just to
make<00:02:28.940> sure<00:02:28.970> your

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
make sure your

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.270 
make sure your
shots<00:02:30.900> do<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.650> stray<00:02:32.570> for<00:02:34.100> horizontally<00:02:35.100> so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
shots do not stray for horizontally so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.770 
shots do not stray for horizontally so
that<00:02:35.430> they<00:02:35.520> don't<00:02:35.610> like<00:02:35.760> go<00:02:36.060> off<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.450> sides

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
that they don't like go off to the sides

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420 
that they don't like go off to the sides
a<00:02:36.960> bit<00:02:37.110> it's<00:02:37.620> not<00:02:37.770> much<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.130> difference<00:02:38.370> but

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
a bit it's not much of a difference but

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.490 
a bit it's not much of a difference but
just<00:02:38.790> make<00:02:38.970> sure<00:02:39.000> you<00:02:39.360> don't<00:02:39.630> go<00:02:40.170> off<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.470> the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
just make sure you don't go off to the

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.390 
just make sure you don't go off to the
sides<00:02:40.860> of<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.190> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.520> just<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:44.010> set<00:02:44.190> up<00:02:44.310> a

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
sides of it you can just just set up a

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.070 
sides of it you can just just set up a
bit<00:02:44.550> of<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.730> wall<00:02:44.910> like<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.660> then<00:02:45.900> that's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
bit of a wall like that and then that's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.750 
bit of a wall like that and then that's
really<00:02:46.380> all<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.530> need<00:02:46.830> then<00:02:47.010> it'll<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.490> fire

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
really all you need then it'll just fire

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.670 
really all you need then it'll just fire
a<00:02:47.790> lot<00:02:48.180> more<00:02:48.390> straight<00:02:48.840> even<00:02:49.350> though<00:02:49.440> it's<00:02:49.590> not

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
a lot more straight even though it's not

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.080 
a lot more straight even though it's not
too<00:02:49.980> big<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.370> difference<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.880> first

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
too big of a difference in the first

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.710 
too big of a difference in the first
place<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:52.460> this<00:02:53.460> is<00:02:53.610> really<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.120> basic<00:02:54.600> as

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
place but this is really the as basic as

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.030 
place but this is really the as basic as
you<00:02:54.870> need<00:02:55.050> it<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.230> can<00:02:55.380> make<00:02:55.650> it<00:02:55.770> a<00:02:55.830> bit<00:02:56.010> more

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
you need it you can make it a bit more

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680 
you need it you can make it a bit more
basic<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.700> believe<00:02:56.970> but<00:02:57.210> I<00:02:57.240> really<00:02:57.540> haven't

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
basic I believe but I really haven't

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.020 
basic I believe but I really haven't
screwed<00:02:58.020> around<00:02:58.110> too<00:02:58.410> much<00:02:58.560> with<00:02:58.830> TNT<00:02:59.640> cannons

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
screwed around too much with TNT cannons

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.320 
screwed around too much with TNT cannons
and<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.770> can<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.220> is<00:03:02.430> just<00:03:02.460> sort<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:03.000> use

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
and what you can do is just sort of use

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.740 
and what you can do is just sort of use
a<00:03:03.890> tower<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.100> inverters<00:03:05.700> like<00:03:05.910> this<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.450> just

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
a tower of inverters like this and just

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.750 
a tower of inverters like this and just
set<00:03:06.990> that<00:03:07.020> up<00:03:07.200> kind<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.070> tall<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.580> don't

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
set that up kind of tall so you don't

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.150 
set that up kind of tall so you don't
need<00:03:08.880> stairs<00:03:09.270> for<00:03:09.600> when<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:10.620> want<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.860> to<00:03:11.010> go

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
need stairs for when you want it to go

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.570 
need stairs for when you want it to go
up<00:03:11.400> real<00:03:11.700> high<00:03:11.730> and<00:03:11.940> then<00:03:12.390> fire<00:03:13.580> horizontally

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
up real high and then fire horizontally

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.540 
up real high and then fire horizontally
afterward<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.590> that'll<00:03:16.590> give<00:03:16.770> its<00:03:16.890> own<00:03:17.160> delay

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
afterward and that'll give its own delay

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.430 
afterward and that'll give its own delay
because<00:03:17.760> these<00:03:18.090> are<00:03:18.330> practically<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.080> know<00:03:19.200> a

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
because these are practically you know a

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.380 
because these are practically you know a
default<00:03:20.330> repeater<00:03:21.330> pretty<00:03:21.660> much<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:23.210> you<00:03:24.210> can

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
default repeater pretty much so you can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.120 
default repeater pretty much so you can
just<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> stack<00:03:25.050> up<00:03:25.290> however<00:03:25.890> how<00:03:26.070> you

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
just have a stack up however how you

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.190 
just have a stack up however how you
need<00:03:26.430> it<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.670> such<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.240> what's<00:03:27.840> interesting

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
need it and such and what's interesting

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.590 
need it and such and what's interesting
to<00:03:28.590> note<00:03:28.740> about<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.280> canyons<00:03:29.820> is<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.240> really

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
to note about the canyons is they really

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.170 
to note about the canyons is they really
aren't<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:31.110> T<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.500> T<00:03:31.620> cannons<00:03:32.070> because<00:03:33.000> I

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
aren't just T and T cannons because I

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.000 
aren't just T and T cannons because I
mean<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.660> put<00:03:33.840> other<00:03:33.960> physics<00:03:34.470> blocks<00:03:34.770> in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
mean you can put other physics blocks in

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.750 
mean you can put other physics blocks in
here<00:03:35.220> as<00:03:35.280> well<00:03:35.430> such<00:03:35.730> as<00:03:35.760> sand<00:03:36.090> and<00:03:36.300> gravel<00:03:36.510> so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
here as well such as sand and gravel so

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.560 
here as well such as sand and gravel so
just<00:03:38.760> going<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:38.970> defuse<00:03:39.330> this<00:03:39.510> TNT<00:03:39.959> real<00:03:40.230> quick

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
just going to defuse this TNT real quick

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.130 
just going to defuse this TNT real quick
throw<00:03:42.570> some<00:03:42.840> sand<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:45.510> do<00:03:45.570> not<00:03:45.840> go

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
throw some sand in and they do not go

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.540 
throw some sand in and they do not go
quite<00:03:46.740> as<00:03:46.770> far<00:03:46.890> as<00:03:47.459> T<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:47.880> T<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:49.070> you<00:03:50.070> know<00:03:50.190> it's

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
quite as far as T and T so you know it's

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.690 
quite as far as T and T so you know it's
gonna<00:03:51.020> hit<00:03:52.020> there<00:03:52.320> whereas<00:03:52.770> the<00:03:52.920> TNT<00:03:53.400> would

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
gonna hit there whereas the TNT would

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.840 
gonna hit there whereas the TNT would
have<00:03:53.910> bounced<00:03:54.920> from<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:56.250> I'll<00:03:56.459> just<00:03:56.670> do

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
have bounced from there I'll just do

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.190 
have bounced from there I'll just do
that<00:03:57.090> real<00:03:58.080> quick<00:03:59.480> to<00:04:00.480> demonstrate<00:04:00.630> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
that real quick to demonstrate the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.290 
that real quick to demonstrate the
difference<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.709> bit<00:04:01.890> that<00:04:02.310> landed<00:04:02.730> pretty<00:04:03.060> much

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:03.300 
difference a bit that landed pretty much

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.780 
difference a bit that landed pretty much
perfectly<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.110> that<00:04:04.350> arrow<00:04:04.910> whereas<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.060> T&amp;T

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
perfectly on that arrow whereas the T&amp;T

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.220 
perfectly on that arrow whereas the T&amp;T
hits<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:09.000> side<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.540> then<00:04:09.660> falls<00:04:09.930> on<00:04:10.110> the

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
hits the side and then falls on the

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.440 
hits the side and then falls on the
arrow<00:04:10.410> so<00:04:11.130> it's<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> bit<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.580> a<00:04:11.640> difference<00:04:12.030> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.680
