00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hey and welcome here at it.de today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.410
 It's all about the term chipset 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 or in English chip set this concept 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 especially when you look at yourself 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 dealing with the topic mainboard 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 in itself, this topic is very much 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.500
 extensive and therefore I will be the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 chipsets on current mainboards in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.550
 treat a separate video since that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.449
 otherwise the frame of this video 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 would jump 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.680
 the chipset or in English chip set 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.170
 is a central link between 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.640
 he controls the individual pc components 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.700
 the interaction and the data flow 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.200
 between cpu ram the bus systems as well 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.450
 the internal and external interfaces 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.070
 the chipset itself has a big one 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.140
 influence on the overall computing power 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.870
 By playing it makes so little sense 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.850
 a processor from the intel 7 segment 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.640
 to put on a mainboard that eg 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 the h 81 chip set offers a chipset 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.360
 which is really the lowest drawer 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.190
 which is really not meant for that 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.809
 to act on this processor and in the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.640
 Ultimately, it would be like that 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.379
 this bad chip set the whole 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.329
 cpu performance limited 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.969
 The configuration of the chipset is done 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.430
 about the well-known bios or about the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.799
 new uefi chipsets are usually available 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.530
 from the individual cdu manufacturers such as 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.020
 intel or amd the best possible 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.450
 want to provide conditions for their cpu s 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 In addition, chipset ensures that all 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.170
 components over their interfaces 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.729
 can communicate with each other 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.290
 on the left side we see now 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.600
 A rough sketch of the chipset 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.840
 architecture from current point of view in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.909
 combination with the cpu chipset 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 implemented are eg the sata audio and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.509
 usb controller the controller for the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.729
 Memory is now the same 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.350
 implemented in the cpu as to 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.090
 example of the pci express controller 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.189
 why the whole from the current point of view 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.960
 as now all so until a few 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.939
 years did not look like that back then 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.770
 time was the chipset divided in 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.420
 north and southbridge the northbridge 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 served to control the flow of data 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 between processor memory 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.509
 graphics card and the peripheral bus the 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.159
 southbridge serves the control of 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 peripheral interfaces and is 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.119
 also responsible for the transformation of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.759
 voltage levels data formats 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.500
 protocols and clock frequencies the whole 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.270
 now again compared to the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.489
 left side the contemplation of the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.259
 chipsets from old sight and up 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.920
 the right side from current view 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.450
 wise 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.410
 it follows that the northbridge 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.330
 meanwhile 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.710
 no longer exists why is the whole 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.470
 so now the tasks of the northbridge 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.120
 were implemented in the cpu thus 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.040
 so we have from the current point of view 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.020
 or based on the current 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.070
 technology only the cpu to the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.810
 example also the drum controller 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.460
 includes and of course then the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.380
 single chip set resp 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.210
 this house bridge if we look at that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.130
 whole now once on a mainboard 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.140
 we have here on the left 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.670
 side a model from a long time ago 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.310
 We have seen quite a while here 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.020
 clearly under the cpu pedestal is a cooler 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.880
 for the northbridge and a little further 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.320
 bottom right is then the cooler for the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.720
 southbridge we look at the whole 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.790
 see on a current mainboard of 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.830
 We provide below the processor to nothing 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.480
 Some mainboards are currently there too 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.190
 there is only one killer left 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.260
 for optical purposes and then we have 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.850
 bottom right the big cooler for the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100
 southbridge respectively for the 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.020
 actual chipset and thus sets 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.370
 have been the subject of chip I set 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.990
 I hope I could give you this video 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.610
 maybe even help a little further 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.440
 continue to educate as I said the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.030
 individual chipsets from current view 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.800
 continue for example on the basis of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.990
 I am interested in technology 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.580
 a separate video before you want it 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.750
 I thank you for that 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.910
 I would look over one 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.890
 positive rating as well as an abo by 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.220
 Happy and see you next time 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.220
 pure skin
