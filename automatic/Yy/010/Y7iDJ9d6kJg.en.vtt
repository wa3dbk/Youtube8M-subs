00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.600
 I bring again here we would like to know 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:11.200
 more of you more than anything how it influences 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.559
 you familiarly the pigeons what 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.750
 benefits have above all what is 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.250
 your family the environment we know that of 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 Somehow they have many communities 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.160
 but I would like us to live 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:43.290
 in a family environment for example a 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.790
 little more than this distance 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.670
 after d 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.060
 gangster drug addiction 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.600
 I feel resignation 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.940
 what I say in training in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.539
 the pigeons what is the formula of success 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.730
 look I feel that success goes all 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.280
 together there have to be many 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.740
 bicycles you have to have them right towards 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.340
 two pigeons 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.560
 you have to give them medicine vitamins and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.140
 training all together 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.140
 discipline above all and dedication 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.450
 I imagine part of this is cleaning 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:30.270
 everything they do every day in the morning 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.820
 in the afternoon all you have to do and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.530
 of course for example here when it is 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.710
 pride season 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.390
 We usually wish for the 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.390
 morning and afternoon no one 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.730
 which lines are what you drive us 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.170
 I would like to know more than anything because 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.860
 some colleagues, they have there 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.930
 lines and also because it's part of having 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.690
 good pigeons truth and especially the 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.920
 lines is also important in truth 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.170
 look, of course, this month 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.610
 driving 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.899
 in a line where a partner 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.799
 gave away some sticks 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.629
 janssen and other verses spread that I 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.360
 they gave satisfactions were words 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.510
 who gave me my first diplomas 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.760
 fulfill 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 can you indicate to me that it is a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.099
 dove background the qualities that you 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.189
 see according to the experience that you have 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.610
 really lived in the experience that 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:35.070
 contend can be better 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.640
 I feel like I've had pigeons since 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.940
 I was 12 or 13 years old but I never had 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:45.680
 dedicated to flying the well 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:49.320
 professionally in this 207 fancier 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.180
 strictly in about 5 years to here in 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.730
 where several results have been given and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.860
 cons God has done well 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:04.140
 the goal for me has always been for me 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:07.620
 it's a pleasure ok 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.120
 according to your experience what are 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.400
 the qualities that can have a 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.670
 breeding for you to say this 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.500
 Dove can be in my dovecote look 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.700
 the qualities I dawn them 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.910
 forever 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.080
 I've seen that the winning pigeons for 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.840
 they are the ones that have the best 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.000
 qualities a dove that has already 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.000
 attributed the results 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:38.519
 are you talking about the lineage that has 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.489
 pigeons back from the grandparents parents and 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.940
 everything that transcends them to 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.980
 to be able to leave generation by generation 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:50.069
 lines that are not nothing more than they are 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.470
 pretty but they are according to the 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.760
 flight that based that you're going to fly that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:59.720
 you can highlight truth then for me nothing 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.720
 the pigeons 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.040
 look I would not like to spend there in the 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.329
 area where you have your dovecote and 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.950
 the time see your payment plus 900 to make 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.200
 some question about that pigeon 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.200
 please if we pass
