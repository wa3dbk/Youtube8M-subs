00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
I use on a daily basis so I tend to use

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.810

salt for 8 when my hair is feel a bit
itchy<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.600> sometimes<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> just<00:00:55.800> feel<00:00:55.890> like

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
itchy or sometimes when I just feel like

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.740 
itchy or sometimes when I just feel like
it<00:00:56.280> because<00:00:56.520> I<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.940> like<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> sensation

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it because I kind of like the sensation

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.049 
it because I kind of like the sensation
that<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.230> has<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.710> gives<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.219> tingly

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
that it has it gives you this tingly
sensation<00:01:00.600> especially<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.350> hair<00:01:01.590> is

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
really good for anti dandruff because I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.660 
really good for anti dandruff because I
know<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.650> some<00:01:07.920> women<00:01:08.130> suffer<00:01:08.640> from

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
know that some women suffer from

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.850 
know that some women suffer from
dandruff<00:01:09.270> when<00:01:09.510> they're<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.750> braids<00:01:10.049> or<00:01:10.380> when

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
dandruff when they're in braids or when

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469 
dandruff when they're in braids or when
they<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> same<00:01:11.700> hairstyle<00:01:11.970> for<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
they just have the same hairstyle for a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.060 
they just have the same hairstyle for a
long<00:01:12.659> time<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:13.140> know<00:01:13.320> their<00:01:13.500> variety<00:01:13.890> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
long time I know their variety of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.660 
long time I know their variety of
reasons<00:01:14.520> for<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:15.150> don't<00:01:15.420> really<00:01:15.840> know<00:01:16.229> why

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
reasons for that I don't really know why

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.469 
reasons for that I don't really know why
thankfully<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.729> don't<00:01:17.939> really<00:01:18.119> suffer<00:01:18.360> from

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
thankfully I don't really suffer from

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.120 
thankfully I don't really suffer from
dandruff<00:01:18.930> that<00:01:19.110> much<00:01:19.320> but<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
dandruff that much but I think that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.950 
dandruff that much but I think that
there's<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.340> really<00:01:20.670> good<00:01:20.850> grade<00:01:21.240> spray<00:01:21.659> it's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
there's a really good grade spray it's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.499 
there's a really good grade spray it's
called<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.520> conditioned<00:01:23.520> answer<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.180> guess<00:01:24.360> it

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
called a conditioned answer I guess it

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.660 
called a conditioned answer I guess it
qualifies<00:01:24.930> as<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.170> leave-in<00:01:25.409> conditioner<00:01:26.310> but

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
qualifies as a leave-in conditioner but

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
qualifies as a leave-in conditioner but
I<00:01:26.939> find<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.110> pretty<00:01:28.409> good<00:01:28.500> for<00:01:28.560> me<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:28.860> this

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
I find it is pretty good for me so this

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.270 
I find it is pretty good for me so this
is<00:01:29.250> what<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.970> usually<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:31.680> twice<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> week

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
is what I use usually about twice a week

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.969 
is what I use usually about twice a week
because<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.759> stinks<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.750> tend<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> use<00:01:34.590> it<00:01:34.860> at

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
because it stinks I tend to use it at

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.980 
because it stinks I tend to use it at
nighttime<00:01:35.280> as<00:01:35.850> far<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.240> products<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.689> use<00:01:36.840> in

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
nighttime as far as products I use in

for instance I have this mane and tail
deep<00:03:23.640> conditioner<00:03:24.150> I<00:03:24.269> like<00:03:24.420> this<00:03:24.570> again

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
deep conditioner I like this again

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.930 
deep conditioner I like this again
because<00:03:25.230> it's<00:03:25.380> quite<00:03:25.590> deep<00:03:25.859> moisturizing<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
because it's quite deep moisturizing and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.000 
because it's quite deep moisturizing and
this<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:27.570> really<00:03:27.750> good<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.350> my<00:03:28.470> natural<00:03:28.650> hair

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
this is really good for my natural hair

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.640 
this is really good for my natural hair
I<00:03:29.190> really<00:03:29.519> enjoy<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.060> so<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:31.019> only<00:03:31.230> thing<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:31.590> do

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
I really enjoy it so the only thing I do

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.000 
I really enjoy it so the only thing I do
is<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:32.880> dilute<00:03:33.540> this<00:03:33.780> conditioner<00:03:34.380> after

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
is that I dilute this conditioner after

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.520 
is that I dilute this conditioner after
washing<00:03:35.280> my<00:03:35.400> hair<00:03:35.549> before<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.000> apply<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.530> simply

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
washing my hair before I apply it simply

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.140 
washing my hair before I apply it simply
because<00:03:37.799> when<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.130> have<00:03:38.310> braids<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:39.000> can

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
because when you have braids you can

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.090 
because when you have braids you can
imagine<00:03:39.600> that<00:03:39.750> condition<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.350> molecules

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
imagine that condition of molecules

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.030 
imagine that condition of molecules
especially<00:03:41.760> this<00:03:42.150> big<00:03:42.510> won't<00:03:43.380> really<00:03:43.620> be<00:03:43.799> able

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
especially this big won't really be able

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.160 
especially this big won't really be able
to<00:03:44.160> penetrate<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.450> will<00:03:45.570> be<00:03:45.660> hard<00:03:45.900> for<00:03:45.959> you

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
to penetrate so it will be hard for you

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.630 
to penetrate so it will be hard for you
to<00:03:46.320> wash<00:03:46.470> it<00:03:46.650> out<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:46.829> it<00:03:47.100> might<00:03:47.220> be<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.430> bit

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
to wash it out and it might be a bit

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.610 
to wash it out and it might be a bit
might<00:03:48.000> feel<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.209> bit<00:03:48.329> weird<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.140> it's<00:03:49.410> really

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
might feel a bit weird so it's really

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.550 
might feel a bit weird so it's really
good<00:03:49.859> to<00:03:50.070> dilute<00:03:50.730> them<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.810> way<00:03:52.019> they<00:03:52.260> can<00:03:52.440> do

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
good to dilute them that way they can do

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.680 
good to dilute them that way they can do
their<00:03:52.739> job<00:03:52.920> better<00:03:53.190> after<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.329> so<00:03:54.600> I've

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
their job better after that so I've

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.090 
their job better after that so I've
washed<00:03:54.900> my<00:03:55.109> hair<00:03:55.290> I've<00:03:55.470> conditioned<00:03:55.950> my<00:03:56.069> hair

out<00:06:48.350> probably<00:06:48.860> once<00:06:49.460> every<00:06:49.580> two<00:06:49.880> weeks<00:06:49.910> or

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
out probably once every two weeks or

once<00:06:51.680> every<00:06:51.800> three<00:06:52.220> weeks<00:06:52.370> not<00:06:52.820> necessarily

time you get into your second month as

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.230 
time you get into your second month as
your<00:06:57.770> hair<00:06:57.979> is<00:06:58.100> growing<00:06:58.280> in<00:06:58.520> you<00:06:58.729> will<00:06:58.880> notice
