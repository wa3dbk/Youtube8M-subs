 I just made change I lost everything 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 That scenario I had then I'm going 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.470
 having to rejoin now will take a while 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.789
 little but soon he is coming back 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.070
 with full force 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.609
 We're going to make a delicious here. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.990
 with the Italian stuffed a light bread not 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.040
 I know how it works 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.040
 so let's go to the recipe 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.850
 before I start the recipe I made 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.190
 I took a whole purple onion already 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.590
 slice very thin and now that I 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.940
 I threw 300 ml of water and a spoonful of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.280
 sugar soup 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 I mixed everything I played here for what it is 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.760
 to break if from the onion that does not 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
 You're going to let this rest here for some. 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.410
 15 minutes to get perfect is very 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.510
 important is to leave everything ready 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.700
 here to facilitate assembly 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.730
 today I have to cheese salami ham 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.430
 underneath is the tomato is carrot already 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.470
 here is the beetroot lettuce 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.390
 now it's all in the scheme go 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.430
 start cutting our good is well 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.479
 the process will pick up that goes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.040
 cut it in half is harder is a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.010
 little more work 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.510
 if you have a separate japanese knife there 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.640
 make life much easier 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.140
 so now I'm going to split in half and already 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.520
 I'll show you how we can 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 take the next step 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.770
 We already cut our tram because with 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.940
 two halves and now just prepare the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.880
 mayonnaise 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.950
 I have here a common mayonnaise in your 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.539
 packet have a tablespoon the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.990

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:47.429
 oregano dessert and some 15 and 20 , the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.289
 five money readers 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.060
 wines where to do a medium analysis 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.039
 temperate 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.780
 Let's show this everything now who 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.289
 already mixed everything here 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.220
 the focus now already pass this little hand already 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:08.640
 is mixed with help to harvest here 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:11.700
 spread a generous layer can 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.890
 replace this mayonnaise here with a 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.770
 curd can put a piece of chicken 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.200
 Shredded you can do what you 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.959
 I want a little paper everything will be 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.490
 Delicious here is just a suggestion with 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.360

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.860
 My favorites 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.080
 now that he has spent all the more in this 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.080
 It 's time for the cheese season now 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:42.240
 cheese can make generous layer 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.040
 I think it does not taste so good. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.159
 the focus now together need not be too much 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.730

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.879
 so now I've played ham will 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.670
 Putting on the talking, you'll put it on. 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.830
 always half out 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.900

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.849
 disappear film measurement garbage now let the 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.610
 here onion 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.689
 the boot if you want can give the chosen one 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.430

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:12.290
 Alone because you think a little taste 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.290

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.400

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.400
