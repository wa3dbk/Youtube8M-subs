00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.309
 hello girls that such welcome from a to 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.900
 my shadow channel here and shadow now today 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.730
 I bring a video of the lipsticks that 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.980
 surely you will already know all that are 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.140
 the lips of Kate Moss I know that no 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.330
 is the prettiest nor my the highest but 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.910
 I love it as a model I think it has 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.320
 a lot of personality and I do not know how I love 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.420
 many jobs and things that 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.490
 do and two because the labials the 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.929
 truth is that they are of very good quality and 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.610
 taking advantage that now they had lowered them 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.140
 I decided to buy some 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.580
 how many since I did not have any because 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.019
 before, it seemed to me that the price had 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.019
 a little bit high there are two types 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.970
 there are two for streets is worth forever 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.870
 say that the packaging for me 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.820
 love is beautiful is simple but very 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.120
 pretty as you see, it has the signature of 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.960
 Kate Moss and the Reds are completely 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 mates and blacks are with a little 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.040
 more than brightness 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.670
 the first lipstick you want to show you is 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.670
 this one here 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.710
 red so blood 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.970
 beautiful 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.970
 and it happens in the fat 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.530
 tell you also that they are lipsticks 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.150
 that smell great and that they have 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.620
 quite a long time and they last me 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.900
 quite on the lips so the 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.720

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.689
