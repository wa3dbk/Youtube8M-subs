00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 how about hunting is a monster 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 ten meters high in a jungle 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.600
 tropical with four of your friends and 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.069
 well that's what the 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 creators of left for dead with their 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.400
 new license i flight 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.690
 four hunters against a monster a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.580
 experience that promises to be more 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.350
 interesting especially that the prey is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.090
 not always the one we believe the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.710
 producer of the game being passing on 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.480
 Paris we took advantage for him 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.910
 ask your questions and learn a 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.330
 little more about this new license and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.210
 wolf 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.349
 it's a game of 4 against 1 ie 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.170
 which a team of four hunters 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.189
 who clash with a monster 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 what is more interesting is that 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.570
 the team is controlled by humans and 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.070
 the player can also be countered by 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.899
 humans so it gives to help 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 battles that are all different 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.050
 which gives different results to 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.600
 every time it's a game that has been 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.340
 designed and created by the right who are 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 the creators of the fed who also 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.180
 worked on a lot of versions of 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 quintals strike so already it's a 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.449
 team a studio that has not hurt 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.449
 experience in play but you see 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.649
 we can easily see points that we 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.809
 must I think because here we already 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.869
 is talking about a game that has a team of 4 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.020
 people here type e or cooperation 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:13.030
 is very important but what they have 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.070
 tried to do with yvan really got 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.960
 moved to another level of cooperation 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.250
 with the need of following you 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.299
 four different characters but there we 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.470
 the 4 different classes four 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.460
 characters who are all a job 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 different in the team 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.590
 a healer a trapper in support and a 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.119
 assault the different classes are 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.799
 obliged to do their job 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.920
 particular for the team to work 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.920
 well 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.110
 not at all no so it's true that a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.390
 cat team who plays very well 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.090
 that they have understood the classes that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.100
 plays and who plays a spirit of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.380
 cooperation if it's a workforce that's 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.350
 a very powerful team very powerful 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.150
 but the boss on his side is also very 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 very powerful when he starts he is 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.259
 quite vulnerable tends to want 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.880
 escape from feeding themselves to go down 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.530
 had to evolve but little by little 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.009
 when he evolves to the second mode is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.800
 at the level 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.540
 he becomes very very powerful so the 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.680
 rescue deaths that level 2 this is 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.630
 rather a battle and that it lasted 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.950
 when they arrive at level 3 is 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.110
 even bigger more powerful so 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.150
 here is the advantage with the monster 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.590
 it does not mean that all 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.870
 battles are going on like this it's 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.940
 quite possible to win if you are 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.680
 pretty good at level 1 with the monster 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.430
 well his account y experienced team of 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.010
 hunters it's difficult but so our 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.940
 a monster that four hunters it's 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.940
 very alive 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.880
 this card is big enough to go 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.430
 because who are bigger smaller 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.460
 more intimate that forces a little more the 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.860
 fight so mean for some of that 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.570
 really depends on the players so if 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.010
 the team and hunters is very very 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.750
 strong maybe it should maybe five 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.610
 minutes and in fact there are several 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.100
 things that can change the dynamics 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.170
 of the game so there are bullocks on the 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:18.260
 cards so if for example the hunters 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.910
 and he finds Adam Jones who is in 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.270
 killing critters that is on the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.740
 map 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.090
 that it can completely change the 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.920
 part ie the hunters 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.280
 they can really do a lot of 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.530
 damages 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.570
 we will finish the game at 6 to 8 months 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.630
 in the side the world can also find 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.220
 more damages so him if the troubles 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.810
 lady and the responsible moment to go 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.840
 attack the hunters and that can end 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.300
 leave in five minutes but good this morning 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.300
 we made parties of not 20 25 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.300
 minutes quite tense so it can last 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.769
 the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.209
 in fact I can not really speak in 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.980
 this moment is something that is not 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.689
 not defined yet so we show 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:00.010
 until we just talk about what we 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.010
 shows where I'm sorry 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.049
 so here I entrust my jury who did not 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:13.319
 splitted screen in fact the experience is 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.319
 much better with full screen 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:35.340
 in fact not so how do we fix the 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.140
 classes at sotra veur healer each 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.500
 character keep even if it's not 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.530
 possible 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.700
 ddd to save but hey there will be a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.490
 compression system ie that 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.620
 if you prefer a character on a 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.170
 other you can choose you can 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:57.220
 progress seven characters so that's 

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:58.780
 so low we can confirm that there 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.310
 will have a matchmaking system that we 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.510
 realizes that maybe all the 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.210
 world will perhaps want to play the 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.580
 monster so it would have to be here for 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.620
 find a way to fill the teams 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.090
 but I want to tell you that with the system 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.310
 of progression there will be a system of 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.620
 matchmaking which means that oval that 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:21.520
 should the teams so that all the 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:24.400
 world may or may not that it is rather a 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.100
 question for for rock drama but a 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.440
 very good question I think at 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.290
 given moment if or for people 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:35.770
 creatives they did what they did 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.930
 with the dead efs story from here a game 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.910
 who is very very successful they have 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.440
 want to try new things there 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.840
 had all the time I think the 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.370
 creative people they have ideas in 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.280
 head any time ideas that launches 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.260
 when they work so necessarily 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.150
 it's an idea that has just formed 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.280
 before they start the fevad 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.380
 things that remained so when he removes 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.310
 have finished with the sales fennecs 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.310
 that's it
