that I can do a red one cuz i think the

because a lot of times when you say red
black<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:39.930> some<00:02:40.290> wider<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.799> some<00:02:41.010> gray<00:02:41.250> it

sometimes<00:03:31.709> where<00:03:32.069> I'm<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.250> like<00:03:32.549> not

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
sometimes where I'm just like not

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.009 
sometimes where I'm just like not
thinking<00:03:33.030> about<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.209> stick<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.480> i<00:03:33.540> go<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.930> i

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
thinking about the stick and i go and i

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.360 
thinking about the stick and i go and i
go<00:03:34.139> to<00:03:34.199> pass<00:03:34.470> or<00:03:34.650> shoot<00:03:34.829> and<00:03:35.099> it's<00:03:35.190> just<00:03:35.310> like

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
go to pass or shoot and it's just like

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.939 
go to pass or shoot and it's just like
her<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.090> I'm<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.230> kind<00:03:37.230> of<00:03:37.260> confused<00:03:37.680> but

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
her and I'm like kind of confused but

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.319 
her and I'm like kind of confused but
these<00:03:38.129> ones<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.430> been<00:03:38.579> great<00:03:38.849> like<00:03:39.150> it's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
these ones have been great like it's

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.710 
these ones have been great like it's
kind<00:03:39.540> of<00:03:39.629> started<00:03:40.019> at<00:03:40.169> a<00:03:40.459> when<00:03:41.459> i<00:03:41.489> started<00:03:41.879> when

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
kind of started at a when i started when

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.360 
kind of started at a when i started when
i<00:03:42.810> did<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.049> pink<00:03:43.290> one<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.500> think<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.310> I

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
i did the pink one I think is when I

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.539 
i did the pink one I think is when I
really<00:03:44.819> started<00:03:45.410> understanding<00:03:46.410> like<00:03:47.220> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
really started understanding like the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.140 
really started understanding like the
physics<00:03:48.180> of<00:03:48.299> it<00:03:48.449> and<00:03:49.069> really<00:03:50.069> dialing<00:03:50.730> in<00:03:50.879> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
physics of it and really dialing in the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.699 
physics of it and really dialing in the
you<00:03:51.389> know<00:03:51.419> that<00:03:51.660> mid<00:03:51.900> whip<00:03:52.169> but<00:03:52.440> then<00:03:52.560> when

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
you know that mid whip but then when

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.830 
you know that mid whip but then when
you're<00:03:52.799> going<00:03:52.949> to<00:03:53.010> crank<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.400> shot<00:03:53.699> all<00:03:54.000> these

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
you're going to crank a shot all these

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.309 
you're going to crank a shot all these
see<00:03:55.470> all<00:03:55.919> these<00:03:56.540> contingent<00:03:57.540> stringing<00:03:58.019> here

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
see all these contingent stringing here

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.759 
see all these contingent stringing here
and<00:03:58.470> here<00:03:58.739> see<00:03:59.400> they<00:03:59.790> pull<00:04:00.319> it's<00:04:01.319> making<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
and here see they pull it's making the

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.430 
and here see they pull it's making the
pocket<00:04:02.129> deeper<00:04:02.519> making<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:03.510> know<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.900> ramp

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
pocket deeper making you know the ramp

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.860 
pocket deeper making you know the ramp
is<00:04:04.680> Weston<00:04:05.040> would<00:04:05.159> say<00:04:05.480> deeper<00:04:06.480> which<00:04:06.750> is

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
is Weston would say deeper which is

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.780 
is Weston would say deeper which is
going<00:04:06.989> to<00:04:07.049> give<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.319> more<00:04:07.500> whip<00:04:07.829> and<00:04:08.129> thus<00:04:08.760> a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
going to give you more whip and thus a

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.869 
going to give you more whip and thus a
harder<00:04:09.359> shot<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:11.489> when<00:04:11.579> you're<00:04:11.699> when

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
harder shot and so but when you're when

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.030 
harder shot and so but when you're when
you're<00:04:11.940> passing<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.750> ball<00:04:13.440> doesn't<00:04:13.680> have<00:04:13.889> as

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
you're passing the ball doesn't have as

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.259 
you're passing the ball doesn't have as
much<00:04:14.159> attention<00:04:14.310> on<00:04:14.639> them<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:14.909> stretch<00:04:15.120> them

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
much attention on them to stretch them

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.729 
much attention on them to stretch them
so<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.479> ball<00:04:15.659> comes<00:04:15.840> out<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.470> then<00:04:16.620> when

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
so the ball comes out but then when

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.319 
so the ball comes out but then when
you're<00:04:16.859> cranking<00:04:17.280> it<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.579> its<00:04:17.669> way<00:04:17.880> back<00:04:18.090> here

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
you're cranking it and its way back here

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.270 
you're cranking it and its way back here
and<00:04:18.389> you're<00:04:18.449> Paul<00:04:18.690> Rabil<00:04:18.900> again<00:04:19.289> this<00:04:20.010> thing

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
and you're Paul Rabil again this thing

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.039 
and you're Paul Rabil again this thing
will<00:04:20.519> push<00:04:20.760> up<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.269> it's<00:04:21.389> going<00:04:21.510> to<00:04:21.570> snap<00:04:21.989> that

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
will push up and it's going to snap that

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.620 
will push up and it's going to snap that
ball<00:04:22.560> out<00:04:22.800> on<00:04:23.030> kind<00:04:24.030> of<00:04:24.120> what<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.389> was<00:04:24.479> like

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
ball out on kind of what it was like

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.750 
ball out on kind of what it was like
what<00:04:24.870> a<00:04:24.900> heat<00:04:25.169> does<00:04:25.380> but<00:04:26.130> on

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
what a heat does but on

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.060 
what a heat does but on
it's<00:04:27.180> gonna<00:04:27.390> the<00:04:27.960> heats<00:04:28.200> not<00:04:28.380> gonna<00:04:28.740> have<00:04:28.890> more

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
it's gonna the heats not gonna have more

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.770 
it's gonna the heats not gonna have more
whip<00:04:29.370> because<00:04:29.640> of<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:29.970> X<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.540> doesn't

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
whip because of the X and it doesn't

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.840 
whip because of the X and it doesn't
have<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.960> twist<00:04:31.860> which<00:04:32.250> it's<00:04:32.490> gonna<00:04:32.580> let<00:04:32.760> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
have the twist which it's gonna let the

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.590 
have the twist which it's gonna let the
ball<00:04:33.030> release<00:04:33.360> nicer<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:35.010> I've<00:04:35.910> really<00:04:35.970> been

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
ball release nicer so I've really been

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.480 
ball release nicer so I've really been
loving<00:04:36.750> them<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:37.320> this<00:04:37.800> one<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:37.980> think<00:04:38.100> is<00:04:38.310> just

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
loving them and this one I think is just

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.020 
loving them and this one I think is just
you<00:04:38.700> know<00:04:38.880> um<00:04:39.440> another<00:04:40.440> really<00:04:40.920> solid<00:04:41.520> totally

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
you know um another really solid totally

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.270 
you know um another really solid totally
different-looking<00:04:42.390> pocket<00:04:43.020> um<00:04:43.200> that<00:04:44.130> I've

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
different-looking pocket um that I've

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.760 
different-looking pocket um that I've
done<00:04:44.460> you<00:04:44.910> know<00:04:45.150> it's<00:04:45.270> another<00:04:45.480> black<00:04:46.380> clutch

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
done you know it's another black clutch

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.350 
done you know it's another black clutch
and<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.100> think<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.310> got<00:04:47.460> another<00:04:47.730> one<00:04:47.850> in<00:04:48.000> today

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
and I think I got another one in today
