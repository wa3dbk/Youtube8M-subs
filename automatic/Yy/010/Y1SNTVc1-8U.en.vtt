called the core a couple of times but a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.800 
called the core a couple of times but a
couple<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.689> ads<00:01:24.810> through<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:26.810> other

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
interesting things like the power

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
interesting things like the power
consumption<00:01:29.909> tells<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> current<00:01:30.900> power

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
consumption of the unit which is rather

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.330 
consumption of the unit which is rather
odd<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.320> call<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.740> techno<00:01:35.250> wank<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.790> anyway

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
odd I call that techno wank but anyway

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.890 
odd I call that techno wank but anyway
it's<00:01:38.340> not<00:01:38.460> such<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> bad<00:01:38.939> idea<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.450> suppose<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it's not such a bad idea I suppose it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.440 
it's not such a bad idea I suppose it
has<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> built-in<00:01:40.439> Nass<00:01:40.880> which<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.210> will

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
has a built-in Nass which I will

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.440 
has a built-in Nass which I will
probably<00:01:42.600> never<00:01:43.020> use<00:01:43.909> but<00:01:44.909> anyway<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.299> might

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
probably never use but anyway it might

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.819 
probably never use but anyway it might
be<00:01:45.570> good<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.899> for<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.170> storing<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> couple

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
be good there for just storing a couple

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.300 
be good there for just storing a couple
files<00:01:47.040> maybe<00:01:47.280> like<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> backup<00:01:48.060> system<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.689> the

the<00:02:06.350> automatic<00:02:07.350> configuration<00:02:07.620> is<00:02:08.280> useless

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the automatic configuration is useless

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.340 
the automatic configuration is useless
here<00:02:08.820> in<00:02:08.910> Australia<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.570> may<00:02:09.720> work<00:02:09.990> for

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
here in Australia it may work for

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.710 
here in Australia it may work for
Germany<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.670> does<00:02:11.940> not<00:02:12.180> work<00:02:12.360> here<00:02:12.630> in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.400 
Germany but it does not work here in
Australia<00:02:14.600> it's<00:02:15.600> very<00:02:15.810> good<00:02:15.990> tools<00:02:16.230> which

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
Australia it's very good tools which

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.810 
Australia it's very good tools which

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
all sorts of other information like how

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.000 
all sorts of other information like how
much<00:02:23.880> megabytes<00:02:24.510> you've<00:02:24.690> used<00:02:25.010> everything

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
much megabytes you've used everything

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.590 
much megabytes you've used everything
recorded<00:02:26.940> in<00:02:27.210> between<00:02:28.430> online<00:02:29.430> time<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.450> I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
recorded in between online time which I

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.880 
recorded in between online time which I
don't<00:02:30.660> think<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.050> going<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.320> used<00:02:31.590> because

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
don't think is going to be used because

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.860 
don't think is going to be used because
it's<00:02:32.160> actually<00:02:32.490> permanently<00:02:33.120> online<00:02:33.570> for<00:02:33.780> me

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
it's actually permanently online for me

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.640 
it's actually permanently online for me
but<00:02:34.860> yeah<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:36.480> rates<00:02:36.780> thing<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.320> I<00:02:37.350> think<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
but yeah the rates thing here I think it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.090 
but yeah the rates thing here I think it
can<00:02:37.740> actually<00:02:38.040> enable<00:02:39.470> how<00:02:40.470> much<00:02:40.620> money<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
can actually enable how much money you

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.190 
can actually enable how much money you
spend<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.640> data<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.690> warn<00:02:42.990> you<00:02:43.140> or

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
spend on data and it can warn you or

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.830 
spend on data and it can warn you or
things<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:44.460> does<00:02:44.670> actually<00:02:44.850> email

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
things like that it does actually email

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.930 
things like that it does actually email
you<00:02:46.080> while<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.620> can<00:02:46.830> be<00:02:46.860> set<00:02:47.190> up<00:02:47.310> to<00:02:47.340> email<00:02:47.760> you

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
with the unit so far definitely is quick

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.250 
with the unit so far definitely is quick
definitely<00:03:35.459> no<00:03:36.090> doubt<00:03:36.330> about<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.720> being<00:03:36.900> quick
