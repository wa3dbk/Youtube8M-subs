I
I<00:00:08.460> love<00:00:09.460> phenom<00:00:10.000> CA<00:00:10.240> pans<00:00:10.570> and<00:00:10.900> Finance<00:00:11.590> ea's

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
I love phenom CA pans and Finance ea's

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.280 
I love phenom CA pans and Finance ea's
are<00:00:12.010> actually<00:00:12.430> French<00:00:12.850> for<00:00:13.300> ingot<00:00:13.810> they<00:00:14.140> look

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
are actually French for ingot they look

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.890 
are actually French for ingot they look
like<00:00:14.380> little<00:00:14.530> gold<00:00:14.860> ingots<00:00:15.310> I<00:00:15.490> use<00:00:16.180> them<00:00:16.480> for

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
like little gold ingots I use them for

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.130 
like little gold ingots I use them for
baking<00:00:17.260> brownies<00:00:17.620> because<00:00:18.310> brownies<00:00:19.240> after

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
baking brownies because brownies after

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.750 
baking brownies because brownies after
if<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:20.260> cut<00:00:20.500> them<00:00:20.680> after<00:00:20.950> they're<00:00:21.100> baked<00:00:21.340> it's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
if you cut them after they're baked it's

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.490 
if you cut them after they're baked it's
always<00:00:22.030> awkward<00:00:22.450> to<00:00:22.810> cut<00:00:22.990> them<00:00:23.170> because

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
always awkward to cut them because

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.990 
always awkward to cut them because
they're<00:00:23.680> not<00:00:23.800> even<00:00:24.190> and<00:00:24.400> they<00:00:24.760> don't<00:00:24.880> have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
they're not even and they don't have

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.269 
they're not even and they don't have
crust<00:00:25.420> on<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.690> side<00:00:25.900> to<00:00:25.930> keep<00:00:26.140> them<00:00:26.350> fresh<00:00:26.650> but

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
crust on the side to keep them fresh but

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.100 
crust on the side to keep them fresh but
in<00:00:27.340> these<00:00:27.430> pans<00:00:27.789> each<00:00:28.090> one<00:00:28.330> is<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.630> exact<00:00:28.930> same

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
in these pans each one is the exact same

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.410 
in these pans each one is the exact same
size<00:00:29.410> and<00:00:29.770> also<00:00:30.460> they<00:00:30.609> have<00:00:30.760> a<00:00:30.789> very<00:00:31.150> fine

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
size and also they have a very fine

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.720 
size and also they have a very fine
crust<00:00:31.779> that<00:00:32.020> sealed<00:00:32.320> in<00:00:32.529> plus<00:00:33.100> it's<00:00:33.340> really

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
crust that sealed in plus it's really

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.160 
crust that sealed in plus it's really
easy<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:34.000> unroll<00:00:34.329> them<00:00:34.540> especially<00:00:34.780> in<00:00:35.110> the

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
easy to unroll them especially in the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.290 
easy to unroll them especially in the
silicon<00:00:35.649> but<00:00:36.160> the<00:00:36.310> secret<00:00:36.760> to<00:00:36.910> baking<00:00:37.210> in

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
silicon but the secret to baking in

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.660 
silicon but the secret to baking in
silicon<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:38.500> make<00:00:38.649> them<00:00:38.680> bake<00:00:39.010> evenly<00:00:39.220> the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
silicon and to make them bake evenly the

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.210 
silicon and to make them bake evenly the
center<00:00:40.030> row<00:00:40.239> is<00:00:40.450> to<00:00:41.050> set<00:00:41.260> it<00:00:41.410> on<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.590> rack<00:00:41.860> and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 
center row is to set it on a rack and

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.490 
center row is to set it on a rack and
then<00:00:43.000> in<00:00:43.510> order<00:00:43.690> to<00:00:43.870> put<00:00:44.020> it<00:00:44.110> in<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:44.380> out<00:00:44.470> of

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
then in order to put it in and out of

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.080 
then in order to put it in and out of
the<00:00:44.680> oven<00:00:44.829> easily<00:00:45.520> because<00:00:45.670> it's<00:00:45.820> hard<00:00:46.000> to

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
the oven easily because it's hard to

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.540 
the oven easily because it's hard to
grab<00:00:46.270> ahold<00:00:46.420> to<00:00:46.600> rack<00:00:46.899> on<00:00:47.140> a<00:00:47.200> rack<00:00:47.559> to<00:00:48.280> put<00:00:48.309> them

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
grab ahold to rack on a rack to put them

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.310 
grab ahold to rack on a rack to put them
on<00:00:48.640> a<00:00:48.670> baking<00:00:48.880> sheet<00:00:49.120> believe<00:00:49.840> me<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.110> worth

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
on a baking sheet believe me it's worth

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.110 
on a baking sheet believe me it's worth
it<00:00:50.559> because<00:00:50.590> you'll<00:00:51.130> see<00:00:51.340> how<00:00:51.520> easy<00:00:51.550> it<00:00:51.940> is<00:00:52.059> to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
it because you'll see how easy it is to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.810 
it because you'll see how easy it is to
unmold<00:00:52.540> now<00:00:53.379> the<00:00:53.440> first<00:00:53.680> thing<00:00:53.860> I<00:00:54.070> do<00:00:54.129> even

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
unmold now the first thing I do even

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.700 
unmold now the first thing I do even
though<00:00:55.030> silicon<00:00:55.540> is<00:00:55.809> a<00:00:55.840> very<00:00:56.230> nonstick

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
though silicon is a very nonstick

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.220 
though silicon is a very nonstick
material<00:00:56.920> is<00:00:57.520> I<00:00:58.030> spray<00:00:58.360> it<00:00:58.390> with<00:00:58.540> the<00:00:59.050> grease

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
material is I spray it with the grease

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.990 
material is I spray it with the grease
and<00:00:59.469> flour<00:00:59.590> because<00:01:00.039> that<00:01:00.340> way<00:01:00.489> it's

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
and flour because that way it's

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.520 
and flour because that way it's
chocolate<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:01.719> chocolate<00:01:01.870> never<00:01:02.230> wants<00:01:02.500> to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
chocolate and chocolate never wants to

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.859 
chocolate and chocolate never wants to
unmold<00:01:02.829> from<00:01:03.039> anything<00:01:03.430> one<00:01:03.520> hundred<00:01:03.730> percent

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
unmold from anything one hundred percent

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.240 
unmold from anything one hundred percent
but<00:01:04.869> after<00:01:05.199> spraying<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.680> with<00:01:05.710> grease<00:01:06.040> and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
but after spraying it with grease and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.670 
but after spraying it with grease and
flour<00:01:06.369> I<00:01:06.580> take<00:01:06.880> a<00:01:06.909> damp<00:01:07.210> cloth<00:01:07.330> and<00:01:07.810> clean<00:01:08.409> the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
flour I take a damp cloth and clean the

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.880 
flour I take a damp cloth and clean the
top<00:01:08.920> because<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.990> will<00:01:11.229> bake<00:01:11.470> onto<00:01:11.770> the

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
top because it will bake onto the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.710 
top because it will bake onto the
silicon<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.670> not<00:01:13.060> that<00:01:13.180> it<00:01:13.270> would<00:01:13.330> hurt<00:01:13.540> it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
silicon and not that it would hurt it

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.180 
silicon and not that it would hurt it
but<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.020> wouldn't<00:01:14.229> look<00:01:14.320> as<00:01:14.470> attractive<00:01:14.590> and

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
but it wouldn't look as attractive and

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.160 
but it wouldn't look as attractive and
since<00:01:15.670> I<00:01:15.729> love<00:01:15.909> my<00:01:16.030> equipment<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.600> love<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.990> keep

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
since I love my equipment I love to keep

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.130 
since I love my equipment I love to keep
it<00:01:17.320> looking<00:01:17.560> really<00:01:17.860> pretty<00:01:18.070> and<00:01:18.280> good<00:01:19.140> you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
it looking really pretty and good you

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.570 
it looking really pretty and good you
can't<00:01:20.380> put<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> dishwasher<00:01:21.280> as<00:01:21.549> well

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
can't put this in the dishwasher as well

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.910 
can't put this in the dishwasher as well
but<00:01:21.909> it<00:01:22.000> won't<00:01:22.180> take<00:01:22.390> off<00:01:22.570> baked<00:01:22.869> off<00:01:23.049> things

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
but it won't take off baked off things

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.490 
but it won't take off baked off things
like<00:01:24.130> that<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.460> in<00:01:27.760> order<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.060> get<00:01:28.479> the<00:01:29.260> brownie

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
like that so in order to get the brownie

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.310 
like that so in order to get the brownie
batter<00:01:29.799> or<00:01:30.159> not<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:31.180> batter<00:01:31.420> into<00:01:32.170> these

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
batter or not see a batter into these

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.100 
batter or not see a batter into these
depressions<00:01:32.830> you<00:01:33.670> can<00:01:33.850> spoon<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:34.930> I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
depressions you can spoon it in but I

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.109 
depressions you can spoon it in but I
love<00:01:35.409> using<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.740> pastry<00:01:35.920> bag<00:01:36.280> especially<00:01:36.610> since

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
love using a pastry bag especially since

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.760 
love using a pastry bag especially since
they've<00:01:37.330> been<00:01:37.360> making<00:01:37.479> disposable<00:01:38.350> plastic

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
they've been making disposable plastic

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.260 
they've been making disposable plastic
ones<00:01:38.979> that<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.490> can<00:01:39.610> just<00:01:39.759> throw<00:01:39.880> out<00:01:40.119> when

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
ones that you can just throw out when

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.670 
ones that you can just throw out when
you're<00:01:40.390> done<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.840> don't<00:01:41.170> even<00:01:41.259> need<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.590> have

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:41.680 
you're done you don't even need to have

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.350 
you're done you don't even need to have
a<00:01:41.710> pastry<00:01:42.130> tip<00:01:42.310> you<00:01:42.520> can<00:01:42.670> just<00:01:42.850> cut<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.180> tip

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
a pastry tip you can just cut the tip
