series<00:00:10.820> engine<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.769> we'll<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:14.130> fire<00:00:14.340> them

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
series engine and we'll just fire them

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.660 
series engine and we'll just fire them
up<00:00:14.690> running<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:15.929> down<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.350> rpm<00:00:16.830> so<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.580> can

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
up running up and down on rpm so you can

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.580 
up running up and down on rpm so you can
see<00:00:17.789> how<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.029> runs

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
see how it runs

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.279 
see how it runs
make<00:00:19.830> sure<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> t<00:00:20.279> levels<00:00:20.520> on

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:26.289 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.839 

ciao

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.520 

throttle

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:02:25.670 

Machoke

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.060 

so<00:02:26.680> as<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.980> can<00:02:27.100> see<00:02:27.160> everyone's<00:02:28.000> runs<00:02:28.780> well

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
so as you can see everyone's runs well

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.170 
so as you can see everyone's runs well
the<00:02:30.070> engine's<00:02:30.400> real<00:02:30.580> strong

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the engine's real strong

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.350 
the engine's real strong
I<00:02:31.210> took<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.110> carburetor<00:02:32.530> apart<00:02:32.620> and<00:02:33.360> probably

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
I took the carburetor apart and probably

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.200 
I took the carburetor apart and probably
could<00:02:34.540> use<00:02:34.720> an<00:02:35.050> extra<00:02:35.580> needle<00:02:36.580> valve<00:02:36.790> in<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
could use an extra needle valve in the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.790 
could use an extra needle valve in the
bottom<00:02:37.510> of<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:37.750> fits<00:02:38.050> somebody<00:02:38.380> torqued<00:02:38.680> it

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
bottom of it fits somebody torqued it

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.450 
bottom of it fits somebody torqued it
down<00:02:38.950> too<00:02:39.160> hard<00:02:39.400> and<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:41.190> made<00:02:42.190> a<00:02:42.220> ring

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
down too hard and kind of made a ring

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.190 
down too hard and kind of made a ring
around<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.910> needle<00:02:43.180> valve<00:02:43.390> so<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.750> probably

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
around the needle valve so it probably

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.760 
around the needle valve so it probably
could<00:02:44.380> use<00:02:44.410> a<00:02:44.560> new<00:02:44.830> needle<00:02:45.610> valve<00:02:46.410> that's<00:02:47.410> and

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
could use a new needle valve that's and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.500 
could use a new needle valve that's and
that's<00:02:48.550> probably<00:02:48.820> part<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.240> adjustment

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that's probably part of the adjustment

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.440 
that's probably part of the adjustment
issues<00:02:49.930> that<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:50.350> have<00:02:50.770> with<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:52.330> a

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
issues that I have with it but it's a

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.680 
issues that I have with it but it's a
strong<00:02:52.750> running<00:02:52.990> little<00:02:53.320> engine<00:02:54.270> if<00:02:55.270> you<00:02:55.480> go

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
strong running little engine if you go

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.330 
strong running little engine if you go
