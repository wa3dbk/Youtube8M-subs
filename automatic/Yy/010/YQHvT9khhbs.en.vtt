00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.750
 i 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:19.310
 very good and welcome to a new 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.310
 video of a new job of an expert 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.540
 let's see today we will give time to 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:29.220
 work this tree because good has been 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:31.170
 a hard day of work then 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.590
 I wanted to share with you this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.850
 tree because I came up with an idea 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.860
 we have already given all the guidelines of the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 bonsai according to the traditional school 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.320
 Japanese at bonsai school online 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.320
 so 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.210
 so I want you to see this tree 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.039
 you see the movement of the trunk 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.860
 you see the arrangement of the branches that 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.460
 they go diagonal up 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.820
 You see the departure of the taxi to Gary 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 the layout of the branch makes fun 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.730
 in curved outdoors and all these things 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.800
 do not 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.040
 well I 'm something I'm going to work 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.600
 morning 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:19.439
 because I already say that today 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.570
 I do not have time even if you do not see me 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 working determined empty the pond 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.130
 of cleaning it does many things must 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.430
 watering everything very profusely were missing the 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.150
 dry air musict trees so 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.320
 I want 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.320
 as an exercise 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.080
 that you leave written in the comments of 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.880
 Youtube 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.870
 or on the facebook also that also 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.870
 It has a lot of movement 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.270
 that work 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.580
 you think it would be good to do this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.130
 tree or what you think should be the 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.740
 design of this tree and I will read it 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.280
 everything today and tomorrow morning before 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.820
 come 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.120
 and I will answer you 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.960
 to the most remarkable things to the 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.190
 the most remarkable successes and the successes 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.959
 most remarkable but always of a 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.510
 constructive way to tell him hey 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.950
 I was very bad but for example that 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.610
 tell me hey, I think the front 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:22.550
 it has to be this from the dry branch 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.620
 and I'm going to explain that not for a 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.020
 motive or that I tell you go I think that 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.000
 different it must be this one that has everything 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.470
 the front foliage so that it is more 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.410
 covered ahead and I must say that 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.410
 not for any reason or lateral or 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.240
 another lateral we are going to give you a 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.950
 track for you to make your designs 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.840
 mental and yours as if you want 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.460
 make the graphic designs and upload the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.690
 photos to twitter also sorry to the 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.860
 facebook or facebook because this is not 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.020
 good to do by email 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.880
 privately this is something like a 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.560
 exercise for everyone to learn 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.660
 this is a matter of learning not from 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.450
 humiliate anyone or be better than 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.940
 nobody to this is a matter of learning and 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.910
 share then had already given the 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.760
 first track the front has to be 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.650
 West 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.680
 from here by the right movement to 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.680
 left 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.430
 this movement here by the 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:20.459
 movement from left to right 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.459
 tell me which of these fronts you would choose 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.819
 how would you work on the tree like this 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.480
 as a summary 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.859
 and with respect to that I tomorrow when 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.099
 work is something that I have more or 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:36.170
 less clear what I want to do with it 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.400
 I'm commenting on you, I'm answering 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.840
 your suggestions or that it is not that I 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.700
 be in possession of the absolute truth and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.230
 tell you that he is wrong or not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.379
 that I according to the concepts tell me 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:52.129
 I could reason according to my point of view 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:56.970
 from the traditional Japanese school 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:59.580
 because yes or why not or who knows 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 maybe you see something that to me 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.170
 it has not occurred to me that I had 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.180
 possible 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.420
 and we can apply it to this 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.740
 juniper so well I do not return it to 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.370
 put 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:14.239
 the back 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.239
 or the front 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.950
 the back 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.500
 or the front 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:28.100
 this must always be a side and a 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.639
 side by the movement of the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.319
 so good 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.889
 I'm going to do a couple of photos, I 'm going to 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.889
 put on it 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:41.689
 in the video 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.249
 at the end and you already tell me 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:45.259
 I want to take this video for 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:49.749
 congratulate my brother that today is his 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.749
 birthday today turns 21 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.960
 good adriÃ¡n congratulations let's do 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.210
 one thing I'm going to 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.199
 I had sung a little piece of you 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.180
 happy birthday I'll give you one 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:08.880
 philosophical dissertation that now I 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:10.500
 like and I already have a good advice that goes 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.139
 to be my three gifts because what 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.580
 they demand nothing so first I'm going to 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:16.680
 sing a very short piece very short 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.039
 deliberate birthday 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.930
 as I said that the second short 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:26.729
 I'll give you the philosophical thought 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.800
 deep not deep this is called the 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.270
 surface so it was in your 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.940
 intimate moments of yours with yourself 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:40.490
 what you have lost or confused 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.490
 have something to think about and it's the following 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.810
 and you throw a peanut in the water 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.360
 being a nut and now the council 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.969
 a great board of brothers 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.539
 my advice the next we suck the 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.539
 yellow snow 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:59.610
 we do not go out 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:02.030
 so a hug and until the next 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.030
 video
