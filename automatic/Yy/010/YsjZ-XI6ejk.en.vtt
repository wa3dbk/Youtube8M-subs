00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
to get work on the steering I

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.030 
to get work on the steering I
straightened<00:01:27.810> out<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> tie<00:01:28.229> rod<00:01:30.650> as<00:01:31.650> best<00:01:31.890> as

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
straightened out the tie rod as best as

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.469 
straightened out the tie rod as best as
I<00:01:32.130> could<00:01:32.960> just<00:01:33.960> clean<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.560> clean<00:01:35.479> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
I could just clean it up clean the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.440 
I could just clean it up clean the
threads<00:01:36.750> all<00:01:37.049> up<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:37.729> put<00:01:38.729> never<00:01:38.939> sees<00:01:39.240> on

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
threads all up and put never sees on

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.819 
threads all up and put never sees on
there<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.200> shouldn't<00:01:40.500> have<00:01:40.619> any<00:01:40.770> issues

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
there so I shouldn't have any issues

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.750 
there so I shouldn't have any issues
later<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> adjust<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.130 

also<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:48.000> also<00:01:49.000> made<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:50.130> steering<00:01:51.130> link<00:01:51.430> here

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
also I also made this steering link here

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.570 
also I also made this steering link here
because<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.290> one<00:01:53.470> that<00:01:53.680> was<00:01:53.800> on<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.190> tractor

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
because the one that was on the tractor

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.760 
because the one that was on the tractor
originally<00:01:55.210> wouldn't<00:01:55.870> work<00:01:56.020> anymore<00:01:56.320> cuz

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
originally wouldn't work anymore cuz

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.300 
originally wouldn't work anymore cuz
it's<00:01:56.950> boat<00:01:57.450> four<00:01:58.450> inches<00:01:58.690> too<00:01:58.900> short<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.620> I

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
it's boat four inches too short so I

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.810 
it's boat four inches too short so I
couldn't<00:02:00.700> use<00:02:00.850> it<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.130> bent<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.340> one<00:02:03.610> up

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
couldn't use it so I bent this one up

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.540 
couldn't use it so I bent this one up
and<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:05.200> round<00:02:05.410> to<00:02:05.560> die<00:02:05.740> down<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.220> for<00:02:06.250> the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
and just round to die down it for the

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.990 
and just round to die down it for the
threads<00:02:07.619> threaded<00:02:08.619> it<00:02:08.770> for<00:02:09.130> half<00:02:09.310> inch<00:02:09.580> fine

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
threads threaded it for half inch fine

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.110 
threads threaded it for half inch fine
thread<00:02:10.330> which<00:02:10.510> is<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.840> these<00:02:11.020> joints<00:02:11.590> are

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
thread which is what these joints are

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.810 
thread which is what these joints are
and<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:16.740> started<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.890> make<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.250> bit<00:02:18.400> shorter

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
and I started to make it a bit shorter

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.400 
and I started to make it a bit shorter
yet<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.760> half-inch<00:02:22.240> shorter<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
yet for a half-inch shorter and it

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.280 
yet for a half-inch shorter and it
should<00:02:23.620> work<00:02:23.650> perfect
