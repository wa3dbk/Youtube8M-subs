what I grow the nursery is kind of
temporary<00:00:52.550> so<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.180> know<00:00:53.390> something<00:00:53.960> is<00:00:54.200> not

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.570 
going to be firm in any mood around I'll
disable<00:00:56.540> over<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.020> money<00:00:57.200> upfront<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.920> that

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
time once you set them in place so it's

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.490 
time once you set them in place so it's
not<00:01:07.220> something<00:01:07.640> that<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:08.030> I<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:09.110> any<00:01:09.259> thought

I'm going to cover this with plastic and

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.749 
I'm going to cover this with plastic and
then<00:01:51.109> the<00:01:51.200> plastic<00:01:51.469> is<00:01:51.979> going<00:01:52.130> to<00:01:52.189> trap<00:01:52.460> water

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
then the plastic is going to trap water

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.239 
then the plastic is going to trap water
but<00:01:53.090> I'll<00:01:53.179> poke<00:01:53.479> holes<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:54.109> the<00:01:54.200> plastic<00:01:54.469> to

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:55.249 
but I'll poke holes in the plastic to

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.120 
but I'll poke holes in the plastic to
let<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> water<00:01:55.700> drain<00:01:56.030> through<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:57.170> know<00:01:57.289> 36

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
let the water drain through you know 36

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.160 
let the water drain through you know 36
inches<00:01:58.459> might<00:01:58.850> be<00:01:59.030> ideal<00:01:59.209> you<00:01:59.749> can<00:01:59.899> make<00:02:00.049> it

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
inches might be ideal you can make it

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.510 
inches might be ideal you can make it
longer<00:02:00.409> but<00:02:00.740> you<00:02:00.859> know<00:02:00.950> what<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.219> make<00:02:01.369> many

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
longer but you know what you make many

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.399 
longer but you know what you make many
sizeable<00:02:02.119> wine<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.359> doesn't<00:02:02.689> matter<00:02:02.899> so

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
sizeable wine it doesn't matter so

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.080 
sizeable wine it doesn't matter so
basically<00:02:03.950> I've<00:02:04.159> just<00:02:04.189> got<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.670> standing

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
basically I've just got these standing

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.980 
basically I've just got these standing
up<00:02:05.209> here<00:02:05.389> I'm<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.600> take<00:02:05.719> them<00:02:05.869> outside

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
up here I'm going to take them outside

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.010 
up here I'm going to take them outside
I'm<00:02:06.439> going<00:02:06.619> to<00:02:06.679> assemble<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.639> this<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.060> a<00:02:08.090> frame

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
I'm going to assemble so this is a frame

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.530 
I'm going to assemble so this is a frame
mine<00:02:09.440> happens<00:02:09.979> to<00:02:10.009> be<00:02:10.130> five<00:02:10.429> feet<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.270> end

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
mine happens to be five feet that end

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.570 
mine happens to be five feet that end
piece<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.959> 42<00:02:12.440> inches<00:02:12.800> it's<00:02:13.010> going<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.220> overlap

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
piece is 42 inches it's going to overlap

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.380 
piece is 42 inches it's going to overlap
so<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.060> finished<00:02:14.390> product<00:02:14.780> will<00:02:14.870> be<00:02:14.900> about

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
so the finished product will be about

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.930 
so the finished product will be about
thirty<00:02:15.510> eight<00:02:15.600> inches<00:02:16.110> or<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.610> then<00:02:17.790> I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
thirty eight inches or so and then I'm

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.520 
thirty eight inches or so and then I'm
going<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.180> double<00:02:18.360> stack<00:02:18.870> them<00:02:19.140> because<00:02:19.410> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
going to double stack them because I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.280 
going to double stack them because I
want<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.490> put<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.850> much<00:02:21.290> growing

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
want I'm going to put this much growing

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.900 
want I'm going to put this much growing

medium in there rooting medium now I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.090 
medium in there rooting medium now I
could<00:02:24.209> use<00:02:24.240> coarse<00:02:24.690> sand<00:02:25.020> or<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.560> may<00:02:25.860> use

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
could use coarse sand or I may use

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.160 
could use coarse sand or I may use
something<00:02:26.520> like<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.670> potting<00:02:27.120> soil<00:02:27.420> for

something like a potting soil for

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.870 
something like a potting soil for
hardwood<00:02:28.560> cuttings<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.400> depends<00:02:29.790> on

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
hardwood cuttings it just depends on

I<00:02:52.800> built<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> propagation<00:02:53.940> box<00:02:54.300> out<00:02:54.570> here<00:02:54.600> I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
I built the propagation box out here I

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.890 
I built the propagation box out here I
thought<00:02:55.590> I've<00:02:55.769> taken<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.280> my<00:02:57.000> two<00:02:57.510> by<00:02:57.660> eight

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
thought I've taken my my two by eight

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.840 
thought I've taken my my two by eight
boxes<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.650> stacked<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.190> on<00:02:59.250> top<00:02:59.400> of<00:02:59.640> the

summer<00:03:21.900> when<00:03:22.079> we're<00:03:22.230> doing<00:03:22.320> salt<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:22.799> I

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
summer when we're doing salt because I

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.910 
summer when we're doing salt because I
use<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> real<00:03:23.970> course<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.470> has<00:03:25.709> got

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
use a real course and this has got

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.280 
use a real course and this has got
little<00:03:26.250> pebbles<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.150> because<00:03:27.750> we<00:03:27.900> want<00:03:28.140> the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
little pebbles in it because we want the

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.810 
little pebbles in it because we want the
water<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.620> run<00:03:28.739> through<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.400> don't<00:03:29.489> want<00:03:29.700> to

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
water to run through it we don't want to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.470 
water to run through it we don't want to
running<00:03:30.480> media<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.079> stay<00:03:31.350> wet<00:03:31.650> but<00:03:32.459> on<00:03:33.209> this

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
running media to stay wet but on this

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.330 
running media to stay wet but on this
side<00:03:33.750> I've<00:03:34.019> actually<00:03:34.230> taken<00:03:34.709> what<00:03:35.100> I'm<00:03:35.190> going

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
side I've actually taken what I'm going

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.280 
side I've actually taken what I'm going
to<00:03:35.400> use<00:03:35.519> as<00:03:35.700> my<00:03:35.850> potting<00:03:36.329> mixes<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
to use as my potting mixes and this is a

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.530 
to use as my potting mixes and this is a
lot<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.739> organic<00:03:38.130> material<00:03:38.850> there's<00:03:39.329> some

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
lot of organic material there's some

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.500 
lot of organic material there's some
leaf<00:03:39.720> compost<00:03:40.019> in<00:03:40.530> your<00:03:40.560> decomposed<00:03:41.160> bark<00:03:41.850> so

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
leaf compost in your decomposed bark so

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.539 
leaf compost in your decomposed bark so
I'm<00:03:43.110> actually<00:03:43.500> going<00:03:43.860> to<00:03:43.920> do<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.130> little<00:03:44.340> bit<00:03:44.489> of

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
I'm actually going to do a little bit of

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.340 
I'm actually going to do a little bit of
an<00:03:44.640> experiment<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.480> see<00:03:45.690> work<00:03:45.930> which<00:03:46.200> is

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
an experiment just to see work which is

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:47.930 
an experiment just to see work which is
going<00:03:46.470> to<00:03:46.530> work<00:03:46.680> better<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.100> these<00:03:47.340> hardwood

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
going to work better on these hardwood

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.120 
going to work better on these hardwood
cuttings<00:03:48.150> we<00:03:48.870> won't<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.320> answer<00:03:49.470> until

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
cuttings we won't know the answer until

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.759 
cuttings we won't know the answer until
the<00:03:50.489> probably<00:03:51.090> June<00:03:51.630> or<00:03:51.840> July<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.380> next<00:03:52.500> summer

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
the probably June or July of next summer

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.789 
the probably June or July of next summer
but<00:03:53.420> none<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.450> us<00:03:54.630> are<00:03:54.810> going<00:03:54.989> anywhere<00:03:55.470> so

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
but none of us are going anywhere so

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.430 
but none of us are going anywhere so
I'll<00:03:56.430> do<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.820> experiment<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.690> then<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.320> know

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
I'll do the experiment and then you know

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.199 
I'll do the experiment and then you know
remind<00:03:58.980> me<00:03:59.220> next<00:03:59.430> summer<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.850> I'll<00:03:59.910> tell<00:04:00.120> you

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
remind me next summer and I'll tell you

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.970 
remind me next summer and I'll tell you
how<00:04:00.360> this<00:04:00.570> did<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.959> will<00:04:01.170> shoot<00:04:01.709> a<00:04:01.829> little

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
how this did it will shoot a little

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.590 
how this did it will shoot a little
video<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.549> something<00:04:02.790> but<00:04:03.090> anyway<00:04:03.209> I'll

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
video or something but anyway I'll

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.660 
video or something but anyway I'll
update<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.140> page<00:04:04.470> with<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.280> outcome<00:04:05.640> of

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
update this page with the outcome of

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.120 
update this page with the outcome of
this<00:04:05.850> experiment<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.870> got<00:04:07.260> my<00:04:07.440> box<00:04:07.650> filled

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
this experiment so I got my box filled

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.640 
this experiment so I got my box filled
I've<00:04:08.340> got<00:04:08.549> like<00:04:09.360> a<00:04:09.390> potting<00:04:09.900> type<00:04:10.110> mix<00:04:10.380> on<00:04:10.530> this

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
I've got like a potting type mix on this

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.470 
I've got like a potting type mix on this
side<00:04:10.920> I<00:04:10.950> have<00:04:11.190> a<00:04:11.280> coarse<00:04:11.579> sand<00:04:11.910> on<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.090> side

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
side I have a coarse sand on that side

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.449 
side I have a coarse sand on that side
now<00:04:12.959> I'm<00:04:13.200> going<00:04:13.380> to<00:04:13.440> make<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> plastic<00:04:14.220> cover

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
now I'm going to make a plastic cover

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.400 
now I'm going to make a plastic cover
that<00:04:14.670> will<00:04:14.820> go<00:04:14.940> over<00:04:15.239> here<00:04:15.570> I'll<00:04:15.930> paint<00:04:16.260> to

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
that will go over here I'll paint to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.710 
that will go over here I'll paint to
cover<00:04:16.620> white<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.370> I've<00:04:17.880> got<00:04:18.090> clear<00:04:18.329> plastic

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
cover white it I've got clear plastic

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.599 
cover white it I've got clear plastic
and<00:04:19.260> I<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.560> want<00:04:19.919> clear<00:04:20.190> because<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
and I don't want clear because the

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.349 
and I don't want clear because the
subtle<00:04:20.970> shine

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
subtle shine

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.719 
subtle shine
to<00:04:21.419> clear<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.289> create<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.830> lot<00:04:23.069> of<00:04:23.099> heat<00:04:23.430> and

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
to clear and create a lot of heat and

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.850 
to clear and create a lot of heat and
could<00:04:24.060> possibly<00:04:24.569> make<00:04:24.810> my<00:04:25.020> cuttings<00:04:25.379> leap<00:04:25.620> off

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
could possibly make my cuttings leap off

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.290 
could possibly make my cuttings leap off
they're<00:04:26.789> dormant

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
they're dormant

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.850 
they're dormant
right<00:04:27.449> now<00:04:27.629> I<00:04:27.659> want<00:04:28.080> them<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.199> stay<00:04:28.530> dormant

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
right now I want them to stay dormant

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.179 
right now I want them to stay dormant
until<00:04:29.389> late<00:04:30.389> April<00:04:31.020> of<00:04:31.229> next<00:04:31.740> year<00:04:31.949> it's<00:04:34.189> late

00:04:35.179 --> 00:04:35.189 
until late April of next year it's late

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:36.800 
until late April of next year it's late
November<00:04:35.400> now<00:04:35.789> today's<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.389> day<00:04:36.539> after

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
November now today's the day after

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.080 
November now today's the day after
Thanksgiving<00:04:37.379> here<00:04:37.560> in<00:04:37.620> Ohio<00:04:37.889> so<00:04:38.280> I'm<00:04:38.729> going

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
Thanksgiving here in Ohio so I'm going

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.320 
Thanksgiving here in Ohio so I'm going
to<00:04:39.949> get<00:04:40.949> my<00:04:41.099> cuttings<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.639> here<00:04:41.849> but<00:04:42.000> anyway

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
to get my cuttings in here but anyway

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.029 
to get my cuttings in here but anyway
I'm<00:04:42.810> going<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.080> put<00:04:43.229> the<00:04:43.289> plastic<00:04:43.710> on<00:04:43.830> here

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
I'm going to put the plastic on here

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:45.260 
I'm going to put the plastic on here
then<00:04:44.189> I'll<00:04:44.280> paint<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.610> white<00:04:44.819> because<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
then I'll paint a white because the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.179 
then I'll paint a white because the
white<00:04:45.509> will<00:04:45.780> reflect<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.439> Rays<00:04:46.620> of<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.889> Sun

00:04:47.179 --> 00:04:47.189 
white will reflect the Rays of the Sun

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:49.159 
white will reflect the Rays of the Sun
the<00:04:47.699> plastic<00:04:48.240> will<00:04:48.389> help<00:04:48.569> to<00:04:48.689> retain<00:04:48.840> the

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
the plastic will help to retain the

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.040 
the plastic will help to retain the
moisture<00:04:49.349> and<00:04:50.159> water<00:04:50.789> is<00:04:51.000> going<00:04:51.150> to<00:04:51.240> puddle<00:04:51.930> on

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
moisture and water is going to puddle on

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.879 
moisture and water is going to puddle on
top<00:04:52.289> of<00:04:52.500> here

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
top of here

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.399 
top of here
but<00:04:53.460> I'm<00:04:53.580> hope<00:04:54.090> some<00:04:54.330> holes<00:04:54.569> so<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.960> water<00:04:55.199> can

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
but I'm hope some holes so the water can

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:57.230 
but I'm hope some holes so the water can
actually<00:04:55.590> seep<00:04:56.099> in<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.370> keep<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:57.029> humidity

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
actually seep in and keep the humidity

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.809 
actually seep in and keep the humidity
up<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:58.229> way<00:04:58.409> I<00:04:58.439> don't<00:04:58.620> have<00:04:58.979> to<00:04:59.159> if<00:04:59.430> I'm<00:04:59.610> not

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
up that way I don't have to if I'm not

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:00.980

had put a couple hinges on here Mar to
the<00:05:53.279> box<00:05:53.520> and<00:05:53.849> then<00:05:54.419> I'm<00:05:54.689> going<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.900> paint<00:05:55.229> is

00:05:55.429 --> 00:05:55.439 
the box and then I'm going to paint is

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:58.369 
the box and then I'm going to paint is
plastic<00:05:55.979> with<00:05:56.189> with<00:05:56.849> white<00:05:57.180> shoes<00:05:57.960> regular

00:05:58.369 --> 00:05:58.379 
plastic with with white shoes regular

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.129 
plastic with with white shoes regular
white<00:05:58.680> latex<00:05:59.159> paint<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.819> roll<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.509> plastic<00:06:01.020> of

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
white latex paint I roll the plastic of

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:02.990 
white latex paint I roll the plastic of
what<00:06:01.259> he<00:06:01.349> had<00:06:01.500> on<00:06:01.770> the<00:06:01.830> ends<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:02.430> I<00:06:02.580> could<00:06:02.819> get

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
what he had on the ends so I could get

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.540 
what he had on the ends so I could get
enough<00:06:03.689> thickness<00:06:03.990> to<00:06:04.349> hold<00:06:04.529> in<00:06:04.680> place<00:06:04.710> and

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:05.550 
enough thickness to hold in place and

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.119 
enough thickness to hold in place and
the<00:06:05.879> sides<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.419> put<00:06:06.659> a<00:06:06.689> strip<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.740> duct<00:06:08.009> tape

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129 
the sides I put a strip of duct tape

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.829 
the sides I put a strip of duct tape
down<00:06:08.639> there<00:06:08.849> and<00:06:08.969> then<00:06:09.060> staple<00:06:09.539> through<00:06:09.689> the

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839 
down there and then staple through the

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.390 
down there and then staple through the
duct<00:06:10.110> tape<00:06:10.349> and<00:06:10.560> that<00:06:10.680> gives<00:06:10.949> it<00:06:11.129> just<00:06:11.159> a

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:11.400 
duct tape and that gives it just a

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.939 
duct tape and that gives it just a
little<00:06:11.520> bit<00:06:11.729> more<00:06:11.939> strength<00:06:12.330> the<00:06:12.960> stapler

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
little bit more strength the stapler

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.050 
little bit more strength the stapler
duct<00:06:14.879> tape<00:06:15.150> is<00:06:15.469> less<00:06:16.469> likely<00:06:17.009> to<00:06:17.039> pull<00:06:17.370> out<00:06:17.580> you

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
duct tape is less likely to pull out you

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.040 
duct tape is less likely to pull out you
know<00:06:18.180> then<00:06:18.419> it<00:06:18.659> just

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
know then it just

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.249 
know then it just
a<00:06:20.150> plastic<00:06:21.150> with<00:06:21.300> a<00:06:21.360> staple<00:06:21.810> through<00:06:21.990> it<00:06:22.050> so

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
a plastic with a staple through it so

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.520 
a plastic with a staple through it so
that's<00:06:23.069> a<00:06:23.330> throw<00:06:24.330> rat<00:06:24.629> a<00:06:24.900> little<00:06:25.110> bit<00:06:25.229> of<00:06:25.289> paint

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
that's a throw rat a little bit of paint

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.070 
that's a throw rat a little bit of paint
we're<00:06:25.800> ready<00:06:25.979> to<00:06:26.159> stick<00:06:26.430> some<00:06:26.580> cards<00:06:27.080> our
