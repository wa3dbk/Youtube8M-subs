00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.979
 there are studies made the leader the best thing to do is monitoring 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.850
 on the fruit fly in sales but we are here in an orchard 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:15.979
 two-stage wrapping in an orchard in full bloom 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.099
 another one the beginning begins to make bloom half 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:22.480
 the best way 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.480
 up and removal of plants 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.590
 and the most usual is the use and traps 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.590
 monitoring system consisting of 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.560
 the adults 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.380
 is that of the fruit fly 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.640
 here we have an event in a chair manufacturing trap that consists 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.800
 in a neal bottle in this case 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.070
 where is it done? 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.500
 at the time of the protest would have of the bottle wi-fi their 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.640
 asymmetric way 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.690
 these two floors about one centimeter in diameter 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.110
 inside the bottle is to put a juice to attract the flies that juice 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.130
 It consists 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.690
 too much fruit juice with sugar 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.829
 sugary or else it has already developed in the beginning 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.970
 the intended and helping team is an attractive 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.090
 very efficient 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 one can suppose of diverse types of fruits 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 being that in the item 7 thousand eggs are very efficient 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 the time to put the traps in the orchard 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.140
 depends on the type of support from the concessionaires in the peach orchard 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 it is in the period of closing of the fruit that the fly 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.140
 eggs are deposited 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.330
 thirty days prior to the product closure period, we must 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.770
 put the traps of the field in palmares of up to two hectares 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.850
 it is recommended to use four precarious traps 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.990
 palmares t2 so kate areas the number of pitfalls recommended asks 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.290
 two traps per hectare 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.820
 Another important point is the location of the trap installation. 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.220
 which must be placed 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.620
 on a branch 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.660
 the actress esther quito 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.080
 to avoid balconies convent 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.960
 the height of 1050 to 80 of the soil 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.070
 but less inside the tree canopy after the installation of the traps and 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.529
 if you do the count of the flies 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.369
 who were caught in this trap 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.170
 the liquid should be poured over a sieve 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.719
 with the pain the thin piece of cloth 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.150
 It is important to note that making a record of these quantities and 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:34.459
 collection to know the situation of palmar the producer will check here 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:40.430
 there are types in certain different types of flies and the fruit fly beyond 20 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:44.299
 each by a drop a special feature that the coloring has a 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:45.749
 radio design 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:50.719
 well and viewers of the terrace this forum some tips that we pass on 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:53.719
 to peach producers for more information 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:56.959
 to contact 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.099
 on the phone 2 7 5 8
