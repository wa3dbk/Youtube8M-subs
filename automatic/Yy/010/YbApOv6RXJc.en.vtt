00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.260
 words and others like this I have done and 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.750
 today I bring you a guide 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 graphic of our gentleman of the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:26.009
 seas that nothing more and nothing less than you 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 that is in the melee is a 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:31.050
 excellent since thanks to his skill 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 passive can keep the enemies 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.580
 back is why today 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.949
 let's talk more about your 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.320
 skills and how to burn our 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:42.040
 he pointed 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.040
 and so 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.670
 now show the elusive 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.269
 Friday our r 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 The first is that it is torrent and invokes a 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.879
 ascending torrent that after a brief 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.050
 delay threw the enemy units to the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.050
 air to running telling them harm and 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.050
 profitable 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.920
 fair 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.400
 so it smells 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 and let's go 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.460
 the next one is that is the splash the 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.400
 legendary sword and never gives him damage 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.320
 additionally come a large area 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.320
 in front of him as only 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.890
 the third skill is the demarcation x 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.340
 our with can marks the position of a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.930
 Allied or enemy hero with an X and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.690
 he returns this place after 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.730
 seconds our hero can activate the 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.040
 return at any time of its 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.090
 duration is why effective the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.090
 return option 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.040
 bye 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.040
 field 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.800
 the last shearing mention is the boat 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.500
 ghost summons a ghost ship to 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.090
 fight your way through the battle 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.270
 causing damage and absorbing the 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.520
 enemy solutions to which javier los 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.560
 wise men are sprinkled with the kun rum 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.630
 is getting movement speed 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.630
 additional and a reaction 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.700
 as usual 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.670
 next we will explain how 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.680
 we must study our points on 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.859
 first point we will give it to the planes 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.170
 this is the water picon is the skill that 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:59.579
 we should give it more priority since we 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.030
 will allow in an effective way 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:05.770
 keep the enemy behind the second 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.830
 point we will give it to the torrent 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.560
 It would be good to leave this skill at one point 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.770
 or if it's convenient on Sunday since it 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.380
 we would also enter the third skill 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.310
 It is very useful to avoid painting for the 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:24.720
 enemy without forgetting that having 6 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.720
 we must expropriate others 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.280
 now we will see how we are going to arm 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.980
 our knight of the seas like 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.099
 first phase we knew with four goals 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.670
 a force glove all his three 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.040
 twigs 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.560
 and online we would buy our boots 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.660
 that would be on the face to be able to have a 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.550
 greater damage with respect to our 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.250
 second skin 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.140
 then we will try to complete our 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.510
 urn to be able to have a little more 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.520
 mana regeneration and be able to heal 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.520
 with the charges that we have 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.220
 as a second phase and this criterion of 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.500
 you can take out the crystal is or the 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.690
 dark leaf personally I would opt 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.080
 for the latter since we could win 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.210
 the enemy in a surprise after 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.770
 earn a little more gold we could 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.770
 complete our of the year 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.509
 newell's 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.750
 as a third phase I'm going to build on a 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.419
 mobile that generates tremendous damage that is 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.970
 go for two fingers since this one gives you the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.790
 probability of generating critical in a 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.880
 higher percentage apart from the damage that you 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:54.210
 gives the same we would complete to increase 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.010
 more the damage a low fiber like the 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.280
 scam and we could get you a cure 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:02.070
 tip assault scratches a baby if it's that 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.139
 we have enemies enable me 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:08.419
 I opt for items that generate me 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.419
 that's why I'm going to choose the mobile 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.019
 and it's me 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:16.599
 good but remember to wait for the child 

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:18.819
 can be very very annoying and that in the 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:22.089
 game can generate a lot very much 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.769
 damage then I will leave you with a 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:26.860
 collection of plays that I have made 

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:28.659
 with this hero and do not forget that at 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.309
 finalize the video is the section 

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.309
 question of the week 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:22.490
 i 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.130
 two 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:31.110
 good doctor if I wait for you 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:33.690
 have liked this basic guide of our 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:36.480
 gentleman of the seas and I leave you with the 

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:40.070
 question of the week because I no longer 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:40.070
 you play one 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.550
 and 

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:14.279
 x
