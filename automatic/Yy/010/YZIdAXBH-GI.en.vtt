00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.740
 hello everyone with you international 2013 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.900
 Starladdera in collaboration with us 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.199
 Forum and of course Balak Corporation 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.339
 will now conduct a small round in place 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.210
 events where the group stage 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:33.200
 international from number three went like you 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.260
 see here some cars so in 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.390
 principle yes brother in general is a quiet city here 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.540
 I can immediately say the machines in general 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.380
 bit is not loaded 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.380
 when was the first day roughly speaking 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.450
 group stage when played not even not 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.820
 the first day when quantity was played against 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.920
 rattlesnake of us then led to dinner 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.620
 and we are just the whole delegation 80 people 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.000
 people probably walked along these roads there 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.239
 go nuts from this city 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.239
 here is the hotel lobby 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.109
 here some players rest and there for 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.159
 an escalator on the third floor already 

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:18.159
 dota begins 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.790
 quietly slowly climbs on 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:34.510
 the second floor can already be seen 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 proper international sign 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.330
 the third floor is the action itself and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.720
 Of course, conference rooms where 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:47.410
 dota play our players not only ours 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.520
 they are called hero names to 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.399
 it was easier to remember 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.940
 not to say we go to some kind of there 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:58.090
 lake 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:00.610
 and we go to the warlock room and that's it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.899
 a variety of events also occur 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:10.020
 type bar mitzvah yesterday was some kind of 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:10.020
 we are not interested we are interested dota 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.790
 it cost us to go up to the third floor 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.819
 and we immediately see 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.370
 staff players becoming ramparts which 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.469
 organize this wonderful tournament 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.859
 and if we go a little bit further 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:36.329
 enter this room we will see 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:40.700
 players players international games hung 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.700
 Emotions are all you want 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.730
 so now let's go a little to our 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.730
 guys look at 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.940
 from 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.650
 and here now sit virtus.pro which 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.420
 just finished playing against 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.900
 invictus gaming last year's champions 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.900
 insulator 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.110
 this is our personal table here we are all 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:23.590
 We are going to all our Russian-speaking 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.590
 the team and take care of course 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:34.720
 we can show raised these drive where 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:34.720
 people help us master this whole thing 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.270
 give the necessary information and help 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.550
 guys and move in and stuff like that 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.680
 other 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.050
 the last thing is probably not the most 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:51.650
 the main thing of a new place where to rest all 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.800
 players and not only players but also becoming 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.959
 and all the people we show you the rooms 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:04.790
 who provided us 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:14.540
 Shaft U and West End Bel View Hotel 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:16.760
 like a card thanks to which 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.970
 we will be able to climb the floor we need 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:24.950
 by the way from a certain time she 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:28.150
 it works only on that floor where 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.150
 your room 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:38.389
 the elevator goes very fast so the first 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.280
 day many dizzy after 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.910
 this elevator and now ride it 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.130
 because literally in five seconds we 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.070
 drive eight floors it's damn 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.350
 a lot I hope that in my 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.669
 the room is cleaned 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.669
 if not cleaned it will be bad 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.860
 here we are my point comor 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.180
 I live here 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:16.670
 one no not removed why not removed in 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:22.370
 last time we played well 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:24.920
 basically here is convenient and comfortable 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.120
 the main thing is quiet and calm and especially 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:32.540
 sleep well what these open like them a 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.540
