him hit turn his sirens on you'll see
immediately<00:03:42.799> that<00:03:42.859> his<00:03:43.099> blip<00:03:43.370> changes

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
immediately that his blip changes

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.600 
immediately that his blip changes
I'm<00:03:45.230> not<00:03:45.440> going<00:03:45.560> to<00:03:45.620> test<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.980> distance<00:03:46.340> of<00:03:46.490> it

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
I'm not going to test the distance of it

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.430 
I'm not going to test the distance of it
all<00:03:46.850> because<00:03:47.450> that's<00:03:48.020> just<00:03:48.110> going<00:03:48.260> to<00:03:48.350> take

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
all because that's just going to take

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.040 
all because that's just going to take
too<00:03:48.560> long<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:50.000> i'm<00:03:50.120> going<00:03:50.300> to<00:03:50.390> show<00:03:50.510> you<00:03:50.540> that

right<00:03:56.210> now<00:03:56.300> I'm<00:03:56.450> rendering<00:03:56.660> one<00:03:56.990> video<00:03:57.290> while

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
right now I'm rendering one video while

making another let's go ahead and I mean
that's<00:04:03.110> pretty<00:04:03.410> much<00:04:03.530> it<00:04:03.590> in<00:04:03.860> terms<00:04:04.250> of<00:04:04.460> the

that's pretty much it in terms of the

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.610 
that's pretty much it in terms of the
blips<00:04:04.790> there's<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.660> son<00:04:05.930> so<00:04:06.260> many<00:04:06.440> conditions

leaving<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.280> this<00:04:10.790> script<00:04:11.060> open<00:04:11.390> source<00:04:11.630> all

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
leaving the this script open source all

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.270 
leaving the this script open source all
my<00:04:12.320> scripts<00:04:12.560> are<00:04:12.650> open<00:04:12.860> source<00:04:13.070> but<00:04:13.220> I'm

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
my scripts are open source but I'm

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.070 
my scripts are open source but I'm
actually<00:04:13.459> leaving<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.209> source<00:04:14.450> file<00:04:14.660> with<00:04:14.930> it

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
actually leaving the source file with it

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.870 
actually leaving the source file with it
so<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.620> could<00:04:15.770> just<00:04:15.920> open<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.250> up<00:04:16.370> in<00:04:16.519> a

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
so you could just open it up in a

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.080 
so you could just open it up in a
notepad<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.570> just<00:04:17.750> edit<00:04:17.959> it<00:04:18.049> as<00:04:18.200> you<00:04:18.380> wish

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
notepad and just edit it as you wish

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.370 
notepad and just edit it as you wish
this<00:04:20.090> way<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:20.299> can<00:04:20.419> edit<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:20.989> conditions

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
this way you can edit the conditions

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.050 
this way you can edit the conditions
because<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:21.769> did<00:04:21.919> not<00:04:21.950> include<00:04:22.280> an<00:04:22.490> ini<00:04:22.820> file

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
because I did not include an ini file

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.580 
because I did not include an ini file
that<00:04:23.660> would<00:04:23.900> list<00:04:24.169> all<00:04:24.320> the<00:04:24.380> conditions

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
that would list all the conditions

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.770 
that would list all the conditions
they're<00:04:25.520> not<00:04:25.640> interchangeable<00:04:26.180> through

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
they're not interchangeable through

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
they're not interchangeable through
settings<00:04:27.350> file<00:04:27.560> basically<00:04:27.980> so<00:04:28.400> you'd<00:04:28.550> have<00:04:28.669> to

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
settings file basically so you'd have to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.070 
settings file basically so you'd have to
actually<00:04:28.850> look<00:04:29.120> in<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.360> code<00:04:29.510> understand<00:04:29.990> a

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
actually look in the code understand a

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.450 
actually look in the code understand a
little<00:04:30.200> bit<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.470> code<00:04:30.620> it's<00:04:31.100> pretty<00:04:31.310> easy

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
little bit of code it's pretty easy

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.909 
little bit of code it's pretty easy
stuff<00:04:31.640> its<00:04:32.000> high-level<00:04:32.210> coding<00:04:32.810> so<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.770> just

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
stuff its high-level coding so you just

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.200 
stuff its high-level coding so you just
have<00:04:34.040> to<00:04:34.160> get<00:04:34.280> to<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.520> parts<00:04:34.820> where<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.030> shows

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
have to get to the parts where it shows

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.930 
have to get to the parts where it shows
the<00:04:35.419> conditions<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.110> I<00:04:36.430> put<00:04:37.430> some<00:04:37.550> comments

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
the conditions and I put some comments

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.510 
the conditions and I put some comments
in<00:04:38.000> there<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.300> help<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.900> list<00:04:39.110> it<00:04:39.260> the<00:04:40.250> script

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
in there to help to list it the script

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.510 
in there to help to list it the script
itself<00:04:40.640> isn't<00:04:41.120> really<00:04:41.660> well<00:04:42.169> created<00:04:42.590> it<00:04:43.400> was

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
itself isn't really well created it was

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.060 
itself isn't really well created it was
one<00:04:43.640> of<00:04:43.700> my<00:04:43.760> first<00:04:43.910> scripts<00:04:44.240> so<00:04:44.860> just<00:04:45.860> kind<00:04:46.040> of

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
one of my first scripts so just kind of

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.040 
one of my first scripts so just kind of
when<00:04:46.190> I<00:04:46.220> was<00:04:46.340> learning<00:04:46.490> GTA<00:04:47.180> modding<00:04:47.450> but<00:04:47.600> it

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
when I was learning GTA modding but it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.469 
when I was learning GTA modding but it
runs<00:04:48.200> really<00:04:48.380> well<00:04:48.500> runs<00:04:49.160> multiplayer<00:04:49.700> there

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
runs really well runs multiplayer there

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.060 
runs really well runs multiplayer there
are<00:04:50.600> some<00:04:50.750> known<00:04:50.930> issues<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.500> I'll<00:04:51.590> list

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
are some known issues that I'll list

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.659 
are some known issues that I'll list
some<00:04:52.940> other<00:04:53.690> little<00:04:53.810> fun<00:04:54.110> stuff<00:04:54.490> from<00:04:55.490> my
