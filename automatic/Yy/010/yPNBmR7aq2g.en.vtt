00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:17.230

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:24.990
 Well known for making cars 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:30.710
 Well, from Seth's process, with Seth 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.710
 I am allowed to have special permission, and I will call it "Hachidani " 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.610

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.510
 It is 8 after the code of the hotel of Seth's color and bioblory arrives to the next play animation 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.719
 If it becomes a reference even if you play video 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.770
 I thought, but I will be at hand until 8 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:53.280
 I would like to introduce you there 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.570
 Movement in round one is only super horse 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.340
 2000 fighting area people 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:05.060
 Out and it will earn this hero Energy five 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.060
 And lays supermarket 2 at the start of the low 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:17.680
 Fart yourself by this it will activate abilities that Well use became one force 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:20.180
 I was the gym team's fighting ability, my own part guard total myself 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.110
 And up 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.110
 In other words- 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.550
 In round 2 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.510
 In place of the 32 only combat force-ray area 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.500
 dust 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.500
 I think it's good 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.890
 Well with these two bodies 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.890
 Well save six more after the other 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.380
 I think I will eat four more 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.090
 Yes yes 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.920
 If not accumulate Well in this Well yourself to because there is never used anymore most today is this 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.630
 And hero energy 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.630
 Is respect for the 8 bit so much 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.590
 There is only this I guess I have to eat 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.530
 Well doing this in Well bio bath Lee 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.960
 Passing out to the $ 1000 civil election area 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.760
 Is good 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:20.470
 In Hero Energy is 10 required for the devil unit of this legend 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.290
 It will collect and the old age skill is right 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.720
 Rob parts a 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:31.990
 35% energy recovery in Lands 2 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.990
 I think that it is good that the imperial part of the universe 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.670
 And 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.930
 Activate with Uny to activate the enemy 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.760
 When sentence between the here of the combat force by the ricochet 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.300
 I mean 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.300
 To 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.300
 The following is not 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.540
 In such Fu 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.130
 Please put out this fighting power is 20,000 but you can always take precedence 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.440
 In this 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:12.240
 Oh well this is a round 3 move and Broly has a card action 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.450
 It becomes kind of place from 3 to legend carried by 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.450
 Yes 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.410
 Well , I think that it is good to record it in the same way as Brody and Super Block in the same way. 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.920
 I will 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.920
 I think Bronny's Roko doesn't have to be used separately, though 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:36.970
 It is interesting to put out well just froze in a round-how and final round 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.440
 Well this 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.160
 When only someone will be 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.160
 that's interesting 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:50.520
 Allowed to purchase from another interesting is Rourke kun It is this tournament professional bio bath Lee 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.920
 I received it 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:56.520
 Well if the team's good is pudding or less than 30% the meeting record is fully restored and it's fighting power 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.210
 But 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.099
 a 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.720
 I wonder if it doubles 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:09.910
 In the burst hold up to 500 minutes of damage to 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.910
 Because it was 500, damage will rise in the burst 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.530
 Well that's something like that 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:26.590
 Well, as I said earlier , I'm not used to this yet because I am 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.590
 I think there is an explanation error 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:34.830
 It 's an introduction I ca n't get used to . 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:39.900

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:52.790
 When fighting with Mecha Freezer Medal Cooler 8 says that the investment explosion is not used 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:56.550
 Gave me air advice 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:05:01.460

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.960

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:17.409
 This one of the previous pile quiz format is kinda 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:19.139
 It was pretty weird, just a few guys and only one person included 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:24.080

 It is such a feeling Well super branch Somewhat wide g 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.169
 I wonder if it exists 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.320
 Well when I went next time with this work 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:44.550
