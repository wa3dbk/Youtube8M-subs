00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.890
 little bit stormy row love 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.260
 I realize today I have one 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.370
 wonderful guest with me the love 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.940
 Nicole and today are on the occasion book 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.320
 stunts a wonderful job making a 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.119
 dough and then show what you still have 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 can make one from the dough on 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.240
 nicoles can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.609
 Now let's prepare the dough for now 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:35.750
 and for that you even need the following 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:37.980
 yeast salt milk eggs and butter 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.020
 We put the flour in the bowl 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.500
 make a trough there was the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.930
 milk in with the yeast and the sugar 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.879
 then we leave the salt and the whole 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.129
 15 minutes 15 minutes then we give the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:01.050
 add butter and eggs and knead 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:05.489
 then a dough a bit pure 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.590
 and then just about it when we're there 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.869
 Covered and must after threats 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.710
 in the fridge and at noon could 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.710
 processed 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.240
 the oven at 40 degrees in front of me and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.430
 my reached the temperature reached 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.840
 but put the key in it 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.909
 the oven and then it is right there 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 nice and warm has the ideal temperature 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.619
 So why should not heat permanently 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.960
 but just with a certain 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.829
 have room temperature and then the long 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.030
 be in us 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.860
 then we can do such an hour 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.570
 what a half hour hour 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 it just works a bit faster 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.530
 as this is a bit faster 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
 a whole closer 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.530
 we'll see what Gastwirt at 1 it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.530
 sounds promising 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.140
 3 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.240
 the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.690
 the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.610
 okay but really before 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.269
 as the handlebar it very very very juicy 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.469
 crumbles in the mouth is really very soft 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.939
 I still have a little bit left 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:04.640
 this is my personal taste 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:08.810
 We insist a little more sugar 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.799
 bauer with jam and butter it is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.879
 give very tasty 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.010
 I am enthusiastic about the result 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.870
 thank you for buying the help without the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.629
 we could not have done it alone 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.159
 Note for you it was a bit too 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.519
 it smells good that means they had to come with you 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.879
 little more mail help out and not sweet 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.000
 enough 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.739
 We would like to 100-150 grams 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.230
 sugar for me, who will it already 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.870
 So sweet at least 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.750
 200 grams to take over we still have 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.250
 something sweet and magic 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.870
