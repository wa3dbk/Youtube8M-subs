00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.039 
you have it I think this is definitely
older<00:03:47.769> model<00:03:48.519> because<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.330> got<00:03:49.480> fire<00:03:49.780> wire

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
older model because it's got fire wire

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.940 
older model because it's got fire wire
instead<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.040> e-sata<00:03:51.489> which<00:03:52.030> is<00:03:52.180> anyone<00:03:52.480> has

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
instead of e-sata which is anyone has

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.900 
instead of e-sata which is anyone has
but<00:03:53.950> it<00:03:54.070> might<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:54.190> upgraded<00:03:54.700> with<00:03:54.760> the

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
but it might be upgraded with the

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.620 
but it might be upgraded with the
extreme<00:03:55.360> software<00:03:56.049> so<00:03:56.260> often<00:03:56.650> to<00:03:56.950> see<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:58.390> not

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
extreme software so often to see if not

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.060 
extreme software so often to see if not
then<00:03:58.870> we<00:03:58.989> don't<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.350> extreme<00:03:59.680> can't<00:04:00.010> do

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
then we don't have the extreme can't do

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:04.350 
then we don't have the extreme can't do
explosions<00:04:02.670> okay<00:04:03.670> we<00:04:03.760> do<00:04:03.880> explosion<00:04:04.150> from
