00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.710
 last year did a garage but by car 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.450
 I can't go there because 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.750
 no zero floor 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.929
 here as soon as I was freed now became 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.350
 to do to me here in the garage 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.350
 make the floor that's what I ran into 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.710
 when I began to dig and the ground level was and 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.890
 he will now show the ground level here 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.920
 was and now digging the ground and throwing away 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.530
 up and this is the slope of the earth 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.739
 all rolls and everything I had to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.840
 set this one here is a shield for one 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 cheat one way and the other side and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 do the disassembly and then I threw away 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 this land and trampled that is he demanded 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.579
 very well you can see right here this one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:55.590
 layer and here is the same way 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.190
 I placed this whole land in the garage not 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.160
 enduring and 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.530
 this land is in the street like this 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.239
 happened 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.150
 configuration now i will fill 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.500
 concrete is such a platform that's me and 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:13.920
 then there will be such sideways 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.930
 laying on the mortar further 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.330
 I will have sand but here around 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:23.520
 the perimeter I spilled sand that is 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.560
 here I have is if the sand 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.950
 dig sand there sand sand sand 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.680
 sand sand i made for what if 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.810
 winter time this land will still be warm 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.610
 and the concrete on the other side will freeze 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.160
 there will appear a type of times and whether 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.740
 and this moisture will go away style for this 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.090
 sand and if some moisture spring 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.320
 trial period 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.610
 it will pass because it is just sand 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.150
 will not rise but will leave 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:56.400
 it's moisture and flow here with me 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.790
 naturally concrete but then i'm all 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:04.160
 tell show how i will do this 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.130
 viewing pit and what will be mine 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.260
 mark the zero floor of what this floor 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.990
 will I myself do not even know or concrete or 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.209
 at the board I will do but pour the mark 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.930
 I will be here so that the level of 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 a car drove me in peacefully 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.450
 how do I do not even very interesting 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.739
 I would like it all done 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.350
 a concrete mixer that's installed here 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.650
 in this way in the middle here now 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.650
 will show 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.830
 that's how I set it here here to 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.890
 I will walk like this and will water 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:45.050
 pour into this concrete mixer ready 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.600
 ready-mixed concrete will be poured into one 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.290
 then turn the side I will merge into 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.000
 the other side and like that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.790
 would be such an interesting design 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.610
 It turned out here already finished 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:06.050
 proportion do sand and gravel cement 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:11.560
 I've already seen everything in doses by 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:14.480
 the volume made here is the cart worth 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.489
 I brought this tiller and I will 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.430
 unload here this perimeter 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.440
 making a small angle out of the blocks so as not to 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.209
 spilled out but I have not yet poured out the first 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.000
 once on the cart I will pour out interesting 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:30.920
 as a special water is brought from the side from 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 yourself from the pond to this barrel pouring 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.180
 because the water is far away 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.590
 and to not pull the hoses are not here and 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.220
 I decided to collect the barrel 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.530
 bring water in this 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.110
 look how the water brought it will be 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.280
 merge well try merge you show 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.460
 how do i drain the water 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.970
 of course you have to lift nowhere 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.970
 not going anywhere 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.920
 also in the cart I took I want empty 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.920
 ride and merging in this way 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.750
 Kind of like everything dad is done now 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:18.000
 how are the earrings gonna drop 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.280
 that's interesting i don't even know how it is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.110
 get the first time lublin watch 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.110
 God did not close the tap 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.230
 but 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.210
 rises easily because everything goes according to 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.210
 axes 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.710
 Well, that's all 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.730
 I will try not to raise something 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.160
 need here on dimensions most likely yes 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:58.660
 dimensions will this cart then be 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.660
 abut it turns out 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.240
 This kind of reset is obtained 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.449
 well still not so good again 

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:19.189
 I will bring a bunch here 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:22.749
 huge work don't stop well 

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:22.749
 OK, bye
