00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.700
 Calving in cattle can be 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.840
 divide the phase into five phases 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:24.380
 preparatory course lasts two to three weeks 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:27.769
 the beginning of the work will last 6 to 16 hours 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:31.340
 the dilation phase still lasts one to 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.610
 three hours the expulsion phase does 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.980
 lasts only three to fifteen minutes and 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.129
 finally the phase after calving last 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:45.019
 6 to 12 hours at the beginning of the phase of 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.360
 dilation the cows isolate themselves 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.980
 naturally from the rest of the flock while 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.949
 keeping eye contact 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.839
 that's why a calving box with a view 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:58.729
 on the flock is ideally normally the 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:01.159
 cow remains lying during calving 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.659
 however, it needs room for 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.780
 able to change position and 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.270
 to settle at your ease the pocket of waters 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.880
 appears and expands the pelvic pathway 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.340
 namely the neck of the womb the vagina 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.520
 and the vulva to prepare the passage of the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.650
 calf this process is very important and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.329
 request time 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.189
 allowing time for 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.130
 the cow helps prevent calving 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.630
 difficult and injuries 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.829
 that's why you must never pierced 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.829
 the water pocket manually 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.860
 if the calf remain covered by the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:41.070
 envelopes total it will slide better and 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:42.600
 lubricates the pelvic die when the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 calf is sufficiently engaged in the 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 pelvic sector the water pocket 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.650
 and will appear in nails 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.180
 interior presentation one to two 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.140
 hours can easily flow 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.910
 until the head is visible in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.550
 heifers it can even flow 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.780
 up to six hours during this phase he 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.369
 worth to show 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.690
 patience 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.490
 as long as the calf is connected to 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.560
 the sea by the umbilical cord 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.720
 it is sufficiently stocked 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.830
 think about the breaks between them 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.830
 contractions are normal 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.110
 strong abdominal contractions make 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.110
 part of this phase and its maximum 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.880
 in the animal bed it allows the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.020
 fetus to position themselves properly 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.020
 in the basin 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.260
 contractions are triggered by the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.790
 pressure that the calf's head exerts on 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.650
 the vaginal ceiling when the vo comes 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.390
 to the world in previous presentations we 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.269
 first sees the nails have paws 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.920
 before stretched and lay on the wall of the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:48.690
 calf by changing its position during 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.209
 this phase the influence cow 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.440
 the orientation of the calf in his pelvis 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.440
 who is advancing the calving 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.290
 the expulsion phase only lasts 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.090
 a few minutes 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.040
 it starts as soon as the head of you 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.240
 pass the vagina and lasts until 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.400
 the whole calf was born without 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.470
 intervention the umbilical cord does 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.680
 will be with right after the passage 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.120
 the rear end of the calf 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.450
 it is only then that the 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.600
 Vaud can breathe alone 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.600
 [Music] 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.760
 by licking the calf with his tongue rech 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.519
 the cow stimulates the breathing and the 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.290
 circulation of the newborn but also the 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.629
 production of oxytocin in cows 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:50.940
 itself that triggers the expulsion of the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:52.920
 placenta and the descent of milk after 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.180
 calving the cow willingly drinks one to 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.579
 two cans of warm water 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.980
 this helps quench his thirst after 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.750
 the effort and expand the rumen what 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:08.190
 will have a positive influence on his 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:09.989
 consumption at the beginning of lactation for 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.370
 the immune system of the calf it is 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.379
 very important that they drink at least 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.769
 two liters of colostrum during both 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:20.090
 hours after his birth he is worth 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.090
 worth checking this point 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.819
 during the following 6 to 8 hours 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.180
 calving the rest of the amniotic fluid and 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:37.749
 the backs are expelled 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.749
