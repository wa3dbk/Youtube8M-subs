he's<00:00:10.900> and<00:00:11.900> they<00:00:12.080> fit<00:00:12.259> together<00:00:12.349> life<00:00:12.740> so<00:00:15.550> after

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 
he's and they fit together life so after

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.769 
he's and they fit together life so after
the<00:00:16.670> machines<00:00:17.529> that<00:00:18.529> one<00:00:18.710> goes<00:00:18.950> there<00:00:19.779> this

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
the machines that one goes there this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.380 
the machines that one goes there this
one<00:00:21.050> goes<00:00:21.259> here<00:00:21.289> like<00:00:23.410> that<00:00:24.410> and<00:00:25.029> the<00:00:26.029> same<00:00:26.210> on

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
one goes here like that and the same on

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.290 
one goes here like that and the same on
the<00:00:26.509> scenes<00:00:28.779> so<00:00:29.779> when<00:00:29.930> we<00:00:30.050> sit<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:30.349> out<00:00:31.000> we<00:00:32.000> have

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
the scenes so when we sit it out we have

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.790 
the scenes so when we sit it out we have
a<00:00:32.689> face<00:00:33.559> mark<00:00:33.829> on<00:00:34.370> each<00:00:34.579> piece<00:00:35.290> these<00:00:36.290> are<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
a face mark on each piece these are the

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.049 
a face mark on each piece these are the
these<00:00:37.670> pieces<00:00:38.260> for<00:00:39.260> the<00:00:39.410> front<00:00:39.649> and<00:00:39.800> back

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
these pieces for the front and back

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.660 
these pieces for the front and back
which<00:00:41.059> means<00:00:41.960> up<00:00:42.200> pretty<00:00:42.620> much<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.890> same<00:00:43.250> and

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
which means up pretty much the same and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.060 
which means up pretty much the same and
the<00:00:44.510> long<00:00:44.690> pieces<00:00:45.020> in<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.410> case<00:00:45.650> are<00:00:45.920> they

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
the long pieces in this case are they

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.970 
the long pieces in this case are they
draw<00:00:46.790> size<00:00:47.620> so<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:49.579> machine<00:00:49.970> it<00:00:50.680> these<00:00:51.680> people

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
draw size so to machine it these people

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.920 
draw size so to machine it these people
these<00:00:52.579> pieces<00:00:53.050> end<00:00:54.050> up<00:00:54.290> upside<00:00:55.160> down<00:00:55.750> and<00:00:56.750> this

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
these pieces end up upside down and this

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.950 
these pieces end up upside down and this
piece<00:00:57.200> goes<00:00:57.470> in<00:00:57.500> front<00:00:57.890> of<00:00:58.040> it<00:00:58.160> like<00:00:58.340> that<00:00:58.960> so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
piece goes in front of it like that so

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.830 
piece goes in front of it like that so
we'll<00:01:00.170> go<00:01:00.350> to<00:01:00.380> the<00:01:00.590> machine<00:01:01.149> and<00:01:02.149> show<00:01:02.660> how

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
we'll go to the machine and show how

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.620 
we'll go to the machine and show how
that<00:01:02.899> fits<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.470> guy's<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:03.860> machine<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:05.119> piece

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
that fits a guy's a machine this piece

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.999 
that fits a guy's a machine this piece
here<00:01:05.840> that<00:01:07.960> lines<00:01:08.960> up<00:01:09.170> with<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.439> straight<00:01:09.829> edge

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
here that lines up with a straight edge

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.760 
here that lines up with a straight edge
with<00:01:10.040> a<00:01:10.369> little<00:01:10.729> stop<00:01:11.119> here<00:01:11.360> normally<00:01:11.780> but

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
with a little stop here normally but

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.490 
with a little stop here normally but
will<00:01:13.040> them<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:14.750> then<00:01:16.180> this<00:01:17.180> piece<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:18.049> goes<00:01:18.290> in

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
will them and then this piece it goes in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.020 
will them and then this piece it goes in
with<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.799> face<00:01:18.950> side<00:01:19.220> towards<00:01:19.670> always

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
with the face side towards always

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.430 
with the face side towards always
towards<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.420> middle<00:01:20.659> if<00:01:20.750> it's<00:01:20.900> on<00:01:21.020> that<00:01:21.170> side

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
towards the middle if it's on that side

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.789 
towards the middle if it's on that side
face<00:01:22.310> mark<00:01:22.610> comes<00:01:22.880> this<00:01:23.060> way<00:01:23.350> the<00:01:24.350> right<00:01:24.530> side

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
face mark comes this way the right side

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.000 
face mark comes this way the right side
goes<00:01:25.100> with<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.490> face<00:01:25.670> making<00:01:26.180> deadlines<00:01:27.010> and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
goes with the face making deadlines and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.500 
goes with the face making deadlines and
the<00:01:28.130> face<00:01:28.310> mark<00:01:28.610> goes<00:01:28.820> on<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.150> underneath

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
the face mark goes on the underneath

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.180 
the face mark goes on the underneath
part<00:01:30.190> just<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.280> same<00:01:32.049> it<00:01:33.049> goes<00:01:33.409> face<00:01:33.890> side

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
part just the same it goes face side

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.490 
part just the same it goes face side
goes<00:01:34.460> down<00:01:34.490> and<00:01:35.150> underneath<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.750> there<00:01:35.960> and

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
goes down and underneath in there and

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.149 
goes down and underneath in there and
gets<00:01:36.740> clamped<00:01:37.010> in<00:01:37.250> there

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.760 

okay<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.610> face<00:01:42.820> mark<00:01:43.090> goes<00:01:43.420> downwards<00:01:43.990> but

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
okay the face mark goes downwards but

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.190 
okay the face mark goes downwards but
towards<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.370> center<00:01:45.790> of<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:45.880> machine<00:01:46.330> you

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
towards the center of the machine you

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.899 
towards the center of the machine you
press<00:01:47.440> it<00:01:47.590> in<00:01:47.710> until<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:48.070> just<00:01:48.250> touches<00:01:48.400> on

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
press it in until it just touches on

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.100 
press it in until it just touches on
this<00:01:49.090> but<00:01:49.810> underneath<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.890> you<00:01:51.070> feel<00:01:51.340> it<00:01:52.110> feel

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
this but underneath and you feel it feel

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.780 
this but underneath and you feel it feel
it<00:01:53.140> come<00:01:53.500> in<00:01:53.650> against<00:01:53.979> there's<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.280> stop<00:01:54.580> on

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
it come in against there's a stop on

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.210 
it come in against there's a stop on
this<00:01:54.970> side<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.259> it<00:01:56.320> needs<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.680> come<00:01:56.860> against

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
this side so it needs to come against

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.550 
this side so it needs to come against
the<00:01:57.310> stop<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.910> be<00:01:58.210> nice<00:01:58.360> and<00:01:58.600> straight<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
the stop and be nice and straight and

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.249 
the stop and be nice and straight and
then<00:01:59.800> you<00:01:59.920> tighten<00:02:00.130> these<00:02:00.430> two<00:02:00.990> screws<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.200> the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
then you tighten these two screws on the

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.300 
then you tighten these two screws on the
top<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.770> clamp<00:02:03.130> them<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.580> top<00:02:05.159> so<00:02:06.159> that's

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
top and clamp them on the top so that's

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.840 
top and clamp them on the top so that's
clamped<00:02:06.850> down<00:02:06.909> nice<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.509> firm<00:02:07.750> like<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:09.489> the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
clamped down nice and firm like that the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.250 
clamped down nice and firm like that the
cutter<00:02:10.739> there's<00:02:11.739> a<00:02:11.830> little<00:02:12.070> guide<00:02:12.310> on<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.730> here

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
cutter there's a little guide on it here

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.020 
cutter there's a little guide on it here
which<00:02:14.260> runs<00:02:14.560> against<00:02:14.980> these<00:02:15.190> pieces<00:02:15.730> here

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
which runs against these pieces here

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.699 
which runs against these pieces here
those<00:02:16.330> are<00:02:16.360> called<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> comb<00:02:17.170> because<00:02:17.530> it

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
those are called the comb because it

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.960 
those are called the comb because it
looks<00:02:17.890> a<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.040> like<00:02:18.160> it<00:02:18.370> okay<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
looks a bit like it okay and so that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:29.620 
looks a bit like it okay and so that
copies<00:02:22.360> around<00:02:22.540> on<00:02:23.050> those

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:04:32.530 

much<00:02:29.930> like<00:02:30.230> touch

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.570 

so<00:04:33.110> it's<00:04:33.260> important<00:04:33.740> that<00:04:33.830> the<00:04:34.070> pins<00:04:34.340> are<00:04:34.520> all

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
so it's important that the pins are all

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.300 
so it's important that the pins are all
on<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.910> same<00:04:35.090> side<00:04:35.450> that<00:04:35.900> the<00:04:36.740> pins<00:04:37.010> are<00:04:37.220> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
on the same side that the pins are the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.300 
on the same side that the pins are the
pieces<00:04:37.520> that<00:04:37.700> stick<00:04:38.150> out<00:04:38.290> basically<00:04:42.130> so<00:04:43.130> these

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
pieces that stick out basically so these

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.950

up so now I can take it out of
there<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:07.270> little<00:05:08.270> bit<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:09.680> comes<00:05:09.920> out<00:05:10.220> of<00:05:10.250> the

there a little bit that comes out of the
let's<00:05:12.170> go<00:05:12.410> can<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:12.980> go<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.220> fit<00:05:13.460> up<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.760> here

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
let's go can you go to fit up in here

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:20.620 
let's go can you go to fit up in here
like<00:05:14.120> that<00:05:18.730> well<00:05:19.730> they<00:05:19.850> get<00:05:20.000> glue<00:05:20.240> together

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
like that well they get glue together

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:27.360 
like that well they get glue together
later<00:05:20.870> on

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:52.629 

did<00:05:28.370> you<00:05:28.520> go<00:05:28.700> on<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.820> cutoff

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:56.990 

so<00:05:53.639> we're<00:05:53.789> ready<00:05:53.909> to<00:05:55.189> to<00:05:56.189> fit<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.580> end<00:05:56.729> of<00:05:56.909> the

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
so we're ready to to fit the end of the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.249 
so we're ready to to fit the end of the
drawn<00:05:57.740> fits<00:05:58.740> on<00:05:58.979> there<00:05:59.159> like<00:05:59.370> that<00:05:59.990> one<00:06:00.990> on<00:06:01.110> the

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
drawn fits on there like that one on the

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.499 
drawn fits on there like that one on the
opposite<00:06:01.560> end<00:06:01.770> face<00:06:02.729> marks<00:06:03.150> go<00:06:03.360> together

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
opposite end face marks go together

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:09.649 
opposite end face marks go together
again<00:06:05.030> it<00:06:06.030> just<00:06:06.090> slips<00:06:06.599> on<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.840> ni<00:06:07.110> 10<00:06:07.379> and<00:06:08.659> the

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:09.659 
again it just slips on the ni 10 and the

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:14.149 
again it just slips on the ni 10 and the
draw<00:06:09.870> side<00:06:10.909> goes<00:06:12.289> face<00:06:13.289> back<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.740> same<00:06:13.949> way

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
draw side goes face back the same way

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.670 
draw side goes face back the same way
again<00:06:14.840> goes<00:06:15.840> on<00:06:16.080> there<00:06:16.789> what's<00:06:17.789> in<00:06:17.969> there<00:06:18.680> and

again goes on there what's in there and

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.540 
again goes on there what's in there and
it<00:06:20.009> can<00:06:20.129> have<00:06:20.279> a<00:06:20.310> little<00:06:20.460> tap<00:06:20.819> and<00:06:25.370> she's<00:06:26.370> off

it can have a little tap and she's off

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:37.600 
it can have a little tap and she's off
it<00:06:26.789> cuts<00:06:28.520> everywhere

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.820
