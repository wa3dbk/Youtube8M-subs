hearing<00:00:51.270> from<00:00:51.390> them<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.500> really<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> us<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.190> is

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
hearing from them so really to us it is

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.920

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
a key part of the application process

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.500 
a key part of the application process
great<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.649> you're<00:00:55.769> setting<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.340> puts<00:00:56.609> a<00:00:56.820> face

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
great so you're setting it puts a face

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
great so you're setting it puts a face
it<00:00:57.809> away<00:00:58.050> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> application<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> makes<00:00:59.460> them

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
it away on the application it makes them

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.869 
it away on the application it makes them
a<00:00:59.670> person<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.440> then<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.739> that<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
a person and then also that it is

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.189 
a person and then also that it is
important<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.510> take<00:01:03.690> care<00:01:03.929> with<00:01:04.080> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
important that they take care with it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.990 
important that they take care with it
because<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.620> is<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.040> last<00:01:05.309> piece<00:01:05.700> that's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
because it is the last piece that's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.609 
because it is the last piece that's
under<00:01:06.240> their<00:01:06.420> control<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.050> you<00:01:07.140> don't<00:01:07.320> want<00:01:07.530> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
under their control so you don't want to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.020 
under their control so you don't want to
see<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.009> grammar<00:01:08.340> mistakes<00:01:08.790> so<00:01:08.970> I'm

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
see a lot of grammar mistakes so I'm

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.789
