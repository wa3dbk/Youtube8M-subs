a common use for the flange effect with

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
a common use for the flange effect with
clean<00:02:44.430> guitar<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.239> use<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.690> pom<00:02:46.170> muted<00:02:46.560> sort

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
clean guitar is to use a pom muted sort

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.800 
clean guitar is to use a pom muted sort
of<00:02:46.980> galloping<00:02:47.489> picking<00:02:47.910> technique<00:02:48.330> which

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
of galloping picking technique which

00:02:48.810 --> 00:03:27.330 
of galloping picking technique which
I'll<00:02:48.989> demonstrate<00:02:49.230> for<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.770> now

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.040 

lunging<00:03:28.340> is<00:03:28.460> often<00:03:28.790> used<00:03:28.940> with<00:03:29.210> distortion

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
lunging is often used with distortion

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.020 
lunging is often used with distortion
and<00:03:30.200> so<00:03:30.380> what<00:03:30.650> we'll<00:03:30.770> do<00:03:30.890> next<00:03:31.070> is<00:03:31.370> demonstrate

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and so what we'll do next is demonstrate

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.670
