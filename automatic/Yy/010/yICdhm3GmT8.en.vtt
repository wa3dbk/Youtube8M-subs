first<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.439> quick<00:00:26.310> review<00:00:26.609> why<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.660> there

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
first a quick review why are there

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
first a quick review why are there
sounds<00:00:28.410> what<00:00:29.220> are<00:00:29.310> these<00:00:29.400> things<00:00:29.820> we<00:00:30.060> detect

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
sounds what are these things we detect

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
sounds what are these things we detect
with<00:00:30.689> our<00:00:30.720> ears<00:00:31.109> shell<00:00:31.439> flaps<00:00:31.769> which<00:00:32.430> adorn

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
with our ears shell flaps which adorn

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.660 
with our ears shell flaps which adorn
the<00:00:32.940> sides<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:33.480> hat<00:00:33.690> rustling<00:00:34.020> orb<00:00:34.670> sounds

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the sides of our hat rustling orb sounds

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.910 
the sides of our hat rustling orb sounds
are<00:00:35.820> pressure<00:00:36.570> waves<00:00:36.899> moving<00:00:37.530> through<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
are pressure waves moving through a

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.580 
are pressure waves moving through a
medium<00:00:38.309> like<00:00:38.760> air<00:00:39.059> water<00:00:39.960> or<00:00:40.379> beer<00:00:41.219> talking

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
medium like air water or beer talking

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.490 
medium like air water or beer talking
explosions<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.829> music<00:00:44.820> push<00:00:45.510> air<00:00:45.809> molecules

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
explosions and music push air molecules

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.459 
explosions and music push air molecules
into<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.460> air<00:00:47.730> molecules<00:00:48.379> through<00:00:49.379> all

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
into other air molecules through all

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.979 
into other air molecules through all
that<00:00:49.649> stuff<00:00:50.129> pushing<00:00:50.670> other<00:00:50.879> stuff<00:00:51.390> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
that stuff pushing other stuff it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.139 
that stuff pushing other stuff it
eventually<00:00:52.530> pushes<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.160> stuff<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:53.940> call

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
eventually pushes the stuff that we call

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.479 
eventually pushes the stuff that we call
our<00:00:54.300> eardrum<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.770> lets<00:00:56.039> us<00:00:56.190> hear<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
our eardrum and that lets us hear a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.689 
our eardrum and that lets us hear a
thing<00:00:57.230> so<00:00:58.230> much<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.070> how<00:00:59.190> there's<00:00:59.430> not

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
thing so much like how there's not

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.520 
thing so much like how there's not
enough<00:01:00.120> stuff<00:01:00.539> in<00:01:00.750> space<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
enough stuff in space to take a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
enough stuff in space to take a
temperature<00:01:01.949> reading<00:01:02.250> there's<00:01:03.180> not<00:01:03.539> enough

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
temperature reading there's not enough

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.590 
temperature reading there's not enough
stuff<00:01:04.199> in<00:01:04.409> space<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.430> considered<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.970> medium

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
stuff in space to be considered a medium

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.609 
stuff in space to be considered a medium
for<00:01:07.320> sound<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:08.159> move<00:01:09.000> through<00:01:12.439> don't<00:01:13.439> get<00:01:13.530> me

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
for sound to move through don't get me

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
for sound to move through don't get me
wrong<00:01:13.650> there's<00:01:14.490> stuff<00:01:14.939> there

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
wrong there's stuff there

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.570 
wrong there's stuff there
there's<00:01:15.869> particles<00:01:16.439> even<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.310> intergalactic

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
there's particles even in intergalactic

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.990 
there's particles even in intergalactic
depths<00:01:18.299> there<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> few<00:01:19.049> hundred<00:01:19.380> particles

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
depths there are a few hundred particles

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.730 
depths there are a few hundred particles
every<00:01:21.000> cubic<00:01:21.330> metre<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> there's<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.710> more

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
every cubic metre and there's much more

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.850 
every cubic metre and there's much more
in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.280> galaxy<00:01:23.759> they're<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.020> far<00:01:25.290> apart<00:01:25.590> though

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
in a galaxy they're so far apart though

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.130 
in a galaxy they're so far apart though
the<00:01:26.430> particles<00:01:27.060> don't<00:01:27.240> immediately<00:01:27.600> collide

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
the particles don't immediately collide

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.319 
the particles don't immediately collide
with<00:01:28.320> each<00:01:28.380> other<00:01:28.619> allowing<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.460> sound<00:01:29.790> wave<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
with each other allowing a sound wave to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.230 
with each other allowing a sound wave to
pass<00:01:30.479> through<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.020> grouping<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.530> them<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:32.490> even

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
pass through a grouping of them so even

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.880 
pass through a grouping of them so even
if<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.420> did<00:01:33.630> watch<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> Death<00:01:34.229> Star<00:01:34.470> explode
