00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hey people and welcome back 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.580
 the topic is delegation skype today 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 it's about more 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.150
 and I'll show you how awesome 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.219
 If you actually already play the game 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.469
 played his champion the one played through 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.910
 I can actually bolt upwards 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.210
 Today I will show you how to meet a man 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.090
 gets attacked with 900 mhz or fucking 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.670
 Actually, those 900 attacks are real 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.279
 on the first day of his champion 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.140
 digimon be there 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.189
 Of course, it is extremely much and am 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.760
 This is complete at the beginning of the game 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.929
 unthinkable 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 but in the end it actually works 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.710
 used great carrots you need the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.510
 training places pixie lott and man 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.460
 needed improved green training camp 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.829
 then comes the 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.719
 our argument is here now four days 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.750
 old and already has an attack of 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.460
 650 and also a very high one 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.370
 Of course you have to drive speed 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.960
 be careful that the care mistakes 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.600
 it really fits for he needs for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.180
 more ramon five care mistakes at least 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.840
 five care mistakes during your ban 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.489
 ramon 3 needs if you then at 4 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
 stands still because he is too 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.369
 think late, then it can be 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.780
 that I get ramon on the board here 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.240
 but then would have attacked 900 that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.409
 So we are not that bad 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.040
 So I see this episode now for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.020
 both of them so I explain it to us 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.240
 both get the rules are namely 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.159
 actually very simple for several people 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 you need an attack of over 100 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.350
 a weight of 20 and at least five 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.060
 Care mistakes I remember are errors 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.170
 when you do it on the floor when you do it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.119
 do not feed if you can 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 Do not let exhaustion rest and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.720
 Not only half of them are not 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.070
 only the heaps on the floor but also 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.960
 at burger moon it is exactly 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 the same only that just not five 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.229
 Care error then only needs three and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.720
 you need a speed of 100 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.920
 with us are the speed and the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.450
 given each attack 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.100
 so it could be both 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.360
 theoretically we have to so I want to go with it 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.310
 find the care and the weight 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.469
 watch out there but both a weight of 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.180
 20, it really depends on now 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.500
 the care is missing I have mine 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.969
 argument 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.850
 as far as I know yet no care 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.740
 mistake committed 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.360
 but that's where we start right away 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.459
 increase the speed here because 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 it does not really take a bit of a while and me 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.319
 maybe again my cds 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.220
 pick up exactly in the original plays could 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.780
 of course not do that 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.360
 record this just above the monitor 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.209
 because I have the better options 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.110
 so we will argue that now 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.310
 complete action 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.050
 we will only open it all the time 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.920
 train and attack his 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.739
 Completely ignore needs and it 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.280
 only then with a failed when it 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.959
 really tired or that they are more then 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.150
 would have to come there even relatively soon 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:45.519
 it was straight but we give you a short 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.530
 a movie not yet no I wanted 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.880
 me on long distance foreign immediately 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.709
 connection a great carrot 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.080
 so the attack a bit 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.730
 is increased during training so 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.549
 drunk soil should not make us 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.769
 further disturb that is the goal and 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.180
 But anyway, I do not care 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.410
 want to sleep it and if you are hungry 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.230
 to send to bed then it is natural 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.880
 the better as you said you can 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.440
 this method bertram and or more 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.700
 man get both is possible if 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.299
 you really want to be sure 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.000
 which she wants to get then no 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.260
 you want to be sure that you do that 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.810
 right one gets the right one for you 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.790
 so to speak then just brings one 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.540
 worth over 100 do that now 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:28.540
 criminal champion fighting machine though 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.100
 well the only option is well 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.250
 still much stronger 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.079
 with chips or by extra attempts 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.920
 where it would really be damned 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.690
 be good 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.060
 When I try extra, I usually get 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.829
 get the wrong one out and you should too 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.480
 Look that you do not like that 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.010
 I feed early, I'm not sure 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.780
 So I think we have the 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.829
 five care mistakes already together but 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.769
 it does not necessarily have to be that way 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.120
 quite possible that we are right now 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.400
 I have only four and I have not 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.799
 That's why we've counted correctly 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.410
 that should get involved a bit more 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.450
 as almost 900 or fall over it 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.250
 exactly at 900 according to which we see 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.579
 equal exactly to 100 that's nice 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.959
 that yet because we have weight 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.720
 but first we leave it on the 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.990
 soil 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.820
 it is quicker when doing workout 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.260
 then I do very well on the ground 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.769
 to actually look superman 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.040
 that will often need exactly five then 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.300
 we have some filets or apa red me 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.740
 personally, he would save eagle by 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.000
 we can also buy and much 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.920
 but gets only a limited number 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.470
 a day when we now unknown 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.260
 that you could never buy 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.730
 once we get into the near 20 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.360
 the weight is likely 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.970
 dictate 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.830
 So yes, I would already have 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.540
 can think right now it is 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.190
 You should either go to several months 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.960
 according to my logic, it would have to several 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.460
 be very good that i wanted like 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.720
 said in exactly the same way and 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.710
 wise you can bertram and 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.560
 get here already 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.480
 the champion who attacked someone with 926 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.950
 that's something or 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.150
 now it has to stop a bit 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.090
 train the other values ​​and then 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.380
 can you clear it off properly so 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.050
 beautiful man as I said it can 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.990
 Spellbane and Maximilian Bertram and 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.930
 By the way, that is absolutely not 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.760
 problem so if you börgermann 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.840
 then you want to get as well as with 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.480
 several you just do less 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.860
 care mistake so if you like that 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.419
 strong pendant one would like to have 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.100
 if that makes sense or not 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.050
 put there several you can namely 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.850
 actually just mount to others 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.220
 And for that it does not need any attack 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:34.070
 of 900 instead defended the word 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.200
 Initiatives Defense Intelligence and MP 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.030
 very high and the other three he values 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.290
 not so 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.690
 so I would say so many times 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.040
 an apathetic attack pays off 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.600
 I can not really do that either 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:46.490
 Let's see the digita zions table 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:51.110
 but not really 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:52.520
 great evolved okay I was 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.900
 sure this could only be 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.910
 others will gram with and hall 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.580
 goes already then is the guide 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.260
 I just looked at me wrong 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.419
 maybe i should say somebody 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.919
 that's not good so in that 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.400
 I would say it's worth it 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.669
 well 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.810
 So you can count on metal 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.310
 gram and passed over 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:13.880
 but he does not need attack value 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.510
 from 900 reached 800 should also loose 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.470
 Look at each other a bit 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.160
 values ​​maybe focus 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:21.580
 maybe a little bit yes 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:26.349
 but off during speed he too 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:29.590
 at all because the intelligence is not 

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:31.900
 so important and in life and magic 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.840
 Points reach you easily because 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.250
 that you always heal with your items 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.340
 that's the nice thing about that 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.289
 my thomas j that was it with mira 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.180
 At bonn it really is like that 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.560
 only phoenix one can become 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.240
 phoenix I have shown before 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.009
 I'll give you one like that 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.069
 small part of my let's play 

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:54.129
 Show because that is in my opinion 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:56.800
 definitely easier to understand 

00:06:54.129 --> 00:06:59.219
 So thank you for people to see so and up 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.219
 next time
