00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
if this is backwards I'm gonna try and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.189 
if this is backwards I'm gonna try and
draw<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:28.920> upside<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> might<00:00:30.689> not<00:00:30.720> come

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
draw it upside down so it might not come

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
draw it upside down so it might not come
out<00:00:31.289> as<00:00:31.500> good<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.009> I'm<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
out as good because I'm not really that

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.110 
out as good because I'm not really that
used<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.840> drawing<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.170> Sam<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.809> here<00:00:36.809> is

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
used to drawing up Sam right so here is

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.569 
used to drawing up Sam right so here is
that's<00:00:39.120> if<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.390> can<00:00:39.450> see<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> right

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
that's if you can see this right

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:48.030 
that's if you can see this right
computer

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:01:11.620 

just<00:00:48.670> a<00:00:48.940> circle<00:00:49.600> a<00:00:49.810> couple<00:00:50.230> times

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.580 

well<00:01:12.380> multiple<00:01:12.979> circles<00:01:13.369> are<00:01:13.520> usually<00:01:13.969> for

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
well multiple circles are usually for

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.130 
well multiple circles are usually for
basis<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:15.950> can<00:01:16.180> connect<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:17.329> lines<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.990> know

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
basis you can connect the lines you know

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.029 
basis you can connect the lines you know
like<00:01:18.320> any<00:01:18.560> circle<00:01:19.009> or<00:01:19.159> anything<00:01:19.549> like<00:01:19.610> that<00:01:19.759> so

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
like any circle or anything like that so

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.240 
like any circle or anything like that so
here's<00:01:22.039> a<00:01:22.130> hey<00:01:23.439> don't<00:01:24.439> know<00:01:24.560> if<00:01:24.649> you<00:01:24.710> can<00:01:24.890> see

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
here's a hey don't know if you can see

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.399 
here's a hey don't know if you can see
it<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.810> think<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:26.929> can<00:01:27.429> um<00:01:28.960> ok<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:29.990> then<00:01:30.320> you

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
it I think you can um ok so then you

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.809 
it I think you can um ok so then you
draw<00:01:30.649> a<00:01:30.679> line<00:01:32.149> from<00:01:32.569> line<00:01:33.079> from<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.819> chin

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
draw a line from line from the chin

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.179 
draw a line from line from the chin
to<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:35.750> top<00:01:36.079> of<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.319> head<00:01:36.530> try<00:01:36.950> and<00:01:37.069> make<00:01:37.159> it

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
to the top of the head try and make it

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.569 
to the top of the head try and make it
as<00:01:37.310> straight<00:01:37.579> as<00:01:37.700> possible<00:01:38.950> this<00:01:39.950> is<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.369> dead

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
as straight as possible this is the dead

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.190 
as straight as possible this is the dead
setting<00:01:41.000> line<00:01:41.210> and<00:01:41.479> this<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.720> how<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.899> will

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
setting line and this is how you will

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.919 
setting line and this is how you will
distribute<00:01:43.100> evenly<00:01:43.509> certain<00:01:44.509> parts<00:01:44.810> of<00:01:44.869> the

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
distribute evenly certain parts of the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.020 
distribute evenly certain parts of the
head<00:01:45.200> now<00:01:46.189> if<00:01:46.459> you're<00:01:46.580> going<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.819> draw<00:01:46.970> the

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
head now if you're going to draw the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.789 
head now if you're going to draw the
eyes<00:01:47.270> I'm<00:01:47.899> not<00:01:48.080> going<00:01:48.259> to<00:01:48.319> actually<00:01:48.500> draw<00:01:48.740> the

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
eyes I'm not going to actually draw the

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.449 
eyes I'm not going to actually draw the
eyes<00:01:49.009> or<00:01:49.039> just<00:01:49.549> the<00:01:49.640> guidelines<00:01:50.709> start<00:01:51.709> here

00:01:52.449 --> 00:01:52.459 
eyes or just the guidelines start here

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:53.949 
eyes or just the guidelines start here
in<00:01:52.640> the<00:01:52.880> middle<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.360> intersection<00:01:53.929> between

00:01:53.949 --> 00:01:53.959 
in the middle the intersection between

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:56.949 
in the middle the intersection between
the<00:01:54.649> center<00:01:54.979> line<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.640> bottom<00:01:56.030> where<00:01:56.899> it

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:56.959 
the center line and the bottom where it

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:59.320 
the center line and the bottom where it
intersects<00:01:57.289> with<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.740> circle<00:01:58.189> just<00:01:58.729> kind<00:01:59.270> of

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
intersects with the circle just kind of

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.320 
intersects with the circle just kind of
go<00:01:59.479> across<00:01:59.780> on<00:02:00.170> both<00:02:00.319> sides<00:02:00.909> then<00:02:01.909> just<00:02:02.179> kind

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
go across on both sides then just kind

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.010 
go across on both sides then just kind
of<00:02:02.450> go<00:02:02.599> up<00:02:02.770> probably<00:02:03.770> where<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.250> circle<00:02:05.020> melts

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
of go up probably where the circle melts

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.940 
of go up probably where the circle melts
into<00:02:06.289> like<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.950> head<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.880> just<00:02:08.679> go<00:02:09.679> across

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
into like the head and just go across

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.830 
into like the head and just go across
there<00:02:10.340> to<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.759> other<00:02:10.910> side<00:02:11.180> where<00:02:11.450> it<00:02:11.569> melts

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
there to the other side where it melts

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.890 
there to the other side where it melts
into<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.019> head<00:02:12.670> that's<00:02:13.670> not<00:02:14.030> very<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:14.599> but

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
into the head that's not very right but

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780 
into the head that's not very right but
you<00:02:15.170> know<00:02:15.319> I'm<00:02:15.799> doing<00:02:15.950> this<00:02:16.160> upside<00:02:16.459> down<00:02:16.640> I'm

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
